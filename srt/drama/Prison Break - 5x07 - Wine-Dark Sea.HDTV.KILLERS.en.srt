1
00:00:01,405 --> 00:00:03,538
Don't you have a job or something?

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:05,136
Yeah, on a freelance cargo ship.

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,574
We go to Hong Kong, Spain,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,972
Buenos Aires, basically
wherever the boss tells us.

5
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,244
Corrupt son of a bitch.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,184
We've awoken something,
something people are trying to

7
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,214
hide about Michael.

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,749
Who the hell is this Poseidon guy?

9
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,117
A psychopath.

10
00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:18,212
A frustrated policy wonk

11
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,281
in the CIA who created a cell

12
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:23,090
within the CIA called 21-Void.

13
00:00:23,126 --> 00:00:24,625
And they needed my help

14
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:25,860
breaking out people in prison

15
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:27,629
all over the world.

16
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:28,518
Before he was killed,

17
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,665
Kellerman had been looking into 21-Void.

18
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,513
I need you to look into the possibility

19
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,336
that there was an insider involved.

20
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:36,071
I wasn't expecting a call at this hour.

21
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,372
I think we need to meet soon.

22
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:39,174
I was looking for where the man went.

23
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:40,242
What man, baby?

24
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:41,509
The man that gave me this.

25
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:42,677
Michael.

26
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,946
What are you into?

27
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:46,514
Just tell us where you're headed.

28
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,984
300 miles across the desert, Phaeacia.

29
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,952
Autonomous zone. No ISIL.

30
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:52,153
I can lead you there.

31
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:54,169
Phaeacia, we found it!

32
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,772
Back in the city, I
told you you would die.

33
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:11,840
Michael.

34
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,675
He poisoned me.

35
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:41,036
It's incredible how good
you've gotten at drawing, Mike.

36
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:43,705
Really, that's...

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,640
that's so good.

38
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:48,043
It's a Greek hero.

39
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,678
He looks hurt.

40
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,113
They all get hurt sooner or later.

41
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,803
That's what's great about Greek heroes,

42
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:58,086
they're real, not supermen.

43
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,021
They get hurt.

44
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,423
They can die.

45
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:12,834
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy, last little bit.

46
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,869
I got to keep it clean, you know?

47
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,538
It's looking much better though, okay?

48
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:18,934
You're doing good. You
just hang in there, buddy.

49
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:20,608
How we doing?

50
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,277
Got something.

51
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,296
Our friend over there has a boat.

52
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,214
He's making a smuggling run to Greece.

53
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:29,184
He says he can take your
brother to a first world doctor.

54
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,386
First world thinks he's Kaniel Outis.

55
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:32,926
They'll arrest him on sight.

56
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:34,150
So?

57
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,908
What's the alternative, let him die?

58
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,256
What kind of a brother are you?

59
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:40,995
You say something like that again,

60
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,764
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

61
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:51,473
There might be a third option.

62
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,674
So how was your first day back?

63
00:03:03,987 --> 00:03:06,421
I have to say, it's
never been so rewarding

64
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:07,689
to teach game theory to the tops

65
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,090
of a bunch of 18-year-olds' heads

66
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,725
while they're busy sexting each other.

67
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:11,926
Ew.

68
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:13,261
Ew.

69
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,696
But...

70
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:17,298
normalcy's threatening to come back,

71
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,534
and I say cheers to that.

72
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,869
Cheers to that.

73
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:24,205
Come on, let's sit outside.

74
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,609
I'll be right there.

75
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,249
Hello?

76
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:36,451
We found Michael.

77
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:38,920
Is he our Michael?

78
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:40,655
Yes, Sara.

79
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:45,627
Sara, listen, he's been poisoned.

80
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:46,861
We think it's antifreeze.

81
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:48,129
He's lost a lot of blood.

82
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:50,465
He needs a lot of blood.

83
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,747
Okay.

84
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,535
He needs a lot of things
if it's antifreeze.

85
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,769
Listen, uh,

86
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:56,143
we're heading to Greece.

87
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,740
Is there any way we can get
some medical help off the books?

88
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:00,682
No, no, no, no, no, this
isn't the kind of thing

89
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:02,218
that you want to do off the books.

90
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,113
Listen, Lincoln, he's
gonna need a transfusion.

91
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,848
Michael's B negative, okay?

92
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:09,884
It's maybe one percent of the
population with that blood type.

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,653
You won't find it where you're going,

94
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,688
and he won't make it while you look.

95
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:19,060
Unless it comes to you.

96
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,462
I'll call you back.

97
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,365
Hey, what's going on?

98
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,967
I, uh...

99
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,869
I got to go.

100
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:29,804
You got to go?

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,239
Go where?

102
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:32,674
To Crete.

103
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,210
Michael, um,

104
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,845
they found him.

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,279
He's alive.

106
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,514
He's poisoned.

107
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,916
Michael? Your ex, Michael?

108
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:42,962
Yeah.

109
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,419
Wait, hold on a second,

110
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:46,821
he really is alive?

111
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:48,356
He contacted you just now?

112
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:51,826
Yeah, and, uh, and he needs help,

113
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:55,930
and I think I'm the only
one that can help him.

114
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,999
Um...

115
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:00,731
yeah, I can get there faster on
a plane than they can on a boat.

116
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,368
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sara?

117
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,873
Y-You don't owe him that.

118
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,225
Y-You don't know what you'd
be walking into, it's not safe.

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
I'll be fine. I don't have a choice.

120
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,941
I...

121
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,676
This has been a hell of a week.

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
Okay, look, I know you've
got a million questions,

123
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,949
just like I do, okay?

124
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,485
I can't look my son in the eye

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,587
and tell him that I let his father die

126
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,922
when I could've tried to save him,

127
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,291
A father he's never met.

128
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,893
I can't do that.

129
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,828
And if I told you not to go?

130
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,100
"If's" a big word in that sentence.

131
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,202
Jacob, are you telling me not to go?

132
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,107
No.

133
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,076
No, of course not.

134
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,078
Okay.

135
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,758
Should've left her out of this, Linc.

136
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,328
Shut up. You're about to
see the wife you haven't seen

137
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,996
in seven years.

138
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:08,833
- I got you, I got you.
- Cast off.

139
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,668
You're ready.

140
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,637
What do you mean?

141
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,376
Been locked up for longer
than I can remember.

142
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,311
Before Ogygia, it was
my apartment, my head

143
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,413
and my phone.

144
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,948
Walls all around me.

145
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:27,118
Couldn't see the world.

146
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,322
I like it here.

147
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,757
No walls.

148
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,327
Freedom, like I haven't
had in a long time.

149
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,030
I can start over.

150
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,999
And unless you say you need me,

151
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,001
I'd like to stay.

152
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,537
You're a free man, Ja.

153
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,506
The choice is yours.

154
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,577
I owe you my life.

155
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,846
You gave me back the world.

156
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,884
Get him healthy. Get safe.

157
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,953
Yeah, I will.

158
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,755
See you.

159
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,559
Hey, hey, hey.

160
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,061
I got to know,

161
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,464
you really got Freddie Mercury's ashes?

162
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,235
Is it true Keith Richard
snorted his dead father's ashes?

163
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,703
I don't know.

164
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,039
Exactly.

165
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,875
Keep alive.

166
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,043
You too, man.

167
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,687
Linc,

168
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,523
how far is it to Greece?

169
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,591
12 hours.

170
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,226
Sara's gonna be there in 12.

171
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,897
I don't think I have 12 hours in me.

172
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,872

173
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:06,887
I was right, we got problems.

174
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:11,374
Apparently, State Department is
asking questions about 21-Void

175
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,726
after our visit to NSA yesterday.

176
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,596
They have no viable information.

177
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:18,432
21-Void doesn't exist.

178
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:19,866
Poseidon will clean house.

179
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:21,655
The problem's not going away.

180
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:23,270
That State Department
agent wants to meet

181
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,738
as soon as we land.

182
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,718
Chania, please?

183
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:39,019
Thank you.

184
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,236
It is safe here.

185
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:57,804
I use when I come.

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,018
You got any food for him?

187
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:02,643
Come, it's in the boat.

188
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:05,245
Great, thank you.

189
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,980
Keep his spirits up.

190
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:08,570
All right, man.

191
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:16,290
Oh, man.

192
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,847
Got to hang in there, buddy, huh?

193
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:28,435
Still got a lot of things
to tell me, you know?

194
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:33,340
You gonna tell me why
I'm your whip hand.

195
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,833
Remember?

196
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,484
I got a lot invested in you.

197
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:50,090
You can't die on me
now, Michael, you know?

198
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,261
Called you Michael.

199
00:10:54,296 --> 00:10:58,932
The first... first time I
ever really known your name,

200
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,468
even though I feel like...

201
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,139
I feel like we've been
brothers since we met, you know?

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,181
You know, with... With Linc here...

203
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,887
it was the first time I ever
felt like an outsider with you.

204
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:23,090
You know, like...

205
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,926
Like I lost...

206
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,794
part of my family or something.

207
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,932
So, you see, Michael, you can't die.

208
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,372
Please?

209
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:30,798
Linc.

210
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,285
Hi.

211
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,520
I missed you.

212
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:12,599
I'm gonna fix you up.

213
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:14,734
And then we'll talk, okay?

214
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,439
I'm gonna make you okay.

215
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,477
No.

216
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,511
Shh, shh, shh,

217
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:26,780
shh, shh, shh, it's okay.

218
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,016
Hey, Lincoln, uh,

219
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,985
would you pass me that coatrack?

220
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,054
- Could I grab the chair, please?
- Yeah.

221
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:37,324
Thanks.

222
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,180
We'll do a transfusion.

223
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:05,886
I'm O negative.

224
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:08,488
It's the universal donor.

225
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:11,391
Turns out it's the only other
blood type I could've given him.

226
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:16,029
Maybe there's something to destiny, huh?

227
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,202
Is he gonna live?

228
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,872
Yeah.

229
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,174
Yeah, he'll live.

230
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,810
Give him a couple hours.

231
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,246
He's strong.

232
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,786
We'll, uh... we'll give you a minute.

233
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,721
Yeah.

234
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,925
I'm right here.

235
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,660
I'm right here.

236
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,234
We need to work out a way
to get off this island.

237
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:03,577
What I said...

238
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,252
um, about you...

239
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:09,555
I was wrong.

240
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,821
A man would be lucky to have a brother

241
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:16,890
cares as much as you, you know?

242
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,727
Wife like that...

243
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,564
family.

244
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,703
I wouldn't call it luck.

245
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:32,439
You've been through
what we've been through.

246
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,274
You're family now.

247
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,179
I'll drink to that.

248
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:41,648
Yeah.

249
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,618
Flying's really out of the question?

250
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,819
Yeah.

251
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:49,756
Airports are worse than hospitals.

252
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,792
And once the name Kaniel
Outis is radioactive,

253
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,861
they'll shoot him on sight.

254
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,498
So another boat?

255
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,533
Across the Atlantic?

256
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:05,772
Mm, I'm no sailor, but I know
that no boat in that harbor

257
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:08,274
is gonna get us that far.

258
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,776
We need a big boat.

259
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,273
One that doesn't mind a
radioactive cargo, you know?

260
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:34,000
Hey there, I wanted to
follow up on our conversation.

261
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,735
Obviously, the CIA and State,

262
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,771
we've been sharing
information on Kaniel Outis,

263
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,006
but my question for you is:

264
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,708
Outis killed Abu Ramal,

265
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:44,110
did the country a service.

266
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,746
So why were you still at NSA yesterday,

267
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:48,782
trying to kill him?

268
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,817
Why don't we get off the tarmac?

269
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:53,119
We'll share what we can
about our investigation.

270
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,871
This is all just
bureaucratic miscommunication.

271
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,459
We can iron it out.

272
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:02,387
So you know, we checked with CIA.

273
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:05,131
The CIA didn't sanction
your visit to NSA yesterday.

274
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,933
No one even knew you were there.

275
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:09,469
Who are you working for, really?

276
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:12,005
And why were you trying
to take out Kaniel Outis?

277
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:23,083
Never thought I'd see this face again.

278
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,552
You weren't supposed to.

279
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,022
Why?

280
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:34,327
I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

281
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:36,863
But first, I need something from you.

282
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:38,698
Anything.

283
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,236
A picture of my son.

284
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,117
We weren't at NSA yesterday.

285
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,716
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

286
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:52,034
And it's a mistake to lie to me.

287
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:53,701
I can have you prosecuted.

288
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:57,851
I have a contact at the
NSA and she gave me proof.

289
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,653
You're not calling him Junior, are you?

290
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:03,757
I promised you I would never do that.

291
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,707
He's an amazing kid.

292
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,330
He's just like you.

293
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,907
What's wrong?

294
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,587
It's him.

295
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,495
Your husband.

296
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:44,737
Jacob?

297
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:45,940
Jacob.

298
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,442
Jacob is Poseidon.

299
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:06,574
I knew it. I wasn't crazy.

300
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:10,429
I caught him lying, but he-he...

301
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,064
Oh, God, he covered it so well.

302
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,766
He was... honest and hurt,

303
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,736
and I bought it.

304
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,170
Who is he?

305
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:19,939
Really?

306
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:23,409
He's a CIA operative, deep cover.

307
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,678
He runs a splinter cell called 21-Void.

308
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:28,080
What does this have to do with you?

309
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,816
He targeted me for my skills,

310
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:32,351
blackmailed me.

311
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,520
He told me if I didn't
agree to come work for him,

312
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,289
he'd go after you and Linc,

313
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,848
put you both in jail.

314
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,884
And then he proved it to me.

315
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:45,522
He said I could never see
either one of you again.

316
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:48,224
Or Mike.

317
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
Made me fake my death.

318
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,896
And then he just used me.

319
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:54,431
He married me.

320
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,266
If I'd known he was
your husband, I swear...

321
00:19:56,302 --> 00:19:57,367
No, no, no, no, no,

322
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,402
this is not on you.

323
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:01,472
I...

324
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:05,608
Why now? Why did you come back now?

325
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:07,744
The origami...

326
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:12,282
Four years ago, he betrayed me

327
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:14,884
and now I know why.

328
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,421
He wanted me out of the way...

329
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:20,157
so he could have you.

330
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,526
How did he betray you?

331
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,762
He set a meeting.

332
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,665
We were supposed to
discuss my next assignment.

333
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:30,770
What he didn't tell me was that

334
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:32,803
we were meeting a man
named Harlan Gaines,

335
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:35,672
a deputy director of the CIA.

336
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,907
Gaines was investigating 21-Void.

337
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:40,176
Looking for the traitor behind it.

338
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:44,314
That's when I knew my work
wasn't sanctioned by the CIA.

339
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,584
Poseidon shot and
killed Gaines that night,

340
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,653
to stop the investigation.

341
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:54,591
He told me to move the body,

342
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,993
make it look like it never happened.

343
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,262
I've seen the photos of
that part, they're damning.

344
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,473
He chose images that showed
me moving Gaines' body,

345
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,411
eliminated the ones that
incriminated himself.

346
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,514
I knew I was being set up.

347
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,416
He was tightening his control over me,

348
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:13,786
but there was nothing I could do.

349
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:16,756
At least, that's what he thought.

350
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,558
When I knew Poseidon had gone rogue

351
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:22,027
and was operating outside the CIA,

352
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,630
that's when I started my
plan to get back to you.

353
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,958
You're not.

354
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,513
Some other man has your...

355
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,536
Your face, your past, your whole life.

356
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,506
Sara, there is a plan
to make this right,

357
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,458
to protect our family.

358
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,147
Michael, he's with our son right now.

359
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,409
He's with Mike.

360
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,320
I, uh, look, I have to go.

361
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:50,827
Ah.

362
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,925
Hey, Noah, you gonna build us a boat?

363
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,662
Nope. I'm gonna do one better.

364
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:58,264
Who you calling?

365
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,602
A friend who actually has a boat.

366
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,545
Hello?

367
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,746
Sucre, it's me.

368
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,781
Linc? I thought the Middle East

369
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,049
was gonna swallow you up, man.

370
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,685
Where's Michael? Did you find him?

371
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:21,778
Listen, that's why I'm calling.

372
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:23,372
We're on the island of Crete.

373
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,381
We need a low profile
ride back to the States.

374
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,880
I would love to help,

375
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:28,885
but we're on the other
side of the world, brother.

376
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,520
We just dropped a load in Morocco.

377
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:33,022
What are you talking
about? Morocco's near Crete.

378
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:35,925
Yeah, I know, of course it is,

379
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,127
but what I mean is it's not my ship.

380
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:40,964
Yeah, but what would
it cost to hitch a ride?

381
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,665
You can't hitch a ride.

382
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:44,400
You have to rent the whole ship.

383
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:46,869
The boss charges 50K a leg, Linc.

384
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:49,072
You want to get back
to the States, it's 50K.

385
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:50,306
50K?

386
00:22:50,342 --> 00:22:52,609
We're just trying to get home.

387
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,645
You know we don't
have that kind of cash.

388
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,648
You do now.

389
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:00,483
Here, this was my grandmother's.

390
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,999
It's an heirloom worth at least that.

391
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,425
I can't think of a better use for it.

392
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,094
Thank you.

393
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,371
We got it, Sucre. Get to Crete.

394
00:23:17,202 --> 00:23:19,035
He's not gonna hurt Mike,

395
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:22,138
not unless he suspects
you know who he really is.

396
00:23:22,174 --> 00:23:23,606
If you remove his mask,

397
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:25,274
he'll lash out.

398
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,043
You know him better than I do.

399
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,845
That's the point, no one knows him.

400
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,647
So, what do I do?

401
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:33,249
You play his game.
You wear your own mask.

402
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:36,285
As soon as you get a chance
to get away with Mike,

403
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:39,922
you take it, disappear.

404
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,125
I'll get to the States as soon as I can.

405
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,861
I'll find you.

406
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,596
You're looking better.

407
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:48,431
A little grayer, but better.

408
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,535
I have an amazing doctor on call.

409
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,244
I will wear the mask.

410
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,780
I will play his game...

411
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:07,484
and if he hurts our son I'll kill him.

412
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:11,888
I can't...

413
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:30,915
Please come back to us.

414
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:51,294
She's leaving Crete alone,

415
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,530
which means she left Outis
behind, and he'll try to follow,

416
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:56,245
return to the U.S. in
the next day or two.

417
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:57,152
Who called?

418
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,362
Only be by ship or
plane, so plaster his face

419
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,230
on all maritime and air channels,

420
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,273
focusing on all vessels
departing from Crete

421
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,307
in the next 48 hours.

422
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:06,075
He's got to be on one.

423
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:08,445
- He can't make it back inside the country.
- Jacob?

424
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:11,414
Was that Mommy?

425
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,029
Yes. Mommy's on her way home.

426
00:25:29,264 --> 00:25:31,264
Michael Scofield.

427
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:35,267
My man, you got more lives than anyone.

428
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,137
Think I might've used them all up.

429
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:40,606
A damn phoenix.

430
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:42,241
I can't believe it.

431
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:43,809
I want to hear every damn thing

432
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:45,545
that's happened to you since you died.

433
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,246
Papi, you're alive?

434
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:52,081
The skipper is a corrupt bastard.

435
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,129
Don't mess with him.
He's got guns in the hold,

436
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,914
all kinds of contraband. Captain.

437
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,973
Here's the cargo I
was telling you about.

438
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,428
Pay up.

439
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:04,947
Where's the 50K?

440
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:06,707
Here.

441
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:09,610
I said cash.

442
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:11,945
It's a sapphire, six carats,

443
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:15,582
flawless, surrounded by 2.5
carats of bezeled diamonds.

444
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:17,518
Street value is 125K.

445
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:20,491
You can pawn it for half
that and still make a profit.

446
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:31,398
If it's fake,

447
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,387
you go under the sea.

448
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:39,373
A boat is the last place I
expected to find you, buddy.

449
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:40,974
I thought you hated the water.

450
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,244
Yeah, you remember, but I got a record.

451
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,914
Not a lot of employers lined
up to take a chance on me.

452
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:49,349
Besides, this ship
provides opportunities

453
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:50,830
for my side business...

454
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,086
which is the real
reason I'm on this boat.

455
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:55,022
This baby...

456
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:57,190
houses my entire life savings.

457
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:59,560
I'm telling you, it's gonna be huge.

458
00:26:59,595 --> 00:27:02,262
I'm a few months away from
putting all this behind me.

459
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:04,531
If you guys are lucky, I'll let you guys

460
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,647
take one of my ladies for a spin.

461
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,904
Huh?

462
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,070
What, sex dolls?

463
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,424
No, have some class, man.

464
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,799
The term is inflatables, high quality,

465
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,695
expensive, very lifelike.

466
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:23,250
Huh?

467
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:41,902
Hey, honey.

468
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:44,071
Hey, you.

469
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:53,564
Mm.

470
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:58,819
Mm.

471
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,288
Where's Mike?

472
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:03,690
Asleep.

473
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:04,725
Kid had a big day.

474
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,360
Oh.

475
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,562
Most important, though,

476
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:10,097
how's Michael?

477
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:12,199
Were you able to help him?

478
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:16,737
I mean, he was barely
alive when I got there.

479
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:20,407
He, uh, slept most of the time.

480
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:22,342
I-I did what I could for him. I, uh...

481
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:26,313
I stabilized him, but he's changed.

482
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:30,617
He, uh... he's just not the guy I knew.

483
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:33,553
So, they dropped me at the
airport and that was that.

484
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,494
They?

485
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:37,618
Linc and some other guy.

486
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,434
Mike?

487
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:51,079
Where's Mike?

488
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,892
- You said that he was asleep.
- He is...

489
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:55,709
at a friend's house, a sleepover.

490
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:58,578
Okay. Which friend?

491
00:28:58,614 --> 00:28:59,880
He's at Patrick's house.

492
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,686
What happened to your
grandmother's ring?

493
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:09,189
I'm such an idiot.

494
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:11,091
I took it off on the
way over for safekeeping,

495
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,060
'cause I didn't want it to get stolen,

496
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:16,663
then when I looked for it
on the way back it was gone.

497
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:20,500
Screamed so loud they nearly
threw me off the flight.

498
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:23,503
Hmm.

499
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,798
Yeah?

500
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,367
We spoke to our man at the Pentagon.

501
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:55,969
A naval alert just went out.

502
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:58,105
Kaniel Outis has been located

503
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,707
on a cargo ship in the Mediterranean.

504
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,676
It was reported by the ship's captain.

505
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,344
What's the navy gonna do about it?

506
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:06,446
The nearest LCS combat craft

507
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,030
is moving to engage.

508
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:09,850
SEAL team's been deployed.

509
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:11,451
Orders?

510
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,888
To seek and destroy Kaniel Outis.

511
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:15,996
Good.

512
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:17,771
We've done our job
getting the message out.

513
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,194
Now it's time for the
SEALs to do theirs.

514
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,030
My God.

515
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,400
You've been through hell, my friend.

516
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,272
Have some faith, papi.

517
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:34,808
Thanks, papi.

518
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,344
What about you, Linc?

519
00:30:38,781 --> 00:30:40,781
I think Linc's got a secret girlfriend,

520
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:42,749
the pilot lady.

521
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:44,151
She's not my lady.

522
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:46,720
Maybe Sucre will set you up
with one of his sex dolls.

523
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:48,054
They're not dolls, man.

524
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,374
Oh, sorry, inflatables.

525
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:51,324
Look, let's just change
the subject, please.

526
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:54,060
You know, might be something
to be said for settling down.

527
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:57,426
Right, well... that's not in the cards.

528
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,906
It's locked from the outside.

529
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:06,973
They made you.

530
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:08,975
You really are a wanted terrorist.

531
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:10,243
What did the hell did
you think he was saying?

532
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,211
I thought it was an analogy.

533
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:12,445
Oh, for God's sake.

534
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:14,017
There's no other way

535
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:16,016
out of this cabin.

536
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:24,117
All crew to the top deck. All hands up.

537
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,734
Comply or be fired on.

538
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:30,584
This ship is now under the
control of the U.S. Navy.

539
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:31,832
Prepared to be boarded.

540
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:33,466
We got company.

541
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:34,734
I say we jump.

542
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,902
That's a long way down.

543
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,137
It's the only way out.

544
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,104
It's too far.

545
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,706
I have an idea...

546
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:43,247
but it's gonna hurt.

547
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,260
Hello?

548
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:06,333
Hey, Heather, it's me.
Listen, I can't talk,

549
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,501
but I need you to go pick
up Mike right now, okay?

550
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:09,970
Do you know where Patrick Monroe lives?

551
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:10,937
Yeah.

552
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,172
Okay.

553
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:13,707
Listen, I'll explain later.

554
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:15,575
Don't bring him back here, okay?

555
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,711
Keep him with you. I'll
be over as soon as I can.

556
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:19,045
Can you do that for me?

557
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,314
Uh, yeah. Uh, I'll leave right now.

558
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,682
I-I-Is everything okay?

559
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:23,750
No.

560
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:33,493
Go.

561
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,931
Six. The rest with me.

562
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:42,435
Go.

563
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,478
One, two, three, four.

564
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,315
Go, go.

565
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:04,858
I'll go left, you right.

566
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,534
They went out the window!

567
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:15,835
They went out the window!

568
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:18,138
What do you see?

569
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:19,673
No visual.

570
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:24,010
Alpha One, Alpha Two to portside, now.

571
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:26,513
Copy that.

572
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:29,849
Okay!

573
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:32,552
Take... Take it off!

574
00:33:32,587 --> 00:33:33,902
What's your name?

575
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:35,421
Fernando.

576
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,023
Fernando Sucre.

577
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,159
I'm a member of this crew.
Check the roster, man.

578
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,994
I got no part in any of this.

579
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:44,864
Check the roster for Fernando Sucre.

580
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:48,512
Suspect seems to check out.

581
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:50,503
Take him to the bridge.

582
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:52,205
Yes, sir.

583
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,607
Let's move.

584
00:33:58,647 --> 00:34:01,235
Absolutely no one gets
off this ship, understand?

585
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:02,530
Sir.

586
00:34:16,775 --> 00:34:18,508
I don't know any Kaniel Outis.

587
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:20,113
The guy's name is Scofield.

588
00:34:20,148 --> 00:34:21,413
Haven't seen him in years.

589
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,416
He calls me, he says he needs a ride.

590
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,386
We got active pursuit on engine deck.

591
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,553
Watch him.

592
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:30,123
The guy's name is Scofield!

593
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:36,429
That's the door Sucre told us about.

594
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:38,765
There they are!

595
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,400
Freeze! Freeze!

596
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,870
Look alive, look alive!

597
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,905
We've got them bottled up.

598
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,708
Guys, come on! Hurry!

599
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:49,776
Hurry!

600
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,977
It's stuck!

601
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,411
- Come on!
- It's stuck!

602
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,513
It's stuck!

603
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:55,882
Smoke them out, go!

604
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:09,796
Tear gas.

605
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:13,366
That hits the ventilation,
it's gonna ruin my cargo.

606
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:18,471
You've always been a loser, Sucre.

607
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:19,806
Worst shipmate I ever hired.

608
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:21,474
You brought this scum on board my ship.

609
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:23,043
They're your friends.
Where are they going?

610
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:24,477
They're associates of associates.

611
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,345
I haven't seen them in years.

612
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:27,680
But that's a good point.

613
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:30,216
Why don't you tell the nice SEAL here

614
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,418
how you accepted payment
for their passage?

615
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,992
Maybe they're your friends, not mine.

616
00:35:40,028 --> 00:35:42,195
Okay, okay.

617
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:45,780
I heard them say something
about container 17.

618
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:52,672
Oh.

619
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:55,041
That container 17.

620
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:58,911
The one with your
super secret cargo, huh?

621
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:00,413
Weapons and munitions?

622
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:03,683
Vincent, tangos may
be arming themselves.

623
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:06,552
Man, they're not gonna like
you if they find that, are they?

624
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:08,287
Vincent.

625
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:10,923
You might just end up on the
terrorist watch list, too.

626
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:11,924
Vincent, do you copy?

627
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,860
Can't read you.

628
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:17,730
Good-for-nothing
Mexican. You planned this.

629
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:18,865
Stay here.

630
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:28,984
17's still sealed.

631
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:34,947
Captain?

632
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:40,553
I'm Puerto Rican.

633
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:46,893
12:00. You hear that?

634
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:55,301
Come on!

635
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:02,475
Go, go. Move!

636
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:08,014
What's going on?

637
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:09,615
The ship's changing course.

638
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:12,151
I did it, papi.

639
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,928
No going back now.

640
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,624
See what their next move is.

641
00:37:31,372 --> 00:37:34,206
Do you remember our honeymoon?

642
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah, of course.

643
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,648
How you opened up.

644
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:46,419
Told me you carried shame
for what you did at Fox River.

645
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:49,689
How some days you
wished you'd never heard

646
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:51,857
the name Michael Scofield.

647
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,162
Even admitted to lying,

648
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:58,331
keeping it all from me.

649
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:00,918
How you finally came clean

650
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:03,703
and put it all behind you?

651
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,239
Sure.

652
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:10,376
I forgave you for the lies.

653
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:12,511
Your past.

654
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:14,280
Accepted you.

655
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:16,415
Loved you and Mike.

656
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,417
How is that not enough for you?

657
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:36,736
Hi.

658
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:37,870
Hello?

659
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,605
I have him.

660
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,274
Thank God.

661
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,843
He's fine.

662
00:38:43,878 --> 00:38:45,378
Headed home now.

663
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,646
Hi, Mom.

664
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:49,122
Oh, Heather, thank God.

665
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:51,284
I'll be there soon.

666
00:39:34,294 --> 00:39:36,365
Navigation's been trashed,

667
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,501
the controls damaged.

668
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:41,837
Damn it.

669
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:43,472
Tramp's off course.

670
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:46,409
Moving toward Algerian
waters, top speed.

671
00:39:46,444 --> 00:39:47,613
Can we fix it?

672
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:48,911
It'll take time.

673
00:39:48,947 --> 00:39:50,513
And by then we'd be out

674
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:51,714
of international waters.

675
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:54,784
Falcon One requesting orders.

676
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,519
We have a situation.

677
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:00,736
Yeah.

678
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:03,005
The SEAL team failed
to neutralize Outis.

679
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:05,837
Somehow the ship's
controls were damaged.

680
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,477
It's headed for Algerian waters
with our soldiers on boards,

681
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:10,012
but it'll cause a diplomatic incident

682
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:12,348
if they stay to finish the job.

683
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:14,817
The navy just made the
call to pull the team.

684
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:16,418
All right, all right.

685
00:40:16,454 --> 00:40:18,320
The SEALs couldn't do
it. We escalate our move.

686
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:20,255
Shouldn't have brought
a knife to a gunfight.

687
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,824
I will handle from here.

688
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:23,658
Thank you.

689
00:40:35,873 --> 00:40:36,972
Sir.

690
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:38,474
Yes.

691
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:41,410
I have an ask, one that's imperative.

692
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:44,580
I believe you'll find that
our interests are aligned.

693
00:40:59,964 --> 00:41:01,363
What are they doing?

694
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,364
They're leaving.

695
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,665
Why?

696
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:04,867
Run!

697
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:07,936
Oh, God. No, no, no, no!

698
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:12,100
Hey!

699
00:41:12,127 --> 00:41:13,994
You're gonna want this.

700
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:46,308
Mike is safe where you can't
touch him, and this is over.

701
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:50,512
The life, the lies, the mask.

702
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:53,248
You're gonna tell me everything.

703
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:55,584
Like who you really are,

704
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,687
what this was, all of it.

705
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:02,591
It was our life.

706
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,726
It's not over, Sara.

707
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:07,496
Not even close.

708
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:10,098
And Mike was never in danger.

709
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:12,434
I love him.

710
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,103
He is my family.

711
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:17,239
I raised him.

712
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:18,540
What have you done?

713
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:20,742
No.

714
00:42:20,778 --> 00:42:22,845
It's what you've done, Sara.

715
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,682
All of this could've been avoided.

716
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,886
Good sleepover?

717
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:31,920
Yeah.

718
00:42:31,956 --> 00:42:33,555
Is Mommy coming to pick me up?

719
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:35,603
Yes, sir.

720
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:40,496
Michael's dead.

721
00:42:40,531 --> 00:42:43,665
Your Nightingale trip to
Greece led me straight to him.

722
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:48,670
So... it's all on you, Sara.

723
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:52,007
And your plan with Heather didn't work.

724
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,276
Where's my son?

725
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:55,377
I have him.

726
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:58,347
And whether or not I
have to threaten him...

727
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,249
Which I don't want to do...

728
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:03,919
Is entirely contingent upon
you putting the gun down.

729
00:43:20,843 --> 00:43:25,343
