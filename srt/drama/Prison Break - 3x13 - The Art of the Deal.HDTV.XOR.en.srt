1
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:06,051
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:07,511
What are you doing?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,223
You know I have what you need
and I'll give you the rest

4
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:13,601
after I know that Sofia, L.J.
they're all safe.

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,093
My book!

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
Get up!

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:26,823
What's this place?

8
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:28,982
We'll make the exchange here
on our terms.

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,369
An abandoned warehouse 5 miles
down the road.

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,330
Be there in 20 minutes with my son.

11
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,904
They must've closed all
the roads out of Panama.

12
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:36,999
What do we do?

13
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:39,250
Whistler still claims
he's a fisherman?

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,128
If he's not a fisherman, what is he?

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,049
I don't care what he says!
I don't know anything about Scofield!

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,172
You sure you don't want
to change your story...

17
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:51,723
I guess this is where I say good-bye.

18
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:56,977
My truck!

19
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,110
What are we gonna do now?

20
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,520
Do you have a cell phone?

21
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,566
<i>- I lost 'em. Come and pick me up.</i>
- Where are you?

22
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:14,865
let me guess.

23
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,037
- If anything happens to him...
- That depends, doesn't it?

24
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,792
I'm at the warehouse, like you said.
Where are you?

25
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,250
Chasing your buddy.
Where do you think I am?

26
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,715
Get back here. I have L.J. and Sofia.
I'm ready to do the exchange.

27
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,702
- Call you back.
- What?

28
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,303
- The plan's shot. She's already there.
- OK. So now what?

29
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:38,830
It took me two weeks
to hook up that warehouse.

30
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,601
- We'll figure something.
- I was trying to fix this.

31
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:45,354
- You were calling them to pick you up.
- So no one else would get hurt!

32
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,441
You really think I would
put anyone's life at risk?

33
00:03:49,683 --> 00:03:50,984
You already have.

34
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,628
I can't go back to Sona!

35
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,004
You're not going back to Sona.

36
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:31,793
Do you want some water?

37
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,520
Or do you want
to tell me where Michael Scofield is?

38
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,010
I don't know where he is.

39
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:52,231
I knew there was something off
about you from day one.

40
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,611
I guess I just know a
con when I see one.

41
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,489
Maybe you'll get to be
employee of the month.

42
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,900
- I'm waiting.
- There's been a change in venue.

43
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:41,279
I finally get to talk
to the brains of the outfit.

44
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,350
We're at the <i>Plaza De Francia</i>.

45
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,891
<i>So you're thinking public place,
safety in numbers,</i>

46
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,671
plenty of witnesses to protect you.

47
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,582
I'm thinking public place,
wanted men, police,

48
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:53,876
lots of witnesses to identify you.

49
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,497
Plaza de Francia. Ten minutes.

50
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:01,800
Round everyone up.

51
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,789
Subtitles: swsub.com

52
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:54,895
It's anarchy in here!

53
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:56,397
We gotta hide!

54
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,399
- I gotta help him.
- He's the most hated person in here.

55
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,450
- If we're around him again, we'll...
- He gave me a home!

56
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,322
He gave me third-degree burns
down my back! He can go to hell!

57
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,990
I owe him this much.

58
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,655
You don't want to help, then don't.

59
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,122
Get outta here! Shoo fly...

60
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,592
Just a few more steps, only a few more.
Then it's home, sweet home.

61
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:39,689
This is my house!

62
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,219
Easy, now.

63
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,597
Get out!

64
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,710
- He's gonna get us killed.
- He's gonna get us out of here.

65
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:49,918
What can I get you?

66
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:51,610
Club soda.

67
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,720
You been to Panama before?

68
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,153
First time.

69
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,821
What did you do back, in the states?

70
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:17,278
I'm in sort of a transitional period
right now.

71
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,451
In between jobs.

72
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,833
Sorry to hear that.

73
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,724
Yeah, we've all been there.

74
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,051
I'm sure something will come up
before long.

75
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,769
I'm hoping
it's right around the corner.

76
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,011
You're gonna give me some real
information on Michael Scofield.

77
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,299
Or it's gonna be your funeral.

78
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,870
I don't know where he is.

79
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,631
I don't know how to reach him, I swear.

80
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,776
Which one is it gonna be, <i>papi</i>?

81
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,760
- Hello, Gretchen.
- Where's Whistler?

82
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:58,180
Over my right shoulder.

83
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,103
You know, you're the first
to ever break out of Sona?

84
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:07,231
Where are they?

85
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,484
Bring them out.

86
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,364
I've worked with a lot of intelligent
people in this business, but you...

87
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,799
You wouldn't have to worry
about the company

88
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,412
trying to kill you if you were
on their side. They certainly pay well.

89
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,090
There they are.

90
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:35,842
Give me Whistler
and I will give you L.J.

91
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,771
If you move, you're dead.

92
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:53,318
- It for hand-off.
- Roger that.

93
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:11,169
- What is he doing?
<i>- I lost him.</i>

94
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,170
It's not the point of the exchange.
Just a confirmation

95
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,259
- that everyone's still alive.
- They're alive. Let's trade.

96
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:20,678
You'll get a call in five minutes
telling you where to go next.

97
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,433
And when the exchange
is over and L.J. is safe,

98
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,602
you and I are gonna
spend some quality time.

99
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:32,942
When the exchange is over,
you better run for your life.

100
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:55,493
<i>Gracias, papa.</i>

101
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,943
One more stop.

102
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,237
There's a storm brewing
out there in the yard.

103
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:26,096
You tell them come in.
I'm not scared.

104
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,565
Well, I am.

105
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:31,477
You might want to put that down.

106
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,832
You're the last one
I'd expect to see at my side.

107
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:55,949
I take offense, <i>patròn.</i>

108
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,736
I've had many foot-washers.

109
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:01,590
Many men have come in
with sheep's clothing,

110
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:03,384
only to let the wolf come out.

111
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,640
I am not trying to hurt you.
I am trying to save you.

112
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,904
Save me?

113
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,185
I'm gonna die here.

114
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:16,021
Your life is in jeopardy
just being with me.

115
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,726
Not necessarily.

116
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:22,820
As I was being escorted
back inside today, one of the guards

117
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,606
offered us
a chance to buy our freedom.

118
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:30,828
If a guard spoke to you, he was lying.
It's impossible to get out.

119
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,431
maybe you've been
too busy dying to notice,

120
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,510
but there's a new colonel outside.

121
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,860
Little Suzy Sona ain't playing so hard
to get no more. She has her price.

122
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,388
- And we gonna need some money.
- No.

123
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,306
Then you will die in here.

124
00:16:59,054 --> 00:17:01,450
The lobby of the museum of antiquities.

125
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,256
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because that's where Whistler is.

126
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:06,447
<i>You're overthinking things.</i>

127
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:08,560
I've seen it too many times before.

128
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,080
The 1st plan goes to hell,
then you start tap-dancing,

129
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,329
and, trust me, it always ends badly.

130
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,189
You have five minutes.

131
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:32,964
Unbelievable.

132
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,562
You know what to do.

133
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,180
- What's so funny?
- You.

134
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,035
Thinking you can outsmart my uncle.

135
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:54,701
Walk.

136
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,640
Metal detectors.

137
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,885
I thought we were
building a circle of trust.

138
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,700
Come to the southwest
corner of the first floor.

139
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,722
<i>Fine.</i>

140
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,030
But that's it.
No more stops on your guided tour.

141
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:21,480
<i>If I don't walk out of here
with Whistler, I'm gonna snap LJ's neck.</i>

142
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,608
And yes, I can do it.

143
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,028
Here we go.

144
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,487
- Is everyone in position?
- Roger that.

145
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,572
It's the last bottle of rum.

146
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,390
Good-bye, <i>patròn.</i>

147
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,022
How much do they want?

148
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,242
50,000.

149
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:54,220
We're not in Tijuana
haggling over a blanket.

150
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,889
We're talking about your life!

151
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:57,836
Even if I could...

152
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,603
find the money, who could
I trust to bring it in?

153
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:06,988
There is one person.

154
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,453
- How do you know James?
- You're working my last nerve. Move.

155
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:33,302
Everybody stays cool and we
will all walk out of here.

156
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,929
As soon as we get LJ,
you get Whistler.

157
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,792
But LJ comes to us first.

158
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:54,130
Go ahead.

159
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:09,254
Thank God, you're safe.

160
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,718
What about the coordinates?

161
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,727
You said first thing you would do

162
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,568
once you had Whistler was to get
the rest of the coordinates.

163
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,858
Is she serious?

164
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,824
I'll give her exactly what she
wants when we get out of here.

165
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,161
- But it's not safe. We need to go.
- I want to see them.

166
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,626
Sofia, come on.

167
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,163
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait...

168
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,703
You wrote those numbers
on a piece of paper.

169
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:56,637
You gave her half at Sona and said
you'd give her the other half now.

170
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,800
I know, and we'll discuss it later.

171
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,557
Welcome to the real world.
I'm sick of keeping your princess

172
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:04,810
- in a bubble. Let's go!
- This is between us.

173
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,337
- Where are the coordinates?
- There are no coordinates.

174
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:27,875
Come on.

175
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:40,637
Stop kidding yourself.
It's time to leave.

176
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:49,938
And what are you still doing here?

177
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,524
If I were you and I couldn't
bring weapons inside,

178
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,695
I'd have agents at every exit ready
to shoot as soon as we stepped outside.

179
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,669
Then it really doesn't
matter what exit you take, does it?

180
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:04,202
I'm gonna go out that door.
Maybe you should take that door.

181
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,117
Actually, that door is locked
in the event of an emergency.

182
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,278
- What emergency?
- This one.

183
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,804
We're all walking out of here.

184
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:25,891
Together.

185
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,431
That's very dramatic,
calling the cops on yourself.

186
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,410
You wanna go back to Sona?

187
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,210
They're not looking for a con,
they're looking for a thief.

188
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,880
Whatever I told you, it
was always to protect you.

189
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,658
You'll understand,
if you just let me explain.

190
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:07,516
All this because I knew Scofield?

191
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,811
- Tell me where he is.
- I don't know!

192
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,652
Even if I knew...

193
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:00,146
All right.

194
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,363
It'll be here shortly.

195
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,163
Now that we have the money,
how do we get it to the guard?

196
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:13,999
We don't.

197
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,086
What do you mean?

198
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:24,176
We were supposed
to bribe the guard, that was the plan!

199
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:34,561
This is the plan.

200
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:37,147
This is business.

201
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,816
And you, of all people,
should understand.

202
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,074
- Help me hold him down.
- What the hell you talking about?

203
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,575
Do it.

204
00:25:00,502 --> 00:25:03,400
It's just a matter of time, anyway.

205
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,597
But from one thief to another...

206
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:13,642
out of respect,

207
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:16,728
make it quick.

208
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,650
If you don't fight me,

209
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,430
I will.

210
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,334
Adios, homey.

211
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,128
Over here.

212
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,263
- What's the problem?
- I found this in his pocket.

213
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:39,353
- Would you care to explain this?
- I've got no idea what it is.

214
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,107
It's plastic. It's from the gift shop.

215
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:46,735
Now, if you'll excuse us.

216
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:50,864
- What?
- Stay where you are.

217
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:53,991
- Why?
- Where is your identification?

218
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,667
Dad, dad... you can't do this.

219
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,698
You can't do this. The cops'll start
asking questions. We gotta go.

220
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,550
Go, I'm not leaving.

221
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:41,947
What are you gonna do, James?

222
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:46,044
You go back there, you'll get arrested,
and that won't do any of us any good.

223
00:27:51,122 --> 00:27:53,468
I ought to kill you right now
for what you did to her!

224
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:54,511
Enough!

225
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:01,363
I did what I had to do
to get you out, period!

226
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:03,520
You remember what's at stake, James.

227
00:28:05,054 --> 00:28:06,404
We're moving.

228
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,180
Stop the van. I can't leave her.

229
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,660
She already left you.

230
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,040
I'm not going anywhere.

231
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,670
Dad, you've got to go!
I'll stay with her! I promise.

232
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,670
You've got to go. Dad?

233
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:56,364
Could I get some help?

234
00:28:57,897 --> 00:28:59,624
Do you have everything?

235
00:29:00,494 --> 00:29:01,955
The book is gone.

236
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,706
What do you mean, gone?

237
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:11,174
Is it true?

238
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,929
- he's really...
- Yeah.

239
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,740
How do you want me to give you this?

240
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,170
The guards,
they won't let me in anymore.

241
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,679
I only want what I asked for.

242
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,139
Hold on to the rest for a few days.

243
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,239
If you were to consider
leaving with all that...

244
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,809
I just want you to know
I'd be very cross with you.

245
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,253
I've been known to have a
bit of a temper problem...

246
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:56,965
when betrayed.

247
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,250
A deal's a deal.

248
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,057
You've done so much for me.

249
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:05,767
You have my word.

250
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,463
Wait.

251
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,232
It's okay.

252
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,464
I'll wait for you.

253
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,037
You ready?

254
00:31:30,617 --> 00:31:32,660
I'm all right.

255
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:42,405
Where is Michael Scofield?

256
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,239
Where is Michael Scofield?

257
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,830
If it's him...

258
00:32:21,517 --> 00:32:25,080
you're gonna find out where
they are, or I'm gonna answer it myself,

259
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,840
so they can hear you scream
when I blow your head off.

260
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,280
Sucre. Thank God.

261
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,250
- When you didn't show up at the boat...
- I'm really sorry about that, <i>papi</i>.

262
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,470
I got into a little bit
of trouble at work.

263
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,930
<i>Are you all right?</i>

264
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,768
- Where are you?
- You guys get L.J?

265
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,354
Yeah. He's fine.

266
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,731
What about Linc? Is he okay?

267
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:00,149
<i>He's fine.</i>

268
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,027
Are you sure you're all right?

269
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,528
I'm fine.

270
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,515
It all worked out.

271
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,390
I'm about to catch the bus, <i>papi.</i>
Take care.

272
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,429
Kill me if you want.

273
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:23,634
No, <i>papi.</i>

274
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,059
You're gonna wish we had.

275
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:41,566
Lechero is dead!

276
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,745
I come before you now to bury the man.

277
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,166
Not to praise him,

278
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,180
for there is nothing
praiseworthy about his rule here.

279
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,588
Having one of our own dictate to us?

280
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,303
That's just not the natural order.

281
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,805
All cons

282
00:34:13,046 --> 00:34:14,515
are equal!

283
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,260
I have the last remnants...

284
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,435
of Lechero's cruel empire

285
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,321
in my hand.

286
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,617
An empire which I...

287
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:34,082
willingly participated in

288
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:37,046
and witnessed first-hand.

289
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,720
Money...

290
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,837
made off of your backs

291
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:47,446
and off the backs of your family!

292
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,094
It's yours.

293
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,231
And I'm here to tell you

294
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,376
I'm giving it back.

295
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:29,211
Welcome home, <i>papi</i>.

296
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,593
- She's gonna be okay.
- Good.

297
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,151
Uncle Mike...

298
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,061
I wanted to wait
until we were safe to do this, but...

299
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:26,620
but...

300
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:30,818
I found this in the room
where Sara and I were held.

301
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,500
I thought you might want to have it.

302
00:37:03,502 --> 00:37:04,644
I'm sorry.

303
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,810
Thanks.

304
00:37:14,387 --> 00:37:15,720
How's Sofia doing?

305
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,329
- She's good.
- Good.

306
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:19,006
The cops will be leaving soon.

307
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,490
- You can go up and see her, then.
- Good.

308
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,630
She wanted me to tell you something.

309
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,790
She said there's something in
her apartment underneath her bed.

310
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,940
- Something about Whistler.
- I'm not interested.

311
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:33,965
What is it?

312
00:37:36,082 --> 00:37:38,261
This is over. It's done.

313
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,125
I said, "what is it?"

314
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:01,930
You're late.

315
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,163
And you owe him for my drinks.

316
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,293
Give us a minute?

317
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,053
Nice tip.

318
00:38:22,454 --> 00:38:24,265
She handles the money.

319
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:32,690
You in?

320
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,319
She'd better be able to handle
a lot more than that.

321
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,979
Because if she has done what
you think she has...

322
00:38:41,164 --> 00:38:42,033
Sara...

323
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,453
she's the weak link.

324
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,800
And he will find her.

325
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,918
And then Scofield will find you...

326
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,441
and me.

327
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,150
And I'm not paying for your mess.

328
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,101
Are you in or are you out?

329
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,558
I'm in.

330
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,383
I need your gun.

331
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,690
"Jason Lief."

332
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,700
You heard of this guy?

333
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:05,117
No, but if he's important to Whistler,
he's important to me.

334
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:06,909
Slow down.

335
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,953
I get to Whistler, I get to Gretchen.

336
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,706
This is the one chance we have
of sticking toge...

337
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:13,844
They killed Sara.

338
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,800
I'm sorry about that.

339
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,515
I know...

340
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:28,431
Listen, man...
I did everything I could, you know.

341
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,873
- Everything.
- I know you did.

342
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,522
But I gotta go.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
