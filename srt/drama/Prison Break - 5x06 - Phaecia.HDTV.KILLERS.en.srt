1
00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:04,177
We're gonna get you out of here.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,960
_

3
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:08,497
_

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,504
Poseidon put us in
here to get Ramal out,

5
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:11,832
but then he abandoned us.

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,837
Ramal is Poseidon's guy, not ours.

7
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:16,173
The escape is on.

8
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,875
He's my brother!

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,977
Who the hell is this Poseidon guy?

10
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,690
A frustrated policy wonk

11
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:23,847
in the CIA, who created a cell

12
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:26,983
within the CIA called 21-Void.

13
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,385
And he needed my help

14
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:31,455
breaking out people
imprisoned all over the world.

15
00:00:33,793 --> 00:00:36,060
We've awoken something.

16
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:38,462
Any chance Poseidon will
just let us kill her?

17
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,064
- Point.
- It's three and four.

18
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,081
The man, and the woman was the shooter.

19
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,650
Step back! That's not gonna happen.

20
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:45,869
Go to hell!

21
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:49,698
Let's get the hell out of here!

22
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,842
The only way out now is up, brother.

23
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:02,219
I'm so sorry. Sorry, brother.

24
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:10,779
_

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,417
We got to move.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,253
No. We go out on the
streets tonight, we're dead.

27
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:22,675
You know it and I know it.

28
00:01:22,678 --> 00:01:25,542
Even on the outside, I
feel the world crushing in.

29
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:27,444
That's what being locked up does.

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,147
You carry the prison
with you on the outside.

31
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,150
I can't live that way.

32
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:36,353
I've got to know the walls disappear.

33
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,857
It's called being scared.
Happens when you're sober.

34
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,992
Don't give me the pill talk.

35
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:44,755
I won't give you the
poor little orphan talk.

36
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:45,728
How your friend here

37
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,531
isn't the father figure
you thought he was gonna be.

38
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:48,833
This isn't helping.

39
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,268
The walls are going away, brother.

40
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,504
We're gonna make 'em go away.

41
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,186
We're getting out of this country.

42
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,273
All of us.

43
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,242
Oh, really? Which
contingency's that gonna be?

44
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,443
You burned through them all.

45
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:01,745
Truck to border, train, airport.

46
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,913
None of those.

47
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,214
We're exactly where

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,817
I don't want to be: improvising.

49
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:09,319
Well, we need to improvise
something real fast

50
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,754
or it's gonna be us down there,

51
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,055
strung up like that.

52
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,024
Omar. Sheba's guy.

53
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:15,825
She said he had a way out.

54
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,060
We can trust him?

55
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,797
No. But he's our last option.

56
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,483
You made bail. You're being released.

57
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,377
Don't be a stranger, sugar.

58
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:52,322
Poseidon got you out first.

59
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,232
I thought I was his favorite.

60
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:02,286
Son of a bitch really escaped.

61
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,655
Yep.

62
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:07,454
But why kill Ramal? I
thought they were allies.

63
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,857
It's not our job to ask questions.

64
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,192
Maybe we should.

65
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:17,197
Poseidon says we find
Kaniel Outis and kill him.

66
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:20,066
That's what we're gonna do.

67
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,370
And I think I know how to do it.

68
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,813
Omar.

69
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,519
What are you doing here?

70
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,621
You're radioactive, my friend.

71
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,258
You killed Abu Ramal. Really?

72
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:48,261
That was a very stupid move, man.

73
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,896
Just tell us where you're headed.

74
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,635
300 miles across the desert. Phaeacia.

75
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,403
Old smuggling friends.

76
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,772
Uh, autonomous zone. No ISIL.

77
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:00,940
Perfect.

78
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:02,709
Not perfect.

79
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,580
Four of you, one of
me. Not enough seats.

80
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,747
Okay, okay, all right. What
about getting another vehicle?

81
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,215
Tell you what.

82
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,869
Because it's Sheba and I owe her,

83
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:14,612
maybe we can help each other.

84
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:16,288
I have another vehicle.

85
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,257
A Land Cruiser.

86
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:19,058
I was going to leave it behind,

87
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,527
but if you can get it,

88
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:23,096
it's in a parking garage
two blocks from here.

89
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,431
I'll let you follow.

90
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,336
Deliver my second vehicle,

91
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:30,007
and maybe I get the Phaeacians
to get you a boat somewhere,

92
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,639
to Europe, France, Italy,
Spain, wherever you want to go.

93
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,607
How's that sound?

94
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,049
Keys are here.

95
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:43,806
Uh, left side, the
red brick. First floor.

96
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:46,591
Battery might be dead, so you might need

97
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,480
- all of you to push.
- We got it.

98
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,258
Whip, you stay with him. Let's move.

99
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,300
He always give you orders like that?

100
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,905
It's complicated.

101
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,308
I got an order for you.

102
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:10,843
Load up.

103
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,612
One more bag inside.

104
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,366
There!

105
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:22,601
Give it a push on my say.

106
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,697
Battery's working perfectly.

107
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:33,833
How far away is this garage?

108
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:37,003
Only two blocks. No problem.

109
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,319
Someone says there's no problem,
there's always a problem.

110
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,011
He set us up. Get in!

111
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:50,984
Hold on.

112
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:42,948

113
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:58,336
Nothing personal, my friend.

114
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,839
In another life, no doubt
we smoke the hookah together.

115
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,657
No! No, you don't!

116
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,530
Whip, you okay?

117
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,326
Thought you were gonna
be a millionaire, huh?

118
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:29,571
I didn't have a choice.

119
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,572
Come on! Coldcocking son of a bitch!

120
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:37,475
Hold on, hold on. Easy
now, we may need him.

121
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,443
Yes. You need me.

122
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,281
I want a map to this Phaeacia place.

123
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:45,383
You do realize this is Yemen, don't you?

124
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:48,084
Phaeacia is a hundred people.

125
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:50,855
Mud huts. There is no map.

126
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:55,017
But I can lead you there.

127
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:57,956
You want to trust this guy?

128
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,794
Well, if he screws with us,

129
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:02,198
we'll just let Whip
finish what he started.

130
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:03,966
And I will kill you.

131
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,135
I can't wait to kill him.

132
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,538
You coldcock me, I end you.

133
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:11,941
Rule number one in my country. Okay?

134
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,510
And rule number one in my country is

135
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,946
when things get bad, go to the desert.

136
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,233
We are desperate, desperate men.

137
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,968
Not as desperate as Omar right now.

138
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:40,436
If there's one man you don't want

139
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:42,304
to get on the wrong side of, it's Whip.

140
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:46,408
That might apply to you, too, Michael.

141
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,944
I get the sense the kid thinks
you betrayed him somehow.

142
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:52,659
I could understand why he thinks that.

143
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:06,762
I really am sorry, my friend.

144
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,897
When I'm scared, I make poor choices.

145
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,866
Zero comes out of your mouth. Okay?

146
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:16,639
I'm having a really bad
couple days. Just the worst.

147
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:29,118
Agent Kishida.

148
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,330
Settling into your new office, I see.

149
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:36,225
I still see this as
Kellerman's office, ma'am.

150
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:41,430
As you probably know,

151
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,465
before he was killed,

152
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:46,068
Kellerman had been looking into 21-Void.

153
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:47,939
I knew that. Yes.

154
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,172
I need Paul's files.

155
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,341
Obviously, he was
getting close to something

156
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,843
and they killed him for it.

157
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,845
Actually, I've been
looking into his leads,

158
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,547
and there's nothing there.

159
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:02,250
I hate to say it, but this
file is full of dead ends.

160
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,086
There's nothing here.

161
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,322
There must be something.

162
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:09,058
Look, I don't want Paul
to have died in vain,

163
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,393
but we need to look at this
whole thing with new eyes.

164
00:10:11,429 --> 00:10:12,895
Read it for yourself.

165
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,933
Okay, you want to put
new eyes on this? Fine.

166
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:20,433
Now that you report to me,

167
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:22,338
I need you to look into the possibility

168
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,073
that there was an insider involved.

169
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,675
Here? At the State Department?

170
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,578
Anywhere along the evidence chain.

171
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:31,347
Will do, ma'am.

172
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:48,621
Agent Kishida.

173
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,324
I wasn't expecting a call at this hour.

174
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:53,235
I just wanted to follow up
on our earlier conversation.

175
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,770
The situation in the Middle East?

176
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:57,439
Situation's developing.

177
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,975
We need to meet soon.

178
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,977
Fair enough.

179
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:04,146
The moment we're back, we'll call you.

180
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,056
You worked at NSA?

181
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:15,055
Team Eye in the Sky for ten years.

182
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:17,236
Watched the most heinous
crap you can imagine

183
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,239
by satellite.

184
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:20,896
Stonings, rapes.

185
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:24,900
Just had to sit back and watch
it like a horror film, helpless,

186
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:27,069
until Poseidon tapped my shoulder,

187
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,738
gave me a chance to
do something about it.

188
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:33,976
Emily, good to see you again.

189
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,210
Likewise.

190
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,546
You got my message? Kaniel Outis?

191
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:39,879
You gonna help us locate him?

192
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:42,384
Look, protocol says no.

193
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,387
We stay clear of CIA,
any offensive action.

194
00:11:45,423 --> 00:11:47,055
We're surveillance only.

195
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,524
We just want to put eyes on him.

196
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,688
I think I can get you in as observers

197
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:55,595
under interagency auspices.

198
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,600
I knew I could count on you.

199
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,068
But you owe me.

200
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,905
That B&B we went up to in Connecticut,

201
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,573
I want that weekend again.

202
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,611
That exact weekend.

203
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,557
What you got back here, anyway?

204
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:23,392
What is this, guns, drugs?

205
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,195
Fireworks?

206
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,330
You don't understand the Phaeacians.

207
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,766
They are beautiful. Generous.

208
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:33,502
They just want to smile.

209
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:34,770
Unlike you.

210
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:36,505
Oh, is that right?

211
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,774
Ah, holding grudges.

212
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,018
It's very bad for the heart...

213
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,937
You know what else
is bad for your heart?

214
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,847
If I shove a Roman candle
through the middle of it.

215
00:12:54,663 --> 00:12:56,559
Ja, please.

216
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:57,927
Don't check out on us.

217
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:02,231
Still trying to figure
out why you got me out.

218
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:06,201
I need that great big mind
of yours clean and clear.

219
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,310
It's the number from
the airport last night.

220
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,543
C-Note, what's up?

221
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:16,970
Lincoln, it's Sheba.

222
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,305
I got Benjamin's phone.

223
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:20,048
Oh, hi.

224
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:22,050
Did you find Omar?

225
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:23,819
Yeah, we found him.

226
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,120
We're traveling.

227
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,855
You okay?

228
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:29,090
Yes. We're in Jordan.

229
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,761
Leaving for the U.S. tonight.

230
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,329
How's C-Note?

231
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:36,431
He's fine.

232
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,134
We all are.

233
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:41,803
Everyone.

234
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,405
We're going to make it.

235
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,741
It's because of you.

236
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,642
Because of my money.

237
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,011
It's because of you.

238
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,413
Come on.

240
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,450
Hey, uh...

241
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,321
when I get back, I'll,
I'll buy you a drink.

242
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,723
I don't drink.

243
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:04,626
But I'll buy you a drink.

244
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:06,028
How about that?

245
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:08,897
Sounds good.

246
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,102
We got a hit,

247
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:15,737
Franklin's cell phone lit up in Jordan.

248
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:18,182
The one he bought with a credit
card in Yemen a few days ago.

249
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:20,354
Making an outbound call
to an unknown number.

250
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,731
Currently right outside Sana'a, Yemen.

251
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,701
Rerouting a drone to that target now.

252
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:27,115
We just found our man, didn't we?

253
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,710
There. Two vehicles heading west.

254
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:37,690
Drones in position.

255
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,093
Let's take a peek.

256
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,793
They're stopping.

257
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,229
Pull up all known data on that location.

258
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:53,291
Why did we stop?

259
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:55,937
Phaeacia is 300 miles that way.

260
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:59,974
We need to fill our
gas tanks up to the top.

261
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,016
- As-salamu.'alaykum.
- Alaykumu s-salaam.

262
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:05,446
Michael, where you going?

263
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:06,580
Been under Poseidon's thumb

264
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:08,115
for the last seven years.

265
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:12,019
It's about time I got out from under it.

266
00:15:12,055 --> 00:15:13,287
Internet?

267
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,788
_

268
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,190
Shukraan.

269
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,346
They have no clue
we're watching, do they?

270
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:26,801
Not at this height.

271
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:39,772
_

272
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:45,552
Who is this?

273
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:47,764
A friend from far away.

274
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,991
Your government has always
considered us an enemy.

275
00:15:51,027 --> 00:15:52,292
Officially.

276
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:57,398
But some of us have a
more enlightened view.

277
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:00,134
Abu Ramal was a great visionary.

278
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,836
You have our sincerest condolences.

279
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,071
What do you want?

280
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:05,272
The same thing you do,

281
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:07,378
to eliminate the men who killed him.

282
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,848
And as a sign of good faith...

283
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:15,249
we'll tell you exactly where they are.

284
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,769
Hey, can you see me?

285
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:28,138
Not yet.

286
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:29,701
Blasted computer camera thing.

287
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,067
Who makes these things?

288
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,869
All right, I see you.

289
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,432
Come on, hurry. Get this off of me.

290
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,256
Hold your hand still.

291
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,642
Just do it already.

292
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,278
Do you want to stay like this?

293
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,948
You're lucky we cut you loose.

294
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,447
The men who killed Abu Ramal,

295
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,624
Leaving Sana'a, heading
west on Highway 80.

296
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,240
- Okay.
- Highway 80.

297
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,642
We're leaving now.

298
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:03,801
- I'm coming, too.
- No.

299
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,205
This is not your fight anymore.

300
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,207
Understand?

301
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,227
_

302
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,800
_

303
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,611
You know it's been four years
since I've had air conditioning?

304
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:49,303
I'm done with the heat.

305
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,772
Kind of like it out here.

306
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,019
No walls.

307
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,319
No walls, okay? Ain't about walls.

308
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,291
My opinion, you know what you need

309
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,859
more than anything else in the world?

310
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,494
Got to laugh more.

311
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,329
If he wants to laugh,

312
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,897
Phaeacia 's the place.

313
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,833
I always wanted to bring Sheba;

314
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,367
for her to see the people.

315
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,403
No technology, no politics,

316
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:14,671
no modern nonsense.

317
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:16,439
They know how to enjoy life.

318
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,941
No technology?

319
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,606
Freddie Mercury here couldn't hack it.

320
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:20,510
Freddie Mercury?

321
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:22,045
I could hack it.

322
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:24,114
I was alive before cell phones.

323
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,716
You're more addicted to
that screen than you are

324
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,551
to them pills, and that
is saying something.

325
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,258
Be ready.

326
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:38,261
Ah, my friends. We got problems!

327
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,230
Michael, we got to go!

328
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,965
Michael? Let's go!

329
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,233
I got to go.

330
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:44,734
Hold on, let me try something else.

331
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,969
Can you see me now?

332
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,837
No. Take a screen capture.

333
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,072
What of?

334
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,608
A screen capture. Take it.

335
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,111
ISIL militants coming from the east.

336
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,047
This should get interesting.

337
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,212
Don't think one bullet is
going to get us out of this.

338
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:06,823
One bullet? Who the hell
carries a gun with one bullet?

339
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:09,259
The man who would kill himself
before being captured by ISIL.

340
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,342
Get closer. Zoom in.

341
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:27,071
Hold on.

342
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,913
These militants, how'd they find them?

343
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,882
Damnit, what are you
waiting for? Shoot back!

344
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,216
We only got one bullet.

345
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,852
- One bullet?
- Exactly.

346
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:42,049
We're seriously screwed here.

347
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:44,661
Unless I can make this one bullet count.

348
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:46,029
What?

349
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:05,215
You sure as hell made it count, kid.

350
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,350
Hell yeah, you did.

351
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:12,389
Oh, my God.

352
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:15,658
Michael.

353
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,227
He's in a bad way, Linc.

354
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,784
More coming, we got to
get the hell out of here!

355
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,321
What are they stopping for?

356
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:38,523
Don't know.

357
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:47,984
We can't go any further.

358
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,085
We can go a lot further.

359
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,386
We've got to get to Phaeacia.

360
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:51,928
There's no roads, Whip.

361
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,923
The roads are in Omar's
head along with the map.

362
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,226
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

363
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,428
Our map is dead.

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,666
We got to head back.

365
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:14,902
To what?

366
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:16,837
He's right.

367
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:18,338
We'll die out there without a map.

368
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:20,073
We don't know that.

369
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,042
We 99% know that.

370
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:27,881
Guess we're not out of the woods yet!

371
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,623
We got to lose this guy, whoever he is!

372
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:31,385
- Let's go!
- Then move it, damn it.

373
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:52,172
All targets now bearing 2:15.

374
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,607
Stay with them.

375
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:55,809
No. Pull the drone.

376
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,650
Time for our visitors to leave.

377
00:22:57,653 --> 00:22:59,279
What are you talking about?

378
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:00,547
We find Kaniel Outis in Yemen,

379
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,416
and then rebels show up to take him out?

380
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,291
Was I supposed to think
that was a coincidence?

381
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,253
This isn't surveillance, is it?

382
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:07,955
This is assassination.

383
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,346
You're using me for some sort
of black work, aren't you?

384
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,360
This is way over your head, Tricia.

385
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:15,262
Stop asking questions.

386
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:19,284
If you don't get out of my
sight, I will blow the whistle.

387
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:21,112
Right now.

388
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:28,867
Would've been a hell of
a weekend in Connecticut.

389
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:38,151
It's playing with fire,

390
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:40,120
co-opting other agencies like that.

391
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:41,755
You think she'll talk?

392
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,058
Run it up the flag pole?

393
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:47,227
You got designs on killing her?

394
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:48,802
I'll kill you.

395
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,025
Relax, will you?

396
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,672
I'm getting pretty
tired of chasing Outis.

397
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:01,109
- Always being behind him.
- Me, too.

398
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:03,543
That's why I keep thinking
about all that time that he spent

399
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:06,446
in that gas station in Yemen.

400
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,282
ISIL on his tail,

401
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:10,596
and he just hangs in there?

402
00:24:10,627 --> 00:24:12,736
What was he doing in there?

403
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:29,503
The sun is directly overhead.

404
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,968
I can't tell which way is east, west...

405
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,205
We got to stop.

406
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:41,767
Hey, Ja.

407
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,257
You got a compass on that phone?

408
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,885
No signal.

409
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,987
We're flying blind.

410
00:24:47,022 --> 00:24:49,289
Completely blind.

411
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,362
But he's not.

412
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:58,865
We're leaving him a beautiful
set of tire tracks to follow.

413
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:00,600
Who the hell is this guy?

414
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,373
It's the guy who killed Sid.

415
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:09,176
Son of a bitch is like
a dog with a bone, huh?

416
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,378
You kill someone's spiritual leader,

417
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:14,047
they'll follow you to the
ends of the Earth, apparently.

418
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:16,216
Why is he stopping?

419
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:18,852
He's refueling.

420
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,287
Now?

421
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:22,956
He knows he's got more gas than we do.

422
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:25,592
All he has to do is follow our tracks.

423
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:27,761
Then wait until we run out.

424
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,583
There are four of us.

425
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,104
Let's just swarm him, take him out.

426
00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:32,272
Not out here.

427
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:34,096
Not with an AK-47.

428
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,435
We wouldn't get within
a hundred feet of him

429
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:36,803
without taking a bullet.

430
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,849
Then we got to outthink him.

431
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,144
What you gonna do with that, flog him?

432
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,437
Gonna transfer gas from
that tank to this one.

433
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,240
Almost all of it.

434
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:49,710
It's not gonna help.

435
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:53,182
It's gonna help this
one get to Phaeacia.

436
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,921
We pile into one vehicle?

437
00:25:54,957 --> 00:25:56,356
He still has more gas than us.

438
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:58,125
He can still follow our tire tracks.

439
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,094
That's why we leave a little
bit of gas in that one.

440
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,996
And make two sets of tracks.

441
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:05,984
He's gonna have to choose.

442
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,776
I got four rocks in my hand.

443
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:17,344
Three red, one white.

444
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:20,747
Get the red rock, get in
the Jeep, go to Phaeacia.

445
00:26:20,783 --> 00:26:22,916
Get the white rock,

446
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,552
deal with our friend.

447
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,689
Stick out your hand.

448
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Red.

449
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,698
Whip.

450
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,006
Come on.

451
00:26:48,844 --> 00:26:50,677
Red.

452
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,450
Linc.

453
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:01,822
No.

454
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:04,124
You knew the rules, Linc.

455
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:08,096
He's picking up again.

456
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,297
I'm not leaving you out here to die.

457
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:11,998
I have no intention of dying.

458
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,864
Anyway, you've got the harder job.

459
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:16,503
You've got to find Phaeacia
out there somewhere.

460
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:20,707
Leave tracks so I know how to find you.

461
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:44,498
Just one.

462
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:50,971
You want to play, you son of a bitch?

463
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:09,356
Now how the hell am I
gonna get out of this?

464
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,122
We're driving blind.

465
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:36,988
It's the same damn
thing everywhere we look.

466
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:39,257
There's something to be said for that.

467
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:40,891
Makes you use your senses.

468
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:42,126
Will you stop talking crap

469
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,610
and talk elephant in the room, please?

470
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,029
We just left Michael back there.

471
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,264
It's completely wrong.

472
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,367
I'm the last guy you
want to say that to.

473
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:50,701
Well, why are we doing it, then?

474
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:51,857
Because he said, that's why.

475
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,139
One thing you don't understand.

476
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:56,641
When Michael takes on the world,

477
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:59,210
the world always loses.

478
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,653
We've been looking the whole time.

479
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:43,888
That's the problem.

480
00:29:43,923 --> 00:29:44,989
What?

481
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:47,091
Stop the engine.

482
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,971
You hear that?

483
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:02,139
Birds?

484
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,508
Not just birds. Gulls.

485
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,312
As far as I know, gulls got
no interest in the desert.

486
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,039
They only got interest in the sea.

487
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,475
It means we're close.

488
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,044
All you got to do is follow them.

489
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:16,749
Maybe we got GPS after all.

490
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,616
Is this Phaeacia?

491
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,186
Phaeacia! Phaeacia!

492
00:31:58,153 --> 00:32:02,126
Omar! Omar!

493
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:05,362
Omar, Omar.

494
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:10,734
Hello.

495
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:20,411
You bring Omar car, but not Omar?

496
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:23,781
Omar had to go somewhere safe.

497
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,117
Because of the war?

498
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,553
Yeah, the war. That's right.

499
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:33,891
He told us to bring this stuff for you.

500
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:38,763
Also said you could
arrange a boat for us.

501
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:54,231
Back in the city...

502
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:56,734
I told you you would die.

503
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:03,627
We will both die out here, American!

504
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:35,973
Turns out that gas
station outside Sana'a

505
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,592
had a computer with Internet access.

506
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:41,228
He sent this image from Yemen. Why?

507
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,464
We're gonna find out as soon as we talk

508
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:44,832
to the guy he sent it to.

509
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:50,371
Blue Hawaii in Portland, Maine.

510
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:51,672
Think we got a snowbird?

511
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:54,675
I don't think that's quite it.

512
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:17,711
Welcome to Graceland.

513
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:20,367
Don't just stand there
and let the AC out.

514
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:25,183
Come on in.

515
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:32,212
What can I do for you fine folks?

516
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,620
Linc, where are your tracks?

517
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,708
Tracks, tracks.

518
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:14,265
No, no, no, no!

519
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,805
No, no. No.

520
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:28,994
Come on. Come on!

521
00:37:57,372 --> 00:37:59,973
Come on, Mike, come on.

522
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:02,442
Where are the tracks?

523
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:05,445
Where are the tracks?

524
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,183
This is for you. Look.

525
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:15,855
W-Wait, go easy, go easy.
Start with the small stuff.

526
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:19,058
Flowers, snakes, we'll move
onto the artillery later.

527
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:25,498
Fireworks okay?

528
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:26,633
Yes, yes, of course.

529
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:28,735
- It's okay to use?
- Thank you.

530
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:32,305
Omar was right.

531
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,108
This place.

532
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:38,945
It's like the rest of
the world doesn't exist.

533
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,763
I'll go check on Linc.

534
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:47,320
Hanging in there?

535
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:51,624
You're right. I shouldn't
have abandoned him.

536
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,824
If he doesn't find those
tire tracks by nightfall,

537
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:55,426
he never will.

538
00:38:57,673 --> 00:38:59,299
Where are you going?

539
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:00,600
Going out to find him.

540
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,267
You can't go out there at night.

541
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,036
You'll never find him.

542
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:06,873
Doing nothing's not an option.

543
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:10,209
I didn't say do nothing.

544
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,550
You got to have faith.

545
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:56,789
Sarah.

546
00:40:01,363 --> 00:40:02,929
Sarah.

547
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,909
Michael!

548
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:53,713
Michael!

549
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,453
Michael!

550
00:41:23,645 --> 00:41:26,713
That's it.

551
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,730
Michael.

552
00:41:43,765 --> 00:41:45,298
Thank God, you made it.

553
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,948
He poisoned me.

554
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:48,519
- What?!
- Antifreeze.

555
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,272
Need a doctor.

556
00:41:53,308 --> 00:41:54,708
Get the doctor now.

557
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,642
The doctor, the only
doctor is in Sana'a.

558
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:58,211
We can't go back to Sana'a.

559
00:41:58,246 --> 00:41:59,508
We just came from there.

560
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:01,814
It's 300 miles across
the friggin' desert.

561
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,450
We got to do something. He's dying.

562
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:06,816
Michael, Michael.

563
