1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,510
Now, remember last night
when you asked after Mama?

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,490
'Do they always have to do the
stock-taking at night, Arthur?'

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,650
I'm going to have a baby!

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,570
What business do you have
with the Russians, Tommy?

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,850
I've been to the factories

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,410
and the armoured vehicles
are in good condition...

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,690
"A factory break-in,"
that's what you said.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,060
When you go home, be sure to check
under your little boy's pillow.

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,380
'We can reach anyone.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,130
'Anywhere.'

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,650
'The priest is passing
information about the robbery

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,930
'to a Lloyd's underwriter
called Monkland.'

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,690
'Why would the priest pass
information to our enemies?'

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,650
'The complexities are your business.'

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,840
Now get me permission...

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,500
.. to kill the priest.

Watch out, John Boy!
He's got a strong left...

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,010
Arthur, John, Finn!

31
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,530
Come here!

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,570
All right, what is it?

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,210
This letter...

34
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
says that Dad's dead.

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,850
He was in Boston in a bar
called the Mickey Free.

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,890
Two men waiting in an alley.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,810
He was shot twice.

38
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,620
Who's Rosie Rice?

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,610
Some fucking whore.

40
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,610
She was a woman who took
the trouble to write to us.

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,860
She wanted us to know
that during the night...

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,020
.. while he was dying, he
asked for our forgiveness.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,250
The only thing he ever taught us
was how to kill and cut a stag.

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,170
- Finn, John, you won't remember.
- I remember.

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,160
Cannock Chase, he...

46
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,890
.. parked up at a pub called the Griffin.

47
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,650
He got drunk and sang Silver
Dagger about 100 times.

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,570
Yeah, one weekend.

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,780
One weekend he was like that.

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,800
The stag is to remember him.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,930
We eat.

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,050
And then we forget him.

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,050
No need to forgive him. Agreed?

54
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,250
John, I have to say this,

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,770
you can name your new
baby after him if you like.

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,340
No.

57
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,660
Arthur, I won't even ask.

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,490
So, his name dies.

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,640
It's been in the family for a
long time, but now it's gone.

60
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,820
Right. That's done. Fuck him!

61
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,770
Before we cook and eat,
there's some business.

62
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,140
Boys!

63
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,530
I wanted to say this out here,

64
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,520
cos I don't trust the maids in the house.

65
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,290
There's going to be a robbery.

66
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,570
I wish to confess...!

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,330
There's no confessional today.

68
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,250
The name's Shelby.

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,570
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

70
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,410
Today's a Holy Day...

71
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,210
Look, I came.

72
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,930
I made myself.

73
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,690
Have you been drinking?

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,820
I couldn't sleep.

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,540
I tried to get enough down me
to get myself to sleep, but...

76
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,490
I just do these night vigils
by myself, thinking...

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,280
How long since your last confession?

78
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,130
I don't remember.

79
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,210
Mrs Shelby,

80
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,330
do you have something to confess?

81
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,450
Do you know, it's actually Gray.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,940
My name is Elizabeth Gray.

83
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Do you think God calls
me "Pol" or "Polly"?

84
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,920
This voice calls me Pol.

85
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,420
You hear a voice?

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,610
Yeah. Like Bernadette heard a voice.

87
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,000
And what does the voice say?

88
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,880
"Murderer."

89
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
It says this to you?

90
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,180
It's in my head. Who else
would it be talking to?

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,970
And are you... a murderer?

92
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,960
If you're talking about the law, then...

93
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,330
.. yes.

94
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,680
- I'll be out in a moment, Peter.
- Yes, Father.

95
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,290
Are you saying

96
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,380
you want to confess to a murder?

97
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,560
No.

98
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,090
My confession is that I feel no regret.

99
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,080
He was a policeman.

100
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,770
He was a bad man,

101
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,360
he hurt me.

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,060
I do the things I do, so that
my son doesn't have to do them.

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,210
It's just the wiping away of
the shit from under your feet.

104
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,970
The taking of any human
life is a mortal sin.

105
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,130
No.

106
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,130
The UNJUST taking of a
human life is a mortal sin.

107
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,050
Look it up. Look who did it.

108
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,690
Moses. Samson.

109
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,330
Lord Kitchener.

110
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,770
Are you saying you took
the life of a policeman?

111
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,580
Oh, Father...

112
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,770
.. now there is another life to be taken.

113
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,490
If there is a voice telling
you to take a life,

114
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,570
you must ignore it.

115
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,690
The voice doesn't tell
me. The voice asks me...

116
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,450
It says, "Pol...

117
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,530
"does this way of excusing
a murder still work

118
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,520
"if the life that is going to be taken...

119
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,090
".. is a consecrated man?"

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,970
He's a man of the cloth.

121
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,940
He's a holy man.

122
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,890
What kind of holy man?

123
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,210
It's not fair.

124
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,770
They're off drinking and
shooting rifles as we sit here

125
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,850
and listen to the mugs swearing,

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,100
spitting on the bloody floor
for us to fucking wipe up!

127
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,370
Without men here, they'll be
like dogs pissing up the wall.

128
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,960
I was just saying it's not fair.

129
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,640
The men are down there like lords...

130
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,660
Esme, just...

131
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,650
.. get on with it.

132
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,330
I'm bloody five months gone!

133
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,130
Forgot the combination.

134
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,010
24-8-22.

135
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,690
How do you know the
paper cash combination?

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,290
Tommy talks in his sleep.

137
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,010
Shut up, Esme.

138
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,180
He's changed the combination.

139
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,890
You've put it in wrong.

140
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,610
No, I haven't.

141
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,290
Your hands are shaking.

142
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,010
And, actually, I am sleeping
with Tommy, OK? Now and then.

143
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,650
Because he wants to. Now and
then. When the mood takes him.

144
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,780
Except we don't sleep. It's hard
to sleep bent over a desk, isn't it?

145
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,380
Happy?

146
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,860
None of it's fucking fair!

147
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,090
It's two hours' work. Bit of
grease on your cuffs, that's it.

148
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,370
Tommy, should I really be here for this?

149
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,210
I've cleared it with Polly,
Michael. There's no way around it.

150
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,370
We need you to know...

151
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,250
Who the fuck wants to buy
27 stolen armoured cars?

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,530
- A foolish man. - And how much
is this "foolish man" paying?

153
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,090
150,000 --

154
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,250
cash, diamonds and sapphires.

155
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,220
So, that's 20 for you, Charlie.

156
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,370
Isiah, there's five to you.

157
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,770
The rest we take to America to
invest in legally acquired property.

158
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,650
Assets bought with
untraceable income resold

159
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,290
and the profits reinvested
to make sure it's clean.

160
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,290
And after that, I
suppose, the old business

161
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,090
will be like that stag hanging
up over there, right, Tom?

162
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,690
Well, with profits on this
scale we'll be in a position

163
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,050
to stop the off-track business for good.

164
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,570
Keep the pubs, stop the protection.

165
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,980
Horses for the sport,
race days for the lark.

166
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,050
I made a promise to Charles's mother.

167
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,130
I also made a promise...

168
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,020
to Linda.

169
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,770
I know.

170
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,930
I can see it in your eyes, man.

171
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,970
Part of the reason for doing this last job

172
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,740
is so you'll be set up when
you do decide to walk away.

173
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,760
Look at you, Arthur.

174
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,850
A man who wants to live a clean life,

175
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,380
here you are signing up for
the biggest robbery of all.

176
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,330
I have to hand it to you,
Tom, you're a smart man...

177
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,650
Are you in or out, Charlie?

178
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,490
Curly?

179
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,890
- Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.
- Oh, shut up.

180
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,090
- Bad luck...
- Shut up.

181
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,570
How do we know this foolish man
will hand over the diamonds

182
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,570
- when we're done?
- We don't.

183
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,960
But that's another business.

184
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,650
Right...

185
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
let's cook some meat.

186
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,770
Can't wait to part with
their money, stupid bastards.

187
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,960
It's all right, it's me!

188
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,410
Arthur said you'd be short-staffed today

189
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,890
- because they're on a works outing.
- Piss-up actually.

190
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,370
I brought sandwiches and
lemonade I made myself.

191
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,380
I'll make tea and empty ashtrays,
but I won't handle money or slips.

192
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,490
Arthur says what you do here
is illegal but not immoral.

193
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,170
Depends what time you get here, Linda.

194
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,810
And, anyway, I thought I would offer you

195
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,570
my physical and spiritual
support for your time of need.

196
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,290
Oh, Linda, if you want to be
a help, run up to the shops

197
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,330
and get me 20 Senior Service...

198
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,610
- Lizzie'll give you the change.
- No, I won't!

199
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,370
Actually, I'll use my own money, Polly.

200
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,210
And before you ladies decide
to find me so amusing,

201
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,770
- I have a message for you.
- Oh, God, no, Linda.

202
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,610
I've been to church already. Have you?

203
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,490
It's not a message from God, Polly.

204
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,370
It's from Jessie Eden.

205
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,890
Who's Jessie Eden?

206
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,650
She's the lady shop steward at
the Lucas Factory in Sparkhill.

207
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,410
"Lady shop steward"?

208
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,930
She's bringing all the female
workers in the spot-welding

209
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,250
and wire-cutting shops
out on strike for the day.

210
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,490
At protest at being made
to work on a Holy Day,

211
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,090
poor conditions, lack of holidays,

212
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,610
unsanitary lavatory provisions
and lower pay for female workers.

213
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,090
Apparently, all the female
factory workers in the city

214
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,090
are joining the protest in sympathy

215
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,410
and will walk out of their
places of work at 9am

216
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,010
to march on the Bull Ring.

217
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,850
All oppressed female workers welcome.

218
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,170
Them bastards down there shooting deer,

219
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,290
me five-months-gone sat
here like a pudding.

220
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,250
- Only one outside lavatory between
the lot of us. - Not consulted.

221
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,770
Bent over a fucking desk...

222
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,490
Ladies, I honestly believe
those who march on Good Friday

223
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,490
will have God on their side.

224
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,040
It's nine o'clock, ladies!
Open the fucking door!>

225
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,610
(Fuck it.)

226
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,930
I'm not in the mood today.

227
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,260
- Let's go to the Bull Ring.
- Hallelujah!

228
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,380
♪ Yeah, it's coming

229
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,820
♪ Out of this world

230
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,460
♪ Yeah, I'm lucky

231
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,300
♪ The lucky girl

232
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,860
♪ Hell... ain't... half... full... ♪

233
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,040
The foolish man?

234
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,130
Not quite.

235
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,860
♪ .. What a monster

236
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
♪ What a night

237
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,220
♪ What a lover

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,890
♪ What a fight... ♪

239
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,450
I'm sorry I came unannounced.

240
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,170
What do you want?

241
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,290
We need proof.

242
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,010
Proof of what?

243
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,330
You said the priest is a traitor.

244
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,330
We need to know how you know...

245
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,380
The proof is my word.

246
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,970
If he's involved, I'm
out. He needs to die.

247
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,290
Are you always so violent?

248
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,850
I killed a stag today

249
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,040
and it hurt me to do it.

250
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,130
But I treated it with respect

251
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,180
and the spare meat will go to poor people.

252
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,580
It will grieve me far less to put
a bullet in the priest's face.

253
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,060
Will you not sit when a duchess sits?

254
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm told you're part of
the deal. Is that true?

255
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,410
- The royal court in Tbilisi actually
worked very efficiently. - Oh, I see.

256
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,330
And it worked like this, eh?

257
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,850
There were lots of
corridors and small rooms.

258
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,490
Attics. There were no rules there.

259
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,810
Deals were done. Brothers gave
sisters, aunts gave uncles,

260
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,600
fathers gave daughters and servants.

261
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,040
It was my aunt's idea that I came alone.

262
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,400
She's in charge of this.

263
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,860
When there are no rules,
women take charge.

264
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,730
They understand that the power they have

265
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,490
come through silent agreements.

266
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,890
I've promised I will do everything
I can to make this plan work.

267
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,940
My aunt assumed you would
want me as part of the deal.

268
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,240
I will tell her she's wrong.

269
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,730
Tommy, you ain't gonna believe this, man.

270
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,530
I've just phoned the Garrison,
right. I just spoke to Billy,

271
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,570
he says Polly, Esme and Lizzie...

272
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,090
have gone on fucking strike(!)

273
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,210
They what?

274
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,010
They've gone on fucking strike!

275
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,650
Half of Birmingham's out.

276
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,290
The female half, they're all
out, every single one of them.

277
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,540
Quakers put 'em up to it.

278
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,650
Who's watching the shop?

279
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,370
Polly's locked it up.

280
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,490
See, Good Friday is one of
our best days for takings.

281
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,850
All the men get drunk.

282
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,890
The races are all fixed.

283
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,700
It's like picking apples off
the lowest branches, eh, John?

284
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,130
Hmm, yes.

285
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,720
Then your business is very easy.

286
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,610
Was Linda with them?

287
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,170
You know... Billy said that Polly
jumped in the fucking Bull Ring,

288
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,690
she's pissed out of her mind,
started going on about revolution,

289
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,130
screaming to the rooftops.

290
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,120
Was Linda with them?

291
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,130
Yeah.

292
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,290
Then it was Linda's idea.

293
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,410
Linda's a smart woman.

294
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
John...

295
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,850
.. there's a Bentley on the drive outside.

296
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,170
I want you to go out and
put a nail in its tyre.

297
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,970
It's Good Friday so
there'll be no garages open.

298
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,690
The lady will have to spend the night.

299
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,290
Then I want you and the
boys to all go home.

300
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,610
You take Charlie and put him with
Arthur and Linda for the night.

301
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,930
They can use the practice.

302
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,250
- You want me to put a nail...?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,890
- You heard me.
- I hear you.

304
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,250
All right.

305
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,100
Nice to meet you.

306
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,810
Why do you need to put a nail in the tyre?

307
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,740
I want it so neither of
us can change our minds.

308
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,840
We came back early.

309
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,090
Polly didn't finish the count yesterday.

310
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,570
Hmm, so you thought you
could take a tenner.

311
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,090
I thought I'd finish the count.

312
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,290
Esme, I've told you, stay off
the snow till the baby's born.

313
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,290
It does no harm, passes the time...

314
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,410
Knocks down the walls!

315
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,420
Listen...

316
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,650
I know you miss the travelling.

317
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,370
But it's going to be all right.

318
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,960
It's like being a hen in a coop!

319
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,980
Remember that house in Lichfield?

320
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,490
Eh? The one the bailiff
used to throw you out of?

321
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,610
Throw you in the ditch.

322
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm going to buy that fucking house.

323
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,530
Big as Tommy's with more land.

324
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,440
If you feel cooped up...

325
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,800
.. we'll take a wagon...

326
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,740
.. and camp out by the ditch.

327
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,500
How?

328
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,410
It's all going to change, Esme.

329
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,770
This is not your bedroom.

330
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,090
This is not where you
slept with your wife...

331
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,170
Do you ride horses?

332
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,570
No.

333
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,890
I would need to open my
legs in a public place

334
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,730
and that is not allowed.

335
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,570
Do you drink whiskey?

336
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,760
No.

337
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,410
It tastes like men.

338
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,130
I prefer wine.

339
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,770
Cars?

340
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,960
No.

341
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,410
So, diamonds are your only love, eh?

342
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,930
Sapphires.

343
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,840
They're just a currency.

344
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,140
Well, you know, if it was me
who had all them jewels...

345
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,280
.. I think I'd just sit with them...

346
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,930
.. look at them...

347
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,770
.. touch 'em.

348
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,730
Izabella does that sometimes.

349
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,450
Late at night.

350
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,330
I swear she puts one of the biggest
sapphires into her body for pleasure

351
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,480
and walks up the stairs to
breakfast with it still in place.

352
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,330
- And it stays in there all day? - Mm.

353
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,170
Wow.

354
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,460
What is your weakness?

355
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,300
Talking about duchesses with
sapphires inside of 'em...

356
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,210
I think already know your weakness.

357
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,530
I can get a fuck whenever I want, love.

358
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,780
Yes.

359
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,040
But I am a duchess.

360
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,290
And I'm under you like a horse.

361
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm like a telegram.

362
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,660
"A telegram"? I don't think
your English is so good.

363
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,660
Or maybe you should listen more
carefully to what I have to say.

364
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,760
I have a message for you, Mr Shelby.

365
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,250
As a duchess,

366
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,700
I can show you what is
possible for a man like you.

367
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,410
A man in a house like this.

368
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,290
Right now, you hide inside it

369
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,540
like a boy who's broken
in through the window.

370
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,980
Why do we come to a bedroom for this?

371
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,290
In your own house?

372
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,810
It's a loaded fucking weapon.

373
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,050
We could fuck by the fire

374
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,730
with the maids standing
to attention and watching.

375
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,530
- What can they do?
- Give it here.

376
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,930
Nothing. There are no rules for you.

377
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,850
Give me the fucking gun.

378
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,410
You have maids here. You can
bring a maid into the room.

379
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,370
What can I do about that? Nothing.

380
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,890
- Give me the fucking gun, now.
- You have power.

381
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,690
Everyone does what you tell them to do.

382
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,090
Your brothers, your soldiers.

383
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,130
- No-one can stop you...
- Don't point a fucking weapon at me.

384
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,330
I can be an actress.

385
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,580
Who do you want me to be?

386
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,650
- Your dead wife?
- That's enough! Give me the fucking gun!

387
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,410
If you don't like something,
you say stop and it stops.

388
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,610
Hm?

389
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,050
But you are afraid of it.

390
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,380
You break the law, but
you obey the rules. Why?

391
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,170
Did you know that madness sets you free?

392
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,220
Otherwise, we're just
peasants obeying the law.

393
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,300
There is madness inside your
head, too. I can see that.

394
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,620
Let a duchess show you something.

395
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,050
I emptied the chamber
except for one bullet.

396
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,490
No!

397
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,410
- This is the game
we used to play. - No!

398
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,890
Watch.

399
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,050
Do not fucking do this...

400
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,090
No...

401
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,290
Look at me.

402
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,970
Don't do this.

403
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,130
NO!

404
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,450
Give me that fucking thing!

405
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,410
It brings you alive! You won't try it?

406
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,850
No, I do not want to try!

407
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,130
And I do not want your
mad fucking Russian brains

408
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,850
all over me fucking walls!

409
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,850
I survive each time by the will of God!

410
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,570
Get to fucking bed -- NOW!

411
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,010
I already called a maid.

412
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,660
(Fucking...!)

413
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,850
You see?

414
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,640
You are afraid.

415
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,380
Like a boy who's broken
in through the window.

416
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,680
I need to educate you in how
to run a house like this.

417
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,250
Yes! Come down.

418
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,690
Pour us a drink.

419
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,810
Mary, go back to bed, please.

420
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,730
You go back to bed, please.
This woman is drunk.

421
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,210
- That's all right, sir. Should
I pour whiskey? - Yes. - No.

422
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,210
He will have whiskey...

423
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,130
He will have whiskey,
and I will have wine!

424
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,450
- Mary, go back to bed.
- There. In an old house like this,

425
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,450
- the servants expect it.
- Stop fucking talking.

426
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,850
Mary, go back to bed. Do as I say.

427
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,330
If there is a call after midnight,

428
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,530
the maid who comes in is the
one in love with the master...

429
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,850
This is NOT FUCKING RUSSIA!

430
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,820
(Please, Mary... Go back to bed. Eh?)

431
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,360
I know your weakness, Tommy.

432
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,380
It's freedom.

433
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,940
Madness.

434
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,380
Killing.

435
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
I am the first one...

436
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,730
.. who understands you.

437
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,640
I found her perfume.

438
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,690
Put it on.

439
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,330
What proof do you have
that the priest is a spy?

440
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,620
I told you, I give you my word.

441
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,980
Then kill him.

442
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,980
From now on, you must do
everything that you want to do.

443
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,850
There'll be two of us for
breakfast this morning, Mary.

444
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,290
She's gone for a walk by the river.

445
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,280
The lady left, sir.

446
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,170
Left? How?

447
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,090
She took your car.

448
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,930
She what?!

449
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,850
She was in a terrible hurry.

450
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,690
She said she had your permission.

451
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,730
She told David to go to the garage
to get a new tyre for the Bentley.

452
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,120
She said you could use that.

453
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,450
And why the hell would
you listen to her, eh?

454
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,700
The way she said it, sir.

455
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,970
How was she, Tom?

456
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,760
Talkative, yeah.

457
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,580
- I was fucking working,
all right? - Yeah.

458
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,890
From what she said when she
was out of her fucking mind,

459
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,330
I'm pretty certain the treasury
is underneath the house.

460
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,450
What have you got?

461
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,380
Our Ada got this from the British
Library using her scholar's pass.

462
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,530
She talked about her
aunt coming up the stairs

463
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,890
to have her breakfast in
the morning which means

464
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,850
it has to be in the building somewhere.

465
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,090
Wine cellar. Septic.

466
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,850
Kitchen cellar.

467
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,050
- And a tunnel under the river.
- They don't trust a soul in this country.

468
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,770
So, my guess is they've turned one
of the cellars into a strong room.

469
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,610
- Did you find someone, Arthur?
- Moss got me this.

470
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,010
Stephan Radischevski.

471
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,130
He's a kid from Greet, lives
in Cheltenham. Dad's a Russian,

472
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,330
he has dreams of owning a
pub but he's got a record.

473
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,810
- Breaking and entering. And
he speaks Russian? - Yeah.

474
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,970
Their butler drinks in a
pub called the Mason's Arms.

475
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,610
Get to him, tell him who
we are, offer him some money

476
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,570
if he gives the kid a job in the house...

477
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,090
Wait!

478
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,090
Talk to the kid, offer him one of
the pubs we took off the Italians

479
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,370
if he works in the house for
four weeks, keeps his ears open.

480
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,290
All right?.. Come!

481
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,890
The Executive Committee of the
Union of Bookies and Allied Trades

482
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,010
will see you now, sir.

483
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,250
I heard you were giving speeches
off the back of a wagon, Pol.

484
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,290
I can't remember a fucking thing...

485
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,650
Well, Moss tells me you were threatening

486
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,210
to burn down the Town Hall.

487
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,860
Oh, Tommy, we were having a laugh.

488
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,370
Actually, the crowd around me

489
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,010
was bigger than the
crowd around Jessie Eden.

490
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,410
Who's Jessie Eden?

491
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,810
She's too soft.

492
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,970
You're not going to break
the capitalist system

493
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,610
talking about separate
lavatories for women.

494
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,130
Who's Jessie Eden?

495
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,410
She's our new best friend.

496
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,450
Shop steward at the Lucas Factory.

497
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,890
A woman shop steward, I've heard of her.

498
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,840
There's a leaflet here if you
want to take a look, Tommy.

499
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,170
So, a separate lavatory -- is
that it? Is that what you want?

500
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,650
I don't know what you want.

501
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,810
You have to tell me what it is
that you want and then I'll know.

502
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,610
Actually, we want to know about
the robbery you're planning.

503
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,250
Not the factory robbery.

504
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,610
The other one.

505
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,130
The one you're not
telling the women about.

506
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,850
John has a big mouth.

507
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,970
No... Arthur's got a big mouth.

508
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,450
Arthur told Linda,

509
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,170
Linda told me.

510
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,450
- Polly?
- Read the leaflet, Tommy.

511
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,050
Ladies, why don't I
talk to Tommy privately,

512
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,530
then I'll report back to you faithfully.

513
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,290
You're not just going to take payment

514
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,890
from the Russians, are you, Tommy?

515
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,330
- You're going to clean them
out, is that right? - Esme!

516
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,290
So, what happens after?

517
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,170
When they come for us?

518
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,770
When I'm about to give birth?

519
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,970
Get out,

520
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,820
- get back to work.
- Esme, come on.

521
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,050
- Keep us posted, won't
you, sister. - I will.

522
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,240
(Fucking hell!)

523
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,930
So, Arthur tells Linda everything, eh?

524
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,450
She's stolen his soul and taken it
to a better place -- the suburbs --

525
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,300
where men are honest with their wives.

526
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,410
We can trust Lizzie...

527
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,890
Yeah, but I can't trust Esme.

528
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,770
I can't trust the fucking
Russians to pay me or the army

529
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,610
and I can't trust my own brother
to keep his fucking mouth shut.

530
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,540
Did you make progress last night?

531
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,900
Yes.

532
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,500
John said the girl looks like
Edna Purviance from the pictures.

533
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,160
Be careful.

534
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,490
She's an excellent source of
information regarding the location

535
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,050
- of the merchandise.
- Here we go...

536
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,460
You know, there's a general lack of
discipline in this fucking company!

537
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
She stayed the night.

538
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,210
I'm working, Pol.

539
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,360
I am working... for the
good of the company.

540
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,520
You're grieving.

541
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,730
And when you grieve, you make bad choices.

542
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,130
I know.

543
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,930
I did it myself.

544
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,090
Look, no more marches.

545
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,690
No more fucking politics.
They can kill us.

546
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,970
All right? Joke or no joke.

547
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,020
- Did you tell Arthur about the priest?
- I only told you.

548
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,050
Thanks for the burden.

549
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,530
You were correct not
to talk over the phone.

550
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,380
What did she say?

551
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,240
She said there was going
to be a killing. A holy man.

552
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,980
And she was with the Shelbys, was she?

553
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,330
I suppose you have something
to say about yesterday.

554
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,050
No.

555
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,570
It's something else, actually.

556
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,020
I believe Arthur has told you about
some business we're planning, Linda.

557
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,450
Oh, there's always business, Thomas.

558
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,050
And Arthur believes, when
this business is done,

559
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,970
it'll all be over.

560
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,220
Arthur believes you, but I don't.

561
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,650
Linda, the people who have
hired us to rob the factory

562
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,650
are very bad people...

563
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,090
They'll not pay us as they have promised.

564
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,970
So, on the night of the
robbery, we will take what's ours

565
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,210
- from their treasury.
- And a bit more on top for luck?

566
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,930
If you're saying you're going
to stop Arthur, I need to know.

567
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,250
That'll be Arthur's decision.

568
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,770
And your plan is still to reform him, eh?

569
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,120
- To the absolute degree
of redemption! - Mm-hm.

570
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,290
Well, Arthur will walk away
from this with £30,000.

571
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,170
We made a deal. And afterwards...

572
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,220
you and Arthur can begin your new life.

573
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,100
Did you say 30,000?

574
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,490
Arthur said the estimated total
proceeds would be 150,000.

575
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,970
- Estimated, yes.
- A third of a 150 is 50.

576
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,250
- Why a third? - For three
brothers. Finn is not yet a man.

577
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,570
- There are expenses.
- 25,000, you said.

578
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,930
As of last night, the expenses
increased. We need to dig a hole.

579
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,490
Arthur agreed to a plan
with a figure of 25.

580
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,010
25 from 150 is 125.

581
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,770
A third of that is...

582
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,460
£41,000

583
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,370
Sugar?

584
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,100
Yes.

585
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,810
Thank you.

586
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,090
So, you've worked this all out, I see?

587
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,610
Only in my head.

588
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,930
I haven't written it down.

589
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,660
Linda, are you saying...

590
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,650
.. if it WERE £41,000...

591
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,380
I've already told you,
that'll be Arthur's decision.

592
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,500
But I don't imagine he'll
accept less than 41.

593
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
- May I smoke?
- No.

594
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,330
So, I imagine you have
some plans for your 41,000?

595
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,250
Yes.

596
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,650
California.

597
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,290
For the child's health.

598
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,810
Away from the smoke.

599
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,930
We want to run a general
store on an Indian mission.

600
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,580
The Americans invites Quakers to
do good work with the Indians.

601
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,280
We've already sent our
papers and have been accepted.

602
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,930
Arthur Shelby as a missionary...

603
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,650
No, Arthur will run the store.

604
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,900
- Mm! - I will teach in
the school next to it.

605
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,850
Arthur will swim in the ocean.

606
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,650
I will be on the beach with a towel.

607
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,450
The open air and the sun will get rid of

608
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,440
all the nonsense in his head from France.

609
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,090
That's some plan.

610
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,210
As you know yourself...

611
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,810
.. the arrival of a new
life concentrates the mind

612
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,370
on practical things.

613
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,020
Amen to that.

614
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,610
When is the child due?

615
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,330
September.

616
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,320
When is the robbery?

617
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,700
June.

618
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,130
Then the timing's perfect.

619
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,490
We'll book our passage
through the Panama Canal

620
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,540
the day after the 41,000's paid to Arthur.

621
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,260
Did we agree 41,000, Linda?

622
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,040
I heard nothing to the contrary.

623
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,450
Word association. Right now.

624
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,730
- Oh, God! I hate this game.
- It's Freud. It's terribly fashionable.

625
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,570
I'd rather you put on
that music that I hate.

626
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,930
- Are we going mad in
here, do you think? - Yes.

627
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,890
We shouldn't have drunk
red wine with the cake.

628
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,530
And I believe your vow never
sleep with another man

629
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,170
is a good one.

630
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,290
Good for the painting.

631
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,520
It's not a vow, it's just...

632
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,500
I think when men want
sex, they become hilarious.

633
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,850
Like a dog when you pick up a lead

634
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,570
and he knows he's going for a walk.

635
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,850
May I respectfully point out

636
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,740
that, so far, you haven't
even picked up the bloody lead.

637
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,140
There.

638
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,920
That's the look.

639
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,170
Imperious.

640
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,180

You idiot, you nearly killed him!

654
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,650
I told you we needed him fully conscious.

655
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,370
We need to stop using
soldiers who've been in India,

656
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,610
- they hit too hard.
- Not fucking hard enough!

657
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,410
Hey, Mr Shelby! Hey!

658
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,250
I heard about your plan to kill a holy man

659
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,010
from a voice in a confession.

660
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,800
Can you hear us?

661
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,330
.. Grace...?

662
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,720
Shelby.

663
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,460
Why were you attempting
to kill Father Hughes?

664
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,570
Maybe we should wait until
he's fully conscious.

665
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,130
I have a dinner appointment.

666
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,570
Hey, Shelby...

667
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,810
wake up.

668
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,010
Eyes front.

669
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,360
Mr Shelby, were you trying
to kill me, were you?

670
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,730
For passing information...

671
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Fuck. He knows.

672
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,730
Where am I?

673
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,810
You are among the Odd Fellows.

674
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,170
Please count from ten to one.

675
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,820
Ah, fuck you.

676
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,010
Whatever else you might have forgotten

677
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,020
about last night, remember this...

678
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,690
I am passing on information
to the Soviet Embassy

679
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,650
on the instruction of Section D.

680
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,930
It's part of a bigger picture.

681
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,490
You explain to the Russians

682
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,930
that you were mistaken about me

683
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,920
and you apologise to me in front of them.

684
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,930
A threat to your sister
was evidently not enough.

685
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,660
You do as we say or we will take your son.

686
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,930
Hear this.

687
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,490
We will take your son.

688
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,810
We can do it at any moment.

689
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,780
We have people in your life.

690
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,500
You will make your apology
to me tomorrow night...

691
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,820
.. and you will repair
the damage you've done.

692
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,900
Or you will never see your son again.

693
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,690
Sir, I don't understand...

694
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,410
I don't understand why, as
a former soldier yourself,

695
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,330
you have sacked all the
former soldiers on the staff.

696
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,930
It means there's only one
man left in the household.

697
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,730
Mary, I want it so that Charles
is never left on his own.

698
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,320
Understood?

699
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,610
Sir, I should call a doctor.

700
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,730
There will be some men
coming down from Birmingham.

701
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,690
And you put them up here in the
house, you put them in the front

702
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,130
- and back of the house and you feed them...
- Why are they needed, sir?

703
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,690
I bought a cursed sapphire
into this house, Mary.

704
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,010
And now I'm paying for it.

705
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,040
And I don't know what to expect.

706
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,570
But neither do my enemies.

707
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,810
Tell David to bring the car
round. I want to go to London.

708
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,800
- Sir...
- And... get me some tea, Mary.

709
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,380
Yes, sir.

710
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,570
- 'Hello?'
- Yes, Arthur...

711
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,020
'Tommy?'

712
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,250
They want the robbery to be sabotaged.

713
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,450
They don't give a fuck who gets hurt.

714
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,410
- 'Are you OK, Tommy?'
- It's a bigger picture now.

715
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,210
- 'What?' - Did John make a
list? - 'Speak clearer, Tom.'

716
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,690
- I said, "Did John make a list?"
- 'John Boy! John!'

717
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,890
Right...

718
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,650
'Gypsies and kin only. Yeah.'

719
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,290
Good.

720
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,690
'Tommy, can I ask you why?

721
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,140
'Tommy?'

722
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,460
No, Karl. I told you.
Go and play in there.

723
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,500
Hello?

724
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,370
Ada?

725
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,360
It's me, it's Tommy.

726
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,930
Ada, I need you to....

727
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,530
I need you to speak to
one of your comrades

728
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,460
and get me a meeting with someone
from the Soviet Embassy... Embassy...

729
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,850
Tonight. Your place.

730
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,440
10... 10pm.

731
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:50,210
It seems that Mr Shelby
was given bad information

732
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,930
by an informant who was also
in contact with the underwriter

733
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,140
who, as we know, is in
the pocket of the Soviets.

734
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,260
- Wine, Tatiana?
- A little.

735
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,290
Bad girl.

736
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,180
Sorry I'm late, I, um...

737
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,940
There was a body on the line.

738
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,610
Drink, Mr Shelby?

739
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,250
No, thank you.

740
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,650
It was drink that caused
half this trouble.

741
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,660
I have come here to apologise.

742
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,890
I have already explained
that you now realise

743
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,210
that your absurd allegation
against me was false.

744
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,130
Indeed.

745
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,370
And that your base nature made you rash.

746
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,300
And that now, once again,
our plan is back on track.

747
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,020
When a child in my care commits a sin...

748
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:25,370
.. first of all, he
confesses, as you just did.

749
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,050
And then, I instruct
him to perform penance

750
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,370
in a manner of my choosing.

751
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,850
As a child, you went to church?

752
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,130
Yes.

753
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,850
You remember the Act of Contrition?

754
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,740
Good. Do you remember the
words of the Act of Contrition?

755
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,540
Yes.

756
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:51,840
As your penance, I would
like you to recite it now...

757
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,100
.. in the presence of our associates.

758
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,210
Go away.

759
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,180
Ah...

760
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,090
Oh, my God, I am heartily
sorry for having...

761
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,610
Instead of "God", say my name.

762
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,320
Since it was me you offended
with your false allegation.

763
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:29,140
Father Hughes, I am heartily
sorry for having offended you...

764
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,610
.. because of your just punishment,

765
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,600
but most of all because they offend you.

766
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,380
Father Hughes, who is all good
and deserving of my love...

767
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,900
.. I firmly resolve to...

768
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,690
.. with the help of your
grace, to sin no more

769
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,610
and to avoid all near occasions of sin.

770
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,410
Very good.

771
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,730
Thank you.

772
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,060
Amen.

773
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,730
And now that we are a
united band once more,

774
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,250
perhaps we could order some food?

775
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,940
I'm sorry, I'm not feeling
well. I have to go. Goodnight.

776
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,180
Mr Shelby...

777
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,170
My God, Tommy...

778
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,450
- Are they here?
- Yeah.

779
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,210
- Do you have cocaine?
- No.

780
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,700
Tommy?

781
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,140
Tommy, this is the Special
Advisor to the Soviet Consul.

782
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,620
Members of the British establishment..

783
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,770
.. and exiled White Russians are
planning to rob armoured cars

784
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,570
from a factory in Birmingham.

785
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,250
We know about the robbery.
We have an informant...

786
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,050
Your informant is working for them.

787
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,040
They want you to know about the robbery.

788
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,960
Your informant is working
to their instruction.

789
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,700
- Why would they want us to know?
- They want you to...

790
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,130
They want you to stop the robbery.

791
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,850
They want you to commit a
violent act on British soil.

792
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,290
Tommy, do you want water?

793
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,610
A violent act on British...

794
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,450
.. to force the British Government
to break off diplomatic relations.

795
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,760
That's the game.

796
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,520
The robbery in Birmingham
was just the bait.

797
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,010
Why are you telling us this?

798
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,100
Because my family are the
ones who will be sacrificed...

799
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,060
.. if you decide to blow up the train.

800
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,460
The Consul wants to know who you are.

801
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,850
He's Tommy Shelby.

802
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,250
You can take his word.

tell them I have a fractured skull,

concussion and internal bleeding.

- I think I may have haemorrhaged.
- Tommy! - Ada, go on.
