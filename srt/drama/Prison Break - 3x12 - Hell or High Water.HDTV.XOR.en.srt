1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,410
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,670
We leave tonight

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,930
Got no electricity
and no running water.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,760
A hundred bucks a month.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,220
Deal.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,420
Ready?

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,560
I hope this works,popi.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,620
That book
of yours-

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,040
It's just a bunch of
coordinates in there, right?

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,290
Among other things.

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,910
Does your father still have
that phone number I gave you?

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,160
I think so.

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,380
Well, tell him to call my brother.

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,520
Papa, make that call for my friend.

15
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,660
The American?

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,310
If time runs out, and I don't have
the second half of those coordinates,

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,830
LJ and the senorita stop breathing.

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,460
You have a warrant
out for your arrest

19
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,150
You're not going anywhere

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,650
Just wish there was
another way to do this.

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,510
To save LJ without
handing whistler over.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,810
Look,man,that's
it- There isn't.

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,130
What is that?

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,380
Michael: Kesslivol.

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,530
When heated to a certain
degree, it eats through steel.

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,810
As soon as Linc cuts
the power we go.

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,430
What about the backup generator?

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,031
There's a lag from when the power cuts

29
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,790
out to when the generator kicks back in.

30
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,720
How long a lag we talking about?

31
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,750
30 seconds.

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,810
We only have 30 seconds. Go.

33
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,890
Everything's dark

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,500
Move it, move it.

35
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,500
Come on.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,100
Let's go.

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,470
Okay, letís go.

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,220
Not yet.

39
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,590
We have to go now.
We're running out of time.

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,280
Trust me.

41
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,570
Stop, or we'll shoot

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,560
Stop!

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,910
Stop!

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,020
Whistler: Come on, mate.

45
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,860
What's the holdup, Michael?

46
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,580
Just a little bit longer.

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,510
STOP!

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,410
STOP!

49
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,450
What happened?

50
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,400
They got caught.

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,740
- What's going on?
- Shut up.

52
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,550
What, what...

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
Don't try anything.

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,310
Man: Bring 'em over
here! Bring 'em over here!

55
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,820
You- On your
knees, get down!

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,350
Don't move, or you're like
your friend over here.

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,860
What's going on, Michael?

58
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,910
We have an escape in progress.

59
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,410
We have an escape

60
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,740
This sure as hell better work out.

61
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,890
For everyone's sake.

62
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,280
Status?

63
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,950
No other prisoners have been found

64
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,570
You two, on your feet.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,700
Bring them inside

66
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,600
Where the hell's Scofield?

67
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,540
Shut it.

68
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,110
If Scofield doesn't get caught,
he could still fix this mess.

69
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,440
What do we do now?

70
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,790
- The lights are on, they know about the escape...
- What's your plan, Michael?

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,420
This is the plan.

72
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:02,740

Prison Break Season03 Episode12

74
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,580
Michael, how the hell is
getting caught your plan?

75
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,629
You told them they had 30
seconds to get across when

76
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,630
You knew the generator was
going to kick in sooner.

77
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
I must have miscalculated.

78
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,610
We've got about ten
minutes till the sun rises.

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,160
And there are soldiers out there, okay.

80
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,780
They'll take count.

81
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,650
- We got to get back to the yard.
- We're not going anywhere.

82
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,750
It's almost time.

83
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,560
What do you think you're doing?

84
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,440
Nothing. It's just probably my wife.

85
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,881
You know, we live a couple miles away

86
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,550
And she must have heard the sirens, so...

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,690
You can make your calls
when I'm done with you.

88
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,930
What else you got?

89
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,630
Sucre?

90
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,710
I'm not here. Say what you got to say.

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,840
Sucre,where the hell are you?

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,470
We're counting on you to be here!

93
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,750
If you're not there, weíre dead, man.

94
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,180
Now call me ck,please.

95
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,100
Put these with his personal effects.

96
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,220
What's going on out there?

97
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,670
Some prisoners tried to escape.

98
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
Did they get out?

99
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,100
They got caught.

100
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,820
One of them got shot pretty bad.

101
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,510
Sucre? Sucre?

102
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,750
No, it is Alphonso Gallego.

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,610
You where you need to be?

104
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,340
Yes.

105
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,790
I left the suburban on
the side of the road.

106
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,370
The keys are in the wheel well.

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,700
Are they still there? Check 'em out.

108
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,760
They're here.

109
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,160
Good, good.

110
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,710
You will be here too, on the 312?

111
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,170
Yeah,yeah,the 312.

112
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,220
See you there.

113
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,980
These all the men?

114
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,630
Si,senor.

115
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,590
Tell me, how did you get out there?

116
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,080
How did you get out there?

117
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,630
Don't want to tell me?

118
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,070
How did you get out there?

119
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,910
A tunnel.

120
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,340
Where?

121
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,840
Under Lechero's room.

122
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,940
Show me.

123
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,660
How much longer?

124
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,650
It's just a matter of seconds now.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,050
Michael?

126
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,120
The door.

127
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,480
I don't know the combination.

128
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,750
Then improvise.

129
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,830
This is insane.

130
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,110
Let's go.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,750
Vamanos.

132
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,940
Hurry!

133
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,500
Nothing

134
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,530
You're sure?

135
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,590
Absolutely

136
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,090
Son of a bitch sold us out!

137
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,490
Are you certain?

138
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,420
Absolutely

139
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,740
It's empty

140
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,830
It wasn't me! It was Scofield!

141
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,790
He did this!

142
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,840
Just heck the yard- Him,Whistler,
Mahone and that basketball kid-

143
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,740
None of 'em will be there!

144
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,750
Did you finish the count?

145
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,790
Just finishing now, Sir

146
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,670
Sir... we are four short!

147
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,110
This is Captain Solo.

148
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,570
Other inmates are missing.

149
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,220
I want a post-And-Protect around
the entire perimeter of the prison.

150
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,860
General, we see no one.

151
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,220
Are you sure there's
prisoners out here?

152
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,729
You won't find the prisoners here in

153
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,390
No-Man's-Land because
they're already gone.

154
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,430
Faster! Weíre losing them.

155
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,960
This way.

156
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,810
He just started shouting.

157
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,990
To get off the bus

158
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,670
Off the bus now!

159
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,800
Get off the bus!

160
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,460
How would you describe the suspect?

161
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,590
Well, he was tall.

162
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,170
More than six feet.

163
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,600
What nationality?

164
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,570
American

165
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,850
He spoke English

166
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,030
Come on. Move it! Go!

167
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,500
If you saw him would you recognize him?

168
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,980
Yes, of course

169
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
What's wrong?

170
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,910
My ankle! I've torn it apart!

171
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,860
Come on.

172
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,170
It's not that far. Help me up!

173
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,900
Mr. Whistler, weíll drag you by
your hair because we got to go!

174
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,630
I'll slow you down. Just go!

175
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,250
Just leave me!

176
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,660
We both know that's not an option.

177
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,300
It's only a quarter
of a mile to the beach.

178
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,690
If we stick to the bush, we can make it.

179
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,600
Alex, a little help?

180
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,990
Go. Come on!

181
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,290
We only have a few minutes.

182
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,670
We got soldiers right behind us.

183
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,330
Cops as well.

184
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,110
We got what we need?

185
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,170
Yeah,we got what we need.

186
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,010
What do we need?

187
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,710
Always picking up the strays,huh?

188
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,250
This way.

189
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,406
Listen, Michael,if you think
the company's just going

190
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,620
To let you swap me for
your nephew, youíre mistaken.

191
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,390
Shut up.

192
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,270
Once they get hold of
me, theyíre gonna kill all of you,

193
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,980
And I don't want Sofia
caught in the crossfire.

194
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,880
Listen,just let me go.

195
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,560
I'll contact them, I promise.

196
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,710
I'll say I'll turn myself
in once I know LJ's safe.

197
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,970
Hey,you got no say in
what happens to my son!

198
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,400
You got it?

199
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,040
We don't need a suntan.

200
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,320
We need to get lost.

201
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,500
The military patrols all
the roads around the prison.

202
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,560
You didn't consider a boat?

203
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,880
They show up here and we're ten yards
off the shore, weíre target practice.

204
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,220
We need to be invisible.

205
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,820
Five guys, four tanks.

206
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,830
Sucks for you, Mahone.

207
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,380
Lincoln and I will share.

208
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,400
Toss your boots in the box.

209
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,340
Yeah?

210
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,920
Tell me you have him.

211
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,220
Yeah,I got him.

212
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,630
Where's my son?

213
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,880
With me.

214
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,170
Put him on the phone now.

215
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,870
Say something.

216
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,900
I'll be there soon.

217
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,640
Just don't hurt anyone.

218
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,850
You happy?

219
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,640
You have 20 minutes to meet me
in panama city where we agreed.

220
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,280
We'll be there.

221
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,220
Hey,I need to put my book in there.

222
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,050
The book?

223
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,580
My book!

224
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,710
It must have fell out of my pocket.

225
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,380
I thought you already
figured out the coordinates.

226
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,790
Well, I didn't memorize them!

227
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,700
I wrote them in the book!

228
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm pretty sure they're
still looking for us, guys.

229
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,130
It's gone.
Now get the damn water.

230
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,660
Would you please?

231
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,090
It's a picture of my son.

232
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,360
Can you,uh...

233
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,650
Put it in the bag?

234
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,580
Screw you, Mahone.

235
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,720
Let's go.

236
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,790
Mcgrady.

237
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,260
Mcgrady?

238
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,260
I don't swim so good.

239
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,030
What?

240
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,430
Too bad,kid,you're getting wet.

241
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,840
Get in.

242
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,790
Look it's all right.

243
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,490
We'll share tanks.

244
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Just hold onto me and we'll switch
off back and forth, ten seconds apiece.

245
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,300
Come on. Let's go.

246
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,000
Over here!

247
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,530
Towards the beach!

248
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,790
I could've sworn

249
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
They were headed in this direction

250
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,530
Give me the binoculars

251
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,950
Do you see any boat?

252
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,120
Not a one...

253
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,490
...where the hell are they?

254
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,300
Where is Scofield?

255
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,610
I don't know!

256
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,320
He didn't tell me nothing!

257
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,880
Where is he running?

258
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,650
I told you, I don't know nothing!

259
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,540
Well, thereís only one way
to make certain of that.

260
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,540
I want men covering five kilometers

261
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,980
Both East and West
and Check-Points

262
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,340
On all
coastal roads-

263
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,600
Every vehicle is to be searched!

264
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,440
Contact the General...

265
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,100
I need more men
sent to me at once

266
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,700
This is General Mestas.

267
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,160
The men will be sent.

268
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,920
And, Sojo, I expect every prisoner
to be returned to Sona today.

269
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,530
Dispatch fourth platoon.

270
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,140
Hey,hey,look,man,this
is getting crazy here.

271
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,660
Look, Iíll plead guilty
for ignoring the warrant.

272
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,390
I'll show up for the court hearings.

273
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,130
Let me get out of here.

274
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,700
You know, with this alarms and the guns,
they're making me a little nervous.

275
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,930
Until things settle in,
you go nowhere.

276
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,840
So just sit tight.

277
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,740
Fourth platoon goes to
Cabrillo beach Ahora.

278
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,050
There!

279
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,010
Where is he?

280
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,980
Where is he?

281
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,510
Where is he?

282
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,850
Where's who?

283
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,280
Sucre with the boat.

284
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,510
Just hold on. You all right?

285
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,100
- You all right?
- Yeah.

286
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,980
Come on, hang on...

287
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm all right, Iím all right.

288
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,540
Lincoln: We're not gonna make it
out here too much longer, Michael.

289
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,540
Sucre is coming. Be patient.

290
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,520
Excuse me?

291
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,570
Boat 312,why is it still here?

292
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,360
Wasn't someone supposed
to take that out today?

293
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,300
Someone reserved it, but
they never picked it up.

294
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,820
Sojo: Yes, general.

295
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,030
Mestas: I want an update.

296
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,080
Still no sign of them.

297
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,250
Nothing on the coast.

298
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,490
I think they may have
gone back into the jungle.

299
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,560
The jungle?

300
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,910
You asked me to send men to the beach!

301
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,410
Capitan...

302
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,450
Just a moment, general.

303
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,520
General, I think we have
to call the coast guard.

304
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,490
Come on!

305
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,960
You all right?

306
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,580
My legs are starting to cramp.

307
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,490
You gotta hold on, buddy.

308
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,790
We're not gonna last out
here too long, Michael.

309
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,600
Where's your friend, Michael?

310
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,080
Sucre's not just gonna
abandon us out here, all right?

311
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,550
He'll show, heíll show.

312
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,340
Man: The coast guard is
launching four vessels...

313
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,340
They've been in the
water this whole time.

314
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,690
They're probably at the
bottom of the ocean by now.

315
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,990
Well, look it here!

316
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,140
Looks like we have more than a drunk
and disorderly warrant for Jorge Rivera.

317
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,320
Failure to pay child support.

318
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,960
What kind of man doesn't

319
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,370
Take care of his family?

320
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,990
Not a good one

321
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,050
Please let me go...

322
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,880
They are waiting on me

323
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,600
You're not going anywhere.

324
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,790
Once we're done processing
you, then you can go.

325
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,130
Until then, sit tight.

326
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,570
I should have heard
something by now.

327
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,330
I've lost all damn track of them.

328
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,490
Burrows will eventually reach
out if he wants his son back.

329
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,160
Yeah,well,that might
no longer be an option.

330
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,000
Look! Look!

331
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,580
Sucre!

332
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,610
Sucre!

333
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,390
He's supposed to be flashing a light.

334
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,430
He's not responding, Linc.

335
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,030
The coast guard.

336
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,720
They found us.

337
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,270
Papa!

338
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,760
What's wrong?

339
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,860
Michael...

340
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,820
Michael?

341
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,841
If I don't get another
chance, I want you to

342
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,990
Know that I appreciate
everything you've done.

343
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
You're welcome.

344
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,260
Come on, son.

345
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,260
How'd you find us?

346
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,535
You never showed, and you said
you'd be coming from the southwest,

347
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:29,510
So I took a chance.

348
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,300
What do you think
happened to Sucre?

349
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,240
I don't know, but we gotta move.

350
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,170
He's done

351
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,000
What about him?

352
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,320
He's even worse off

353
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,210
Guess that just leaves one.

354
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,660
Stand up

355
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,700
Move

356
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,760
Move those feet!

357
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,740
Get up.

358
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,270
Let's go.

359
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,900
I saw the boxes in the back, so I took your car
- Figured you'd need to change.

360
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,680
How's the ankle?

361
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,440
Whistler: I need to get off my feet.

362
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,193
All right,guys,get changed
and make sure

363
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:43,980
you don't leave
any wet clothes behind.

364
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,680
Listen,uh...

365
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,840
Thanks for everything.

366
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,350
Thank you for my boy.

367
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,500
I hope you get your son back, too.

368
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,800
Yeah,me,too.

369
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,940
Come.
We need to get back to the truck.

370
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,680
Michael?

371
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,080
Thank you.

372
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,950
Go be with your family, Luis.

373
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,680
Yeah?

374
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,420
Where the hell are you?

375
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,510
We ran into some trouble.

376
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,320
We're-We're downtown panama.

377
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,000
No, Lincoln, you're not.

378
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,010
We got company.

379
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,140
How'd they find us?

380
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,130
You have them?

381
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,250
We're right on top of them.

382
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,810
Hold on!

383
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,310
They must've gotten to Gradyís
dad and bugged this car.

384
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,330
Or one of us.

385
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,200
Then why didn't they find
us when we were in the water?

386
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,370
It's because the water
was blocking the signal.

387
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,330
What you do with that stopwatch
that Gretchen gave you?

388
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:35,970
- Oh,my god.
- Give it to me

389
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,540
I didn't know. I didn't know.

390
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,310
Okay, hold on, guys.

391
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,720
All right, it's time to use
this rig to our advantage.

392
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,000
Go! Here we go!

393
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,130
Uh... this is, like, a
dead end right here.

394
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,320
Stay in the car, then.

395
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,930
This way!

396
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,340
Why don't you just
tell us what you know?

397
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,440
Then you won't wind up being beaten
half to death like your friend.

398
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,230
I know less than you do.

399
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,800
Which is hard, considering
how dumb you are.

400
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,799
I want everything you can find on the

401
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,890
men who escaped and
I want it immediately.

402
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,900
What the hell is he still doing here?

403
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,010
He has an outstanding warrant.

404
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,300
Unless it's for murder

405
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,860
Get him out of here!

406
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,660
Go see the clerk about your stuff.

407
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,300
They're barricaded.

408
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,110
What are you doing? Get back!

409
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,900
All that gunfire and they
only hit your car three times?

410
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,050
Son of a bitch...

411
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,660
Listen, Linc,you've done a great
job getting us out of the frying pan,

412
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,500
But it'll be for nothing if
we end up back in the fire.

413
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,590
There's no fire, just an
exchange, then I'm done with you.

414
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,990
You think it's that simple?

415
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,060
Yeah,they want you,
they get you.

416
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,790
It's that simple.

417
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,850
This is not about me.

418
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,090
It's about Sofia and your son.

419
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,110
Michael- Tell him- Tell him these
people won't just let us walk away.

420
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,970
We already had this discussion
back at the beach, James,

421
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,220
And you were out voted

422
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,590
You're making a terrible mistake.

423
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,080
People might die because of this.

424
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,750
Take off your pants.

425
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,900
Excuse me, Senor?

426
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,040
I said take off your pants.

427
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,203
If I knew you boys
partied in Sona like this,

428
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:11,530
I never would have tried to escape.

429
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,780
One cell phone.

430
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,550
One wallet.

431
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,280
And some change.

432
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,310
There were some papers.

433
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,710
A boat-rental agreement.
I need them.

434
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,370
I'll check the drawer.

435
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,240
Take them down.

436
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,350
Come on,now,hombre.

437
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,280
There's no need to refry my beans.

438
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,930
Always with the wise talk.

439
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,170
Never saying anything
we want to hear.

440
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,640
Now, all I want to hear
are your screams.

441
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,840
No, no. No,no,no,no,no. Listen.

442
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,810
I told you, I don't know nothing.

443
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,740
No,actually,I don't know nothing.

444
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,600
I swear. I swear I don't.

445
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,060
But he does!

446
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,280
He knows everything!

447
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,750
Not so fast, amigo.

448
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,020
A little help.

449
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,990
What is this place?

450
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,420
Where we're gonna make the
exchange- On our terms.

451
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,020
There's a service road out back,
just in case we want to get lost.

452
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,730
Yeah,assuming you're still alive.

453
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,820
You still talking?

454
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,790
- Linc?
- Yeah.

455
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,730
Gotta commend you on
that boom box trick.

456
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,010
Very sophisticated.

457
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,660
You steal that one from home alone?

458
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,130
You fell for it,bitch.

459
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,480
All right, listen.

460
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,580
If you wanna see your son...

461
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,840
You're not calling the shots anymore.

462
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,610
As long as I have LJ...

463
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,070
As long as I got Whistler, youíre
gonna do exactly what I say.

464
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,860
You got it?

465
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,350
Now, listen up.

466
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,951
We're at an abandoned
warehouse five miles

467
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,580
down the road from the
barrios interchange.

468
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,950
Be there in 20 minutes with my son.

469
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,300
And once I get there?

470
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,670
So now we wait.

471
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,470
Yeah.

472
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,890
Think this'll work?

473
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,730
Yeah,it'll work.

474
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,000
- You, me and LJ.
- Yeah.

475
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,240
I just hope it works
out for Mcgrady,too.

476
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,300
Oh,no.

477
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,200
They must have closed all
the roads out of panama.

478
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,520
Papa, what do we do?

479
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,510
You gotta turn around, papa.

480
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,310
I can't go back to Sona. I canít.

481
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,520
I don't care what he says.

482
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,430
He's a convict!

483
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,670
He's a piece of garbage.

484
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,560
I don't know anything about
this Michael Scofield guy.

485
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,540
Guard: General.

486
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Here is everything we have
on the escaped prisoners.

487
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,300
You don't know Michael
Scofield,is that right, Jorge?

488
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,850
Yes.

489
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,730
You sure you don't want to
change your story, Fernando?

490
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,950
What's this!

491
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
WHAT'S THIS!

492
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,200
This should help make
you a decent brace.

493
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,290
Thank you.

494
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,720
Should be able to see
them coming from up here.

495
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,240
You know,Linc...

496
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,740
You did great.

497
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,480
Thanks.

498
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,630
I just want LJ back, you know?

499
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,170
It's just a matter of time.

500
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,640
Yeah.

501
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,470
Considering I don't have
a pony in this race...

502
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,200
I guess this is where I say goodbye

503
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,640
You think you can just walk out
of here after what you did to us?

504
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,490
What you did to my dad?

505
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,220
No.

506
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,188
I was gonna kill you at
the beach, but I didn't

507
00:40:51,189 --> 00:40:53,270
Want to do anything that
was gonna get us caught.

508
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,490
You shot my dad in the back.

509
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,170
I'm gonna give you the
courtesy you never gave him.

510
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,610
Now Turn around.

511
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,800
Turn around.

512
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,960
Linc, think about what you're doing.

513
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,330
I was told to choose between your
family and mine. That was my option.

514
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,900
I chose mine.

515
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,190
Go to hell.

516
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,720
Linc,you don't have to do this.

517
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,800
Mahone!

518
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,180
My truck!

519
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,510
Stop!

520
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,820
What are we gonna do now?

521
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,776
