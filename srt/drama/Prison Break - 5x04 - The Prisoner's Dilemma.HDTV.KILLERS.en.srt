1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,880
I called earlier about a missing
U.S. citizen in the Middle East.

2
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:04,049
How are you, Sara?

3
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:06,318
I wanted the State Department, not you.

4
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:08,918
Any chance Poseidon will
just let us kill her?

5
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,522
I've learned some things

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,624
about who it is we're
apparently both looking for.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,693
You think Michael's in Yemen?

8
00:00:14,728 --> 00:00:17,796
- We're gonna get you out of here.
- I don't know who you are.

9
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:21,133
Your brother was using
this shop for his escape.

10
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,434
We're here for passports.

11
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,240
Figure we got a day to
get out of this hole.

12
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,961
We're still getting out. All of us.

13
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:34,550
_

14
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:36,328
_

15
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:38,619
Poseidon put us in
here to get Ramal out,

16
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,065
but then he abandoned us.

17
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,036
Ramal's Poseidon's guy, not ours.

18
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,882
Our friend told me about the escape.

19
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,385
He will betray you.

20
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:47,960
When those lights go black,

21
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:50,229
we're gonna disappear from
this place like ghosts.

22
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:51,530
I can't get it open.

23
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:53,332
Help me out.

24
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,968
You pull my brother up first.

25
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,708
Don't shoot.

26
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:08,480
_

27
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:14,887
- Hey.
- Hey.

28
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:16,722
How are you feeling?

29
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,624
Body is fine.

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,058
My head is

31
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:22,427
trying to figure out how
to get those passports

32
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:24,029
we couldn't get last night.

33
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:26,765
For you, those kids.

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
Well, that's something you shouldn't

35
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:29,835
be worrying about right now.

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,570
You should rest up.
We're gonna need you.

37
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,138
I can rest when I'm dead.

38
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:37,009
Well, that's what I'm worried about.

39
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:39,878
Didn't know you worried.

40
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:42,014
About the right things.

41
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:46,368
Your brother.

42
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:49,988
He make it out?

43
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:52,558
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:57,338
Sheba, do you mind if I
borrow Linc for a second?

45
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:59,264
- Yeah.
- Okay.

46
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,633
Please get some rest.

47
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,066
Listen. We got to start talking

48
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,568
about leaving the country.

49
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:16,802
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:19,238
I spoke to my friends at the mosque.

51
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:21,607
ISIL is taking
neighborhoods by the hour.

52
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,509
If they cut off the
route to the airport...

53
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,479
I'm not leaving Michael.

54
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,448
If they cut off the airport,
no one is getting out.

55
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,417
Not you, me, Sheba.

56
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,188
As much as it kills me to say...

57
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,859
we can't risk all of it for...

58
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,127
just one man.

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,424
You're right.

60
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:45,664
You can leave.

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,299
But I can't.

62
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:50,469
Get that family to the
airport as fast as you can.

63
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,804
I'll work something out.

64
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,607
Mr. Burrows?

65
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,409
I wanted to thank you
for saving my daughter.

66
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:00,505
And offer you something in appreciation.

67
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,648
I might have a solution
for how to get your brother

68
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,183
out of that prison.

69
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:09,088
Before the city goes to hell.

70
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:14,159
_

71
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:17,658
You hear that?

72
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,364
That was the closest one yet!

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,499
100 yards!

74
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,967
Just when you think
it couldn't get worse

75
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,602
locked up in a Porta Potti,

76
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:27,273
they start dropping 2,000-pound
bombs on the Porta Potti.

77
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,975
Whip. Keep it together, please.

78
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,120
The escape artist is nervous.

79
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:38,284
You should be, too.

80
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,320
Those artillery strikes,
they don't discriminate.

81
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,489
The difference is I have faith.

82
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,157
Allah will deliver me.

83
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:46,892
What do you have?

84
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,195
Ja!

85
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,347
Ja, are you there?

86
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,197
I'm here.

87
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,333
Whip's right.

88
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,468
The strikes are getting closer.

89
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,803
I pity you.

90
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:59,438
I triumph either way.

91
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,877
Either I will be in paradise
or Allah will save me.

92
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:04,279
You,

93
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:06,312
you're just going to die.

94
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:13,179
ISIL has broken through the checkpoints.

95
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:14,553
They're coming into the city.

96
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,855
These uniforms are like targets

97
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,324
- on our backs.
- ISIL isn't here yet.

98
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,159
The government says
it will push them back.

99
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,894
You out of your head? This is happening.

100
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,662
Sana'a is falling.

101
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,675
They're going to retreat.

102
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,971
I've seen that look before in the army.

103
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,373
Men who will do anything
to save themselves.

104
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,609
And how do we save ourselves?

105
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,044
ISIL takes this prison, we'll
be the first they slaughter.

106
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,813
When they take this prison, it will be

107
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,249
to liberate their leader, Ramal,

108
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,950
but if when they get here,

109
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,919
we have him with a knife

110
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,454
to his throat,

111
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,122
then we call the shots.

112
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,824
And we might just live.

113
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,124
Whip, I got a Hail Mary.

114
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,343
- That a prayer or a plan?
- Plan.

115
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,197
I left something the
last time I was in here.

116
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,865
Let me guess, you got a contingency.

117
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,101
They lock me away in
a box for four years.

118
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,402
I'm not just gonna sit there.

119
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,478
It's a long shot, but
it might get us out.

120
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:07,408
The infidel still tries to escape.

121
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,874
The desperate rat.

122
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,542
The desperate rat's gonna light you up

123
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,810
once we get out of here,

124
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:13,712
- you bugged-eyed freak.
- Whip.

125
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,148
Whip! An "S." Is there an "S"

126
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,449
carved in your wall chest high

127
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,084
in the corner?

128
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,796
Come on, come on.

129
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,155
That's not it.

130
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,257
I'm not seeing anything.

131
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,605
I'm not seeing it.

132
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,136
Ja, it's got to be you.

133
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,329
Come on. Tell me you got
an "S" carved in your wall.

134
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,463
It's our last chance.

135
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,517
No.

136
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,900
It's not here, no.

137
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,151
That's because I have it in my cell.

138
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,489
My armies of the caliphate

139
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,558
are coming closer.

140
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,794
The moment they reach this place,

141
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:05,931
all of you will be put down
like the dogs that you are.

_

144
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,093
All right, Sara.

145
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,230
Our friend, Poseidon, has surfaced.

146
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,143
Good God.

147
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,179
Another ISIL attack.

148
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:14,800
They're ripping the city apart.

149
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:17,064
They're animals.

150
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:18,953
I've been a bureaucrat my whole life.

151
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,504
Hated it.

152
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,290
Corruption, backslapping.

153
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,732
But today, maybe some
good will come of it.

154
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,727
I went to grammar school with this boy

155
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:28,396
named Ibrahim.

156
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,074
All the years later,
he's a federal judge.

157
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,810
You, uh, saying this judge can help us?

158
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,579
I called him a few
hours ago and told him

159
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:36,981
about your brother's case.

160
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,881
_

161
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:42,453
Redecorating, I see.

162
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,789
Just readying for the
coming change of seasons.

163
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:49,560
Luxury is something the
Wahabbists frown upon,

164
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,795
so luxury will stay behind closed doors.

165
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,579
You should flee the country.

166
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:54,998
I'm a survivor, you know that.

167
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,934
I thought Mr. Burrows could perhaps

168
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,469
help with his brother's cause.

169
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:01,138
Ah, yes.

170
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:05,876
A full pardon from the
Supreme Judicial Council.

171
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:08,445
But you will have to uphold
your end of the bargain,

172
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,615
Jamil.

173
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:15,986
German engineering. 77,000 miles.

174
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,938
Five liter, seven speed, V10.

175
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,624
It will be a welcome bit of luxury.

176
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,294
Behind closed doors, of course.

177
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:26,230
Best of luck to both of you.

178
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,498
I really appreciate this.

179
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:28,866
Thank you.

180
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:30,968
It's already done.

181
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:35,706
It would've been left behind anyhow.

182
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:38,888
May both of our families

183
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:41,311
get safely out of Sana'a tonight.

184
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,245
We can't just sit here and die.

185
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,651
You-you got a window
like this one, right?

186
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:49,044
Maybe we can pry it.

187
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:50,854
It's too small, reinforced.

188
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,614
Built into the rebar infrastructure.

189
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,169
You got people on the outside, right?

190
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:55,660
And they're gonna try and get us out.

191
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:56,994
They were supposed
to meet us at the shop

192
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,328
last night and we didn't show.

193
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,496
We can't just quit

194
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:01,798
- and let Poseidon beat us.
- Ramal?

195
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,101
There's a way out if we work together,

196
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:06,203
but escape has to start from your cell.

197
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,239
I'm no longer interested.

198
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:11,904
The only thing left
for you to do is to beg.

199
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:14,845
Beg that I might let you
live once my armies came,

200
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,346
if only as a slave.

201
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,482
I've been a slave for
the last seven years.

202
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,051
I won't do it anymore!

203
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,447
I will miss you when you're dead,

204
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,416
but only for a minute.

205
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:29,617
Then you will be forgotten

206
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,888
by both time and the world.

207
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,424
Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.

208
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,058
I have the weekends and...

209
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,393
Well, no, I have the weekends

210
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,149
and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.

211
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:42,351
Why would I want that?

212
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:45,332
Yeah, nobody does.

213
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:51,672
Uh-huh.

214
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,808
No, that's okay, Cindy.

215
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,817
Mm-hmm.

216
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,084
Yeah, that's fine.

217
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,319
What other days?

218
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,842
What other days do you want?

219
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,810
Actually, you know what?

220
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:16,158
I don't want to discuss this now.

221
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,998
No, we'll talk about it later.

222
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,834
Bye.

223
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,638
Of all the things

224
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,474
that mystify me in this world

225
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,209
since I've been released,

226
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:31,812
is that kale is the rage.

227
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,013
Kale.

228
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,382
Theodore Bagwell.

229
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,518
Thing that mystifies me equally

230
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,053
is seven years ago,

231
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:40,941
you exonerated Michael,

232
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,189
Lincoln, all of them,

233
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,216
except me.

234
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:48,095
- Really?
- Yes!

235
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,230
That's why you're here?

236
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,177
Because I didn't exonerate you?

237
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,333
A murderer,

238
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,768
a sexual predator a dozen times over.

239
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,170
"Was" is the key word.

240
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm a man moving toward the light now,

241
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,249
and the light's beckoning me.

242
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:02,911
I just don't know who's
pulling the strings.

243
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,246
But Sara says it's you.

244
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,715
Oh, Sara put you onto me?

245
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,149
Okay.

246
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,985
I don't know who the bigger idiot is,

247
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,253
you or her.

248
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,730
I was helping her.

249
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:17,992
You were hacking her phone
and sending those people

250
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,527
after her... Don't...

251
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:20,929
lie.

252
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,132
Now...

253
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:28,068
how about you pour me one of
them nasty little kale jobbies,

254
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,205
and tell me what's all this got
to do with Scofield and myself,

255
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,506
who your friends are,

256
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,041
who you are... I want to see

257
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:36,210
the true face of who's
pulling my strings

258
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,879
once and for all.

259
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,018
You have two visitors in the lobby.

260
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,253
Tell them I'll be right down.

261
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,368
Hey.

262
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,541
I got this, Grace.

263
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,648
They're in the city.

264
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:20,616
What are you doing?

265
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,855
What do you think I'm doing?

266
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:23,924
Don't run, you dog!

267
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:25,593
Don't run!

268
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,895
It is happening. Be ready.

269
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,714
This pardon better get him out of here.

270
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:38,064
We don't have much time...
we have to get to the warden.

271
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,007
What's going on?

272
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:47,481
They're abandoning the
prison. That's why Ibrahim

273
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,816
gave us that pardon.

274
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,136
He knew it was worthless.

275
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,453
You and C-Note get the
others to the airport

276
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,555
as fast as you can...
There's maybe one flight out.

277
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:55,847
Save two seats.

278
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,291
All right?

279
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,659
What are you going to do?

280
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,261
I'm gonna get my brother.

281
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,898
Mustapha!

282
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,919
Back up!

283
00:13:23,957 --> 00:13:26,073
Back up. Anyone comes at me, dies.

284
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,699
- Understand?
- You think you can shoot all of us?

285
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,279
Anyone else want to play the lottery?

286
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,281
Huh? You're filth.

287
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,483
I'll let ISIL sort you out.

288
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,235
Mustapha!

289
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,457
Mustapha! Mustapha, wait!

290
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,025
Don't lock me in here!

291
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,460
You coward.

292
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:47,527
Mustapha, please.

293
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,229
Coward!

294
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,677
- I need to get in!
- I need to get out!

295
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,575
- Well, give me the key.
- I don't have the key.

296
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,844
You passed the guy who does.

297
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,746
Stay back! I don't want to shoot you!

298
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,591
The guards are gone!

299
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:50,390
They're abandoning their posts!

300
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,393
We're gonna be free!

301
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:56,096
No. We're not free.

302
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:58,532
Things just got a lot worse.

303
00:14:58,567 --> 00:14:59,933
Push the gate open!

304
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,401
Stop! Stop!

305
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:02,643
What are you doing?

306
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,938
- We have to get through the gate!
- If ISIL controls the city,

307
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,474
like they say, it will be
a prison out there as well.

308
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,937
We will be persecuted,

309
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,181
as we have been in here, only worse!

310
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:12,383
At least there's a chance!

311
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:13,447
You want a chance?

312
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,245
Our chance lies in there,

313
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:16,675
in solitary.

314
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,233
Our bargaining chip.

315
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,686
We get Abu Ramal!

316
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,222
We negotiate passage

317
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,889
out of the country.

318
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,458
No, it's madness.

319
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,027
Come on. If we work together,
we can push open the gate.

320
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:28,729
Is that you, Princess?

321
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:30,998
It is you. We remember this one!

322
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,500
- Right? We remember him!
- Please...

323
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,535
Friend to Kaniel Outis,

324
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,838
the man who would not
lend my brother a hand!

325
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,706
The man who killed my brother,

326
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,045
as far as I'm concerned, right?

327
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,344
- We are going to go in there and get Abu Ramal!
- No! Please!

328
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:45,979
- No! Please!
- And when we are there,

329
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:50,317
I am personally going to
slice Kaniel Outis' throat.

330
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:53,353
And you are going to be the one
who's going to help me do it.

331
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,888
- No!
- You sent him!

332
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,156
Take him!

333
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:57,691
All of you!

334
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,139
Will you stay here?

335
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,495
And let ISIL slaughter you?

336
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,663
Or will you stand with me?

337
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:04,931
And fight!

338
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,304
Doesn't sound very promising!

339
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,506
Ramal,

340
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,071
you want to rethink helping us?

341
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,475
Escape has to start

342
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:16,308
from your cell!

343
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,178
All you infidels can go to Hell!

344
00:16:18,213 --> 00:16:20,280
We are in Hell, Ramal.

345
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:22,115
Question is do you want out?

346
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,438
Smash through the door!

347
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,126
Tell me what to do.

348
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,307
Come on, come on...

349
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:02,269
_

350
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,148
_

351
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,648
_

352
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,110
_

353
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,670
_

354
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,632
_

355
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,200
_

356
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,046
I'm not hacking anybody's phones.

357
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,572
You're so off base on this,

358
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,588
you have no idea.

359
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,915
Am I?

360
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,350
Y-Yes.

361
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,321
That is terrible,

362
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:35,960
by the way. What is that,

363
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,958
an act of contrition?

364
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:40,227
Like a hair shirt?

365
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:42,796
Torture yourself with kale
to make up for your sins?

366
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,764
I don't have any sins anymore, man.

367
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,000
- That's you.
- How about the sin of deceit?

368
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:48,568
Hmm?

369
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:51,838
A kale-drinking man named
Kellerman by the light of day,

370
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:54,689
a murderous CIA rogue
named Poseidon at night.

371
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:55,775
Poseidon?

372
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:57,818
His eyes light up.

373
00:17:57,821 --> 00:17:58,853
She was right.

374
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,615
Oh, you think I'm Poseidon?

375
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,384
Okay.

376
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,116
Are you mixed up with Poseidon?

377
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:06,920
Oh, hell,

378
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,155
we got to go old school with this?

379
00:18:08,157 --> 00:18:09,189
Is that what you want?

380
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:11,057
- T-Bag snapping fingers.
- Ow!

381
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,426
That's very... you just gave
me something to work with.

382
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:14,794
Poseidon? Poseidon.

383
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,331
I'll tell you about Poseidon.

384
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,769
I mean, he's one of those myths
you hear about in the system.

385
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:25,238
He's an operative so untouchable,

386
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,741
so deep, you couldn't find
him with a nuclear sub.

387
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,305
Hence the nickname.

388
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:31,645
And how does this involve me?

389
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,947
What's he want with Michael?

390
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,984
Ramal, listen closely.

391
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,486
The brick with the "S," it's loose.

392
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,954
You got to remove it.

393
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,200
It's a spoon, string.

394
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,564
- How?
- A string a day from

395
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,171
my uniforms for four years.

396
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,680
A spoon a guard overlooked
one time in a thousand.

397
00:19:00,876 --> 00:19:02,317
There's a water pipe above you.

398
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,311
Hook it, pull it down.

399
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,079
Do it!

400
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,424
Hey. Let me get this straight.
This is getting him out?

401
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:18,992
It's getting us all out.

402
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,962
This is a two-cell job, mine and his.

403
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,129
That's why I couldn't pull it
off when I was in that cell,

404
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,598
because the guy across from me,

405
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,715
the guy in this cell,
wouldn't cooperate.

406
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,368
We have to work together.

407
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,603
Come on!

408
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,304
- No.
- Cross!

409
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,039
I'm not working with you.

410
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:35,809
No. No.

411
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:38,411
Come here! Come on, sweetheart.

412
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:41,381
Show them your pretty
face! Come on, get up here!

413
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,916
Look! Stop what you're doing

414
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,279
and tell Kaniel Outis
I will kill the girl!

415
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:48,655
Take him!

416
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,124
Come on! I'm not through with you yet!

417
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,941
They're beating the crap
out of Sid. They'll kill him

418
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,628
- unless we surrender.
- If we surrender,

419
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:56,468
they'll kill us. They only want Ramal.

420
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:59,767
Our best chance of saving
Sid is getting out of here.

421
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,135
Make them forget about
him, start chasing us.

422
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,572
Okay, good.

423
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,741
Now pick it up. String the cord

424
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:08,808
and pull it through.

425
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,311
Come on, come on!

426
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:12,312
Yeah!

427
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:15,315
I will kill the girl, I swear it!

428
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,483
No!

429
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:23,857
I will say it again,

430
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:26,910
there will not be any
killing in this prison!

431
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:28,461
Not on my watch!

432
00:20:28,497 --> 00:20:30,449
This is completely insane.

433
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,402
It's a freakin' Mexican
soap opera out here!

434
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,621
Ramal, don't stop. Don't start thinking.

435
00:20:36,624 --> 00:20:39,406
Don't pin your hopes on one guard.

436
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:40,607
Walk away!

437
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,909
Hide in the cell block!

438
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,283
What are you doing?

439
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:49,180
The prison is done, brother.

440
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,482
For the love of God!

441
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,986
For the love of God,
a man seeks justice.

442
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:55,389
In everything he does, at all times!

443
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,428
Now, everybody, back in the block!

444
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,777
There are no prisoners
and guards anymore!

445
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,428
You realize that, right?

446
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:03,563
If ISIL gets in here,

447
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,266
we are all the enemy.

448
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:07,767
Sinners,

449
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,836
deviants...

450
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,405
and those that locked up their leader.

451
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:16,242
You will be the only
guard that they catch.

452
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,011
The noble one.

453
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:21,614
They will behead you for it. But...

454
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,650
if we work together,

455
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,251
we get Ramal,

456
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:26,920
we have a bargaining chip.

457
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,355
I will see to it

458
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,192
that you will get out
with the rest of us.

459
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:34,678
Just give me the keys to solitary.

460
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:36,581
I don't have the keys.

461
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,298
I know you do.

462
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,767
Join us

463
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,702
and you will live.

464
00:21:42,738 --> 00:21:44,771
I give you my word.

465
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:46,439
I don't have them.

466
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:52,412
Kill him!

467
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:57,784
But you have something much better, huh?

468
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,189
Move. Move!

469
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:04,858
Oh, my God.

470
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:07,694
Oh, my God. They killed the guard!

471
00:22:07,795 --> 00:22:10,095
They got his gun. They're coming for us!

472
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:18,961
Got to make this count, Ramal.

473
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,797
String that fishing
pole through that slot.

474
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,432
That's right.

475
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,800
Now, you can remove the pinions

476
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:26,325
on my door... the hinges.

477
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:27,890
There are two of them.

478
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:31,106
No way.

479
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,143
What are you doing?

480
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,238
What are you doing?

481
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,472
I'm doing mine.

482
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:41,441
We don't have time for this, Ramal!

483
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:51,832
I'm telling you, it's a two-cell job,

484
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,486
that's the point. That side of the wing

485
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,255
is new construction. The pinions

486
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,123
are covered in the hinges...
You can't pull them.

487
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,525
This side is original.
They're open, loose.

488
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:01,427
You want me to free you?

489
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,286
Yes, and I, in turn, free you
with those keys, down there.

490
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,466
Why would I trust you more
than the madman out there?

491
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,868
'Cause you just heard
what his word is worth.

492
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:15,675
Kick it.

493
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,513
This is it. It's all
about whose word you trust.

494
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:22,916
I promise you... you release me,

495
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,051
I release you.

496
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,400
Little more, little more.

497
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:50,343
Thank God. Come on.

498
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:52,845
Okay, the bottom.

499
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,669
Yes!

500
00:23:55,841 --> 00:23:57,408
Come on,

501
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,285
- come on. Come on.
- Come on.

502
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,521
Yes!

503
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,622
Almost there!

504
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,700
Yes.

505
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:15,201
Come on.

506
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,037
Got to hurry up, come on.

507
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,875
Yes. Yes, come on!

508
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:34,654
Where are you going?

509
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:35,922
Open my door.

510
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,426
I'm getting the hell out of here.

511
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,829
Open my door.

512
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:46,065
- Leave him, man, you crazy?
- Open my door.

513
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,468
Once we're outside these walls, we need

514
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:49,936
safe passage out of the country.

515
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,437
Even now, you negotiate.

516
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:56,109
We work together or we both die.

517
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,746
You have my word.

518
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:01,347
Open the door.

519
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:11,124
We got to go now.

520
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:21,868
No, no!

521
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:28,975
Mr. Tic Tac.

522
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:31,044
What are you doing here?

523
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,245
You gonna fight ISIL men?

524
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,946
Get out of here, kid, hide!

525
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,149
- This is no place for you.
- You gonna fight ISIL men?

526
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:38,051
Yes.

527
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,921
Listen very closely, all right?

528
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:44,624
American! American!

529
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:45,958
American!

530
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:47,461
_

531
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:48,141
_

532
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,382
_

533
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,724
_

534
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:04,514
_

535
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:14,420
- You go to Bubble Gum Man now?
- Yeah.

536
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,892
Thanks for your help. Here, take that.

537
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:22,328
Get somewhere safe, okay?

538
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,401
Mr. Tic Tac goes to Bubble Gum Man!

539
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,541
Ramal... don't want to kill you.

540
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:37,844
Just your friends. You understand?

541
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:40,405
What are we doing in here?
This is not helping us.

542
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:41,608
You're gonna make a phone call

543
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:43,470
so you can hold up your end of the deal.

544
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:45,384
There's an auto body
shop off Nashwan plaza.

545
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,886
I want vehicles there, full tanks of gas

546
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:48,721
so we can get to the border, all of us.

547
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:49,822
I'm not going with you to the border.

548
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,181
You don't have a choice.

549
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:53,191
We're gonna ride to the
border, then say sayonara.

550
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,392
You're our insurance.

551
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:55,809
Ramal, I don't want to kill you.

552
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:56,996
You understand?

553
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,765
Or would you rather be
their insurance? Take it.

554
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,946
I want to know what he's
saying. He could be screwing us.

555
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,574
He's screwing with us, all right.

556
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:17,196
We just need to screw with him first.

557
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,317
Where's Ja?

558
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,086
I don't know.

559
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:25,717
- Oxycodone...
- Hey, we got to peel.

560
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,692
Percocet...

561
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,661
Come on, you Japanese
junkie son of a bitch.

562
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:30,496
I'm Korean, you Canadian monkey.

563
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:33,299
Canadian? Oh, that's really funny, Ja.

564
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,808
You'd split my sides if we
weren't about to be slaughtered.

565
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:38,104
Hey, remember what Woody Allen said.

566
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,106
What did he say?

567
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:41,741
"I don't mind dying.

568
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:45,077
I just don't want to be
around when it happens."

569
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:46,345
Hey, come on.

570
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,447
We need you, okay?

571
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,749
What's the holdup?

572
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,516
_

573
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,042
Scofield's a dead man.

574
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,431
He's tangling with Poseidon.

575
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,650
I see what you're doing here.

576
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:21,347
Talking Poseidon in third person,

577
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:22,682
like you're not him.

578
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:24,050
State Department has been

579
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:25,718
looking for Poseidon for years,

580
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:28,248
you idiot. He's a rogue CIA operative.

581
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:29,250
Nobody knows who he is.

582
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:31,092
- Here we go.
- I know it's a little

583
00:28:31,095 --> 00:28:33,186
above your pay grade
being a common criminal.

584
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:34,890
I mean, we're talking
about a single man.

585
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,162
Right? A hawk

586
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,564
who apparently doesn't
like how the White House

587
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,199
goes about foreign policy,

588
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,268
and decided to take
matters into his own hands.

589
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,073
Not with armies, not with invasions,

590
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:45,791
but by getting a single person killed,

591
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:48,074
by getting a single
person elected to office,

592
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,677
by getting a single person
released from prison.

593
00:28:51,713 --> 00:28:54,213
Prison, like the one in
Yemen, where Michael's at.

594
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:55,648
You want my guess?

595
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:59,452
It's Abu Ramal that Poseidon wants free.

596
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,254
Guy I seen on the prison telly.

597
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,490
Wait, I thought the CIA was
supposed to kill terrorists,

598
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:06,670
- not release them.
- Poseidon is no longer CIA.

599
00:29:06,682 --> 00:29:08,182
He doesn't report to anybody.

600
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,296
He just pursues his own ideology.

601
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,565
Okay, for instance, listen.

602
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,834
Let's say you think Russia and Iran

603
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,370
are having too much
influence in the Middle East,

604
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,671
and you don't think Washington

605
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:20,473
is getting the job done.

606
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,774
You free Ramal.

607
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:24,343
Sure, he's an Islamic radical nut job,

608
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:26,479
but he will fight Iran
and Russia for you.

609
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,135
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

610
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:31,317
And what's so shrewd about Poseidon

611
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,985
is he does it all without a network,

612
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,621
which is why he's so hard to find.

613
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,290
One man can pull strings like that?

614
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,725
One man manipulating
a handful of others.

615
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:42,461
Abu Ramal is a monster.

616
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:45,464
And there's a spot in
Hell reserved for him,

617
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,968
but the hottest spot is
reserved for Poseidon,

618
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:51,729
because he is letting Ramal
loose on the world again.

619
00:29:51,732 --> 00:29:54,440
Those men, they have
the blood of thousands,

620
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:57,043
thousands on their hands.

621
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,845
Compared to them, you and
me are a couple of angels.

622
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,483
- "Angels"?
- Mm-hmm.

623
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,985
You find out who Poseidon is,

624
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,987
and how Scofield is wrapped up in it,

625
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:10,456
maybe your fate...

626
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,391
is to be a patriot.

627
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,529
What...?

628
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:25,638
Go. Go!

629
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,464
There's a time for everything.

630
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:58,149
911? I need help... now.

631
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:05,612
They're going over the top.

632
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,353
Let's go.

633
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:24,337
Go, go, go, go, go!

634
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:26,272
This way!

635
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,736
It's locked!

636
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:35,648
It's a dead end.

637
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,817
No, no, no, no. No. No, no, no, no.

638
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,118
Ramal?

639
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:44,624
Hide! Hide!

640
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:47,922
I don't want to kill
you! Just your friends.

641
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:50,954
- You understand?
- Sid, you're alive?

642
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:53,666
- We'll see about that.
- Ramal?!

643
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:55,542
Let's hand the son of a bitch over.

644
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,111
Won't work.

645
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,547
They'll gun us down anyway.

646
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,916
Can't just wait here and die.

647
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,386
Your game is up.

648
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:05,988
Come out!

649
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,736
Anyone

650
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:24,673
who gets between me and Abu Ramal dies.

651
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,476
You understand?!

652
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,149
Where is Ramal?

653
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,149
Tell me now!

654
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,622
There's a boy.

655
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,759
Ithaca, New York. Mike Scofield.

656
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,695
If I don't make it out of here alive,

657
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,797
tell him his father loves him very much.

658
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,799
"His father"?

659
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,640
If I don't smother that gun,

660
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,175
they'll kill us all.

661
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,122
Move back!

662
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,629
Move back! Go!

663
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,864
Let me through!

664
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:08,666
Michael! Michael!

665
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,853
Michael? Michael!

666
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,272
Poseidon sent you?

667
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,807
Where's your friend?

668
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:39,975
He's long gone.

669
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,777
Back door.

670
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:44,539
Locked from the inside.

671
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:45,480
He's in here.

672
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,615
Find him.

673
00:34:48,862 --> 00:34:50,886
I was you once, killing for a lie.

674
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,297
Now you're what?

675
00:34:53,316 --> 00:34:54,789
Dying for the truth?

676
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,793
It's human nature to find stuff out,

677
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:00,562
so you will.

678
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:03,165
Or she will.

679
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:06,493
And then the lie has to kill the truth.

680
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:10,005
Which one of you is gonna die ne...?

681
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:34,534
Time to get scarce.

682
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:36,605
Hey!

683
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,872
What did he say to you?

684
00:35:45,008 --> 00:35:46,816
Nothing.

685
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,633
Auto shop's a few blocks up.

686
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:20,902
And your men better be coming.

687
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:22,070
They will be there.

688
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,471
Where is Ja?

689
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:29,441
Ja,

690
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:31,679
- what are you doing?
- I'm starving, man.

691
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:33,714
You know how long it's
been since I seen fruit?

692
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:35,580
You're stopping to eat?

693
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:36,982
Are you high?!

694
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:38,884
Don't come at me, man.
You're not my mama.

695
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:41,915
You know what? You're done.

696
00:36:41,918 --> 00:36:43,088
- You're gone.
- What?

697
00:36:43,123 --> 00:36:45,857
- Wait.
- I said, walk! You're a liability!

698
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:49,286
Wait. Wait. You said you'd get me out,

699
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:51,489
all the way home. That was the deal.

700
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,028
Ramal, this man follows us,

701
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,397
tell your men to shoot him.

702
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,438
Gladly.

703
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:12,939
_

704
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:31,269
Where'd you go, Michael?

705
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:34,940
Where'd you go?

706
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,086
_

707
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:02,602
_

708
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:07,935
There you are, my men.

709
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:10,662
Seize these dogs so that
we can put them down.

710
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,082
_

711
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:17,516
Ramal.

712
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,554
Ramal, what are you doing?

713
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:23,481
You thought you tricked me?

714
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:29,155
Take the long way around
while your friend...

715
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:33,826
gets here first to get weapons.

716
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:36,885
You were going to screw me.
That's the American slang.

717
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,332
- Isn't it?
- You were gonna screw me.

718
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,534
So much for our word.

719
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,270
Lying to enemies.

720
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:46,405
It's called Taqiyya.

721
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,475
Take off the camera.

722
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,316
I will show the world

723
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:54,551
what happens

724
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,487
when you screw Abu Ramal.

725
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:59,356
On your knees!

726
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:01,825
- It's not gonna happen.
- Make them on their knees!

727
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:22,679
Enough!

728
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:26,155
Drop your weapons.

729
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,793
Step away from my brother.

730
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:39,363
Linc.

731
00:39:39,398 --> 00:39:41,216
How much do you love
this brother of yours?

732
00:39:48,287 --> 00:39:52,043
Why don't you step down from that truck?

733
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:54,691
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
No, it's not going down

734
00:39:54,694 --> 00:39:56,513
like this, okay? Just...

735
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:59,160
stop. I got way too many
questions for my friend here.

736
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,252
- Step back!
- I went to prison for killing

737
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:03,954
a guy in a bar fight. I didn't even want

738
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:06,491
to get into it, okay? He
starts talking yang to my girl.

739
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:07,858
I tell him to beat it.

740
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:10,360
He pulls a knife, and I see red.

741
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:12,510
One second later,

742
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:15,899
I'm holding his bloody knife,
and it's his body on the ground.

743
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:18,535
- You're not that fast.
- One second.

744
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,037
Please don't do this.

745
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:22,005
You will lose.

746
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,539
Listen to your friend.

747
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:26,909
I'm talking to you, Ramal.

748
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:30,245
I told you! Step down from that truck.

749
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,853
Pick up your weapons!

750
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:34,016
You've got one second till
that one second happens.

751
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:35,651
Go to hell.

752
00:40:49,808 --> 00:40:51,708
We got more coming!

753
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:54,002
- And more over here!
- This is a big problem.

754
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:56,271
Let's get the hell out of here.

755
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,018
_

756
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,566
- You wanted to see us?
- Ouch.

757
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:31,380
Come on. Come on.

758
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:59,468
Behold the villain.

759
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:14,650
Who the hell is this guy?

760
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:17,175
He's my brother.

761
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:22,858
He's my brother.

762
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:24,593
I can't believe this.

763
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:28,107
I just can't believe
this. I can't believe this.

764
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,333
Back at the prison. Why?

765
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:33,235
- Why did you say?
- I had to deny you.

766
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,304
You were... you were filming me.

767
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:38,430
- They can't know.
- Who can't know?

768
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,042
- They can't know I'm getting out.
- Who?

769
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:42,978
I'll explain everything later, just...

770
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:45,380
Sara and-and Mike?

771
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,082
They're good.

772
00:42:47,117 --> 00:42:48,917
- They're fine.
- Oh, thank God.

773
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:50,469
Thank God.

774
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:52,192
Questions just keep piling up, huh?

775
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,423
That's you.

776
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,182
It's all of us.

777
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:57,559
What are they saying?

778
00:42:57,594 --> 00:43:01,396
That ISIL has taken over
the government station.

779
00:43:01,432 --> 00:43:03,865
That their beloved leader, Abu Ramal,

780
00:43:03,868 --> 00:43:07,011
has been martyred.

781
00:43:07,014 --> 00:43:10,006
That we're the ones that did it.

782
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:14,034
The entire army of ISIL
just declared war on us.
