1
00:00:00,472 --> 00:00:02,827
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:05,949
Those ass-hats are worth more
dead than you and I are alive.

3
00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:08,207
Somebody's gonna get that money--
might as well be me.

4
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:09,884
You know, a job like that might

5
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,425
go a little smoother with
an extra pair of hands.

6
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,026
I want divers down
in the river.

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:18,535
- Are you Scott Kolbrenner?
- You must be Debra Jean.

8
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:20,509
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, same here.

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,132
Apparently, Fibonacci's
coming up for air again,

10
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:26,900
and if he testifies at that hearing,
a lot of people are going down.

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,730
Caroline. They're
taking her in.

12
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,298
Of course,
I'll keep an eye on her.

13
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,034
Hi, my name is Sara,
and I'm an addict.

14
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:34,011
Hi, my name's Lance,
and I'm an addict.

15
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:35,213
Hi, Lance.

16
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,000
You did one hell of a job, Doc.

17
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,460
It's okay for you to leave now.

18
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:42,882
Oh, I'm leaving; you're not.

19
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:47,190
- Where to, sir?
- Utah.

20
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,973
- Ready?
- Yeah.

21
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,871
- So which one of them was it?
- Maybe Scofield.

22
00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,903
Probably gonna find his
brother in there, too.

23
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:02,901
Are you meeting up with her,
the doctor?

24
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:03,842
I don't know.

25
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:08,050
I knew the little whore
would take us right to 'em.

26
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:14,732
What happens when you get to Mexico?
Where will you go?

27
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:18,980
It's best if you don't know.
It's best for everyone.

28
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:20,933
We'll drop you off
in the next town,

29
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:24,130
and I'll wire you that 10,000,
like I said.

30
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:27,932
Shouldn't take more
than a week or two.

31
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:29,931
Michael.

32
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:31,952
We got company.

33
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,623
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

34
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:50,680
Who is it?

35
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:52,963
Who is it?

36
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:57,473
It's Bellick!

37
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:07,023
Hold on.

38
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:11,090
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

39
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,462
Can this thing go any faster?!

40
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:23,260
What do you think?!

41
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,040
Look out! Look out!

42
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,080
Nobody move!

43
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,752
Nobody move!

44
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,960
Oh, good to see you again, boy.

45
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,680
No need for anyone
to get hurt, Boss.

46
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:34,643
Boss? Oh, there's no need for
formalities anymore there, Sink.

47
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,842
I'm no longer an employee of the state,
thanks to you.

48
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:43,172
- I think somebody wants that reward.
- It's not about reward money, friend.

49
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,060
Your pal Manche told me all
about your little treasure hunt

50
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,403
for Westmoreland's stash.

51
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,733
Get in the car.

52
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:53,543
We're going to Utah.

53
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:29,731
All the cops following
you all over the country,

54
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,092
when all they had to do was
tail the tail, you know?

55
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,320
- Move that moneymaker, sweetheart.
- Let's move it, convict.

56
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:39,563
If you know about the money in Utah,
why do you need us?

57
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:40,982
Well, the excitement
of the escape,

58
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,143
Manche didn't hear
everything Westmoreland said

59
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,590
before the old bird kicked the bucket,
but he heard enough:

60
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,731
Utah and five million.
You'll fill in the blanks.

61
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:50,441
Hey!

62
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:53,080
Don't even think about
getting cute, smart-ass.

63
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,583
Now, you and your brother are gonna
take me right to where that money is,

64
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:57,832
or the whore gets
dead real fast.

65
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,711
Ask me if I'm bluffing.

66
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:16,301
The dredging of the river under
Scofield's apartment bore some fruit.

67
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,831
Found a hard drive
under the river bed.

68
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,470
Serial numbers match an
order that Scofield put in

69
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:24,040
with Dell a few months
before he was incarcerated.

70
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:27,200
They've recovered about 12
percent of the data so far.

71
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:47,701
And this is helping us how?

72
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:51,001
Blood tests came back.
B-negative all over that crash site.

73
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:54,393
- Scofield and Burrows are both...
- B-negative. I know.

74
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,882
- I'll reach out to the media.
- How about don't.

75
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:59,002
If it gets out that
the guy who...

76
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:04,332
...who masterminded this
whole thing is possibly dead,

77
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,703
the other six cons are gonna
get their guards up even more.

78
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,333
It is our policy-- excuse me...

79
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:12,902
It is our policy not to announce
deaths until they're confirmed!

80
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:16,831
We've got an exploding
car and a blood match.

81
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,041
- Well, then do more tests.
- On what?

82
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:21,450
On the bumper. I don't know.
I don't care. Just delay.

83
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:25,170
I want those guys out there getting
more complacent, not more careful.

84
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:31,120
...to forge ahead with
its nuclear program.

85
00:06:31,305 --> 00:06:33,990
In national news,
the eight escaped convicts

86
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:38,171
from Fox River Penitentiary in
Illinois are still at large, and...

87
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:43,363
- Hey, I was listening to that.
- Yeah. Yeah, I want to hear this.

88
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:49,021
- Really? You like John Denver?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,641
Country ho...

90
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:00,832
Take me home

91
00:07:01,118 --> 00:07:03,823
To your place

92
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,640
I've got cash

93
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,543
Country ho

94
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:12,181
In West Virginia

95
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:13,912
Take me home,

96
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:16,833
My country ho...

97
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:18,843
This is good, this is good.

98
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,242
- Don't quit your day job.
- What?

99
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:25,900
Nah, I just need a little
tequila to get my karaoke on.

100
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:27,630
Yeah.

101
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:32,852
Here, yo, slow down.

102
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,241
We're doing, like,
65 in a 60...

103
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,822
- Yo, slow down.
- All right, Dad.

104
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:47,742
Yo, we can't be
having that, man.

105
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:50,520
Tickets are, like, 200 bones.

106
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:57,462
I never thought I'd say this,
Scofield, but

107
00:07:57,568 --> 00:08:00,291
I thank God for the day
you walked into Fox River.

108
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,791
And out of it.

109
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:05,662
It's gonna be okay.

110
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:08,391
I don't want to hear
from you right now.

111
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:12,541
You told me nothing would happen.
You promised me.

112
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:19,611
That's one pissed off commie you
got on your hands there, Scofield.

113
00:08:19,656 --> 00:08:21,831
Didn't your mama tell
you how to treat a lady?

114
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,790
Or was she a whore
like this one?

115
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:26,332
- Linc!
- Got a problem there, Burrows?

116
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:30,961
We only need one of you to take
us to the money. Remember that.

117
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:35,831
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

118
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,960
I'd been really drunk
at the wedding speech.

119
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:43,061
And this was the first time
that we'd spoken since then.

120
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:48,580
And it was cleansing.
It was really cleansing. Thank you.

121
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:55,681
Good share, Ralph.
Well, we're out of time.

122
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,622
Unless there are any
burning desires...

123
00:08:57,657 --> 00:09:01,373
Actually, I'd like to...
you know, if there's time.

124
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,060
Of course.

125
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:08,440
- I'm Lance, and I'm an addict.
- Hi, Lance.

126
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:15,201
My, uh, mother died of M.S.
last week.

127
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:19,992
She just... gave out.

128
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:23,851
Just like my grandfather did,
just like my sister did.

129
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,821
Just like I...

130
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,243
Um, if I may?

131
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,800
Lance, M.S.
isn't usually considered genetic.

132
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:43,480
- Really? What are you, a doctor?
- Uh, I am, actually. Sorry.

133
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:46,653
Thank you.

134
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:02,470
All right, everybody,
face the wall and look straight ahead!

135
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:07,951
Eyes front.

136
00:10:08,557 --> 00:10:12,231
- How was your flight?
- Bumpy. Everything is ready?

137
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,221
We got a container ship
down at the navy yard.

138
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:15,550
The captain's one of ours.

139
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,503
He's got a stateroom listed as
a cargo hold on the manifest.

140
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:21,580
You and your family will be on
it when it sets sail tomorrow.

141
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:25,462
Six days from now, John,
you'll be in Sardinia.

142
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,670
Good work.

143
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,750
Sylvia.

144
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,390
Dad!

145
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,598
We missed you.

146
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:50,034
I missed you, too.

147
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,953
It's over, it's over.

148
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,640
Come on. Come on.

149
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:58,301
What the hell are you doing?

150
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,530
Mind your own business.

151
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:20,860
What kind of son of a bitch doesn't
have a spare tire in his car?

152
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,392
The kind that already used it.

153
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:26,222
Well, then you're just the sad sack that
has to go back into town to get a
new one.

154
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:29,650
- That's like three miles.
- That's right.

155
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,293
All right, everybody out.

156
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:42,761
That way, come on.

157
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:50,951
- Careful.
- Don't touch me.

158
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,673
Just relax.

159
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,840
You know,
I believed everything you told me,

160
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,802
and I did everything you asked.

161
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,452
I risked my life for you.

162
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,043
For what?
For $10,000, I risked my life?

163
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:06,842
And this entire time, you've had
$5 million just waiting there.

164
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,241
You're a bastard, Michael.

165
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:15,721
For all the aggravation, I hope you
got to hit that a few times, Scofield.

166
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:19,063
Ba-ba-boom-bah.

167
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:22,011
We're going to wait
it out in that shack.

168
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,840
Keep moving. Come on.

169
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:28,972
Go in there. Come on.

170
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,062
Fantasia, get going.

171
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:37,363
I need to talk to you... alone.

172
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,770
What do you want?

173
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,973
To ruin his life like
he's ruined mine.

174
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,132
Where you coming from?

175
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:53,093
Me? I was just hitting
the head, boss.

176
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:54,642
What's your name?

177
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,233
Clyde.

178
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,843
Clyde May.

179
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,000
- You got any ID, Mr. May?
- I don't, uh...

180
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:06,922
drive anymore,
so don't really have ID per se.

181
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:13,520
Camel jockey left a big box of boom-boom
under my jeep back in Kandahar.

182
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:16,863
- You military?
- Was.

183
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:21,392
- Which one's your vehicle?
- These two sleds right here.

184
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:24,082
That is,
in between rides, anyhow.

185
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:26,363
Ain't much of a bag to
be hitchhiking with.

186
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:28,711
I travel light.

187
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:32,060
And you're just hoofing it out
here in the middle of nowhere?

188
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,711
I do have the right
to see a little bit

189
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,570
of the country I lost my hand for,
don't I?

190
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,512
Why don't you tell me what
this is all about, Officer.

191
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,611
We got a vehicle here
without a driver,

192
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:44,341
and at present, you're the
only driver without a vehicle.

193
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:46,351
Hell, is that what
this is all about?

194
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:48,571
Why didn't you say so?

195
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:52,471
Dirty hippie kid dropping
a deuce in the facilities.

196
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:55,533
Came in with that car
not two minutes ago.

197
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:56,931
Check it out.

198
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:10,912
- What were you, Army?
- Hell no. Corps.

199
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:16,050
Well, then. Semper fi, brother.
What outfit were you?

200
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:22,660
- 196th.
- 196th?

201
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:27,022
Never heard of it.
Where they out of?

202
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:29,473
Hey, Elkind!

203
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:32,152
What the hell, man?
I didn't do nothing.

204
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:36,760
Found these in his knapsack,
after he said he had no car.

205
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,442
What?

206
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,320
Semper fi, brother.

207
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,610
Semper fi.

208
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,672
Stop stressing;
it doesn't do any good.

209
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,353
Maybe you ought to
start stressing,

210
00:15:58,477 --> 00:16:00,882
if they're going to put
a bullet in our heads.

211
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:04,412
They need us.
They need us to get that money.

212
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,571
I admire your optimism.

213
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:10,631
She's rolling, man.
I can feel it.

214
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:14,711
So you want to ruin Scofield's life.
Well, get in line.

215
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,992
What are you really
looking for?

216
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:21,152
Same as you... money.

217
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,221
Money? You want money?

218
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,141
Ten grand, how's that sound?

219
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:28,540
We do it right now,
right there on those floorboards.

220
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:31,223
Not in a thousand years.

221
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,851
Beat it then.
You got nothing else I need.

222
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,191
Typical man.

223
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:39,363
I'm talking about millions of dollars,
and you'd piss it away for sex.

224
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,491
That's right.

225
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,832
And I was hoping you wouldn't
let Michael outsmart you, too.

226
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:46,751
Scofield ain't
outsmarting no one.

227
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,721
You think that tire
went flat by accident?

228
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:52,932
What are you offering?

229
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,932
I can find out where the money is.
He trusts me.

230
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,613
- What do you want?
- My fair share.

231
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:02,950
You find out where that money is,
your fair share is $200,000.

232
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,713
Out of five million?
It's not even...

233
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:10,120
I got the gun, girl.
You're lucky you're a partner at all.

234
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,211
I'll be right back.

235
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,403
Fibonacci's in D.C.

236
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,800
Yeah, and he's in Denver,
Atlanta, Miami...

237
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:25,490
No, no, no, no, no.
This time, it's for real.

238
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:29,020
He's testifying again.
He's in Washington right now.

239
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:33,260
- The Globe Hotel, Room 116.
- Is this information any good?

240
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:38,452
It's from New Jersey.
Fishhead Tommy wants to pay tribute.

241
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:41,911
Get the car.

242
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,350
Look at this room, John.

243
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:53,123
Look.

244
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:58,252
We can be a family again.

245
00:17:58,346 --> 00:18:02,681
But you want to risk it all, disrespect
us, and for what, for vengeance?

246
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:05,412
- He betrayed me.
- I don't care.

247
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,430
He betrayed us.

248
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:15,032
I'm sorry you...
will never understand what happens...

249
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,083
when you're in prison.

250
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,343
But you could go
back to pris...

251
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:23,102
I swear to God...

252
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:27,851
I'd rather die than go back.

253
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:31,913
There's no going back,
never, ever again.

254
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:34,491
Christ saved you, John.

255
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,663
Don't turn your back on him.

256
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:40,002
Don't turn your back on us.

257
00:18:48,757 --> 00:18:50,302
I...

258
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,962
I don't know,
about 20 miles from Gunnison.

259
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,052
He's coming; I have to go.

260
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:14,291
- Who was that?
- Nobody, it's just my father.

261
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:19,011
Hey, listen. Do you mind if
we stop at the next motel?

262
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:20,463
It's only like 4:00?

263
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:22,813
Yeah, but we've been
driving forever.

264
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:24,692
It's cool, I'll drive.

265
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,142
I really just want to stop.

266
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:28,943
But if we get on the
road now, maybe...

267
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:33,250
Scott, it's my car,
and I'm tired of being in it, okay?

268
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,442
All right.

269
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,181
Can you believe it?
Of all the players in this thing,

270
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:46,481
it's the rat that could give
us our first collar. Come on.

271
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:51,021
You guys need to use the can,
hold it.

272
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:55,462
If you need to tinkle, sweet pea,
I'll watch you any time.

273
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,492
Sit down.

274
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,010
Hands behind your back.

275
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:16,463
Took your time.

276
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,163
It takes time to gain
a man's confidence.

277
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:25,013
You're right.
He'll bite on anything I say.

278
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,951
You just tell me
where we trap him,

279
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:30,240
and I'll tell him that's
where the money is.

280
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,880
Hey, you're the guy from
the gas station, right?

281
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:52,673
Yeah.

282
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm the guy who was
having car trouble.

283
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,692
Seems to be purring
along now, huh?

284
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:00,721
Yeah.

285
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:06,140
Water pump.
200 bucks for this heap.

286
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,432
Well, they'll get you.

287
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:11,163
Look, I hope I'm
not out of line,

288
00:21:11,255 --> 00:21:14,202
but I heard you telling the
cop back there about your hand.

289
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,453
My old man was killed in
'Nam when I was a kid,

290
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,080
and so I have the utmost
respect for our servicemen.

291
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:22,982
- Just serving my country.
- A lot of us are grateful for it.

292
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,941
Listen, if you need a
ride or something...

293
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,542
Well, to be honest
with you, my...

294
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:32,132
my dogs are kind of barking.

295
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:35,710
Well, all right. Jerry Curtin.

296
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:40,283
Clyde. Clyde May.

297
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:44,652
My kid Danny's riding shotgun. I hope
you don't mind sitting in the back.

298
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:52,431
- Hi. I'm Danielle.
- Hi, yourself.

299
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:05,251
- Hey.
- What do you want?

300
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:08,173
- I need to use the bathroom.
- Again?

301
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,450
- I have a small bladder.
- That ain't all you got.

302
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,832
Get up.

303
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,891
Well?

304
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:31,813
They plan to trap you.

305
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:35,671
The big one--
he's got friends in Utah. Criminals.

306
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:39,581
A town called Panguitch.
They grow drugs on the farm there.

307
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,840
They'll tell you that's where
the money is, but no money.

308
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:46,310
Just old friends with guns,
waiting for you.

309
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:52,161
Easy enough.
We take a pass on Panguitch.

310
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:58,872
- Where's the money really?
- I'll find out soon enough.

311
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:02,361
But $200,000 was old price
for this information.

312
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:07,220
- I want a new price.
- She's trying to renegotiate.

313
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:11,651
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be face down in a marijuana farm.

314
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:15,402
- One third.
- Ha!

315
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:20,400
It's gonna take a lot more than
information if you want a million-six,
sweet pea.

316
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:23,513
- Such as?
- You know.

317
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:27,142
Piece of that can
anytime I want it.

318
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:30,252
- Is that it?
- Aren't you gonna slap me?

319
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:33,310
I've slept with men for a lot less,
trust me.

320
00:23:33,456 --> 00:23:35,901
And what happened to
"never in a 1,000 years?"

321
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,252
That was negotiating.

322
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:44,011
So.

323
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,083
Deal?

324
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:50,523
Deal.

325
00:23:56,278 --> 00:23:58,722
We got a $150,000 here, John.

326
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:00,280
With Vittorio's
place in Solanas,

327
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,670
we'll be able to live
off the interest.

328
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,122
Where's your father?

329
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,923
Everything all right, boss?

330
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:19,832
Yeah. Let's get
this over with...

331
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,053
so I can get back to my family.

332
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:28,563
She'll get it done.
Nika and I have come too far together.

333
00:24:28,655 --> 00:24:30,360
When money's on the line,
you trust no one.

334
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:31,512
Sometimes you have to.

335
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:34,293
Not if you want to survive,
you don't.

336
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:36,641
You really don't trust anyone,
do you?

337
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:40,813
Can you blame me after
all that's happened?

338
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:44,900
No, I mean before that.
Before prison.

339
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,991
Every time I trusted someone,
I got burned.

340
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:51,033
Every time I got close to someone,
I got screwed.

341
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:55,720
I know better,
and so should you.

342
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:58,032
That's right, the Lotus Motel.

343
00:24:58,537 --> 00:25:02,450
I don't know the number.
I can't talk anymore; I have to go.

344
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:13,392
Oh, check it.

345
00:25:13,488 --> 00:25:16,923
I know this might be a little
forward and all, but, um,

346
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,981
let me ask you something.

347
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:24,041
You got a man?
I mean, a boyfriend?

348
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:26,011
No. What am I thinking?
You're Mormon...

349
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:31,371
I'm not Mormon. You think all
girls from Utah are Mormons?

350
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:35,582
They are, aren't they?

351
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:41,272
Well, yo, hey.
Yo, then you can party, right? Hey.

352
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:45,922
When I land, I want 12 armed agents
waiting for me on the ground.

353
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:48,561
Tell them I want to go straight
to the motel from the airstrip.

354
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:49,713
You got it.

355
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:56,760
I was an ass before.
I apologize.

356
00:25:56,856 --> 00:26:00,952
A little bit.
It's all right. Here you go.

357
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:04,163
- I was a huge ass.
- I apologize.

358
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:06,603
I'm not going to
argue with you.

359
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:10,800
Well, I mean, what were the odds
that you were actually a doctor?

360
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:16,370
Uh, all right, fair enough.
They're probably not good, but, um...

361
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:21,741
And I should not have interrupted you,
and I'm sorry.

362
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:24,992
- I'm sorry, too.
- Well, then, apologies accepted.

363
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:31,553
- I recommend the blueberry pie.
- Well, blueberry pie it is.

364
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:51,252
- Hey, there, Danny.
- Hey.

365
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:56,271
Sure is nice of your daddy to
buy me a room for the night.

366
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:59,863
Yeah, he's always helping
out with vets and stuff.

367
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:02,381
Yeah, good man.

368
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:06,623
But I was wishing we could have
kept going on toward Utah.

369
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:12,092
Lots of light left in the day,
lots of road to go.

370
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:15,060
When Dad's back acts up,
we stop.

371
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:21,432
Young Miss?
That's kind of insulting, isn't it?

372
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:22,453
Hmm?

373
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:25,751
I mean, you're a grown woman.

374
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:31,403
But adults are always trying
to infantilize girls your age,

375
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,563
treat you like children.

376
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:37,140
No duh. My dad won't let me
get earrings, and I'm 14.

377
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:39,110
You see?
That's what I'm saying.

378
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:41,943
You are more than
perfectly capable of, uh...

379
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:44,490
- of making your own decisions...
- Tell my dad that.

380
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:47,491
Yeah, but he won't want
to hear it, right?

381
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:54,032
Because he wants to keep
you as a baby. Right?

382
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:58,510
Even though you're...
you're more than old enough to

383
00:27:58,656 --> 00:28:05,972
to choose how you want to-to dress,
or, uh, accessorize.

384
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:07,660
What are you doing?

385
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:09,600
Just in need of a friend,
that's all...

386
00:28:09,636 --> 00:28:11,750
No. No. I'm telling my dad.

387
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:12,681
Wait!

388
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:21,750
She's got it all wrong.

389
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,280
Go wait outside.

390
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:37,010
You and I are gonna
work this out.

391
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:42,331
Jerry... you really
don't want to do this.

392
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:49,730
Thing I like about you
is your determination.

393
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:55,012
I've got family in Kladno that have
been waiting for me to send for them.

394
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:57,260
They know what kind
of work you're in?

395
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:01,242
They think I work
at Starbuck's.

396
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,213
Mmm. Mmm.

397
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:12,500
How stupid do you think I am?

398
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:23,983
My daddy always said,
"Fool me once, shame on you.

399
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:27,262
Fool me twice,
and I put you in the ground."

400
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:31,591
Any more games,
and I stop the hooker's air, understand?

401
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,412
Thanks for the dance,
sweet pea.

402
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:49,140
- You bitch!
- Fooled you.

403
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:58,181
I carried it;
the cons can change it.

404
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:02,410
Oh, you really suck,
Bellick, you know that?

405
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:05,093
- Roll 'em.
- Let's go.

406
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,750
Put your hands
behind your back.

407
00:30:15,576 --> 00:30:16,840
Thank you.

408
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:19,471
You're as stupid as the prison doc,
you know that?

409
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:20,693
Ignore him.

410
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:23,671
He conned her, too. Made her think
he loved her, and look what she got.

411
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:26,911
An overdose and a shot
at 30 years inside.

412
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:31,522
What are you talking about?

413
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,550
Guess you haven't been reading
the papers, have you, college boy?

414
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:35,983
Cops found your girlfriend--

415
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:39,800
fish-belly white,
garglin' her own puke.

416
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:40,912
Shut up.

417
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:44,211
But what do you care, a long as
she left the door open for you?

418
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:47,691
- Shut up!
- Hit a  spot, didn't I?

419
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:02,570
Dad...

420
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:19,392
It really is like the
best pie I've ever had.

421
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,541
You know what it
needs though...

422
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:23,661
- Hmm?
- Some crack.

423
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:27,411
No, I mean, you know, not a lot.
A pinch.

424
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,531
- A pinch of crack?
- A pinch of crack.

425
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,921
A pinch of crack,
a dollop of smack. Mm.

426
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:36,031
- That's good pie.
- That's so wrong.

427
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:36,913
No?

428
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:40,401
I'm sorry.

429
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:45,781
Hello.

430
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:51,631
- Sara... it's me.
- What do you want?

431
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:54,301
I don't have time to talk.

432
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:57,891
And there's every chance they're
listening to this call right now,

433
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:59,942
but there's a lot
I want to say.

434
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:02,413
Please don't hang up on me.

435
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,580
I don't...
I don't want talk to you.

436
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:06,980
I heard about...

437
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:10,472
I heard about what happened.

438
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,653
I want you to know that...

439
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:18,601
I want you to know
how sorry I am...

440
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:19,871
for everything.

441
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,191
Sorry's not going to do
me a whole lot of good

442
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,381
with what I'm up
against right now.

443
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:31,132
Listen... anyone with any ties to
me and my brother is in danger now.

444
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:34,721
I have no ties to you
and your brother anymore.

445
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:38,442
There is a way I
can protect you.

446
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:41,172
It's already in
your possession.

447
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:43,180
What are you talking about.

448
00:32:43,286 --> 00:32:47,102
It was real, Sara.
You and me...

449
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:50,621
It's real.

450
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:56,140
Michael? I...

451
00:32:57,816 --> 00:32:59,251
Michael?

452
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:08,722
How long to the motel?

453
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:10,600
Approximately ten minutes, sir.

454
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,290
Let's make it five?

455
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:22,793
Ooh. Yo, I haven't taken a
shower like that in forever!

456
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:27,391
- Where are you going?
- I was going to surprise you.

457
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:28,981
Surprise me how?

458
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:31,150
I was going to get
some tequila and lime.

459
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,480
All right, well, hold up--

460
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:37,530
No, no. No, it'll only take a minute.
Stay here and relax.

461
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,362
You seem kind of nervous.

462
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:43,232
- I do?
- Yeah, you're sweating.

463
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:44,973
Maybe I am nervous.

464
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:48,502
Trust me, girl, you got nothing
to worry about, all right?

465
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:53,133
- I'm one of the good guys.
- You seem like it.

466
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:31,502
Hang on tight.

467
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:34,230
I had the manager unlock
the door. Gotcha.

468
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:17,672
If you're looking
for the rat, John...

469
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:20,921
Fibonacci's 2,000
miles from here.

470
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:26,230
Who are you?

471
00:35:27,156 --> 00:35:29,030
Local cops or Feds?

472
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:33,553
Feds, John, only roll out the
best for a man of your stature.

473
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,081
I deserve to know
who turned on me.

474
00:35:40,227 --> 00:35:41,493
Tony?

475
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:44,783
The man was facing RICO rap.

476
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,112
He did not want to to prison.

477
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:52,820
I'm sure can appreciate that, knowing
what you know about the place now.

478
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:56,970
Whatever you're thinking
about doing John...

479
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,173
don't.

480
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:04,970
You are going back
to Fox River today

481
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:07,942
or the morgue,
that's your call.

482
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:14,872
Coming out.

483
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,493
Weapons come out first, John.

484
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:20,421
Forgive me.

485
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:28,220
Yeah, I'm coming out.

486
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:34,403
Easy, John. Easy.

487
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:37,783
We got a weapon, right hand.

488
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:39,803
These are serious men here.

489
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:42,722
They have instructions to shoot
at the first sign of aggression.

490
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:45,443
Please. I'm asking
you, respectfully,

491
00:36:45,586 --> 00:36:50,583
drop the weapon,
kneel and put your hands on your head.

492
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:55,692
I kneel only to God.

493
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:59,022
I don't see Him here.

494
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:05,930
John!

495
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:37,831
I think I screwed up.
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

496
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:42,730
Total Nazi. One of those...
nightmare overprotective dads.

497
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:45,133
Mmm-hmm. Yeah?

498
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:46,581
Well, I called him.

499
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:51,002
Told him I was
traveling with you.

500
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:54,392
I told him that we were
staying in the same hotel room.

501
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:58,690
- Girl.
- What?

502
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:01,942
You got to learn how to lie, girl.
What you thinking?

503
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:06,582
I don't... Yeah, I--
for some reason I don't know how.

504
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:10,500
He was mad enough when I told him I
was staying in a hotel room with a guy,

505
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:12,092
that was one thing...

506
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:12,832
Yeah, yeah.

507
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:16,091
But when I told him I was staying
in a hotel with a guy that...

508
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:18,483
I maybe sort of liked...

509
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:19,892
he lost it.

510
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:24,860
Wait.

511
00:38:25,368 --> 00:38:29,422
- Wait, what?
- Is that okay?

512
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,421
At least let us
take you into town.

513
00:38:46,296 --> 00:38:47,332
No.

514
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:51,281
If I'm seen with you,
it's a lot of trouble for me.

515
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:53,580
I can walk; it's only a mile.

516
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:56,450
We never would've made
it this far without you.

517
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,660
But now you're
crossing the border...

518
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,672
without me.

519
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:05,633
You can't go where we're going.
It's not a life for you.

520
00:39:08,876 --> 00:39:13,880
Then that's it then.
It's over for good.

521
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:16,542
Thank you.

522
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:19,473
Be safe.

523
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:27,823
Good luck.

524
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:37,782
I loved you, Michael.

525
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:41,600
And I thought I was going to get
that back, but you just used me.

526
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:42,773
That's not true.

527
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:44,880
I deserve more than this.

528
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:48,702
I deserve more than just being the
girl you call when you need something.

529
00:39:48,848 --> 00:39:50,901
You really think you're
gonna find the money in Utah?

530
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:53,860
I don't care about
the money in Utah!

531
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:56,583
I don't want any more crime.

532
00:39:56,865 --> 00:40:02,721
I turn you in, I get $200,000.
Legal money.

533
00:40:08,008 --> 00:40:10,120
You're the policemen's
problem now.

534
00:40:10,258 --> 00:40:11,293
Nika...

535
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:13,972
Don't come any closer
or I'll shoot you!

536
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:15,983
No, you won't.

537
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:46,533
Good luck to you.

538
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,153
- Hey.
- Hey.

539
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:18,681
Um, HQ called. They're asking
why you didn't intercept Abruzzi

540
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:21,083
when he was walking
towards the motel.

541
00:41:21,317 --> 00:41:24,730
The man was a mob boss.
The right move was to get him trapped.

542
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:28,402
They're saying the way you played it,
there was only one possible outcome.

543
00:41:28,436 --> 00:41:30,210
HQ has a problem with
the way I do things,

544
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:33,742
they can pick up a gun and follow
me into the field next time.

545
00:41:39,536 --> 00:41:43,351
Scofield always knew the
rat was the key to Abruzzi.

546
00:41:43,498 --> 00:41:46,792
We just put it out on
the wire and Abruzzi bit.

547
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,382
Speaking of Scofield...

548
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:59,873
That crash was staged.

549
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:08,853
Pig blood.

550
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:11,631
Smart kid.

551
00:42:17,247 --> 00:42:18,881
The problem with...

552
00:42:19,218 --> 00:42:22,272
being that clever is
that sooner or later,

553
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,241
you end up getting too
clever for your own good.

554
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:31,743
Good night.

555
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:58,881
You have no idea
what you're in for.

556
