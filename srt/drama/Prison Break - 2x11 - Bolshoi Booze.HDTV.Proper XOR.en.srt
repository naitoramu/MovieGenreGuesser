1
00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:03,704
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,389
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:08,823
You can't kill.

4
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:11,398
- I will get you.
- This is, uh...

5
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,655
in case you run into
trouble down the road.

6
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,347
Lincoln, he really wants to
see you and your brother.

7
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:20,914
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was ten years old.

8
00:00:21,052 --> 00:00:23,919
- Why are we going?
- Michael never met your grandfather.

9
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:24,566
Dad.

10
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,050
- I got Burrows.
- Take care of them.

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,300
I think there's a of
me that enjoys this.

12
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:31,828
It feels to me like
chasing a high.

13
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:34,874
And I should know
better by now.

14
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:36,821
Sara?

15
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:41,650
Hi, Sara.

16
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:45,683
- Hey, what is this?
- It's for my...

17
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,422
blood pressure.

18
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:49,512
Geary, come on,
we can make a deal, man.

19
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:52,670
No deals. You just crapped out
your last bargaining chip, pal.

20
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,821
Ain't that the most beautiful
thing you ever seen.

21
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,623
This is the Tribune Police.

22
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:29,683
This is the Tribune Police.
Make yourself known.

23
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,870
Hey, you're in luck.

24
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,970
- Had a case in back.
- Excellent.

25
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,030
Fishing reel oil.

26
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,550
And you want the whole case?

27
00:01:58,038 --> 00:01:59,342
Whole case.

28
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:05,211
- And the, uh, GPS?
- And the GPS.

29
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:08,823
- Must do quite a bit of fishing.
- Yeah, a lot of fishing...

30
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,071
not a whole lot of catching.

31
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:20,732
- $96.23.
- Um...

32
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:24,950
I'm just going to
take the reel oil.

33
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,953
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,923
Hey! You have to pay for that.

35
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,762
Just take it;
please don't hurt me.

36
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:52,881
Please.

37
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,491
You have to pay for that.

38
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,831
The vault. Open it.

39
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,610
One for the team.

40
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:22,480
He wasn't gunning for me,
he was gunning for my daughter.

41
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:25,061
Give Anna her papa's love.

42
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,463
I'm going cut your throat out.

43
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:33,772
I loved you, Michael.
You just used me.

44
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:38,223
Cops found your girlfriend fish-belly
white, gargling her own puke.

45
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:42,451
And what do you care?
As long as she left the door open.

46
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,693
I feel very fortunate
to have met you.

47
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:48,330
I'm sorry, Henry.

48
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:13,223
It's about corporate interests
taking over the government--

49
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,331
buying elections,
fighting wars...

50
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:19,290
people dying so they
can turn a profit.

51
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:21,440
We're trying to stop it.

52
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,762
What you, a bunch of spies?

53
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,661
Just a handful of
senators, congressmen,

54
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,332
people like me that once
worked for the company.

55
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:32,313
People willing to expose the
President for what she is--

56
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,800
a shill working for
these corporations.

57
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:37,190
We bring her down,
we bring them down.

58
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:39,190
What's it got to do with me?

59
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:41,243
Because the way we're
going to bring her down

60
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,671
is also what we're going
to use to set you free.

61
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,913
About a week ago,
we finally got a break.

62
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,263
An NSA analyst
sympathetic to our cause

63
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:54,151
finally worked his way up and got
clearance to the Echelon program.

64
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:57,930
E-mails, cell phone calls
all across this country,

65
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:00,513
if it's transmitted,
it goes through Echelon.

66
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:04,550
It's catalogued, interpreted,
and then stored for Homeland Security.

67
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:07,272
Nothing is missed
by them. Nothing.

68
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:12,781
Including by accident,
for a few months after 9-11...

69
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:14,982
the White House.

70
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:19,760
The analyst got his hands on a
phone conversation the President had

71
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,542
with Terrence Steadman...

72
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,503
two weeks after you
supposedly killed him.

73
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:30,431
Now, the analyst tried to get this
information out of the building...

74
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:36,533
But it turns out,
someone else was snooping, too.

75
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:43,402
Someone wanted answers
about the President.

76
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,520
Aldo and Lincoln want
to be left alone.

77
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:50,823
Sure, I understand.

78
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:59,210
24 hours later, Tancredi is dead,
the analyst is missing,

79
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:02,951
and the White House Echelon tapes
have been deleted from the mainframe.

80
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:08,551
The tape is still out there.

81
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:11,681
And judging by how hard they're
going after Sara Tancredi,

82
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:13,833
I'm pretty sure they
think she has it.

83
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:16,771
And I think they're right.

84
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:19,491
She's the key to this
whole thing, Lincoln.

85
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,943
LJ, come with me.

86
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:36,461
I would imagine that

87
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,910
you're feeling slightly
betrayed right now.

88
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,743
I understand.

89
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:55,680
As you can see,

90
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:58,771
hi, my name is not Lance,
and I'm not an addict.

91
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:01,512
Okay.

92
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,863
There is one thing about me
that should mean a great deal

93
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,203
to you right now.
That is I am reasonable.

94
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,730
If you tell me what you know,
you get to go.

95
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:14,540
Okay, and then maybe when
this is all behind us,

96
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:17,181
we get to grab a piece of
pie for old times' sake.

97
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:19,013
Okay. Come here.

98
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,603
I don't know where Michael is.

99
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:30,192
This is not about Michael;
this is about your father.

100
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:33,422
He left Washington with something
that didn't belong to him.

101
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,330
- We need it back.
And you killed him for it.

102
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,711
I didn't, no,
for what that's worth.

103
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,611
But I hope that his death
properly illustrates

104
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:46,843
the magnitude of the situation
that we're in right now.

105
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:52,291
So, where is it?

106
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,420
I don't know what
you're talking about.

107
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:56,861
Where is it?

108
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:58,953
I don't know what
you're talking about.

109
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,462
Where is it?

110
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:02,623
I don't know what
you're talking about.

111
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,003
Sara, there's a next
step involved in this,

112
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:08,250
and you don't want
to experience that.

113
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,850
I swear to God I don't know
what you're talking about.

114
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:18,682
My father didn't
give me anything.

115
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,892
I don't know what
you're talking about.

116
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,763
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

117
00:10:48,868 --> 00:10:51,172
How long has it been since
your last confession?

118
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,353
This is my first time.
In a long time.

119
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:58,430
Are you aware of the
nature of your sins?

120
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,480
The nature?

121
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,800
I'm not really sure.

122
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:08,463
Deep down inside your heart,
you know.

123
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,310
Righteousness, maybe.

124
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,573
Believing the ends
justify the means.

125
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:17,683
What are those ends?

126
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:22,412
- Saving someone's life.
- And the means?

127
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:26,301
I've broken just about
every law you can name.

128
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:29,802
But it's not just
what I've done.

129
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,820
It's what others have done...

130
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,060
...because I let them.

131
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:40,592
Because I was doing what
I thought was right.

132
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:42,583
I should have known
better this time.

133
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:43,811
This time?

134
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:49,230
When I was a kid...

135
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,893
I watched a man
bleed out and die.

136
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:58,840
And I was glad...

137
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:02,483
because he deserved it.

138
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,380
Life is only for God to give and take,
my son.

139
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:09,520
Suddenly, there is this
dark space inside of me.

140
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,563
And I knew it was wrong.

141
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:15,720
But here I am.

142
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,741
There is a way to stop this.

143
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:20,160
Surrender your will to God.

144
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:25,740
If I surrender now,
I lose everything that I love.

145
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:31,108
But do you lose your
soul in the process?

146
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,044
Well, we all have
our crosses to bear.

147
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,231
You okay?

148
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:50,082
This is never gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming after us.

149
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:07,371
Lincoln, don't.

150
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:13,890
- Is it done?
- You are.

151
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:19,682
- Lincoln Burrows.
- Your man's dead.

152
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:23,301
Just like anyone else you
send to take out my son.

153
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:26,923
We want you.
This isn't about LJ.

154
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:31,323
There's a very simple way
for all of this to end.

155
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,001
I'll tell you how
it's going to end--

156
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:36,610
me staring in your dead eye with
my hand around your throat.

157
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,791
You even know who I am.

158
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:48,711
How much further?

159
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:01,472
- Right here is good.
- Alright, you got it.

160
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,342
- Thanks for the ride.
- No problem.

161
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:21,322
Agent Mahone. Bill Kim.

162
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:23,662
I'm here to pick you up.

163
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:28,971
- I called Kellerman.
- He's busy right now.

164
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:32,423
Does anyone else
know you're here?

165
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,961
- No.
- Good.

166
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:38,710
Can you open the gate?
And I need a new vehicle.

167
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,991
There's something you
should know about me.

168
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:44,240
I don't like being
out in the field.

169
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,102
I only do so when
there's been a screwup.

170
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:52,241
- I'm out in the field, Alex.
- Then why don't you open the gate?

171
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:55,762
You can hurry back to D.C.
before your shoes get dirty.

172
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:59,990
We have a lead as to where Burrows
will be meeting up with his brother.

173
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,513
It's a place he referred
to as "Bolshoi Booze."

174
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,173
Does that mean anything to you?

175
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,201
Yeah, it's one of a hundred
tattoos on Scofield's body.

176
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,710
- What does it mean?
- I don't know yet.

177
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:11,970
You'll need to figure it out
within the next couple of hours.

178
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,942
If Scofield and Burrows
cross the border,

179
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:15,992
they'll be out of
your jurisdiction,

180
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,612
and you'll be of no
further value to us.

181
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:23,570
- Open the gate.
- So you can do what?

182
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:25,431
I want to hear it.

183
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,530
Straight from the mouth of the guy
who's supposed to be our closer.

184
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,392
I'll get Scofield
and Burrows...

185
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,412
and all of the rest of them.

186
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:36,311
And then me and
you and Kellerman,

187
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,140
we're going to part ways.

188
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,090
I just hope you're
properly motivated.

189
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:55,672
'Cause as long as you do your job,
we'll forget about Shales.

190
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:02,241
And then you can go back to
Colorado and visit your son.

191
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,910
Cameron. He's five, right?

192
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:10,182
Don't you ever mention
his name again.

193
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,781
There he is.

194
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:16,761
That's what I wanted to hear.

195
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,152
Get cracking, Alex.

196
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:26,752
A lot of people
are relying on you.

197
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,080
Jane will take care of it;
you can trust her.

198
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:40,372
I know this is hard,
but it will work out--

199
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:42,010
you have my word.

200
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,611
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

201
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:57,193
Listen, uh...

202
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,020
I know.

203
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:04,301
Jane's gonna look after you.

204
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,252
- I don't even know her.
- She's all right.

205
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,450
She's been working
for Dad for a while.

206
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,603
I'll, uh...

207
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:15,871
I'll see you soon, I promise.

208
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:20,170
Isn't that the same
thing your dad told you?

209
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:21,953
Yeah, but I mean it.

210
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,401
Hey.

211
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,632
Hey, it's me.

212
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,910
Just call me when you get this, okay?
It's important.

213
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:39,060
They're numbers.

214
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,132
Is that my payment?

215
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:39,902
- Medical nitroglycerine?
- As promised.

216
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,123
Whoo.

217
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:50,882
You have no idea how hard it
is to get this kind of grade.

218
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:53,820
Even with my contacts.

219
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,912
It's time for your
end of the deal.

220
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,833
Where's that plane gonna be?

221
00:21:58,156 --> 00:22:01,872
They call me a couple of hours
before with the drop-off point.

222
00:22:02,107 --> 00:22:04,192
It keeps the DEA off our backs.

223
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:06,143
Since it's going to be a while,

224
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,442
you might want to
stay out of the sun.

225
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:17,220
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

226
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,172
Is there a problem?

227
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,560
They're just my cousins.

228
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:38,451
Now, after your father
accessed this information,

229
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:43,343
he made three calls from his cell phone,
all to you.

230
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,742
What did he tell you?

231
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:47,653
Just that he was coming
back to Chicago.

232
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:50,881
Good. You're being
honest. Good.

233
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:54,023
Now, there's a half an hour
between when your father landed

234
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,613
and when he got home
that is unaccounted for.

235
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:59,482
I know you stopped by his office.
Did you see him there?

236
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:03,373
No. The last time I saw my father,
he was dead in his study.

237
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:05,612
Did your father have
anyone give you anything?

238
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:07,910
Do you think that I'm just
withholding information

239
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,803
because I like
hanging out with you?

240
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,330
If I knew something,
I would tell you; I don't.

241
00:23:12,428 --> 00:23:14,423
I don't know anything
about any of this.

242
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:15,263
Really?

243
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,282
Then why did you give your father
the file on Lincoln Burrows?

244
00:23:18,316 --> 00:23:21,220
Why did you open the door for Scofield,
and help him escape?

245
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:23,451
Why did Scofield send
you those coded notes?

246
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:26,751
Why did you come to
New Mexico to meet him?

247
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:32,122
Don't try to float a
babe-in-the-woods routine by me.

248
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:35,501
It's really going to piss me off, so...
Come on.

249
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,572
Okay. Come on. Shh. Shh-shh.

250
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:56,643
You're okay.

251
00:23:57,347 --> 00:24:00,493
Shh. Alright.

252
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:07,831
Look, Sara.

253
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:11,803
We're going to have to
come to an understanding.

254
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,420
You know that, right?

255
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:23,991
Yeah, you were right;
they are coordinates.

256
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,531
Plug them into your GPS.

257
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:28,252
They'll take you to a spot
in the New Mexico desert.

258
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,530
It's in the middle of
nowhere, basically.

259
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:31,372
Thanks.

260
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:34,471
Yeah, no problem.
Sir, who are you meeting?

261
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:37,003
What the hell is he doing?

262
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:40,073
He's keeping us out of the loop,
that's what he's doing.

263
00:24:42,658 --> 00:24:45,663
Constantly running from
the law with a bad heart...

264
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:48,890
Mexico, where I'm from has got
a lot of great things, but...

265
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:52,661
health care ain't one of them.
You all right?

266
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:56,651
- You look a little nervous.
- I don't do this every day.

267
00:24:56,838 --> 00:25:00,122
I just want to get the information
on that plane and, uh...

268
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:01,622
move on.

269
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,013
- Is that it?
- That's it.

270
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:09,470
I know who you are.
You don't have to worry--

271
00:25:09,755 --> 00:25:13,050
we can't go within 100 feet of a
federal marshal to collect the reward,

272
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:16,382
'cause we got U.S.
and Mexican warrants on our heads.

273
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:20,562
But this plane to Panama...
Sit down.

274
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:32,122
- This is all for your brother?
- Yes.

275
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:35,732
I got four brothers,
two in prison.

276
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,510
Accept a call? Yes.

277
00:25:38,388 --> 00:25:41,490
But break them out? Loco.

278
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:45,092
My brother gave me a baseball
mitt for my 14th birthday.

279
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:46,632
I owed him.

280
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:48,363
You're a better man than I am.

281
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:50,471
Time will tell.

282
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:02,202
Shouldn't they have called by now...
about the plane?

283
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,352
Yeah. You know, I...

284
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:07,462
I have a question.

285
00:26:08,938 --> 00:26:12,650
I thought that these
came in glass vials,

286
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:17,860
- not plastic.
- I thought so, too,

287
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,432
but the guy I bought it from
said he packed it in plastic

288
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:24,490
for transportation over long
distances to prevent a fire

289
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:26,000
or an explosion.

290
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:30,273
Really? I never heard of that.

291
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,663
What's going on?

292
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:44,252
We're going to do a little
quality control test.

293
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:47,343
- It's the best available.
- We got time.

294
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:24,180
For the last time,
some black male, early 20s,

295
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:27,321
jumped me from behind.
I didn't get a good look at his face.

296
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:29,360
The assailant attacked
you from behind?

297
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:30,663
That's what I just said.

298
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:33,421
Yet he managed to make contact
square on your forehead.

299
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:35,482
- That's right.
- With what? A boomerang?

300
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:37,491
Come on,
why don't you tell me what happened?

301
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,980
Look, I'm a retired correctional
officer out of Illinois.

302
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,110
How about showing some
professional courtesy, honey?

303
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,413
This is Roy Geary.
Leave a message.

304
00:27:54,648 --> 00:27:57,753
You thieving son of a bitch.
You better get down on your knees

305
00:27:57,895 --> 00:27:59,900
and pray to God that
I don't find you,

306
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:02,010
because, if I do,
mark my words,

307
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:04,100
I'm going to gut
you bow to stern.

308
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:09,940
President Reynolds was in Tallahassee,
Florida, early this morning,

309
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:13,141
attending a $5,000-a-plate
breakfast fund-raiser

310
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,221
for Senator Martin Kleinhenz,
who's running for reelection.

311
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:19,201
Later this afternoon,
her press conference was derailed

312
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,123
when a reporter
asked her to comment

313
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,832
on Lincoln Burrows' escape from custody.
She declined.

314
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:27,320
It's become clear in her
first month in office

315
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,322
that she cannot separate
herself from this manhunt.

316
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,241
And as long as it continues...

317
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:35,631
...pundits say that questions
about Burrows will contin...

318
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,882
Ladies. Let's get
this party started.

319
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:48,990
The last 30 years, I've hated you.
You walked out on me.

320
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:52,792
You haven't even seen Michael.

321
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:56,370
I've seen him before.

322
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,930
Not in the papers, Dad.

323
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:04,520
Been trying to work out what
kind of man abandons his family.

324
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:08,783
Now I'm doing the
same damn thing.

325
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:15,053
You'll see him again.
I'll make sure of it.

326
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:20,830
- How much further?
- About three hours.

327
00:29:28,105 --> 00:29:29,700
It's gonna be a few minutes.

328
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,392
My brother should be here soon.

329
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,933
Maybe I should go outside
and make sure he can see me.

330
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:36,222
That's a good idea.
I think I'm gonna send Ernesto to do it.

331
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:37,281
Ernesto, por favor.

332
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:50,641
Hello.

333
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:52,271
Si.

334
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,642
Bueno, te veo.

335
00:30:01,797 --> 00:30:04,890
- Was that the call?
- Yes, it was.

336
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:08,042
- About the plane?
- ¿Como se llamas?

337
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:14,270
- Agua con azucar.
- Sugar water.

338
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:16,473
You just made a big
mistake, blanquito.

339
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:19,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm not a chemist.

340
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:21,691
The guy I bought it from
swore it was medical nitro.

341
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:23,771
We both got screwed.

342
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,702
Yeah, but only one of
us is gonna pay for it.

343
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:27,392
Look, I just want
to get out of here,

344
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:30,332
and you want your payment.
My brother's gonna be here soon.

345
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:33,041
We'll work something out.
Just name your price.

346
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:37,873
I already named my price.
You didn't come through.

347
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,443
When's your brother
getting here?

348
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:51,732
You were planning on turning us
in the whole time, weren't you?

349
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,511
When's he supposed
to meet you here?!

350
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:54,802
Sueltalo.

351
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:58,011
- Drop it, or I'm gonna shoot him.
- Let him go, or I'll shoot you.

352
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:00,021
- Suelta la pistola.
- Ey, no estoy judiendo.

353
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:01,553
Sueltala, cabron!

354
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:05,440
Quieto!

355
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:21,973
- Where is it?
- My father didn't give me anything.

356
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:26,581
Who you risking your life for?

357
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:29,620
Lincoln Burrows.

358
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,692
Street thug.

359
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,522
And why is that your concern?

360
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:38,313
I mean, is there somewhere in the
Hippocratic Oath where it says,

361
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:41,823
"I pledge to risk my life for
those who don't care about mine"?

362
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:43,912
'Cause they don't
care about yours.

363
00:31:44,147 --> 00:31:47,662
Burrows and Michael
Scofield just used you.

364
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,810
Are you that surprised that
there are people in the world

365
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:52,963
who will stand up
to people like you?

366
00:31:53,526 --> 00:31:55,250
Are you that far gone?

367
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,612
That's cute.

368
00:31:56,756 --> 00:31:57,592
Sad.

369
00:31:59,606 --> 00:32:00,842
But cute.

370
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,081
A Cleveland what?

371
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:20,150
Don't worry,
I'll talk you through it.

372
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:22,860
And we got a glass
coffee table right here.

373
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,580
Hell no.

374
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:29,060
I'll do it for a thousand.
- $500.

375
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:33,860
- $1,000.
- $750.

376
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:36,651
All right.

377
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:50,732
What the hell?

378
00:33:00,697 --> 00:33:01,861
Leave.

379
00:33:06,758 --> 00:33:10,330
You know, it's amazing

380
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:13,761
what you can pick up
at an Army-Navy store.

381
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:16,481
All that torture stuff,
that was Bellick's idea.

382
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,410
And if you ask me,
he took the whole thing way too far.

383
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:23,093
Why don't I just give you half
the money, and we call it a day?

384
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,062
All right, 60-40.

385
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,123
Come on, T, we can deal.

386
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,102
Where's the plane
going to land?

387
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:37,493
Kiss my ass, cobarde.

388
00:33:42,718 --> 00:33:45,341
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

389
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,921
We're not going to get across
the border on the ground.

390
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,680
Without that plane,
we're screwed.

391
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:53,263
He's losing too much blood.
He'll never make it like this.

392
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,371
He should have thought of that
before he tried to kill us.

393
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,042
We got to take him to a hospital,
or else he'll die.

394
00:33:58,175 --> 00:33:58,852
Please.

395
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:03,321
The plane,
and we'll let you go.

396
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:04,822
Dicelo.

397
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:07,113
Dicelo todo.

398
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,930
Dicelo ahora!

399
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,552
Finley Road...

400
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,840
off of Highway 8,
there's an airstrip.

401
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:23,042
There, okay? Now let us go.

402
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:24,630
- Let's go.
- No, no, no!

403
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:26,270
Michael, let's go.

404
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:27,672
Por favor... please.

405
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:29,632
Michael, let's go.

406
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,640
Don't do this,
please don't do this.

407
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:34,742
Let's go, Michael.

408
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:38,003
If we were bleeding he would have
not lifted a finger, you know that--

409
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,621
he was gonna kill us both.

410
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:41,213
- Let's go.
- No, that's not true.

411
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,372
Michael, we're going to
get to that plane...

412
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:45,293
- Don't do this.
- Let's go now, please.

413
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:47,572
- Please don't do this, okay?!
- Callate!

414
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:51,472
Don't do this, all right?
Don't listen to him! Please.

415
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:57,611
Sara, I care about you.

416
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,850
This is not what
I wanted, Sara.

417
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,122
Kellerman.

418
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:17,742
What's going on with Sara?
Has she told you anything?

419
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:21,870
Don't go anywhere.

420
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:23,130
Not yet.

421
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:25,712
I trust you've
been... persuasive.

422
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:29,473
- Yes, absolutely.
- Then kill her.

423
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,332
Well, she knows something.

424
00:35:34,745 --> 00:35:37,331
You disobey me, you are done.

425
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,803
Do you understand me?

426
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,971
Put her in the ground, Paul.

427
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:30,663
Michael.

428
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:32,331
Let's go.

429
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:34,383
- Michael.
- Hold still.

430
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:38,182
Michael, we're doing it wrong--
let's get out of here.

431
00:36:38,218 --> 00:36:40,520
Now, he's gonna call the cops,
or go get his buddies...

432
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:42,001
He's not going to make it.

433
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:42,743
Callate!

434
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:44,533
We'll call them
when we get safe.

435
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,122
Let's go-- Michael, let's go!

436
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:47,040
Thank you.

437
00:36:47,928 --> 00:36:50,933
You got to get him to
a hospital right away.

438
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:06,051
Wait. Wait.

439
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:10,070
- Hey, man...
- Forget Finley Road.

440
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,771
The plane is going to stop
at the seven mile marker

441
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:18,661
on Route 4 at sunset.
It's going to stop for five minutes.

442
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:20,823
Then it's going to go
to Oaxaca, Mexico.

443
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,590
If you miss it,
you're out of luck.

444
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:37,112
- He bled out on the way over.
- Any ID?

445
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:41,201
Yeah, Roy Geary,
just an out-of-stater.

446
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:54,240
- You know him?
- He's a friend of mine.

447
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:56,343
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah.

448
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,773
You mind answering a
few more questions?

449
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,070
Yeah.

450
00:38:11,146 --> 00:38:12,673
It's Pam.

451
00:38:14,017 --> 00:38:15,842
What's going on?

452
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,102
I just wanted to say hey.

453
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:23,042
Well... are you all right?
You said it was important.

454
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:28,540
I know things got kind
of ugly toward the...

455
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:32,373
you know, the end. Um...

456
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:34,610
I got ugly.

457
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,531
But I want you to know that

458
00:38:36,727 --> 00:38:39,870
there were circumstances
that, uh...

459
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:43,052
It was better that
you and Cameron

460
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:46,140
hat you were not with me.

461
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,490
Why are you telling
me this now?

462
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:51,301
If I had to do it
all over again...

463
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,783
I'd do it different.

464
00:38:56,738 --> 00:38:58,661
We'd still be a family.

465
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,532
I'd give anything for that.

466
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:05,273
I just wanted you to know.

467
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:06,903
Alex...

468
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,480
- what's going on?
- Nothing.

469
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:12,213
I just wanted to call to
say that I was, uh....

470
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:18,511
...that I'm sorry
about everything.

471
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,100
Where are you right now?

472
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:24,222
- I can come get you.
- Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

473
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,520
No, I'm serious. Where are you?

474
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:30,823
One more thing.
If you hear anything in the media...

475
00:39:31,056 --> 00:39:35,483
What? What are
you talking about?

476
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:44,080
I love you.
Give Cam a kiss for me, okay.

477
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:33,341
Well... I'm glad I told
you about this place.

478
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:35,530
I'm glad I figured
out how to work a GPS.

479
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:37,940
Could you make it a little
more difficult next time?

480
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,080
- I owe you one.
- We're even.

481
00:40:40,226 --> 00:40:41,772
But we got to leave.

482
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:48,332
- Linc.
- Hey, buddy. How are you doing?

483
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:51,282
- Where's LJ?
- Safe. The money?

484
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,121
I'll tell you later;
we got to go.

485
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:54,272
I brought someone.

486
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:56,503
Dad?

487
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:12,932
We've met before.

488
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:40,461
This is happening
right now, okay?

489
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,751
Don't make me do this.
Don't make me do this.

490
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,922
Even if I knew,
I wouldn't tell you.

491
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,751
You wouldn't? Really?

492
00:41:48,846 --> 00:41:50,431
Are you that stupid?

493
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,032
Are you that stupid?!

494
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,231
Because now you're
going to die!

495
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:55,682
You're going to die,

496
00:41:55,865 --> 00:41:59,201
and all you had to do is tell
me what your father gave you.

497
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,810
I know my options.

498
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:04,060
I can not tell you and die,

499
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:06,241
or I can tell you
and still die.

500
00:42:06,388 --> 00:42:08,571
No. Wrong. Sara.

501
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,810
Come on, smarten up!

502
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:14,420
For once in your life. Please.

503
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:23,743
Go to hell.

504
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:33,840
Huh? Drowning is horrific--
don't get me wrong--

505
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:36,983
but once you give in and let
the water come into your lungs,

506
00:42:36,996 --> 00:42:39,483
there's a certain euphoria...
I hear.

507
00:42:39,665 --> 00:42:43,333
I guess as a junkie,
I thought maybe you'd appreciate that.

508
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:48,911
You did this to yourself.

509
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:06,911
