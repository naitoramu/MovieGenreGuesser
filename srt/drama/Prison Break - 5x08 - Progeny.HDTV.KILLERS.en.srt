1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:03,406
- Previously on Prison Break...
- We're gonna get you out of here.

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,882
- The escape is on.
- Go, go, go!

3
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,398
Who the hell is the guy?

4
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:08,984
He's my brother.

5
00:00:09,022 --> 00:00:10,966
Can't die on me now, Michael,
you know, you're gonna tell me

6
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:13,088
- why I'm your whip hand.
- We found Michael.

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,815
- He's been busted up real bad.
- I got to go.

8
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:16,350
You don't know what
you'd be walking into.

9
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:17,418
It's not safe.

10
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,273
I can't look my son in the eye

11
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,162
and tell him that I let his father die,

12
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,231
a father he's never met.

13
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:25,333
Never thought I'd see this face again.

14
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:28,280
You weren't supposed to.

15
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,172
Lincoln Burrows.

16
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,241
How about you step out

17
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:34,973
and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,918
- There is nobility in you, Lincoln.
- You should rest up.

19
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:40,382
- We're gonna need you.
- Didn't know you worried.

20
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,716
About the right things.

21
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,351
What's wrong?

22
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:45,253
It's him. Your husband.

23
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:47,452
Jacob

24
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,824
is Poseidon.

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,226
He's a CIA operative,

26
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,496
deep cover. He runs a splinter cell

27
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:54,396
called 21-Void.

28
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,731
He targeted me for my skills.

29
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,134
Michael, he's with our son right now.

30
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:00,793
I'll get to the States as soon as I can.

31
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:02,509
Did my husband, Jacob Ness,

32
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:03,972
ask you to work on my cell phone?

33
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:04,806
He said he was looking to find

34
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:06,040
the people who were stalking

35
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:09,310
his wife, so I did a data dive.

36
00:01:09,346 --> 00:01:10,979
Where's my son?

37
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:12,146
I have him.

38
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:13,851
And whether or not I
have to threaten him

39
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,294
is entirely contingent upon
you putting the gun down.

40
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,324
Kaniel Outis

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,393
has been located on a cargo ship

42
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:26,861
in the Mediterranean.

43
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:27,962
They made you.

44
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:29,230
Run!

45
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,942
_

46
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:44,546
Hey!

47
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:48,667
Hey!

48
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:53,655
Hey!

49
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,432
Hey, yo,

50
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,267
where we headed?

51
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:07,569
Marseille.

52
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:11,506
- Marseilles.
- Marseilles.

53
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:19,280
I own you, Scofield.

54
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,449
I know everything about you.

55
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:24,886
Even your most mundane
actions, like the zoo.

56
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,792
What's with you and the zoo?

57
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:28,090
I go there to think.

58
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,391
18 times in the past month?

59
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:32,594
- A lot of thinking.
- I was figuring out how to get

60
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,562
- your guy out of Barranquilla.
- Hmm.

61
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:36,498
Turns out he's not
just a rebel leader...

62
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,366
He's a murderous sociopath.

63
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,085
That's the only way to make omelets.

64
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,063
I need to know more about our targets.

65
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:45,106
If I'm facilitating escapes,
we can't have surprises.

66
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,509
Be proud. You and me,

67
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:50,478
- we're changing the world.
- Doesn't make it right.

68
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:53,915
Don't act like you're suddenly
a fan of the status quo, okay?

69
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,585
The system, it's slow,
stupid, and doomed to fail.

70
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:00,855
That's why you had to bust your
brother out in the first place.

71
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:03,791
New ink since the last time I saw you.

72
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:06,874
- Working on a new plan?
- No. No new plan.

73
00:03:06,877 --> 00:03:09,244
Just get tired of looking at empty skin.

74
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,493
Uh-huh.

75
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,901
You know, it was those tats at Fox River

76
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,807
that caught my eye in the first place.

77
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,371
I had to know everything about the man

78
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,518
who wore his plans on his skin.

79
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,257
In plain sight yet so mysterious.

80
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:26,127
The key to real power is to disappear.

81
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,729
- Hi, Professor Ness.
- Hello, Claudia.

82
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,132
Yeah, the secret to real power

83
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,501
is to never betray your intentions,

84
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:36,670
to wear nothing on your sleeve.

85
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,605
And to never let anyone

86
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:40,841
see your face.

87
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:03,497
Come on in.

88
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:11,238
Next time I'm sitting in solitary,

89
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,374
I'll think of you in
here, running the world

90
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,142
in air-conditioned comfort.

91
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:17,326
I've spent my time in the field.

92
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,580
You all set for Myanmar?

93
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,048
It's only a few weeks off.

94
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,249
That's why I'm here.

95
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,018
I want to bring someone on board.

96
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,363
- Oh, really?
- The prison camp

97
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,722
at Sittwe is a two-man job.

98
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:29,023
I've been watching this
guy. He'll be useful.

99
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:30,658
Watching him? You in charge

100
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:32,893
- of recruiting now?
- Trust me.

101
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,296
The last thing I want to do is
suck someone else into this.

102
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:38,032
He'll have my back and
he'll speed things up,

103
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,068
increase our odds.

104
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,233
Not exactly a distinguished career.

105
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,816
He's held up well in prison.
He's got a mean streak.

106
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:50,826
And he grew up without a family.

107
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,320
It means he can be manipulated.

108
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:54,315
If you're planning something,

109
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,117
I'll always be a step ahead of you.

110
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:59,420
You know that.

111
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:01,488
I can see everything in your eyes.

112
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,391
It's what's behind the eyes that counts,

113
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:05,659
Professor.

114
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:06,927
Hmm.

115
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,229
So you're gonna wait a year

116
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,231
for me to find my way out of Sittwe?

117
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,899
Or are you gonna get me a partner,

118
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:14,014
so we get on with the
business of changing the world?

119
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:25,868
Done.

120
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,296
_

121
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:40,527
I need some food.

122
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,996
I'm with you.

123
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,466
Linc, it's Sara.

124
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,168
She's back in New York.

125
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:51,438
Are she and Mike okay?

126
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:53,116
That's what I'm trying to find out.

127
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,904
_

128
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:08,199
_

129
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:12,693
What is it, Michael?

130
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,828
Something's wrong.

131
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,640
Yes, you will.

132
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:04,678
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

133
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:12,682
- I got to get back to the States.
- Slow down.

134
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,177
You're Kaniel Outis, remember?

135
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:15,912
You're on every no-fly
list in the world.

136
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,914
Jacob's done something
to Sara. Maybe Mike, too.

137
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,582
- How do you know?
- That text.

138
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:21,584
She referred to our son as Junior.

139
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,353
We agreed we'd never call him that.

140
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,421
He's baiting you, Michael.

141
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:27,757
It worked.

142
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,077
_

143
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:38,935
Hey, buddy.

144
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,370
Where's Mom?

145
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:42,438
Oh. I, uh, dropped her off at work

146
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:44,474
while you were at school.

147
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,143
That is quite a pirate ship.

148
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,446
Although it would be a little hard

149
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:52,448
to sail with the mast that far forward.

150
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:54,751
- Your ship might tip over.
- The mast has

151
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:56,619
to be there. It's not just a ship...

152
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:57,754
It's a treasure map.

153
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,981
What do you mean?

154
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,392
It's for Jimmy. We hide
Legos for each other.

155
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,060
I always find his.

156
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,129
He doesn't always find mine.

157
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,198
Wait a second,

158
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:12,835
how is this drawing a map?

159
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:17,940
This is the park.

160
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:20,443
That's the playground.

161
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,945
And this is the sidewalk.

162
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:25,882
Impressive.

163
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,451
You put a code in the drawing.

164
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:31,421
So, okay, where did you hide the Legos?

165
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:34,123
These cannons are pools at the park.

166
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,859
But there's an extra one, in the sand.

167
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:39,997
That's where I buried the Legos.

168
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:43,301
Well done, Mike.

169
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,357
Well done.

170
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,474
I've tried everyone. I'm out
of resources in the States.

171
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,743
All my contacts. People who
can go and check on them,

172
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,144
make sure they're okay.

173
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,746
Linc, I got to get home.

174
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:59,148
I can't spend another
two weeks on a cargo ship.

175
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:00,616
He's got my wife and kid.

176
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,185
There may be another way.

177
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,121
You told me about the last
seven years of your life.

178
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,858
Haven't told you about mine.

179
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,863
After Sara got exonerated,
she left Panama.

180
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:16,899
Me and Sofia stayed behind
and opened a dive shop.

181
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:19,969
We broke up, and
everything went to hell.

182
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:22,438
You weren't there to stop
me, so before I knew it,

183
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,440
I was in the old hood, doing odd jobs.

184
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,808
Odd jobs meaning what?

185
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:29,479
Moving things from point A to point B.

186
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:32,081
For Luca Abruzzi.

187
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:33,649
John Abruzzi's son.

188
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:35,218
Yeah.

189
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:38,855
I just wanted some quick
cash to kick-start my life.

190
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,524
They told me not to look in the boxes.

191
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,527
But I looked in the boxes.

192
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:47,330
The amount of fentanyl they're
smuggling out of Europe...

193
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:49,699
Tens of thousands of
pills in every box...

194
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,567
It's just killing people.

195
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,269
So I dumped a box in a Dumpster,

196
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:54,704
100 grand's worth.

197
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,839
Now you're in hock to Abruzzi's son.

198
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,108
Yeah. He wants to kill me.

199
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:03,713
But maybe it's a way to get
back to the States real fast.

200
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,982
_

201
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:09,852
You got balls, Burrows.

202
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:12,146
You actually think I want to help you?

203
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:13,856
What if I can get you the $100K?

204
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,691
$100K?

205
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:17,660
How are you gonna come up with that

206
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,629
crawling around the
back alleys of Chicago?

207
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:21,464
I'm not in Chicago. I'm in Marseilles.

208
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:23,866
- Marseilles?
- Yeah.

209
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,335
I've been working on a
couple deals. I got $100K

210
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:29,222
in my hand. But I want off the hook.

211
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,974
Sure you do. How about you get
over here and hand it to me?

212
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,676
That's why I'm calling.

213
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:36,379
I need to sneak into the States
invisible, like your pills.

214
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:38,814
Those flights you got
coming out of Europe...

215
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,418
The fentanyl flights...
I need a few seats.

216
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,925
I'll tell you what.

217
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,626
I'll make a few calls.

218
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:51,928
'Cause either I'm gonna see you

219
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,896
and get that money,
or I'm gonna see you,

220
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,098
and you're gonna get
something a whole lot worse.

221
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,169
I can't believe I'm doing
this to myself again.

222
00:11:00,204 --> 00:11:04,240
Difference is this
time, you're not alone.

223
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,250
God, these things are disgusting.

224
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,819
What they call 'em again?

225
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,188
Boudin noir.

226
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:21,257
Not sure what's in them.

227
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:24,193
I don't think your French is
as good as you think it is.

228
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:27,704
Yo, be happy you're not eating snails.

229
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:31,801
Hey.

230
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:40,509
Do you think they noticed?

231
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,112
Let's not take any chances.

232
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,153
Guys.

233
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:52,562
Your faces were on the news.

234
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,391
Somebody sees you, this thing is over.

235
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:56,325
- We got to move, papi.
- We got to go.

236
00:11:58,465 --> 00:11:59,998
Hold. Luca.

237
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,831
If you can get to Lyon by midnight,

238
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,699
I can get you on a flight.

239
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,025
I got a warehouse in New
York. You're coming to me?

240
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,069
We'll be there.

241
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,671
Can't decide whether I want you

242
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:10,606
to have that money or not, Burrows.

243
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:14,577
Killing you might be
a lot more satisfying.

244
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:17,546
Now we know they survived the
strike in the Mediterranean.

245
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:20,049
We can be pretty sure
he's coming back to Ithaca.

246
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:24,520
I need some clarification.

247
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:28,057
Why would he come back here...

248
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:29,892
to the States

249
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,761
when he's more wanted here

250
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:33,763
than anywhere else in the world?

251
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,233
Of course.

252
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:42,938
Because of them.

253
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:46,481
He had a life before he worked for me,

254
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,278
a name... Michael Scofield.

255
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:51,180
A family.

256
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:55,072
And when he went away, I
ended up looking after them.

257
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,987
Ended up... falling for them.

258
00:12:58,022 --> 00:12:59,855
Well...

259
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,725
He wants to kill me.

260
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,671
He thinks I stole his life,
ruined him, which speaks

261
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,496
to his dissociative mind.

262
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:10,249
I mean, he's a murderer,
a turncoat, a terrorist.

263
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:13,696
But we'll use it.

264
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:15,731
I'll be the bait if I have to.

265
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:19,335
So we can go about taking
him down once and for all.

266
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,103
He's not just gonna stroll in here.

267
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:24,273
He's too clever for that.

268
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:27,343
That's why we got
someone even more clever.

269
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,112
Thoreau?

270
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:31,780
Guy's a pencil neck.

271
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:34,116
A pencil neck with insight
into Scofield's plan.

272
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:36,719
So you, in turn, can be the hammer.

273
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:43,092
Screen-grab of the Skype transmission

274
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,460
he sent from the desert.

275
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,928
He routed the image through a server

276
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,197
to this BlueHawaii guy,
but it could have been

277
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:49,898
secretly subrouted to another, yet

278
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:53,305
unknown, recipient to use
the information encoded in it.

279
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,703
Information?

280
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,539
It's actually incredible.

281
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:01,176
Encrypted in the Arabic, the
images are all sorts of stuff.

282
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,245
Apparently, mundane as hell.

283
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,981
Visiting hours for zoos,
links to defunct message boards

284
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,049
on the Internet.

285
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,584
What message boards?

286
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:12,421
Truesnuff.com, Hunterspycamporn.com,

287
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:14,890
both of which carry... this.

288
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:18,293
Images of the Harlan Gaines murder.

289
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:21,104
What's the bastard doing
rubbing that in our faces?

290
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,966
Of all the things to encrypt, why that?

291
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,534
What's that get you?

292
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,169
Stegaonographically, a lot.

293
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:29,849
Steganography is the practice
of concealing information

294
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,174
in the code that makes up digital files.

295
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,610
Russians do it, Chinese, everybody.

296
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,445
He's probably thinking
if anyone sees this,

297
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,313
this'll be as far as they'll look.

298
00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:41,250
But I'm already going inside
the image, breaking down the data

299
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:43,685
- that comprises it.
- This is making my head spin.

300
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,188
Point is we put big data, AI on this,

301
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:49,057
we can crunch any codes
hidden in there pretty quickly.

302
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:50,139
And that's what I'm doing.

303
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:53,529
Nice work, but the truth
is if I've done my job,

304
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:57,366
he may reveal his
intentions to us first.

305
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:18,454
Because I've got him
so far off his game now,

306
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,523
he'll start to play
his cards too early...

307
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:26,829
Teddy.

308
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:30,699
"But in return, you must take a life."

309
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,387
show us what the tattoos mean

310
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,973
even before the computers
will, and all the people

311
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,585
he'll be enlisting for the fight.

312
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,446
You have to call this pay phone

313
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:42,344
in France.

314
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:49,551
Wait. Chicago? I thought
I was going with you.

315
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:53,255
Not until you find out
why you're my whip-hand.

316
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:57,092
I have to go to Chicago
to find that out?

317
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,461
Safe travels.

318
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:01,563
In the grandiosity of his plan,

319
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,398
he'll lose sight of
the simplest details.

320
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:05,267
The phone he texted me with

321
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:08,170
was located in Lyon, France last night.

322
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:12,207
It was turned off in an
airport terminal at 11:51 p.m...

323
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:22,451
20 minutes before a direct
flight to New York where

324
00:16:22,486 --> 00:16:23,819
you'll be waiting for him

325
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,778
to put this game to bed for good.

326
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,073
_

327
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,495
Flight 290 to Miami, Florida

328
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,597
will now depart from gate B24.

329
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,132
He just powered back up.

330
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:41,370
We got him.

331
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,772
Look out!

332
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,173
Back of the plane.

333
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,242
Uh, excuse me! Excuse me.

334
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,911
You're not allowed...

335
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,790
Looks like the game's still going.

336
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,923
_

337
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,173
It's impressive how you get these drugs

338
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,941
in the country just
by bribing small-time

339
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,276
airport officials.

340
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:33,877
I'm guessing you got about

341
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:36,513
five million bucks worth
of fentanyl in here.

342
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,769
So what?

343
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,801
You and your brother
here are gonna lecture me?

344
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,051
We were actually debating on whether

345
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,841
I should give you the 100K or not.

346
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:46,023
He says it's blood money.

347
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:49,993
- I agree.
- How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?

348
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,463
I don't have it.

349
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:58,681
Grab his guys, bring 'em
to the back and shoot 'em.

350
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,377
I don't think you want to add
murder to your arrest warrant.

351
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,173
Wait.

352
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:05,476
Arrest warrant?

353
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,044
That guy out there

354
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,797
is a DEA informant.

355
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,700
We have him in our pocket.

356
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,883
He owes us. He's got three vans

357
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:15,419
full of agents that are
waiting for his call.

358
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,955
They're gonna rain down
on you and your pills.

359
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,125
Unless you forgive my brother's debt.

360
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,427
Then our informant won't make the call.

361
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,395
Have your brother fighting
your battles, do you?

362
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:27,698
No.

363
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,766
Why don't you tell your
guys to drop the guns,

364
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,335
and you and I can have it out?

365
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,104
What do you say, Luca?

366
00:18:35,441 --> 00:18:37,107
Scare that guy off.

367
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,209
Bring these guys to the back.

368
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:40,911
They make a move, he makes a call.

369
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,847
Yeah? I think you're bluffing.

370
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:47,784
I warned you.

371
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:53,090
We got company.

372
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,897
You shoot us, there's
dozens of witnesses now.

373
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,267
Let's go.

374
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,920
All they had to see
were DEA hats and SUVs,

375
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,488
and they were gone.

376
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,990
Famous Michael Scofield.

377
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:31,314
Sheba. Thank you for everything.

378
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,699
You have no idea how happy
I am to see you back home.

379
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:37,634
We're not home yet.

380
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,736
All right, so what's next?

381
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:42,039
How do we get this son of a bitch?

382
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,574
We don't do anything.

383
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:45,242
Your part is over.

384
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:49,012
No, no, no, no, no, no.

385
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,847
Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.

386
00:19:50,883 --> 00:19:52,783
Poseidon... he knows your face.

387
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,786
Been tracking you
since you went to Yemen.

388
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,354
You've been a warrior,

389
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,056
and I owe you.

390
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:02,025
But your face is a liability
now to you and your family.

391
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:04,661
I don't want you to risk that.

392
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,633
They may know his face,
but they don't know mine.

393
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:15,172
It's the punch you don't see
coming that knocks you out.

394
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:17,808
That's my Sheba.

395
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,844
You take care of her, all right?

396
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,013
I take care of him, you mean.

397
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,051
- I love you, brother.
- Love you, too.

398
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,330
Be safe,

399
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,857
- okay?
- You, too.

400
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,593
- Bye.
- All right.

401
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:38,528
Well...

402
00:20:38,564 --> 00:20:40,297
when you need me again,

403
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,133
you know where to find me.

404
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,243
We'll transport her at 1600 hours.

405
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,879
Lay low until then. Thank you.

406
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,891
Hey?

407
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:10,527
That doesn't bother you...
What you just saw in there?

408
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,696
Down in the basement

409
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,865
with his wife, the woman
he says he fell for?

410
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,566
Stop.

411
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:21,071
I'm done with 21-Void after this.

412
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,643
After we get Scofield... Outis...

413
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:28,812
Whatever his name is...

414
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,814
I'm done.

415
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,750
That's all I ever wanted,
to get Gaines' killer, but

416
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,719
what he's got going in there...

417
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:38,121
That's not normal.

418
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,556
It's personal.

419
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,385
Something sicker.

420
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,728
There's no leaving
21-Void, Van. You know that.

421
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:49,733
He hired us because we are the best.

422
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,669
We can do whatever we want.

423
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:56,206
And if we want to
disappear after this...

424
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,482
we can disappear.

425
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:01,712
There's no getting out.

426
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:05,048
If you think that way...

427
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:07,584
then you're a prisoner, too.

428
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:24,108
The guy at the gate
said the vehicles split

429
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,669
five minutes after they got here.

430
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:27,789
Five minutes?

431
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,608
Something ain't right.

432
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,143
The product is still here.

433
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:35,445
Come on.

434
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:38,181
It was all staged.

435
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:40,014
Clever.

436
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:41,512
But Burrows is gonna die for it.

437
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:43,286
I don't know how we're gonna find him.

438
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:44,488
He's in the wind.

439
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:46,123
Maybe not.

440
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:47,990
EZ Pass transponders.

441
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,194
Santora's got a guy
at transit authority.

442
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,131
I bet you he can us what roads
they've been taking and when.

443
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,534
Then it's up to us to
comb the neighborhoods,

444
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:59,269
find the vehicles,

445
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:02,439
and put a bullet in that son
of a bitch once and for all.

446
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,557
_

447
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:15,363
Please keep your baggage
with you at all times.

448
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:18,033
Unattended baggage is a
security risk and may result...

449
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:20,502
I got a weird request.

450
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:23,538
If I give you some coordinates,
can you take me to 'em?

451
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:26,041
See what I can do.

452
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,288
No.

453
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,949
Unless this cab's got pontoons,

454
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:35,684
ain't gonna happen.

455
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:38,587
These coordinates are in
the middle of Lake Michigan.

456
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:56,938
This is it.

457
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:59,262
No lights.

458
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,376
I don't think they're here, Michael.

459
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,712
Unless that's what he wants us to think.

460
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:05,347
Come on.

461
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,694
Get ready to get us out
of here as fast as you can.

462
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:13,355
Linc.

463
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:20,095
Be careful.

464
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,593
Thanks.

465
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,786
What's wrong?

466
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,113
That's why Sara never responded.

467
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:56,387
I wasn't allowed to contact anyone,

468
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,233
but she was my wife.

469
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:01,236
I reached out to her in a way

470
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:02,804
I thought only she would know.

471
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,534
But he knew my ways, too.

472
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,797
Nothing.

473
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,300
_

474
00:27:13,303 --> 00:27:15,437
What are you doing?

475
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,239
That's not Sara, Michael.

476
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:20,791
He doesn't know I know that.

477
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,759
_

478
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,814
_

479
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,444
_

480
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:38,041
- _
- That's the right answer.

481
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:39,694
She's alive.

482
00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:41,963
He must be right there with her.

483
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:44,165
I'm gonna set a meeting.

484
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:46,361
And what, you're just gonna
show up and show your face?

485
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,036
Yes.

486
00:27:48,071 --> 00:27:50,672
That means Poseidon has
to show his face, too.

487
00:27:50,707 --> 00:27:53,741
And the endgame begins.

488
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,257
It's high noon, boss.

489
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:11,459
I'm not seeing him.

490
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:13,328
And you shouldn't. He's waiting for us

491
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:15,597
to push the first piece
out onto the board.

492
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:16,965
Which would be me?

493
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:21,302
Maybe not.

494
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,338
Black SUV.

495
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:28,243
Something I can help you with?

496
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:31,463
Car service. I'm here to
pick up a lady and child.

497
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,181
They got another ride. Hit the road.

498
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:35,617
Are you sure?

499
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:37,285
Hit the road.

500
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:42,457
Mark the black SUV.

501
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:44,692
No need. They were just here
to make you show your face.

502
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:46,361
Walk away, please. Now.

503
00:28:47,964 --> 00:28:50,131
Okay, act the tiniest bit flustered.

504
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,800
Now repeat these words back
to me loud enough to be heard:

505
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:54,135
"They didn't show.

506
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:55,837
I'm coming back to you now."

507
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,672
They didn't show.

508
00:28:57,707 --> 00:28:59,807
I'm coming back to you now.

509
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:07,148
Now we have a game.

510
00:29:07,184 --> 00:29:09,083
He's already revealed

511
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,019
his brother, his biggest piece.

512
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:13,988
Soon he'll have to
show his face. Trailer,

513
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:16,191
please take him down.

514
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,042
What the...?

515
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:48,756
I lost him.

516
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:50,124
Hey.

517
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,893
Can you hear me?

518
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:57,031
Damn it.

519
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,701
No signal.

520
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:06,174
What are you doing here?

521
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:07,508
I lost reception in the garage.

522
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:09,150
Damn it, you fell right into it.

523
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:10,686
Now they've got a mark on us.

524
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:24,125
Black sedan.

525
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:27,929
He's heading west.

526
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,656
Please!

527
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:56,124
Please, don't shoot.

528
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,499
You okay?

529
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:08,336
So that's what the dog
who's destroying my country

530
00:31:08,371 --> 00:31:09,937
looks like.

531
00:31:13,343 --> 00:31:14,776
Talk to me.

532
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:16,711
Michael, we found the car.

533
00:31:16,746 --> 00:31:19,047
We're on the corner of Third
and Washington by an alley.

534
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,481
Get here now.

535
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:22,884
He had Sara with him

536
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,886
- but we couldn't see her.
- What do you mean you couldn't see her?

537
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:26,616
There's no way we could have.

538
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:35,288
Oh, my God. Sara.

539
00:31:42,061 --> 00:31:44,161
There was no one

540
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,796
- in the backseat?
- No, the windows

541
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:47,898
were blacked out... We couldn't see.

542
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,536
What's that?

543
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,631
My son did this.

544
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,840
He's good.

545
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,376
There might be something here.

546
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:00,904
It's a ship.

547
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,879
A pirate ship with three pirates...

548
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,381
Man, woman and a boy.

549
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,116
That's me, Sara and... Mike.

550
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:08,175
What do you think that is?

551
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:10,487
It's a... it's a many-headed hydra

552
00:32:10,522 --> 00:32:12,322
reaching up to attack.

553
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:13,949
Think it's Jacob?

554
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,580
Must be.

555
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,394
- This is a message.
- You're telling me

556
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:19,463
Mikey's left something encoded in that?

557
00:32:19,498 --> 00:32:21,932
Yeah. Yeah, it's encoded in him.

558
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,533
He's got my DNA.

559
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,168
He didn't even know you were coming.

560
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,404
Sara must have told him. I don't know.

561
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,539
She must have told him I was coming.

562
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,542
There's definitely
something here. Definitely.

563
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:43,954
What is it?

564
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:47,048
It's one of Luca's guys.

565
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:49,025
What?

566
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:51,094
How the hell did he track us here?

567
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,501
I don't know. All I
know is all the chickens

568
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,744
are coming home to roost
at the worst possible time.

569
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:57,768
We got to go.

570
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:00,904
Linc?

571
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,643
I got it.

572
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:05,912
This ship, this galleon.

573
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:09,315
The body of water it's
on. I looked at the map.

574
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,202
There's a lake, a lake
shaped exactly like it,

575
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:13,753
up in the Finger Lakes district.

576
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,191
"Long lake."

577
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,189
This X

578
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:18,724
would be on the east shore of that lake.

579
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:22,573
He's telling us where he is.

580
00:33:22,576 --> 00:33:24,797
I'm trying to figure out if
you lost your mind or not.

581
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,867
There's only one way to find out.

582
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:29,268
- Uh-uh.
- What?

583
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:31,137
- You're going back to Buffalo.
- What?!

584
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:33,492
I want you to be with your
family, look after the refugees.

585
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:35,908
Linc, I'm a part of this fight, too...

586
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:43,983
What was that?

587
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:45,685
It's good-bye.

588
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:49,021
I could never forgive myself

589
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:52,291
if something happened to you.

590
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,945
_

591
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:11,377
Can I help you?

592
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:12,912
Yeah.

593
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:15,314
Can I rent a boat?

594
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,950
I want to take one out on the lake.

595
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:45,278
Been thinkin'.

596
00:34:47,382 --> 00:34:48,914
God...

597
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,917
I been thinking.

598
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:54,987
'Cause a hard bargain's
been presented to me,

599
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:57,790
and I'm considering something

600
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:59,959
that's-that's gonna seem like

601
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:02,128
the old Theodore Bagwell.

602
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:05,998
T-Bag.

603
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,270
And if that's indeed what's coming...

604
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:16,208
it won't be the work

605
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:19,111
of a cold-blooded man.

606
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:23,549
And it won't be for sin...

607
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:28,287
or for hate.

608
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,026
If there's blood on my hands,

609
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:36,128
know this, world...

610
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:41,033
it'll be for love.

611
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:08,928
How you doing, buddy?

612
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:10,229
I'm sick of the lake house.

613
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:11,897
I want to go home.

614
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:14,133
I know. I know.

615
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:16,702
We'll go home soon.

616
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:17,937
Don't worry.

617
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:20,115
Is Mom okay?

618
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,440
She's, uh...

619
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:22,942
she's a little under the weather.

620
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:24,176
She's just resting.

621
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,848
Everything will be fine, kiddo.

622
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:32,585
Everything will be back to
normal soon enough, okay?

623
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:29,323
Michael, go get him. And I'll be ready.

624
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,571
- Thanks, man, that was fun.
- Yeah, anytime.

625
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,573
Yeah, great. Thank you.

626
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,710
What kind of honorific is Whip?

627
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,681
Who's asking?

628
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:52,351
A man drawn into this by destiny.

629
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:55,021
Okay. How about you take off?

630
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:57,256
I don't exactly cotton to
strange men coming up to me

631
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,924
in the middle of the night, you know?

632
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,560
Only one person calls
me Whip... you ain't him.

633
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:04,230
Nobody calls you that.

634
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:08,776
Man who gave me this hand. Nobody.

635
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:12,567
Kaniel Outis.

636
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,241
Or for those of us who know him,

637
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:17,610
Michael Scofield.

638
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:23,182
Who are you?

639
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,951
We all got handles, don't we?

640
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:30,790
Outis. T-Bag. Whip.

641
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,793
But you're Dave Martin, aren't you?

642
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:38,531
How'd you know that?

643
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,899
Huh?

644
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:42,268
You better start talking, old man.

645
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:44,503
You don't want to tangle with this.

646
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:45,571
Neither do you.

647
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,609
All your answers are
right in here, all right?

648
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:53,345
West Virginia honky-tonk,

649
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,314
1991, pretty waitress,

650
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:57,990
bunch of personal business
between us after closing,

651
00:38:57,993 --> 00:39:00,753
and then I git, 'cause Johnny
Law's breathing down my neck.

652
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:02,688
Lacking a forwarding address,

653
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:06,284
I never heard from her again.

654
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,828
What are you trying to tell me?

655
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:13,332
Scofield was looking for
a partner, combing prisons,

656
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,335
looking for someone who
could handle himself.

657
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:20,506
And with your innate ability to thrive,

658
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,008
rising to the top in
even the worst of cages,

659
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,145
you reminded him of a certain someone.

660
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,581
And so he did a little research.

661
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:31,617
Wanted to know what we all want to know.

662
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:34,086
Did you learn it...

663
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,555
or was it ingrained in you?

664
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:41,961
It was ingrained in you, son.

665
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,432
You got it from me.

666
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:10,356
Linc, he's here.

667
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,558
- My son.
- Thank God.

668
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:14,693
Hold on.

669
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,731
Hold up.

670
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,633
I think Jacob's coming back.

671
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,970
I can't believe I'm seeing my son.

672
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,043
Something's wrong.

673
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,078
Sara's here, but...

674
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:35,915
- something's wrong.
- Don't do anything. He's coming back.

675
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,859
I'm going in.

676
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:52,717
It's not Jacob.

677
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:53,918
You're clear.

678
00:40:53,955 --> 00:40:55,901
Get your family. Get your son.

679
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,344
Burrows!

680
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:32,305
Hi, Mike.

681
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,510
You know who I am?

682
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:46,585
I got your map.

683
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:49,555
I'm gonna get you and
your mother out of here.

684
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,640
I... I didn't draw a map.

685
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:04,036
- Is someone in there with your mom?
- It's not...

686
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,472
We need to run.

687
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:22,162
