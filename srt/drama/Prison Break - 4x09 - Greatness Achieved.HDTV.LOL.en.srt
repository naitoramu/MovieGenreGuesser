1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,669
previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,809
What do you want with Scylla?

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,209
Same thing you want: bring down the Company.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,309
We need the pages.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,660
Are we partners?

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,569
Partners.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,479
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,760
I'm fine.

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,120
You don't look fine.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,989
Sorry.

11
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,450
Consider this a warning.

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,499
Linc, pull back!

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,720
It's a trap!

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,320
You all right?! Damn, you're hit!

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,479
All right, all right.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,349
You'll get your shot, now back off!

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,989
This is an attempt on my card.

18
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,259
How do you want to proceed?

19
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,389
I want it moved.

20
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,979
Move Scylla.

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,030
Now!

22
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,630
Now, tell the General you killed us.

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Otherwise, my hand, it ain't going to get tired.

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,710
I just hope your mouth gets tired.

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,370
That's funny.

26
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,600
Come on, buddy, come on.

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,480
Enough already, come on, Linc.

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,939
Believe me now?

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,710
Beating him isn't going to work, Lincoln.

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,280
You tried your way.

31
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,910
We want General Krantz to think Wyatt took us out.

32
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,919
even if you do break him, it does call the general

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,659
you don't think a trained military veteran

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,680
is going to hear the fear in his voice?

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,880
They're going to know he was coerced.

36
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,719
yeah£¬well, i need more time with them

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,049
I hear you, Linc, but he can't make the call if he's unconscious.

38
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,279
However we do it,

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,229
we better get what we need from Wyatt soon,

40
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,380
because Mahone ain't going to wait.

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid!

42
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,829
Lisa, what are we looking at?

43
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,659
Initial estimate is three days to complete the move of Scylla.

44
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,840
Unacceptable.

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,649
Respectfully, this is not as simple as unplugging

46
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,619
a laptop and moving it to another room.

47
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,549
The data on Scylla is too delicate.

48
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,929
I don't want excuses.

49
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,539
All I care is that it's done right and done right now.

50
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,529
I understand the urgency, but it will take three days.

51
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,519
And if I may speak freely, I think it's a mistake

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,479
to move Scylla to the Raven Rock bunker

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,819
when the Los Angeles facility

54
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,959
is one of the most secure ones we have.

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,459
The most secure location we have

56
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,370
is the one they don't know about.

57
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,969
Sir...

58
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,049
Still no word from Wyatt.

59
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,429
He only uses the company-issued cell,

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,679
so we can't track him.

61
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,959
We have no way of confirming

62
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,829
if he successfully completed his operation.

63
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,889
Keep calling him!

64
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,179
And draft a press release,

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,629
photographs, criminal records,

66
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,119
everything we have on Scofield, Burrows, all of them.

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,499
Tell our friends in the media I want them

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,099
to saturate the evening news and the morning papers.

69
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,809
I want it impossible for them

70
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,950
to walk down the streets of Los Angeles without being spotted.

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,599
I assume we haven't made much progress

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,879
with our friend over there?

73
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,329
Any suggestions?

74
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,710
How about we talk to him?

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,589
Great, want to give him some milk and cookies

76
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,829
while you're at it? No.

77
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,050
How about just some nice conversation?

78
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,729
So they sent florence nightingale

79
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,889
To get me all ready to cooperate.

80
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,360
Actually,I'm here to help you,despite what you've done.

81
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,829
Because I'm still a doctor and you're a prisoner.

82
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,430
You're going to save me?

83
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,609
Don self has a metal case out there

84
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,769
And I don't know what's in it.

85
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,189
I imagine you don't want to find out,

86
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,909
So I figure if you and I had a talk...

87
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,150
You'd make me see the light.

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,600
If you don't call the general,you're as good as dead.

89
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,939
I've already been a lot of things

90
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,810
Worse than dead in my life,doctor.

91
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,420
You better have more than that to threaten me with.

92
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,609
Come on,mike,she's okay.

93
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,309
He's a professional killer.

94
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,499
Don't worry,he's locked up.

95
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,640
Let's go.

96
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,620
Come on,let's go!

97
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,859
So what'd you do with roland's body?

98
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,140
Roland?

99
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,059
He's been,uh,reconfigured

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,959
And given a permanent resting place.

101
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,769
Good. take his bowling shirts

102
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,559
And the rest of his crap with you when you leave.

103
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,239
Come on linc,the guy died.

104
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,399
He died a punk! he ratted us out,bellick.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,710
You guys,you deal with the matter at hand.

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,279
Assuming these pages are correct,

107
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,890
And there's no way of knowing that they actually are...

108
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,299
We follow this basement hallway through the boiler room to here.

109
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,159
There's some kind of elevated walkway.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,779
We follow that to the end,

111
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,309
And we've covered most of the distance

112
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,069
Between gate and the company's headquarters.

113
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,619
What's this thing at the end of the walkway?

114
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,959
I don't know-- whistler marked it with an "x"

115
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
So I'm thinking it's some kind of wall or serious impediment.

116
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,419
That's why we're going down there prepared.

117
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,659
Tools,thermal lances,sledgehammers...

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,579
Okay,so we get through that wall...

119
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,100
What's on the other side?

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,589
Again,I don't know.

121
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,609
It's because gretchen has the rest of the pages.

122
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,019
But once we're through this location,

123
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,419
We can't go any further until she gives them back.

124
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,779
What's her game in all this?

125
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,979
I mean,if she wants the company to go down,

126
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,469
She should just give us the pages.

127
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,289
Look,we're going to deal with gretchen

128
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,779
When the time is right,okay?

129
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,399
You guys need

130
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,549
To go to gate and get started.

131
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,549
I'm going to stay here with wyatt

132
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,060
And make sure we get what we need.

133
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,499
No more dawdlin' now.

134
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,000
Move your ass.

135
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,580
High gear,gentlemen,high gear.

136
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,380
My boss will be here any minute.

137
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,889
I assume I don't have to mention that discretion is paramount.

138
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,149
In other words,silence is golden.

139
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,099
You just make sure you stay in your office

140
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,439
And you keep other people out.

141
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,159
Oh,I'll stay in my nice,

142
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,599
Air-conditioned office,pretty.

143
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,050
And you can crawl down into your little hole now.

144
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,160
go

145
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,630
Go ahead,crawl.

146
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,330
Vamonos.

147
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,349
Cole? what the hell is going on here?

148
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,890
Mr. white,are you back already?

149
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,689
How are you?

150
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,579
Fine,until I found a resignation fax

151
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,770
Waiting for me from andrew blauner.

152
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,999
A resignation?

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,419
Yeah,I can't get him on the phone,

154
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,909
I reached out to his fiance,

155
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,049
She hasn't seen or heard from him.

156
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,640
She's worried sick.

157
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,209
He's probably on a bit of a bender,

158
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,529
Just sleeping it off somewhere.

159
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,499
Blauner? he's a boy scout.

160
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
None of this makes any sense,cole.

161
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,770
But I'll tell you what,

162
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,150
I'm going to look into it.

163
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,929
Let me know if I can be of any assistance.

164
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,989
Good morning.

165
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,400
Assistance...

166
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,520
What is that sound?

167
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,669
I hope you're having

168
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,869
A lovely enjoyable morning,

169
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,439
Because while you are nowhere to be found,

170
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,799
There is sleuthing going on here

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,630
Regarding the whereabouts of one mr. andrew blauner.

172
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,379
And?

173
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,659
And if I'm going down for this little homicide,

174
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,709
I ain't going alone.

175
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,679
We're going together like traffic and weather.

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,829
Relax, okay?

177
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,790
They'll never find the body where I put it.

178
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,560
Now, where are scofield and burrows?

179
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,929
Just doing their end of the bargain.

180
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,270
Which begs the question, what the hell are you doing?

181
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
Me?

182
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,340
I'm getting ready for a meeting.

183
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,980
So, your friends have been calling a lot.

184
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,780
They must be wondering where you are.

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,990
That's right.

186
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,269
They're wondering, and the longer they do,

187
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,940
The more danger you're in.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,549
Call the general, and say what they want you to say.

189
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,679
And what? you'll let me go?

190
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,759
No, but don self will make sure

191
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,779
That you spend the rest of your life

192
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,500
In a decent facility without the death penalty.

193
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,629
Either way,

194
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,170
If I make the call or not,

195
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,170
I'm dead.

196
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,730
You know that.

197
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,989
And we both know that you, as a doctor,

198
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,820
Won't let that happen.

199
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,069
So, please,

200
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,619
Let's you and I figure a way

201
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,950
Out of this mess that works for everybody.

202
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,419
Sit your ass down! get out of my way!

203
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,809
Out! out!

204
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,080
I will cuff your ass to that table, okay?

205
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,499
All right, I know this is hard.

206
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,619
And I know what you want to do.

207
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,539
Okay, but I'm trying to do something here

208
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,349
And you need to deal with that reality.

209
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,299
Have you lost a kid?

210
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,080
Yeah, I did, too.

211
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,010
My wife was pregnant.

212
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,280
And there were complications and the doctor messed up.

213
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,440
And she...

214
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,740
And they both...

215
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,779
They didn't make it.

216
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,370
Okay? so I understand.

217
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,819
What would you do if you were me

218
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,899
And that doctor was right there?

219
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,199
it's right

220
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,949
What would you do?

221
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,240
I don't know what I would do.

222
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,479
Look, I'm giving you my word.

223
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,360
When the time is right, I won't stand in your way.

224
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,319
When the time is right I won't let you.

225
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,669
Okay. okay.

226
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,950
Did you see the way mahone was looking at wyatt?

227
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,749
The guy is hurting.

228
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,900
It was more than just hurting, that's pain.

229
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,990
I never cared about anything like that.

230
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,830
I look at what I've done with my life,

231
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,679
Beating on cons at fox river, chasing money,

232
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,640
Trying to keep my own ass out of prison.

233
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,650
This the pathway you talking about?

234
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,179
According to the map,

235
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,869
This runs almost the length of that courtyard.

236
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,559
It should put us directly beneath company headquarters.

237
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,310
Shh, listen.

238
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,110
There it is again.

239
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,560
What's that noise, scofield?

240
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,830
I don't know.

241
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,559
Okay, just so we're clear, we get to go up that ladder

242
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,880
Towards the noise that we don't know what it is.

243
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,440
But if we're lucky, we get to basically just

244
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,580
Walk smack into the company?

245
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,240
Sounds about right.

246
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,170
You up for it?

247
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,710
Oh, yeah, after you.

248
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,219
I am no different than that man

249
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,790
Over there... who wants to kill me.

250
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,979
Alexander mahone was forced to do things by the company,

251
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,560
And so was i.

252
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,240
But I know people.

253
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,080
People in government.

254
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,200
People that can help you and michael.

255
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,520
I can give you a phone number.

256
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,150
Arrangements can be made.

257
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,420
All you have to do is trust me

258
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,190
And this will all be over.

259
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,710
It is over.

260
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,409
Has, um, white had anything new to say about blauner?

261
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,700
No, but he might.

262
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,810
Mr. pfeiffer?

263
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,230
That would be moi.

264
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,710
Detective conor mara.

265
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,070
I was hoping I could talk to you about andrew blauner.

266
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,989
Of course.

267
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,150
Great.

268
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,070
It's down this way.

269
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,410
This is it!

270
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,000
This is where the sound was coming from.

271
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,200
One of the main conduit pipes for the la water supply.

272
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,020
30,000 gallons of water rushing through this very spot.

273
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,439
Every second. oh, great.

274
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,939
There's got to be some other way to get around it,

275
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,289
Some other pathway or something.

276
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,389
No, we took the only pathway down

277
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,960
And it leads right here.

278
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,129
How about over it?

279
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,740
We can't risk tunneling too close to the surface.

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,120
What do we do?

281
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,370
We dig.

282
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,919
Truth be told, uh,

283
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,859
Mr. blauner isn't officially a missing person,

284
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,809
But his fiance has a cousin at the mayor's office

285
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,890
So, here we are.

286
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,230
Here we are.

287
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,239
Hey, that's not to say though that there

288
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,200
Aren't some things that concern me.

289
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,400
Really? such as?

290
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,589
Well, the fax that came into white's office

291
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,390
Came from a copy shop,

292
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,070
But blauner had a fax machine at his house.

293
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,149
Okay.

294
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,809
And about a half hour after he resigned,

295
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,929
His car was seen leaving the gate garage.

296
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,869
Now, the driver couldn't be identified,

297
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,529
But it appeared as though a woman's hands

298
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,510
Were seen gripping the steering wheel.

299
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,149
Let me stop you right there.

300
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,109
It always seemed to me that mr. blauner was,

301
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,189
How can I put this delicately,

302
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,399
Um, a swordsman.

303
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,600
You know what I mean?

304
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,130
Actually, I don't.

305
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,959
He might be dipping his snout into a different trough,

306
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,700
And the fiance is none the wiser.

307
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,959
From what I've, uh, heard about him from his other co-workers,

308
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,589
That doesn't sound too likely.

309
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,349
If you don't mind me asking, what is that banging noise?

310
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,600
That's, uh...

311
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,169
It's trouble with the pipes.

312
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,789
You know, they loosened up, it was a moderate quake

313
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,579
And now they shake more than the trembler itself.

314
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,159
Mr. pfeiffer, uh, some people here

315
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,799
Have told me that you and blauner didn't get along.

316
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,110
Would you mind talking to me a little bit about that?

317
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,849
A few years ago, a partner of mine did this same move

318
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,469
Against an enemy combatant we picked up

319
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,799
At the new mexico border-- this guy didn't want to talk,

320
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,160
He didn't know anything.

321
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,650
It worked then, it should work now.

322
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,510
Is that ambulance you got us still out back?

323
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,609
Hey, come on, pal, I got almost a decade on you

324
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,969
And you don't see me sucking air.

325
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,430
I got shot, brad.

326
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,560
Guys, we ain't making any progress here.

327
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,509
There's nothing beneath this cement but granite.

328
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,600
We couldn't get through it with a jackhammer.

329
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,409
Maybe we should go back to the warehouse,

330
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,369
Find another way.

331
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,010
There is no other way. this is it!

332
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,209
This is where the plans lead; this is our way to scylla.

333
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,230
What?

334
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,980
We got millions of gallons of water in this drain pipe.

335
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,020
We can't go under it, we can't go over it.

336
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,340
I know.

337
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
maybe we can go through it

338
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,160
It's loose!

339
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,200
All right, linc, this ought to do it.

340
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,659
After I'm done, how much time we got?

341
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,750
Not a lot.

342
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,600
Be careful.

343
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,010
You, too.

344
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,650
When I was a little boy, I had an old tomcat named rufus.

345
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,110
He was a good mouser.

346
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,160
Tough as nails, solid feline all around.

347
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,529
One day, I bring home this little kitty

348
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,160
From a giveaway box outside the pic 'n save.

349
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,580
Old rufus didn't like that one bit.

350
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,019
He arched his back, hissed like a rattlesnake

351
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,819
And sprang out his claws like a switchblade.

352
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,910
You know,

353
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,269
That new little kitty didn't do nothing wrong

354
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,969
But be new.

355
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,529
Now, that's all I did.

356
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,939
I was being new, and blauner was being

357
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,519
This old tomcat spraying his territory.

358
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,219
Now, I don't hold that against him.

359
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,429
If he didn't protect his turf I'd question his character.

360
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,349
But aside from a little jealousy on his part,

361
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,179
Our issues were as thin as tissues.

362
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,940
I assure you that.

363
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,509
Detective, I pulled blauner's travel schedule

364
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,160
As per your request. thank you.

365
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,460
Uh, what's this?

366
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,129
Uh, sir, uh, we need to step out

367
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,180
For a few more bracket-joints for the shelving.

368
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,419
Uh, all right, yeah.

369
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,229
But I ain't paying you to stop for, uh,

370
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,849
A coffee and donuts, so get back here toot sweet.

371
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,450
Hey, wait up, manuel.

372
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,439
I hired some men, uh, out of my own pocket of course,

373
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,709
To, uh, add some built-in uh,

374
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,210
Uh, storage in my closet-- I hope you don't mind.

375
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,690
Here's the monthly breakdown of where he traveled...

376
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,099
You're gonna talk to me now?

377
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,840
Me? no.

378
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,550
We're done talking...

379
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,950
But you're not.

380
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,940
They are all dead. it's over.

381
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,590
This will all be over.

382
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,550
This will all be over.

383
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,570
It's over.

384
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,019
They are dead. they are all dead.

385
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,260
It's over.

386
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,540
I'm going to take this.

387
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,600
Self...

388
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,160
Can you take a walk?

389
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
Come on, sara, we should go.

390
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,980
Let's go outside.

391
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,960
My son's autopsy report said that he'd...

392
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,980
That he'd been shot twice.

393
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,260
Once in the stomach...

394
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,850
Why, man?

395
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,740
Why?! just to terrify my wife?!

396
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,260
And then a full five minutes later,

397
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,780
Right in the...

398
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,730
You too will suffer.

399
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,950
And when...

400
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,950
And when you can't stand the pain anymore,

401
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,140
You'll make a phone call for me.

402
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:49,289
You know, scofield said that torture wouldn't work

403
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,209
Because the general would hear the fear in your voice.

404
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,540
But the thing is...

405
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,229
...i want the person on the other end

406
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,120
Of my call to hear the fear

407
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,730
In your voice.

408
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,440
Press release, sir.

409
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,179
In short, it sets forth that members

410
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,219
Of the fox river eight and their accomplices

411
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,220
Are alive and well in los angeles.

412
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,470
Where have you been?

413
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,340
They are all dead.

414
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,930
It's over. good work.

415
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,980
Your payment will be left where we arranged.

416
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,000
This is no longer necessary.

417
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,020
Go ahead.

418
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,599
The access code

419
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,170
To the covert entrance

420
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,440
Is still both your daughters' birthdays.

421
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
Everyone leave us alone.

422
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
I said

423
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,160
Everyone leave us alone.

424
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,020
It's okay.

425
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,480
She won't hurt me.

426
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,560
Lisa...

427
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,160
I knew you'd come home.

428
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,439
So, how are you holding up, you know,

429
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,270
Not being with lj and all?

430
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,629
Good, he's a smart kid. he can look after himself.

431
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,770
I can see it, how much you love him.

432
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,340
My dad died when I was a little kid.

433
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,370
But he was a good father.

434
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,810
Let's just focus and get this thing done, all right?

435
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,569
Michael said the manual override

436
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,560
Should be somewhere near the main conduit.

437
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,570
This look like the main conduit to you?

438
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,830
One way to find out.

439
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,319
That look like it to you?

440
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,319
Looks like it.

441
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,450
Fire it up.

442
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,130
All right, let's get out of here.

443
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,869
Hurry up, bro!

444
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,230
Almost done, buddy.

445
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,720
All right, ease it back.

446
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,940
It worked.

447
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,630
How long we got?

448
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,650
I don't know.

449
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,109
Water cut off to thousands of people.

450
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,559
The city will probably have that taken care of in about an hour,

451
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,569
Which means we've got... 60 minutes

452
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,670
To do 90 minutes worth of work.

453
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,050
Or we don't get to scylla.

454
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,360
What's wrong, papi?

455
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,330
Mike.

456
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,929
Michael! michael!

457
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,100
What's wrong, papi?!

458
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,480
Papi, talk to me!

459
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,349
What's wrong?! talk to me!

460
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,390
Michael!

461
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,330
Michael, what's wrong?!

462
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,250
Michael

463
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,470
You want some water?

464
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm okay.

465
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,400
You're alot of things right now, my friend,

466
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,300
And okay ain't one of them.

467
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,120
You know, I may not be the smartest guy,

468
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,010
But I hear things.

469
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,169
Sara and your brother

470
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,650
Have been talking about you not feeling well or something.

471
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,150
Look, I'm just, I'm just saying.

472
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,590
I need your help.

473
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,250
So, please, just, uh...

474
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,650
...cover for me.

475
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,200
You got it.

476
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,490
Truth is, gretchen, I know you better than you know yourself.

477
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,350
So you keep telling me.

478
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,819
When I first met you, you were a 20 year old girl

479
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,599
Who'd just been dumped by the wheeling police academy

480
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,010
For failing her psych evaluation.

481
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,519
But where those good old west virginia boys

482
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,529
Could only see an emotional disconnect

483
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,679
With traces of sociopathic tendencies,

484
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,189
I saw a machiavellian streak

485
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,900
That would make failure an impossibility.

486
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,929
I had to let wyatt do what he did

487
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,240
Because I needed to know...

488
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,909
...what my little bulldog may have known

489
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,680
About whistler and his plans for scylla.

490
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,400
I told you that I knew nothing.

491
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,680
You should have believed me.

492
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,480
I knew you'd never take it personally,

493
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,689
Because you are, and have been

494
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,950
Ever since I took you under my wing...

495
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,280
...my girl.

496
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,680
My girl.

497
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,159
The most sensitive nerve endings are right here.

498
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,349
That's why acupuncturists avoid placing needles

499
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,849
Anywhere near them because opening up

500
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,880
The nerve endings in the fingertip--

501
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,010
Even a little pinprick--

502
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,210
Can result in quite a painful hot flash.

503
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,769
So a five inch needle

504
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,110
Being driven up the length of the finger...

505
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,179
...can make your insides feel like they're on fire.

506
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,800
Another fact of physiology,

507
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,320
The human body when in extreme duress begins to shut down.

508
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,199
Brain activity decreases and your heart rate slows

509
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,539
Until you just can't feel the pain anymore.

510
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,589
And that's where the heart monitor and the battery come in.

511
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,479
'cause when your heart rate dips below 50,

512
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,700
That battery will give you a wake-up call,

513
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,559
Preventing your body from shutting down.

514
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,870
And then you will feel every ounce...

515
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,420
Of the pain.

516
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,000
And that's when you're going to beg me to make the phone call.

517
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,060
What can I do you for?

518
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,479
I... I found some more inconsistencies

519
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,880
In your sales reports.

520
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,360
Listen up here.

521
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,889
From that little computer of yours,

522
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,440
Can you access into gate's records?

523
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,729
If I access the network as an administrator,

524
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,070
I can see the files in a non-pdf format.

525
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,429
I don't know what that means, but I assume it was a yes.

526
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,449
So you let your fingers do the walking across that keyboard

527
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,219
And you get me my sales records.

528
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,639
You are hurting my arm.

529
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,399
And don't make me hurt any more of you.

530
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,640
Now, go.

531
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,650
That's good work.

532
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,100
Here.

533
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,520
I need you to measure this hole.

534
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,350
And then make one of the same size in the wall opposite.

535
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,800
How?

536
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,980
You got a belt?

537
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,229
We have less than 30 minutes

538
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,810
Until this pipe is flooded with water again.

539
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,750
Acceptance is important, wyatt.

540
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,550
I had to accept that my son is gone.

541
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,080
And you have to accept that your life,

542
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,600
Your very, very short life-span ahead of you

543
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,630
Is just going to be filled with agonizing pain.

544
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,490
At least until you do what I've asked of you.

545
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,760
And then...

546
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,930
Then the pain will go away.

547
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,140
We're running out of time!

548
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,370
Aw, man. what's wrong?

549
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
The stupid thing is empty!

550
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,080
All right.

551
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,010
i'm coming in

552
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,290
You can't do this, bro.

553
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,440
Just finish it.

554
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,760
It's me.

555
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,520
What's going on?

556
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,290
Somebody needs to tell you something.

557
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,800
You call her by her first name.

558
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,480
Pam...

559
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,560
I'm... sorry.

560
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,150
It's over.

561
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,900
And I love you.

562
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,860
I love you.

563
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,669
This thing is heavy!

564
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,360
Sure, show up when all the hard work is done.

565
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,170
All right, ease it back.

566
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,419
We heard on the radio

567
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,390
That dwp is going to have the water running in 10 minutes.

568
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,030
You all right?

569
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,739
The sleeve is too heavy

570
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,349
To just slide it through the pipe.

571
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,330
Two of us are going to have to go inside

572
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,629
And guide it through that other hole.

573
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,300
That pipe can flood at any time.

574
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,479
I'll do it.

575
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,619
I'll go, too.

576
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,090
No, I'll go.

577
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,639
Oh, no offense, college boy,

578
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,269
But this sucker's heavy.

579
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,360
You're going to need a little bulk down there.

580
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,350
All right.

581
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,579
Use this to brace the sleeve

582
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,650
When you pull it through to the other side.

583
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,810
And, uh...

584
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,650
Let's get the hell out of there, all right?

585
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,870
How's emmy?

586
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,959
I didn't come here to listen to you

587
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,670
Pretend to care about her...

588
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,790
Or me.

589
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,970
I came here to tell you that I'm a free agent now.

590
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,800
The community we run with know that I'm alive and available.

591
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,619
I can just as easily work for one of them as I can for you.

592
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,229
So the question is, what's your offer?

593
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,039
Actually, the question for you is

594
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,970
Why would you want to go anywhere else?

595
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,390
It's not a time for grudges, gretchen.

596
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,040
It's a time for coming together.

597
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,550
The salad days are fast approaching.

598
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,510
Laos worked perfectly.

599
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,540
Soon the populace will turn to us--

600
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,429
The leaders of the military,

601
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,110
Finance and energy-- to right the ship.

602
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,780
And then...

603
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,089
We'll rebuild this country in our own image.

604
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,220
And when we do, I want you there beside me, gretchen.

605
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,030
As my number two, like I always promised.

606
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,370
What about lisa?

607
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,340
I've already told you.

608
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,710
You're my girl.

609
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,830
Come on.

610
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,020
Over there.

611
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,890
Right up there.

612
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,020
You and I are the same,

613
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,530
Alex.

614
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,550
I've done things...

615
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,309
Push!

616
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,339
Keep going, keep going!

617
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,160
Keep going! keep going!

618
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,199
Yeah, it's good right there.

619
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,009
You got it?

620
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,940
That's it.

621
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,840
I don't know how long that's going to hold.

622
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,999
All we got to do is pull this thing through.

623
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,420
Oh, my god. come on, guys, push!

624
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,419
Oh! it broke!

625
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,090
it broke!

626
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,510
Mr. white...

627
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,419
I'm sorry to bother you, but, uh, after my talk

628
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,889
With detective mara, I was thinking about mr. blauner

629
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,769
And some of the conversations we had.

630
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,809
Salesmen are a lot like fishermen, right?

631
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,780
Always bragging about their big catch.

632
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,069
Well, andy never talked about his sales,

633
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,529
No matter how much I pried.

634
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:00,290
So I took the liberty of... looking them up.

635
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,840
And there were, to say the least...

636
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,140
Irregularities.

637
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,879
T-bag good afternoon to you, too, andy.

638
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,019
Two of your top buyers don't have valid

639
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,299
Social security numbers.

640
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,819
I checked out the social security numbers

641
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,170
Of the clients he allegedly sold gate workshops to.

642
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,499
In some cases the numbers are just pure fabrications.

643
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,659
But the checks must've cleared.

644
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,379
He's must've been money laundering for god only knows

645
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,759
What kind of criminal exploits.

646
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,190
The point is...

647
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,699
If the good officer gets his hands on these papers, you know

648
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,750
You're going to be up to your eyeballs in irs auditors.

649
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,379
I suggest you go tell mr. mara

650
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,539
That you found some irregularities

651
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,250
In blauner's expenses.

652
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,900
Writing off personal matters, et cetera.

653
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,829
This will explain why he disappeared

654
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,210
And will placate the po-po.

655
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,590
Okay.

656
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,710
Listen, detective...

657
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,159
Pick it up! pick it up!

658
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,670
I can't, it's too heavy!

659
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,210
The brace must have snapped.

660
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,590
Let's try and get it up!

661
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,500
It's not moving!

662
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,610
The water's coming.

663
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,520
The water's coming! come on!

664
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,899
We got to leave it there.

665
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,640
But then we'll never get scylla.

666
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,110
We don't have a choice.

667
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,939
You don't, I do.

668
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,240
What the hell are you doing?!

669
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,219
What the hell are you doing?!

670
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,570
Brad, don't do this! brad!

671
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,270
Grab it, grab it, now!

672
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,539
The water's coming!

673
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,160
Get your ass up here, now!

674
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,360
Come on, come on!

675
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,830
You hear that?

676
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,680
They're flooding the pipe.

677
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,460
Linc! get out of there!

678
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,329
It's too loud, he can't hear you!

679
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,490
Linc!

680
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,449
Come on, man, there's still enough room

681
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,599
For you to get through the hole.

682
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,359
I let go of this you could drop it.

683
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,660
It's too heavy!

684
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,720
Brad, drop the sleeve

685
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,170
And get out of there!

686
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,730
Don't do this.

687
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,480
You have a son!

688
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,239
Don't do this. don't do this!

689
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,080
Push it! push it, scofield!

690
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,870
come on, push it through

691
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,000
Push!

692
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,070
Push it!

693
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,040
Push it! push it!

694
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,560
Brad! brad, no!

695
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,230
Brad, no!

696
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,170
Brad! brad!

697
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,130
Brad, no!

698
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,970
Brad! brad!

699
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,399
You can all come back in now.

700
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,810
Everything's fine.

701
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,140
It always was.

702
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,350
You're okay?

703
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,810
Couldn't be better.

704
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,379
more important

705
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,819
What's happening with scylla?

706
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,329
I'll tell you in private.

707
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,620
You can tell me in front of gretchen.

708
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,560
Not until I say something else.

709
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,259
If you ever come near him with a gun again...

710
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,490
You'll what?

711
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,680
That will do.

712
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,560
Scylla.

713
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,539
We got preliminary safeguards in place

714
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,480
Faster than we expected.

715
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,510
We could move scylla tomorrow if we wanted,

716
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,050
But now that wyatt's eliminated scofield and burrows,

717
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,470
There's no need.

718
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,800
Scofield and burrows are dead?

719
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,990
Dead as latin.

720
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,490
Go ahead with the plan.

721
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,209
If a couple of boys from illinois

722
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,570
Could get that close, it's time to mix things up.

723
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,920
I want scylla out of los angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.

724
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,720
He wouldn't climb up.

725
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:03,960
He just wouldn't climb up.

726
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,549
Where does the south pipe lead to?

727
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,480
Maybe we can follow... no.
