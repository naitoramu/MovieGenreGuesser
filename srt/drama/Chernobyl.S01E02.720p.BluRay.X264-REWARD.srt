1
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,481
You work too hard.

2
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,281
- Where is everyone?
- Oh, they refused to come in.

3
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,561
- Why?
- It's Saturday.

4
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,881
- Why did you come in?
- I work too hard.

5
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,721
It's boiling in here.

6
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:00,001
8 milliroentgen. A leak?

7
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,561
No. It would've gone off before.

8
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,681
- It's coming from outside.
- The Americans?

9
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,641
Iodine 131.

10
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,201
It's not military,
it's uranium decay U-235.

11
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,361
Reactor fuel?

12
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,761
Ignalina,
maybe 240 kilometres away.

13
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:11,801
Yes, this is Ulana Khomyuk with
the Institute of Nuclear And...

14
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:13,841
Looking for...

15
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,801
All right. Stay calm.

16
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,561
They're at 4. It's not them.

17
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:29,001
- Who's the next closest?
- It's Chernobyl.

18
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,201
That's not possible.
They're 400 kilometres away.

19
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,361
That's too far
for 8 milliroentgen.

20
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,841
They'd have to be split open.

21
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,801
Maybe they know something.

22
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,881
- Iodine.
- Could it be a waste dump?

23
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:50,521
We'd be seeing other isotopes.

24
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:54,201
Nuclear test?
Er... New kind of bomb?

25
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:57,561
We'd have heard. That's what
half our people work on here.

26
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,521
Something
with a space programme,

27
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:02,601
like a satellite or...

28
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,561
No-one's answering the phone.

29
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,961
- Get everyone started on an IV.
- We don't have enough.

30
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,041
- All the children, then.
- We don't have enough.

31
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,201
As many as you can.

32
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,001
- Where's the old man?
- He set up a burn ward in 16.

33
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,441
What are you doing?
What is that?

34
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:51,761
Milk. It's milk.

35
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,761
- Much better than water.
- Stop. Stop!

36
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:54,961
What are you doing?

37
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:58,521
These are radiation burns.
Their clothes are contaminated.

38
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,041
Help me!

39
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,881
Get it all off.

40
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,721
We're taking it down
to the basement.

41
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,161
He was a firefighter
from Chernobyl.

42
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:11,761
Can you stop pushing, please?

43
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,481
Hey! Get him!

44
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:21,201
Just get...

45
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,361
Why are you keeping us out here?

46
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,241
Professor Legasov.

47
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,001
Oh, no, not yet. They're
finishing up other business.

48
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,281
It'll be a few more minutes.
Can I get you some tea?

49
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,281
- No. I'm fine, thank you.
- Care to read

50
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,561
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina's
report while you wait?

51
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,321
Certainly, thank you.

52
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,721
All right, Professor,
they're ready.

53
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,281
Professor Legasov?

54
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,761
Thank you all for your duty
to this commission.

55
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,561
We will begin with Deputy
Chairman Shcherbina's briefing,

56
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:13,321
and then we will discuss
next steps if necessary.

57
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:15,121
Thank you,
Comrade General Secretary.

58
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,481
I'm pleased to report

59
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,361
that the situation
in Chernobyl is stable.

60
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:22,201
Military and civilian
patrols have secured the region

61
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,041
and Colonel General Pikalov,

62
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,881
who commands troops specialising
in chemical hazards,

63
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,161
has been dispatched
to the plant.

64
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:32,001
In terms of radiation,
plant director Bryukhanov

65
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:35,161
reports no more
than 3.6 roentgen.

66
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,721
I'm told it's the equivalent
of a chest X-ray,

67
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,521
so if you're overdue
for a check-up...

68
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,641
- And foreign press?
- Totally unaware.

69
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,841
KGB First Deputy Chairman
Charkov assures me

70
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,681
we have successfully protected
our security interests.

71
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,881
Good. Very good.

72
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,801
Well, it seems like
it's well in hand,

73
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:55,961
so... if there's nothing else,

74
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:57,521
meeting adjourned.

75
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,361
No!

76
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:05,761
- Pardon me?
- Er... we can't adjourn.

77
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,521
This is Professor Legasov
of the Kurchatov Institute.

78
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,601
Professor,
if you have any concerns,

79
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,521
feel free to address them
with me later.

80
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:15,241
I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

81
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,121
Page three,
the section on casualties.

82
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:22,321
Er..."A fireman
was severely burned

83
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:26,441
on his hand by a chunk of smooth
black mineral on the ground,

84
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,001
outside the reactor building."

85
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:29,921
Smooth black mineral. Graphite.

86
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:32,521
There's graphite on the ground.

87
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,641
Well, there was a tank
explosion. There's debris.

88
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:39,001
And what importance that...

89
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,961
There's only one place
where you will find graphite.

90
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:45,121
Inside the core. If there's
graphite on the ground outside,

91
00:09:45,281 --> 00:09:47,721
it means it wasn't a control
system tank that exploded,

92
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,841
it was the reactor core.
It's open.

93
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:56,841
- Um... Comrade Shcherbina.
- Comrade General Secretary,

94
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,161
I can assure you
Professor Legasov is mistaken.

95
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:01,801
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

96
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,121
- And as for the radiation...
- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

97
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,721
which, by the way, is not the
equivalent of one chest X-ray,

98
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,601
but rather 400 chest X-rays...

99
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,361
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

100
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:15,121
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

101
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,881
They gave us
the number they had.

102
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,641
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

103
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:23,121
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

104
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,601
of four million chest X-rays
in his hand.

105
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:28,001
Legasov, there's no place
for alarmist hysteria...

106
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,641
It's not alarmist
if it's a fact.

107
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,001
Well,
I don't hear any facts at all.

108
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,201
All I hear
is a man I don't know,

109
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,081
engaging in conjecture,
in direct contradiction

110
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,801
to what has been reported
by Party officials.

111
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,921
Um... er... I apologise.

112
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,041
I didn't mean... er...

113
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,841
Please,
may I express my concern

114
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:52,761
as calmly and as respectfully...

115
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:55,001
- Professor Legasov...
- Boris.

116
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,881
I will allow it.

117
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:16,641
An RBMK reactor
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

118
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:21,841
Every atom of U-235
is like a bullet,

119
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:24,041
travelling at nearly
the speed of light,

120
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,561
penetrating everything
in its path -

121
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,561
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

122
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,401
Every gram of U-235

123
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,721
holds over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

124
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,041
That's in one gram.

125
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:40,081
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

126
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,361
and right now it is on fire.

127
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,481
Winds will carry
radioactive particles

128
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,001
across the entire continent.

129
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,961
Rain will bring them
down on us.

130
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:52,401
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

131
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,561
in the... in the air we breathe,

132
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,521
the water we drink,
the food we eat.

133
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,281
Most of these bullets will not
stop firing for 100 years.

134
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:08,161
Some of them
not for 50,000 years.

135
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,881
Yes, and this concern...

136
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:15,641
..stems entirely from
the description of a rock?

137
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:21,641
Yes.

138
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:24,801
Hm...

139
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,761
Comrade Shcherbina...

140
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,921
I want you to go to Chernobyl.

141
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:34,721
You take a look at the reactor,
you personally,

142
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,441
and you report
directly back to me.

143
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:39,041
Wise decision,
Comrade General Secretary.

144
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,041
And take Professor Legasov
with you.

145
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,481
Oh.

146
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:46,481
Forgive me, Comrade General
Secretary, but I don't...

147
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,761
Do you know
how a nuclear reactor works?

148
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,161
- No.
- No.

149
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:55,121
Well, then, how will you know
what you're looking at?

150
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,081
Meeting adjourned.

151
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,401
How does a nuclear reactor work?

152
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,841
- What?
- It's a simple question.

153
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:02,321
- It's hardly a simple answer.
- Of course.

154
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:05,081
You presume
I'm too stupid to understand.

155
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:08,161
So I'll restate: tell me
how a nuclear reactor works

156
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,161
or one of these soldiers will
throw you out of the helicopter.

157
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,641
A nuclear reactor
makes electricity with steam.

158
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:27,841
The steam turns a turbine,
which generates electricity.

159
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,801
Where a typical power plant
makes steam by burning coal,

160
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,921
a nuclear plant...

161
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:43,081
In a nuclear plant we use
something called fission.

162
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:49,361
You take an unstable element
like uranium 235,

163
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,801
which has too many neutrons.

164
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:54,201
- A neutron is a...
- The bullet.

165
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,241
Yes, the bullet.

166
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,081
So, bullets are flying off
of the uranium.

167
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:07,521
Now, if we put enough
uranium atoms close together,

168
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:11,641
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

169
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,761
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

170
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:17,961
releasing a tremendous amount
of energy, fission.

171
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,841
- And the graphite.
- Ah, yes.

172
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:24,561
The neutrons actually travel
so fast we call this flux.

173
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,321
It's relatively unlikely

174
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,281
that the uranium atoms
will ever hit one another.

175
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:33,721
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

176
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:38,841
to moderate, slow down,
the neutron flux.

177
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:46,081
Good. I know how
a nuclear reactor works.

178
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,521
Now I don't need you.

179
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,321
Can you help me?
I need to find my husband.

180
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:11,601
Not now.

181
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,401
- Mikhail.
- Lyudmilla. Take her.

182
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,521
Take her away from here, please.

183
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,201
Get away from them.
Do you want to get sick? Go.

184
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:27,401
Please take her. Please take
her. Please, please, please.

185
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:30,841
Please take her!

186
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,681
Excuse me,
I am Vasily Ignatenko's wife.

187
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:40,681
He's a fireman. Ignatenko.

188
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:44,481
Ignatenko. Six Paramilitary
Fire and Rescue unit.

189
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,801
I need to find him, please.

190
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,961
Ignatenko...

191
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:54,281
He's being transported
by helicopter to Moscow.

192
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:57,361
- Hospital number six.
- Why? Is he all right?

193
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:58,521
Can I see him?

194
00:16:58,681 --> 00:16:59,921
You wanna see him,
go to Moscow.

195
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,961
But they're not
letting us leave here.

196
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:06,561
Tell them Major Burov allows it.

197
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,001
- When are they taking him?
- Now.

198
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:42,801
We're approaching
the power plant.

199
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,041
What have they done?

200
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,881
- Can you see inside?
- I don't have to.

201
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,881
Look.

202
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,801
That's graphite on the roof.

203
00:17:57,961 --> 00:18:00,081
The whole building's
been blown open.

204
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,441
The core's exposed.

205
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:03,361
I can't see how
you can tell that from here.

206
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:06,081
For God's sakes,
look at that glow.

207
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,841
That's radiation
ionising the air.

208
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,801
Well, if we can't see it,
we don't know.

209
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:12,121
Get us over the building.

210
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,841
- Boris...
- Don't use my name!

211
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:17,361
If we fly over an open reactor,
we'll be dead within a week!

212
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,561
Sir?

213
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,521
Get us over that building.
Or I'll have you shot.

214
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,601
If you fly over that core,

215
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:29,121
I promise you
by tomorrow morning

216
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:31,401
you'll be begging
for that bullet.

217
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,761
Perhaps if you came back
another day.

218
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,721
Just wonderful.

219
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,961
Deputy Secretary, Garanin.

220
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,241
Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute

221
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,441
- for Nuclear Energy.
- What a pleasure.

222
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,561
- Let me introduce...
- I'm here about Chernobyl.

223
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:41,441
Such a lovely time.
Visit again soon.

224
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:45,441
I will, thank you.

225
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,801
I must tell you, this is why
no-one likes scientists.

226
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,281
When we have a disease to cure
where are they?

227
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:04,121
In a lab, noses in their books,
and so, Grandma dies.

228
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,961
But when there isn't a problem,
they're spreading fear.

229
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,201
- I know about Chernobyl.
- Oh?

230
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,081
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

231
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,361
Whatever that means.

232
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:14,641
And if you don't immediately

233
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,001
issue iodine tablets
and then evacuate the city,

234
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,681
hundreds of thousands of people
are going to get cancer,

235
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:22,121
and God knows
how many more will die.

236
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:23,601
Yes, very good.

237
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,841
There has been
an accident at Chernobyl,

238
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:28,041
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

239
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,881
- I'm telling you that there is.
- I prefer my opinion to yours.

240
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,641
I'm a nuclear physicist.

241
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,161
Before you were deputy secretary
you worked in a shoe factory.

242
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,161
Yes. I worked in a shoe factory.

243
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,801
And now I'm in charge.

244
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:49,921
To the workers of the world.

245
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,041
Stable iodine
will keep your thyroid

246
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:16,281
from absorbing
radioactive iodine.

247
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:20,121
Take one a day
for as long as they last.

248
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:23,841
And go east. Get as far
from Minsk as you can.

249
00:21:56,641 --> 00:22:00,241
It's overkill. Bryukhanov
showing off to make us look bad.

250
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:02,921
It doesn't matter how it looks.

251
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:04,921
Shcherbina is
a pure bureaucrat,

252
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:07,161
stupid as he is pig-headed.

253
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:10,921
We'll tell him the truth in the
simplest terms. We'll be fine.

254
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,161
Bryukhanov!

255
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,041
Comrade Shcherbina.
Chief Engineer Fomin,

256
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:46,441
Colonel General Bryukhanov and I
are honoured at your arrival.

257
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,841
Deeply, deeply honoured.

258
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,641
Naturally, we regret
the circumstances of your visit,

259
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,921
but as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

260
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,521
in containing the damage.

261
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:59,401
We have begun our own enquiry
into the cause of the accident,

262
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:05,081
and I have a list of individuals
who we believe are accountable.

263
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:28,881
Professor Legasov,
I understand you've been saying

264
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,681
- dangerous things.
- Very dangerous things.

265
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:34,121
Apparently
our reactor core exploded.

266
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:38,961
Please, tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

267
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,921
I'm not prepared to explain it
at this time.

268
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:47,241
- As I presumed, he's no answer.
- It's disgraceful.

269
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:51,401
Really. To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

270
00:23:57,761 --> 00:24:00,241
Why did I see graphite
on the roof?

271
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,281
Graphite is only found
in the core where it's used

272
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,961
as a neutron flux moderator,
correct?

273
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:09,641
Fomin, why did
the Deputy Chairman

274
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,041
see graphite on the roof?

275
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,201
Oh, that can't be.

276
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,641
Comrade Shcherbina,
my apologies, but graphite...

277
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,401
that's not possible.

278
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:20,921
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

279
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,721
Now,
there you've made a mistake.

280
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:25,241
Cos I may not know much
about nuclear reactors,

281
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,961
but I know a lot about concrete.

282
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:30,201
- Comrade, I assure you...
- I understand.

283
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:32,641
You think Legasov is wrong.

284
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,481
How should we prove it?

285
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,361
Our high-range dosimeter
just arrived.

286
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:42,961
We could cover one of our trucks
with lead shielding,

287
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,121
mount the dosimeter
on the front.

288
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:53,601
Have one of your men get
as close to the fire as you can.

289
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,641
Give them every bit
of protection you have,

290
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:59,121
but even with lead shielding,
it may not be enough.

291
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,201
Then I'll do it myself.

292
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,521
Good.

293
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,601
He's back.

294
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:35,001
It's not 3 roentgen.
It's 15,000.

295
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,881
Comrade Shcherbina...

296
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:42,321
- What does that number mean?
- It means the core is open.

297
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,721
It means the fire we're watching
is giving off nearly twice

298
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:48,001
the radiation released
by the bomb in Hiroshima.

299
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:51,081
And that's every single hour,
hour after hour.

300
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:54,441
20 hours since the explosion,
so 40 bombs' worth by now.

301
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,961
48 more tomorrow,
and it will not stop.

302
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,441
Not in a week, not in a month.

303
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,041
It will burn
and spread its poison

304
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:02,401
until the entire continent
is dead.

305
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:07,921
Please escort Comrades
Bryukhanov and Fomin

306
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:09,801
to the local party headquarters.

307
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,761
- Thank you for your service.
- Comrade...

308
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,041
You're excused.

309
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:17,681
Dyatlov was in charge.
It was Dyatlov!

310
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:19,721
Tell me how to put it out.

311
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:22,401
We'll use helicopters and
drop water on it like a fire.

312
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,761
No, no. You don't understand,
this isn't a fire.

313
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,121
This is
a fissioning reactor core

314
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,961
burning at over 2,000 degrees.

315
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,081
The heat will instantly
vaporise the water.

316
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:35,121
How do we put it out?

317
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:37,841
You are dealing
with something

318
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:42,121
that has never occurred
on this planet before.

319
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,281
Boron.

320
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,321
Boron and sand.

321
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:51,281
Well, that'll create
problems of its own

322
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:53,601
but I don't see any other way.

323
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:55,441
It's going to take
thousands of drops

324
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,281
because you can't
fly helicopters

325
00:28:57,441 --> 00:28:59,681
directly over the course,
so most of it is going to miss.

326
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,921
How much sand and boron?

327
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:03,961
For God's sake, roughly.

328
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,721
5,000 tonnes.

329
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:07,761
And obviously we're
going to need to evacuate

330
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:09,481
- an enormous area.
- Never mind that.

331
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:12,721
- Focus on the fire.
- I am focusing on the fire.

332
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:16,161
But the wind is carrying
all that smoke...

333
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:18,681
..all that radiation.

334
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,761
At least evacuate Pripyat.
It's three kilometres away.

335
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:23,801
- That's my decision to make.
- Then make it.

336
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:25,201
I've been told not to.

337
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:27,801
- Is it or is it not...
- I'm in charge here!

338
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:30,841
This will go easier if you talk
about the things you understand

339
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:33,921
and not about the things
you do not understand.

340
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:38,921
Where are you going?

341
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:42,441
I'm going to get you 5,000
tonnes of sand and boron.

342
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,121
There's a hotel.

343
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:47,001
I'd prefer one of those.

344
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,281
Superstitious?

345
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,361
Moscow?

346
00:31:10,641 --> 00:31:12,601
Are you here
because of the fire?

347
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:19,161
Anything we should
be worried about?

348
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,441
No.

349
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,481
<i>We're in position.
Approaching drop.</i>

350
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:34,481
<i>Clear to proceed.</i>

351
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:38,121
<i>Copy. We'll go
one by one in rotation.</i>

352
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,041
Remind them about the perimeter.

353
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:50,601
They cannot fly directly
over the fire.

354
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,961
- A minimum of a 10m perimeter.
<i>- 10m perimeter.</i>

355
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:58,161
<i>Lead 1 for pre-flight,
maintain minimum 10m perimeter.</i>

356
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,801
<i>Copy that.
40 meters, 35...</i>

357
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:03,681
<i>30...</i>

358
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,481
No, no, no. They're too close.

359
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:11,241
If they can't get over the fire,
how...

360
00:33:11,401 --> 00:33:12,881
The wind will have to carry it.

361
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,561
Tell them.
They cannot go over the core.

362
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:21,481
Lead 1 is too close.
I repeat, they are too close.

363
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:25,401
<i>Copy. Lead 1,
you are inside the perimeter.</i>

364
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,441
<i>They're not copying this.
Signal's breaking up.</i>

365
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:34,681
<i>Lead 1? Lead 1, do you copy?</i>

366
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:39,601
<i>Lead 1, do you copy?
Lead 1, come in.</i>

367
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:41,361
<i>Do you copy, Lead 1?</i>

368
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:43,321
<i>Lead 1!</i>

369
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,681
Sir, what do I tell the others?

370
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,001
Is there any other way, Legasov?

371
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:17,121
Send the next one in.

372
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,881
Tell them to approach
from the west.

373
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,961
<i>Lead 2, approach from the west.</i>

374
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:46,681
Kurchatov Institute,
Laboratory 4.

375
00:34:46,841 --> 00:34:50,601
<i>Marina Gruzinskaya? It's
Ulana Khomyuk from Minsk.</i>

376
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,481
Oh, yes.
How nice of you to phone.

377
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,641
- It's been too long.
<i>- It has.</i>

378
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:00,041
I was actually calling
about our friend.

379
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,441
- The one in the country.
<i>- Oh, yes, of course.</i>

380
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,481
<i>I wanted to see how he's doing.
It's so hot there right now.</i>

381
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:09,881
Yes, it's extremely hot, but
his nephews are flying down,

382
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,641
<i>and they always bring
cool weather.</i>

383
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:13,321
Oh, which nephews?

384
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:17,441
Simka, who's 14,
and little Boris, who's five.

385
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:19,281
<i>Oh, that's wonderful.</i>

386
00:35:19,441 --> 00:35:21,201
Though children can make
you even hotter

387
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,761
when they're
crawling all over you.

388
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,201
<i>- Maybe I should visit.</i>
- No, they don't want visitors.

389
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:29,481
<i>I'm sorry. I have to get back to
work. It's very busy right now.</i>

390
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:30,761
<i>Goodbye.</i>

391
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,601
They're dropping sand
and boron on the fire.

392
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:38,681
It's what I would do.

393
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:41,921
Yes, I'm sure it is.

394
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,481
Where are you going?

395
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:07,441
Chernobyl.

396
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:17,001
It's been smooth. 20 drops.

397
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,041
What?

398
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:29,161
There are 50,000 people
in this city.

399
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:34,361
Professor Ilyan,
who's also on the commission,

400
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:37,161
says the radiation
isn't high enough to evacuate.

401
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,161
- Ilyan isn't a physicist.
- But he's a medical doctor.

402
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,801
If he says it's safe, it's safe.

403
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:43,361
Not if they stay here.

404
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:45,201
- We're staying here.
- Yes, we are,

405
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:48,001
and we'll be dead in five years.

406
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:57,961
I'm sorry. I...

407
00:36:58,121 --> 00:37:00,001
I'm sorry.

408
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,601
Shcherbina.

409
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,121
Thank you.

410
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:59,561
A nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation.

411
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:02,841
And identified it
as a by-product of our fuel.

412
00:38:04,161 --> 00:38:06,761
The Americans
took satellite photos.

413
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:10,241
The reactor building
and the smoke. The fire.

414
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,401
The whole world knows.

415
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:23,921
The wind has been
blowing toward Germany.

416
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:27,961
They're not letting children
play outside...

417
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,601
..in Frankfurt.

418
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,121
Do you want a smoke?

419
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,401
<i>There has been a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union</i>

420
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,281
<i>and the Soviets
have admitted it happened.</i>

421
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,681
<i>The Soviet version is this:</i>

422
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:07,801
<i>one of the atomic reactors at
the Chernobyl atomic power plant</i>

423
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,401
<i>near the city of Kiev
was damaged,</i>

424
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:11,361
<i>and there is speculation
in Moscow</i>

425
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:13,681
<i>that people were injured
and may have died.</i>

426
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,441
<i>The Soviets
may have been fairly quick</i>

427
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:17,721
<i>to acknowledge the accident
because evidence</i>

428
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,961
<i>in the form
of mild nuclear radiation</i>

429
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:24,241
<i>had already reached beyond the
Soviet borders to Scandinavia.</i>

430
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:30,201
I said turn around.
This is a restricted zone.

431
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,761
I'm from the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

432
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:35,081
- Do you have permission?
- Listen to me.

433
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:36,641
I need to speak
to someone urgently.

434
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:39,281
Turn around right now
or I'll arrest you.

435
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:40,921
If you arrest me,
you should take me

436
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:43,081
to the highest
possible authority.

437
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:49,681
We have to start
a radiological survey,

438
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:53,841
sector by sector, on foot,
dosimeters in hand.

439
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,641
Are you all right?

440
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:00,881
Of course.

441
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:03,441
Comrades.

442
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:06,001
The guards arrested this woman
at the south checkpoint.

443
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:07,761
I'd have put her in a cell.

444
00:44:07,921 --> 00:44:09,921
But he thought you should know
that I know.

445
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,041
I know your reactor core
is exposed.

446
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:14,521
I know the graphite's on fire,
the fuel is melting

447
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:16,641
and you're dropping sand
and boron on it,

448
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:18,481
which you probably thought
was smart,

449
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:20,081
but you've made a mistake.

450
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,561
Ulana Yuriyvna Khomyuk,
chief physicist,

451
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:24,961
Byelorussian Institute
for Nuclear Energy.

452
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,721
And you're
Valery Alekeyevich Legasov.

453
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:30,801
Smothering the core
will put the fire out

454
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:33,841
but the temperature
will eventually increase...

455
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:36,801
Believe me, I'm perfectly aware.
But I estimate at least a month

456
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,201
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

457
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:41,321
- which gives us time.
- You don't have a month.

458
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:43,481
You have
approximately two days.

459
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:48,921
Yes. The fuel would take a month
to reach the concrete pad here.

460
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:52,361
But first...
it's going to burn through

461
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:54,601
the biological shield here
by Tuesday.

462
00:44:54,761 --> 00:44:57,641
And when it does,
it's going to hit these tanks,

463
00:44:57,801 --> 00:45:00,081
- bubbler pools, reservoirs...
- Reservoirs for the ECS.

464
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,921
I understand your concern.

465
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:04,081
But I confirmed it
with plant personnel.

466
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:07,441
- The tanks are nearly empty.
- No, they were nearly empty.

467
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:11,041
Each of these points here,
here and here

468
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:13,001
all drain to the bubbler pools.

469
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:15,521
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

470
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:17,281
Then there are
those fire engines

471
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:18,721
that I saw on the way in.

472
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,601
The fire hoses
are still connected.

473
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,881
They've been gushing water into
the structure this whole time.

474
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,321
The tanks are full.

475
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,281
The tanks are full.

476
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:08,761
I have ten minutes...

477
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:13,881
...then I'm back on the phone,
apologising to our friends,

478
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,641
apologising to our enemies.

479
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:20,241
Our power comes from
the perception of our power.

480
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:23,401
Do you understand
the damage this has done?

481
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:27,121
Do you understand
what's at stake?

482
00:46:28,361 --> 00:46:30,001
Boris?

483
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:35,921
Professor Legasov
will deliver our briefing.

484
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,441
There is some good news.

485
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:42,441
The air drops are working
to douse the fire.

486
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,081
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

487
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:47,601
but the fire
will not be extinguished

488
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:50,361
for at least another two weeks.

489
00:46:52,321 --> 00:46:54,921
There is also
an additional problem.

490
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,241
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

491
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:00,561
simply because
it is not on fire.

492
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:03,521
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise as a result

493
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:05,161
of the blanket of sand
we dropped.

494
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,921
The uranium will melt the sand,

495
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:11,241
creating a kind of lava,
which will begin to melt down

496
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:14,081
- through the shield below.
- You've made lava?

497
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:18,841
I anticipated this.

498
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,161
I believed there was time

499
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,761
to reinforce
this lower concrete pad

500
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:26,321
before the lava
reached the earth

501
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,881
and contaminated
ground water,

502
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:30,801
but as it turned out I was
worried about the wrong thing.

503
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:36,041
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

504
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:38,441
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

505
00:47:38,601 --> 00:47:41,841
This is Ulana Khomyuk
of the Byelorussian Institute.

506
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:44,081
Thanks to her insight,
we are now aware

507
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:46,921
that the tanks are,
in fact, full.

508
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:51,081
Of water. Why is that a problem,
Professor?

509
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:56,441
When the lava enters
these tanks,

510
00:47:56,601 --> 00:47:59,201
it will instantly superheat
and vaporise

511
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:02,801
approximately
7,000 cubic meters of water,

512
00:48:02,961 --> 00:48:06,001
causing a significant
thermal explosion.

513
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,121
How significant?

514
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:11,961
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

515
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:16,881
Everything within a 30km radius
will be completely destroyed,

516
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,961
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

517
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:23,401
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

518
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:25,921
will be ejected, at force...

519
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:28,801
and dispersed
by a massive shock wave...

520
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:34,441
..which will extend
approximately 200 kilometres

521
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,721
and likely be fatal to the
entire population of Kiev,

522
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,721
as well as a portion of Minsk.

523
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,961
The release of radiation
will be severe,

524
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:46,041
and will impact
all of Soviet Ukraine,

525
00:48:46,201 --> 00:48:48,441
Latvia, Lithuania,

526
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:50,961
Byelorussia, as well as Poland,

527
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:53,641
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania

528
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:55,321
and most of East Germany.

529
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:01,521
What do you mean, "impact"?

530
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,081
For much of the area,
a nearly permanent disruption

531
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:07,641
of the food and water supply,

532
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:10,441
steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

533
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:13,161
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

534
00:49:13,961 --> 00:49:15,441
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

535
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:18,161
impact means
completely uninhabitable

536
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,921
for a minimum of 100 years.

537
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:28,161
There are more
than 50 million people

538
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:30,881
living in Byelorussia
and Ukraine.

539
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:33,041
60, yes.

540
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,801
And how long
before this happens?

541
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:41,961
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

542
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:48,161
But we may have a solution.

543
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:50,241
We can pump the water
from the tanks.

544
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:52,241
Unfortunately
the tanks are sealed shut

545
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:54,881
by a sluice gate,
and the gate can only be opened

546
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:57,041
manually from within
the duct system itself.

547
00:49:57,201 --> 00:49:59,681
So we need to find
three plant workers

548
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:01,481
who know the facility
well enough

549
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:02,961
to enter the basement here,

550
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:06,721
find their way through
all these duct ways...

551
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:09,721
..get to the sluice
gate valve here

552
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:13,681
and give us the access we need
to pump out the tanks.

553
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:16,521
Of course, we will need
your permission.

554
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:21,121
- My permission for what?
- The water in these ducts...

555
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:23,881
The level of radioactive
contamination...

556
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:26,161
They'll likely be dead
in a week.

557
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,281
We're asking for your permission
to kill three men.

558
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,561
Comrade Legasov...

559
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:46,881
..all victories
inevitably come at a cost.

560
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:11,521
And open
the sluice gate valve here.

561
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:14,241
The valve
will be difficult to operate

562
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:16,241
so we'll need three men...

563
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,161
who'll need to know
the basement layout.

564
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:23,521
And, of course,
any volunteers will be rewarded.

565
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,681
A yearly stipend of 400 roubles.

566
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:35,441
And er... for those of you

567
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:39,041
working in reactors 1 and 2,
promotions.

568
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:42,001
Why are reactors 1 and 2
still operating at all?

569
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:44,281
My friend was
a security guard that night

570
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:45,841
and er... she's now dying.

571
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:48,441
And we've all heard
about the firemen.

572
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:52,121
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor.

573
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,921
Do you even know
how contaminated it is?

574
00:52:56,961 --> 00:52:58,881
I... I don't have
an exact number.

575
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,441
You don't need an exact number
to know if it will kill us,

576
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:03,841
but you can't even tell us that.

577
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:07,721
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 roubles?

578
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,321
You'll do it
because it must be done.

579
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:21,201
You'll do it
because nobody else can.

580
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,681
And if you don't...
millions will die.

581
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:31,241
If you tell me that's not
enough, I won't believe you.

582
00:53:32,361 --> 00:53:35,561
This is what has always
set our people apart.

583
00:53:36,321 --> 00:53:39,081
A thousand years of sacrifice
in our veins.

584
00:53:40,001 --> 00:53:42,361
And every generation
must know its own suffering.

585
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:46,001
I spit on the people
who did this.

586
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:49,281
And I curse the price
I have to pay.

587
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:54,801
I'm making my peace with it.
Now you make yours.

588
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:58,001
And go into that water...

589
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:01,761
..because it must be done.

590
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,921
Ananenko.

591
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:25,201
Bezpalov.

592
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:31,601
Baranov.
