2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,146
Careful. You already lost one.

3
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,442
Good.

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,988
- Faster, gentlemen, please.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,618
How's it coming?

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,703
This is fucking cool.

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,122
What did I tell you, motherfucker?

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,543
Stop fucking around.

9
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,712
I don't want to be here all night.
Understood?

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,922
Yes, it's all good.

11
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,632
Let's go.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,302
Fucking idiot.

13
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,683
My dad had 20 years in this shit.
I only have six months.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,144
Pedal to the metal then, bitch.

15
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,442
How many of these things
do we have to empty?

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,195
How much fucking money
do you want to make?

17
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,655
A fucking lot.

18
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,137
<i>In its prime, the Cali cartel</i>

19
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,427
<i>was moving 30 tons of coke
a month into America...</i>

20
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,513
<i>most of it
through their New York operation</i>

21
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,224
<i>and an alliance
with Mexican traffickers out of Juárez</i>

22
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,810
<i>that brought tons of product
across our border.</i>

23
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>That means
that in an average six-month period,</i>

24
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,524
<i>they could put 180 tons on the street.</i>

25
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,652
<i>But there was nothing average about this.</i>

26
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>These were the last six months
in the life of the Cali cartel.</i>

27
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>They were going for it,
making sure there were no loose ends.</i>

28
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,124
Mrs. Salazar?

29
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,546
Mrs. Salazar, housekeeping.

30
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,549
- Come back later, please.
- As you wish.

31
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,029
If you want something done right...

32
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,282
you have to do it yourself.

33
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,285
Just like in life, Don Gilberto.

34
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,163
If you don't play,
you're going to watch others score.

35
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,585
My organization has four partners,

36
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,879
but only one leader.

37
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,673
I wanted to meet with you

38
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,928
to make sure there are
no misunderstandings in the North Valley

39
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,597
regarding the restructuring,

40
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,933
and the necessary house cleaning.

41
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:14,231
No, we were simply curious
about Claudio Salazar's absence.

42
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,149
I will be honest with you.

43
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,860
Salazar never contributed a thing.

44
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,403
He never gave anyone work.

45
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,906
He made more noise than money.

46
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,742
Better said, too much noise.

47
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,792
We are moving forward with the plan,

48
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,963
and we would like to know
if our friends are in agreement.

49
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,425
Your message about the surrender
was very clear,

50
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,887
and was very well received
by all of us in the North Valley.

51
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,057
Have a safe trip home.

52
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,852
Henao... thank you for your friendship.

53
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,770
Excuse me.

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,857
Pacho.

55
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,406
Pacho.

56
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,452
Let's take advantage of this window
to maximize our profits.

57
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,163
I'd like to double
our output through Mexico.

58
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,165
Why don't you go there?

59
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,586
Meet with Carrillo Fuentes. He likes you.

60
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,130
Make one last deal.

61
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:26,094
We both know that isn't the only reason
you're sending me there.

62
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,513
Pacho.

63
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,474
Look, Pacho...

64
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,770
I think it would be best
if you left Cali for a bit...

65
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,940
while things cool off.

66
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:46,239
Remember, Pacho, we're going
to walk away from this happy and rich.

67
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,327
<i>Like I said, they were going for it.</i>

68
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>While they were building up
their retirement accounts,</i>

69
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,373
<i>what were we doing about it?</i>

70
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,834
<i>Jack shit.</i>

71
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,715
I don't want
to rub your noses in that, gentlemen.

72
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,177
My concern is that your men in Cali

73
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,723
didn't so much as contact
my senior officer there.

74
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:17,562
We've agreed that we can't have
those kinds of unilateral operations.

75
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,233
Our laws, our rules, will be respected.

76
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,610
Of course, General.

77
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,780
We apologize for the misunderstanding.

78
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,949
Won't happen again.

79
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:34,162
Well, I'm sorry,
but I will need more than your assurances.

80
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,421
Colonel.

81
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,427
Agent Peña.

82
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,720
How's your son?

83
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,305
Oh, he's fine.

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,809
He got transferred to technical services.
Better fit for him.

85
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,145
Maybe I should join him.

86
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,564
Not a lot of police work these days.

87
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,148
Yeah.

88
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,193
What did you expect?

89
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,572
When you sell your soul to the devil,
you're not allowed to ask for it back.

90
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,831
The men who let loose Los Pepes
on Colombia should have been arrested.

91
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,458
Instead, they got promoted.

92
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,255
Excuse me.

93
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,350
There he is.

94
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,104
Javi Peña,<i> el jefe.</i>

95
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,442
Never thought I'd see the day,
but I'm sure as shit glad to see you now.

96
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,777
- Duff, it's been a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,572
- Lopez.
- Hey.

98
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,449
Can't believe
you two were in the same class.

99
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,242
Miracle this place
is still standing, huh?

100
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,207
Some bullshit, huh, Javi?

101
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,380
Come on. Is this where you go
all<i> Bad Lieutenant</i> on us?

102
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,674
- Like you and Murphy were never made?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,427
You guys are famous.

104
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,561
Sometimes you get them,
sometimes they get you, huh?

105
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,396
Next time, we get them.

106
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,026
There isn't gonna be a next time.
They're rotating you home.

107
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,446
The Colombians are pulling your visa.
You're outta here tonight.

108
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:33,990
Come on.

109
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,117
Who's running things here, man?

110
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,788
They are.

111
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,628
Well, thanks for getting our back, sir.

112
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,686
Wouldn't you have liked
to be born in this era? Take a look.

113
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,689
- Just like the Cauca River, right?
- Identical.

114
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,402
Dad, where are we with the government?

115
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,076
They won't let us use the drug stores
as collateral for the Centenario property

116
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,161
until they're cleared through surrender.

117
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,580
I know, but eventually they will be.

118
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,837
And that's all you can tell me?

119
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,882
You know the rule.

120
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,552
You can't be a part of this.

121
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,471
I didn't send you to law school
so you could worry about our surrender.

122
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,597
That's been planned.

123
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,643
I sent you to take advantage
of what happens after it's done,

124
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,896
when our family is a leader
in the business community.

125
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,693
You're reading it again?

126
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,486
You should read it once in a while.

127
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,155
Wise words.

128
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,490
Sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

129
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,118
You have a call
from our friend in the capital.

130
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,044
Hello?

131
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,080
<i>Four people, including three children,</i>

132
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,134
<i>are dead and thousands more injured</i>

133
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,846
<i>in a mysterious gas leak
in the area of Yumbo in Cali.</i>

134
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,140
<i>Investigators are at the scene
of the incident,</i>

135
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,894
<i>but have not yet discovered
the source of the gas leak.</i>

136
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:31,733
<i>State officials told residents
there will be a formal investigation.</i>

137
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,951
Silvio.

138
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,829
Can I bum a smoke?

139
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,463
Isn't it dangerous?

140
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,799
No more than it ever was.

141
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,636
If it was a natural gas leak,

142
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,971
I want to know before lighting up.

143
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,850
Unless it's not.

144
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,479
I think you should talk
to the captain, Carolina.

145
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,898
He doesn't have the balls to talk to me.

146
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,153
Silvio, help me out. You have kids.

147
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,404
Off the record.

148
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,407
I don't know, Carolina.

149
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,077
Why don't you talk to him?

150
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,829
He is the district safety inspector.

151
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,874
He'll issue the report.
Why don't you ask him for a comment?

152
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,087
Silvio!

153
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
Excuse me.

154
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,549
Careful picking it up.

155
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,719
Lift it up. Careful. Grab the other side.

156
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,726
That's good. A little bit more.

157
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:56,401
If they connect us to this, our friend
doubts the government will honor our deal.

158
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:01,531
We'll be seen as no different
than Escobar, killing women and children.

159
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,535
Months of negotiations and money
down the drain.

160
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,204
Just like the poison you monkeys dumped.

161
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,417
There's a reporter asking questions
in Yumbo.

162
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,336
This safety inspector
in charge of the investigation.

163
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,382
I wouldn't worry about the reporter.
We have lots of reporters.

164
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,176
But a government investigator!
If the motherfucker goes...

165
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,721
Dad, let me take care of it.
I said I would handle it.

166
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,849
You've demonstrated very clearly
that you can't handle it.

167
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,728
Take care of it. Discreetly.

168
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,647
Without any violence.
That's the last thing we need.

169
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,317
What? You have another bright idea?

170
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,288
That's why I didn't want our children
in the business.

171
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,292
We made a mistake, Gilberto.

172
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,756
Let go. Turn. Run.

173
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,426
You need to let out some string.
Careful with Grandma.

174
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,927
You see?

175
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,472
Mm-hmm.

176
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,724
- This is the bedroom.
- Uh-huh.

177
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,892
No, sorry, Dad.

178
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,187
- No, this is the living room.
- The living room.

179
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,272
It's big, Jorge.

180
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,609
And the pool will go here.

181
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,653
- And there, the kitchen.
- Mm-hmm.

182
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,989
And look...

183
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,077
Right in front there,
I'm putting in a jacuzzi.

184
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,661
A jacuzzi?

185
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,168
I always thought
your brother would have...

186
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,046
the house on the hill.

187
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,802
You were just always lost
in your engineering ideas.

188
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,930
What was the last one?

189
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,224
Bio-diesel.

190
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,185
Bio-diesel.

191
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,106
Vegetable gas?

192
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,316
Yes, that's right. Well, conversion.

193
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,983
Well...

194
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,321
Very good.

195
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,991
Better late than never.

196
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,078
I'm glad you like it, Dad.

197
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,748
- Thank you.
- Jorge, the girls are calling you.

198
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,041
Yes, I'm coming.

199
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,125
Paola.

200
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,463
You'll be very happy
when you build the house here.

201
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,675
- It's all very nice.
- Affirmative, General.

202
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,518
You impressed him.

203
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,855
I don't care what he thinks.

204
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,191
That's why you haven't told him
who you work for?

205
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,071
It was always temporary.

206
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,573
Temporary?

207
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,323
Right.

208
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,162
You know this lot is bigger than we need.

209
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,330
Yes, but it's the one we want.

210
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,792
It's the one you deserve.

211
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,256
Six more months.

212
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,258
Okay?

213
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,219
I promise.

214
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,396
Go.

215
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,523
I'll go with your parents.

216
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,066
I'm sorry, honey.

217
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,608
- <i>Hello?</i>
- It's me.

218
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>Chepe!</i>

219
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,321
- How's everything going, brother?
<i>- All right.</i>

220
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,866
We're about to beat
our profit record, brother.

221
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,036
Good. Keep me posted.

222
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,622
<i>You should be happy, Gilberto.</i>

223
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,875
<i>Chepe, do me a favor.</i>

224
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,088
Keep a low profile. At least for now.

225
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,676
I got a lot of stuff going on up here
at the moment.

226
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,638
I just need more ether
to reach the numbers we talked about.

227
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,140
<i>Why? Is everything all right?
You sound weird.</i>

228
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,977
I'm dealing with a problem
that is stressing me out.

229
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,062
It's our fault.

230
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,523
Actually, it's David's, the dumbass.

231
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,606
<i>Is it bad?</i>

232
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,526
I hope not.

233
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,237
<i>But it could complicate our surrender.</i>

234
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,531
Okay.

235
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,907
<i>I'll be careful.</i>

236
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,452
So good you're coming back, brother.

237
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,289
You'll leave behind the hustle
and shit of that city.

238
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,957
<i>It's not so bad.</i>

239
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,419
I love the trees in fall.

240
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,297
The park looks gorgeous.

241
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,592
<i>I love you, brother. Talk soon.</i>

242
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,010
Okay.

243
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,938
Miss, the valet says
the car hasn't returned.

244
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,441
- I see. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

245
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
- María.
- Luisa.

246
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,113
What's happening? Claudio hasn't returned?

247
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,115
No. And Diego?

248
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,077
Diego dragged his drunk ass in
at six in the morning.

249
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,746
Okay.

250
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,997
- Bye.
- Bye.

251
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,756
Spell that for me.

252
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,178
What the fuck are you doing?

253
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,181
- Prime real estate opened up.
- You vulture.

254
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,224
You know,
Lopez is probably still at the airport.

255
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,476
Yeah.

256
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,145
Got it.

257
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,105
Thanks. We'll run these down.

258
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,232
And Eddie, hey, congrats again.

259
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,859
Eddie?

260
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,695
Yeah, Kacerosky.

261
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,989
Cornerstone's his. Good haul on Cali.

262
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,076
He's got addresses, numbers,
a couple of names.

263
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,579
Now you and your badass sunglasses
and hockey hair

264
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,164
want to go ring some doorbells?

265
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,209
Cali's the front line, Dan.

266
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,004
More like the express lane home.

267
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,508
I got a soon-to-be ex waiting to serve me
the second I get back.

268
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,636
Well, I didn't transfer to Colombia
to file wire reports

269
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,971
and drink stale Bud at Mr. Ribs.

270
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,893
I'm moving you to Duffy's desk
while you're gone. I feel alone up here.

271
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,311
Okay, knock yourself out.

272
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,691
You got a minute, sir?

273
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,274
Yeah.

274
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,531
Wanted to talk to you about all this intel
coming out of Miami with Cornerstone.

275
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,743
Paper trail from the warehouse they busted
threw up some flags.

276
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,414
- What's this?
- A shitty diagram,

277
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,542
but there's five or six companies
that show repeatedly.

278
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,752
Now, my buddy in Customs did some digging.

279
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,214
They're all owned by Cali or are
the address of record for shell companies.

280
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,550
They're moving Swiss francs
from Liechtenstein,

281
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,428
bearer bonds from Luxembourg,
but even they leave tracks.

282
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,471
- What's your name?
- Feistl.

283
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,973
Chris Feistl.

284
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,599
Feistl, what are you asking me?

285
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,102
Send me to Cali, sir.

286
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,814
You know, I want it, sir.

287
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:37,361
I mean, these companies,
this is the cartel's financial brain stem.

288
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,453
It's overstating it a little,
wouldn't you say?

289
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,408
It's a start.

290
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,829
We're not sending any personnel to Cali
at the moment.

291
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,874
I don't understand.
Who's the new Cali team?

292
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,208
For now, there isn't one.

293
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,252
There... Sir.

294
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,715
We have arrest warrants for Gilberto
and Miguel Rodríguez, Pacho Herrera...

295
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,592
I'm aware who runs the Cali cartel.

296
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,511
Is there anything else, Agent Feistl?

297
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,515
No, sir. That's... I'm good.

298
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,599
Good.

299
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,438
Nice office, by the way.

300
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,152
Thanks.

301
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,292
I got your message. What's going on?

302
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,962
We have a problem
with the fucking safety inspector.

303
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,714
He won't accept the money?

304
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,259
He has three crucifixes in his office.
Three.

305
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,763
- Reasoning with him is impossible.
- I see.

306
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,977
Tell me, what the hell was David doing
with the chlorine gas?

307
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,271
Do you really want to know?

308
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,902
About a year ago, Don Miguel
and Don Gilberto bought a fungicide lab.

309
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,325
The idea was to replace the gas
with cocaine and send it to the U.S.

310
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,119
They don't check it at Customs...

311
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,664
because it's a poisonous gas.

312
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,462
So that's why David
spilled the gas in Yumbo?

313
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,011
We should let him clean up his own mess.

314
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,473
That's not going to happen, Jorge.

315
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,185
If the fucking inspector doesn't say
what we need him to say,

316
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,271
we're all fucked.

317
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,147
Do you think they're going
to honor the pact?

318
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,233
Do you think there's really
going to be a surrender

319
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,193
between the cartel and the government

320
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,320
if what happened in Yumbo goes public?

321
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,655
Never.

322
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,827
What do we know
about the safety inspector?

323
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:55,082
Here's everything. We have phone numbers,
his home and office addresses,

324
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,169
bank accounts, income tax, properties.

325
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,172
And the only thing we're sure about?

326
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,342
This motherfucker is clean.

327
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,851
There's no one clean in this world,
Córdova. No one.

328
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,397
Find something on him, then. Quickly.

329
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,400
Gentlemen!

330
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,238
We're going to put all our assets
on this man.

331
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:33,245
<i>We have to watch his wife, his kids,
even his fucking dog.</i>

332
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,789
<i>We need to watch his house,</i>

333
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,374
from the inside and out,

334
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,711
every single corner, 24/7.

335
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,632
I want to know what he does at work,

336
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,092
<i>who he meets and where.</i>

337
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,719
<i>I want to know his agenda.</i>

338
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,891
Whatever he does, we're going to find out.

339
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,478
<i>We will be in charge of his fucking life!</i>

340
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:02,107
And, of course,
we have to tap all his phones.

341
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,611
At home, at the office,
and his cell phone.

342
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,529
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

343
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,454
Come to my house this Saturday
after soccer.

344
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,081
My dad gave me permission.

345
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,917
<i>Awesome, I'll see you there.</i>

346
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,335
<i>Cool, bye.</i>

347
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,463
<i>End of call.</i>

348
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,014
<i>- Recording number two... 2:16 p.m.
- Yes.</i>

349
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,308
The company is registered

350
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,353
under one of the Rodríguez's
fake companies.

351
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,941
<i>- Recording number three...
- 32 p.m.</i>

352
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,696
I want to suck your dick. Tomorrow.

353
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,698
At the same place.

354
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,748
Hello?

355
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,292
<i>Ma'am, I'm so sorry to bother you.</i>

356
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,212
It's María. Is Claudio there?

357
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,966
No. Isn't he with you?

358
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,552
No. He didn't come home last night.

359
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,470
<i>I'm worried.</i>

360
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,013
Hmm...

361
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,349
You're fighting again.

362
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,227
<i>You're the reason
he seeks pleasure elsewhere.</i>

363
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,729
Nobody's seen him.

364
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,232
No one's seen him?

365
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,902
What did you do, María?

366
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,779
- No...
- I'm sending the boys.

367
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:34,116
No, that's not necessary.
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

368
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,129
Mrs. Salazar,
will you be checking out today?

369
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,340
No...

370
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,699
Hello, sir.

371
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,369
They're always in room 105.

372
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,789
Very good, thank you.

373
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,090
What a woman.

374
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,261
This was well done.

375
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,597
Thank you, sir.

376
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,808
The inspector has a press conference
scheduled this afternoon.

377
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,314
Someone needs to talk to him.

378
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,773
Finish the job.

379
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,318
Don Gilberto, he knows me.

380
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,111
They won't let me in.

381
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,446
Jorge.

382
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,367
Jorge... you should handle it.

383
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,870
You've done such great work.

384
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,288
Great work so far.

385
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,166
And no one knows who he is.

386
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,088
I appreciate that.

387
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,299
But I only gather information.

388
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,970
Sir, the truth is, I'm a man of...
few words.

389
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:50,312
Look, Jorge, sometimes even the largest
companies depend on a small outcome

390
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,772
to determine their future.

391
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,316
Like the success of one operation...

392
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:59,029
or an employee who is discreet and loyal.

393
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,532
This is the final stretch.

394
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,912
We all have to do our part. Understood?

395
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,205
Yes, sir.

396
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,674
<i>The Cali cartel
came to New York for the cocaine market.</i>

397
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,550
<i>It's the largest in the world.</i>

398
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,761
<i>But they stayed for the ether.</i>

399
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,389
<i>You can't make coke without ether.</i>

400
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:29,142
<i>And while export restrictions
had made it hard to come by in Colombia,</i>

401
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,019
<i>it flowed freely in the States.</i>

402
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:34,815
<i>But maybe not as freely
as the godfathers would've liked.</i>

403
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,611
Was there a problem with your last order?

404
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,779
No. No problems.

405
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,700
I need to add another 300 barrels
to my next order.

406
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,454
300 barrels?
Mr. Crespo, that's nearly double.

407
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,665
I can't do it.

408
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,333
How come?

409
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,587
There's a new buyer. Their orders
are getting bigger and bigger.

410
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,007
We're already stretched very thin.

411
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,428
I've been your most important client
for years.

412
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,723
I understand, but you told me
you were leaving the business.

413
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,059
- However, this other organization...
- Isn't.

414
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,061
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,273
So who are they?

416
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,735
They're kids.

417
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,319
Hmm.

418
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,405
Dominicans.

419
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,950
Running out of some beauty parlor
in Queens.

420
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,286
I see.

421
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,956
They'll probably end up dead or locked up.

422
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,793
You know, it's a young man's world.

423
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,547
We all have to make way
for the next generation.

424
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,637
This beauty parlor in Queens,
give me the address.

425
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,639
But...

426
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:16,333
Can I get one of those?

427
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,090
Quit four months ago.

428
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,510
Looks like it's going well.

429
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,980
Carolina Alvarez.<i> El Tiempo.</i>

430
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,196
So...

431
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,619
what conclusions should be drawn
from the fact that the new DEA attaché

432
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,288
has this intimate history with Los Pepes?

433
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:59,751
And does the fact that the Los Pepes death
squad being financed by the Cali cartel

434
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,587
explain why no one seems to be interested

435
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,674
in going after Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela
and his partners?

436
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,858
You can call the press office
if you want a comment, Miss Alvarez.

437
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,971
Carolina, please.

438
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,349
Have a nice day.

439
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,394
Have you heard much
about the Cali accident?

440
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,396
Four more people dead.

441
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Children.

442
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,649
Dozens more sick.

443
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,905
An empty chlorine gas canister
was found nearby.

444
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,576
And there's a rumor its manufacturer
is linked to a front company

445
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,703
operated by the Cali cartel.

446
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,748
Looks like you said, it was an accident.

447
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,209
By the end of the day, it will be.

448
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,545
No matter what the truth is.

449
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,175
Thanks for the cigarette.

450
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,559
Transportation came out
to $5 million each.

451
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,104
You can see here
that the product loss was very little.

452
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,689
And the bribes?

453
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,234
Well, the payoffs...

454
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,987
they went up this week.

455
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,450
Went up this week to six million, sir.

456
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,288
- Guillermo.
- Yes, sir?

457
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:24,503
What happens in six months
when these people stop receiving money?

458
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,259
No more friends.

459
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,764
This is everything, right?

460
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,934
This is everything
down to the last penny, sir.

461
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:43,355
And we have here coded pages
for all the politicians,

462
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,358
the senators, congressmen, all the cops.

463
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,653
I want an exact copy of this book.

464
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,570
Yes, sir.

465
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,698
It's our insurance
if they try to fuck us afterward.

466
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,078
You think someone would dare
do something to you?

467
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,082
Anything can happen.
If you're a pussy, they fuck you.

468
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:10,215
Any news about Salazar's wife?

469
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,342
Yes, Don Miguel.

470
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,263
The girl has been asking
about Claudio everywhere.

471
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,561
You want me to handle it?

472
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,104
<i>I understand you have
information on the Yumbo incident.</i>

473
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,187
Yes, I do.

474
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,274
Good. Tell me.

475
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,299
Your wife...

476
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:37,802
at the Palace Motel at 3:45 p.m.

477
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,015
After she dropped the kids off
at soccer practice.

478
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,063
So?

479
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,152
At your press conference this afternoon...

480
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:59,115
you will announce that the gas leak
was a municipal accident.

481
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,577
We have video and audio as well.

482
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,207
Look... you bought-off monkey...

483
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,585
take these pictures and fuck yourself.

484
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,255
At the press conference this afternoon,
I'm going to tell the truth,

485
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,758
so that the world will know
what you people do.

486
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,303
And don't worry about my wife.
I already knew.

487
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:24,140
Sometimes we make compromises
to keep a happy home.

488
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,855
I can appreciate you wanting
to take the high road.

489
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,026
However, you're not understanding me.

490
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,781
The men that I work for don't care
about your relationship with your wife.

491
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,701
They care what your children might think,

492
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,620
what their classmates might think.

493
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,040
And your distinguished family.

494
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,211
Think of what they would say
at your church.

495
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,965
If you don't do what I tell you,

496
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:01,428
the men I work for will make sure

497
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:05,849
that the whole world
will have a copy of this tape.

498
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,648
Thank you.

499
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,155
Mrs. Salazar.

500
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,948
So you've never had
a relaxation treatment before?

501
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,159
I've never heard of it.

502
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,245
Relaxation treatment?

503
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,539
That sounds nice.

504
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,168
You have a funny accent.

505
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,004
- Where are you from?
- Colombia.

506
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,091
- Colombian.
- This guy is Colombian, too.

507
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:25,929
- Check it out. Both.
- Really?

508
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,863
And I suppose that guy at the door
is also Colombian?

509
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,742
What a small world, right?

510
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,374
All right. What do you want?

511
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,587
I want you to go through that door.

512
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,090
The one with the English writing
I don't understand.

513
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,553
Tell the men back there
that Chepe Santacruz-Londoño

514
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,430
is getting a relaxation treatment...

515
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,766
and would like to speak with them.

516
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:14,519
Go.

517
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,442
You stay.

518
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:32,871
Cool.

519
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,070
Please, take a seat.

520
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,863
It's better if I stand.

521
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,076
A drink?

522
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,119
No. Thank you.

523
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,248
I'm sorry for the way
you were brought here.

524
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,254
I understand you have a question.

525
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,300
I've spent all day
asking about my husband.

526
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,219
And you think I know the truth?

527
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,803
Yes.

528
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,473
And I don't think
you are afraid to tell me.

529
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,141
And if I don't tell you?

530
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,060
Then I was wrong.

531
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,770
And you are a coward.

532
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,782
Your husband is dead.
He was killed by an associate of mine.

533
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,785
For a personal injury he caused.

534
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,836
This market, we made it ourselves.

535
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,922
It's ours.

536
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,174
We can't just give it up to you.

537
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,344
You haven't heard my proposal yet.

538
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,930
Say what you got to say.

539
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:24,477
The first thing you're going to do
is vacate this place immediately,

540
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,395
and never come back.

541
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:27,980
Oh, yeah?

542
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,233
And the second? What?

543
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,776
Second...

544
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,322
There is no second. Just the first thing.

545
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,080
- So you think this is a joke?
- Gentlemen.

546
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:49,877
Part of being an adult is accepting things
that you wish weren't true.

547
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,924
Recently, I have had to accept
some things that I don't like.

548
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,303
I advise you to do the same.

549
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,812
Look, you and your fucking hair
have ten seconds to get out of here.

550
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,691
- Ten.
- Nine.

551
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,944
- Nine.
- Eight.

552
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:18,197
You think this is funny, motherfucker?

553
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,407
Seven.

554
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,997
- Seven.
- Six.

555
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,711
- Six.
- Five.

556
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,629
- Four.
- Four.

557
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,797
Three, two, one.

558
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,426
- Check on him.
- Got it.

559
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,151
"So then the crow flew up
as high as he could,

560
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,904
losing sight of the dogs,

561
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,781
and returned to the flock.

562
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,492
The crow went to find his friend the cat,

563
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,204
whom he had saved from danger,

564
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:52,750
and lived with him
in peace and happiness."

565
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,628
And that's where we'll leave off
because it's time for bed.

566
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,715
You too.

567
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:02,927
Very good.

568
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,349
- Did the girls go to sleep?
- Yes.

569
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,558
How's the book?

570
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,103
I think they understand it
better than I do.

571
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,818
<i>The municipal safety inspector</i>

572
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,067
<i>closed his investigation
into the tragedy in Yumbo today.</i>

573
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,569
<i>Hundreds were injured in a leak,</i>

574
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,782
<i>some are still in critical condition.</i>

575
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:29,328
<i>Four died, including three children.</i>

576
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:34,041
<i>The deceased were two seven-year-old boys
and a six-year-old girl.</i>

577
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,294
- Can you believe this horrible news?
<i>- One of the boys was about to celebrate</i>

578
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:41,340
<i>his first Communion
at the Santa María church.</i>

579
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:44,427
<i>- Now, instead of celebration...
- Fuck. This is terrible.</i>

580
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,346
<i>- There will be tears at their funerals.</i>
- It's terrible.

581
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,390
I can't find my binoculars.

582
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,601
- Dad, let's go, we're gonna miss the game.
- Sir.

583
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:57,523
Flaco. You're my fourth wife, buddy.

584
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,191
I love you, man.

585
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,527
Sir, they want to make an announcement
at tonight's game,

586
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,863
in honor of the victims
of the Yumbo tragedy.

587
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,364
Good idea.

588
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:09,869
And tell them to say we'll donate
half the ticket sales to the victims.

589
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,579
- You got it.
- Now, let's see if we win.

590
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,414
If we get to the game on time.

591
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,460
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll keep this brief.</i>

592
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,172
<i>After a thorough investigation,</i>

593
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,382
<i>we've reached the conclusion...</i>

594
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,762
<i>that the Yumbo chemical exposure</i>

595
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:33,267
<i>was caused by a faulty valve
in a natural gas line in the area.</i>

596
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,104
<i>And because of that, from now on,</i>

597
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:42,443
<i>the gas company will be responsible
for the expenses.</i>

598
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,986
<i>Now...</i>

599
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,795
You got a partner, right?

600
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,298
Yeah, kind of.

601
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,301
Good. You're going to Cali.
