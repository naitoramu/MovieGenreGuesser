1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:02,429
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:05,476
Losing a brother, the massive
hole that leaves in your life.

3
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:06,844
Like the same massive hole

4
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:08,164
losing a husband makes.

5
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,614
- Your brother's dead, Lincoln.
- How do you explain that?

6
00:00:10,617 --> 00:00:12,586
- Lincoln Burrows.
- Jacob.

7
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,489
- Uncle Lincoln!
- Hey!

8
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:16,792
911. I have an armed
intruder in my house.

9
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,729
We've awoken something...

10
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:20,807
Something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,651
- I don't know who we're fighting.
- Let's go to Yemen and find out.

12
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:25,113
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

13
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:26,601
I'll find someone who does.

14
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:28,637
The country's falling apart.
Everyone wants out.

15
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,422
Welcome to the civil war.

16
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,726
Come quickly, or we'll all be dead!

17
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,878
- Who's that contact again?
- A woman named Sheba.

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,734
Michael's caught in the
middle of something big.

19
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:38,736
Kaniel Outis is

20
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,348
- a big-time terrorist.
- We've arranged

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,039
a visit to Ogygia Prison.

22
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,476
That mean Michael's in there?

23
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:44,407
Michael?

24
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,255
My name isn't Michael, and
I don't know who you are.

25
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,090
_

26
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:51,226
Michael, what are you doing, damn it?!

27
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:54,388
The fighting in Yemen intensified today

28
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,831
as ISIL forces get ever
nearer to the capitol.

29
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,367
The rebels, who have the
stated intent of taking over

30
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,836
the country and establishing
a radical caliphate,

31
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:03,772
are also bent on freeing their leader,

32
00:01:03,774 --> 00:01:07,309
Abu Ramal, who was captured by
the government five years ago.

33
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:10,578
Ramal is known for his
extreme views and practices,

34
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:12,847
from using young girls as sex slaves,

35
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,850
to a medieval brand of justice
that includes public beheadings

36
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,485
and executions in the street.

37
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,421
Ramal is currently being held in Yemen's

38
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:22,206
most notorious
penitentiary, Ogygia Prison.

39
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,002
_

40
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:51,624
Psst.

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,360
This is it.

42
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:01,396
Whip, get up here.

43
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:03,698
Is it happening?

44
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,701
You are not going to leave us, are you?

45
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:09,671
- If the rebels take the city, we're dead.
- You've told us that

46
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:12,507
a thousand times, Sid. You're
a broken record. Is it clear?

47
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,744
Okay, it's clear.

48
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:18,446
Whip. Come on.

49
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,651
Lights go out... you follow.

50
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:24,019
Come on.

51
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,448
Would have made it so much easier

52
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:33,853
if it was just you and me like
it was on all the other ones.

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,264
Nothing is easy on this one.

54
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, tell me about it.

55
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:47,776
One minute.

56
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,081
Board spans the gap.

57
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,383
Okay.

58
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,619
Blanket covers the wire.

59
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,956
Now it's about those lights going out.

60
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,361
He didn't flash it 24 hours before.

61
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,630
- That's supposed to be the signal.
- Have faith.

62
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,432
Seven straight nights?

63
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,601
No signal, no lights getting turned out?

64
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,974
Those strikes are getting closer, too.

65
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,512
Those lights aren't going out.

66
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,881
- Lights aren't going out.
- Got to go back.

67
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:01,265
Maybe make a run for it.

68
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,851
Too much ground to cover.
They'll shoot us down

69
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:03,993
before we make the gap.

70
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,920
What's the plan then? Give up and die?

71
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,522
I can't wait another four years.

72
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:09,390
It was supposed to be one week.

73
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:11,826
- Poseidon has left us here to die.
- We still got

74
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,628
one card left to play.

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,930
I didn't want to play it,
but it's already in motion.

76
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,999
Let's go.

77
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,004
Apparently, Kaniel Outis
was thrown into Ogygia

78
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,672
for crimes against the government.

79
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,874
Shortly after, he was captured

80
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,911
trying to escape, and
thrown into solitary.

81
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:33,113
They just released him
into gen pop recently.

82
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,681
Call him Michael, will you?

83
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,750
But why didn't he acknowledge us

84
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:39,419
when he saw us?

85
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,796
Stop!

86
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,959
Get back here!

87
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,562
- Kid was spying on us.
- Yeah.

88
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,991
And he left something under the doormat.

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,336
_

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

91
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,012
This is Michael's handwriting.
Swan was his calling card.

92
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,308
He's reaching out to us.

93
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:25,390
But why is he being so mysterious?

94
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:29,749
Back in the day, he never
talked to you straight, as in

95
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,113
- not in code?
- He's worried about

96
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,651
someone intercepting his message.

97
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,389
Yeah, but what does it mean?

98
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:36,489
I don't know, but
we're supposed to know.

99
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:38,791
"Sheik of Light." Sheik of Light.

100
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:41,327
That sounds like a
guy on a mountain peak

101
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,962
communing with God.

102
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,097
Yeah, we got to get help.

103
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,366
- We're out of help.
- Sheba.

104
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,433
She's thinks I'm abetting a terrorist.

105
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:52,972
Well, then you have to
convince her that you're not.

106
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:55,174
You have got to leave, Papa.

107
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:58,444
- I will not run away.
- The government is being targeted.

108
00:06:58,446 --> 00:07:01,080
You are being targeted.

109
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:03,582
- I'm a no one.
- You are government to them.

110
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:07,186
You don't understand being a Yemeni.

111
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,258
You would run away when
she needs you the most?

112
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,262
I understand that we are no
good to this country dead.

113
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:19,198
Papa, there will come
a time. We go abroad,

114
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
regroup with an exile government.

115
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:23,736
With what money, girl?

116
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:26,207
It would cost two years' salary.

117
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:33,879
I'd rather die with my face
to the enemy than to run away.

118
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,482
Papa...

119
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,291
- Hey.
- I suggest you leave

120
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:48,861
this country as quickly as you can.

121
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:50,710
What's he doing here?

122
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,145
My friend needs your help.

123
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:53,117
I gave him my help.

124
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,300
You didn't tell me he was
working with the enemy.

125
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:57,192
This man you claim is your brother,

126
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,705
Kaniel Outis, worked with the rebels.

127
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,340
- His name's Michael Scofield.
- I don't care!

128
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:03,108
Not Kaniel Outis!

129
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,442
There's nothing you
can say to me that will

130
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,888
make me help you, okay?

131
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,485
Is that right?

132
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:13,422
This enough to get your
family out of the country?

133
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,947
Deliver me this first.

134
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:28,091
_

135
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,257
Ready, love?

136
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:39,716
_

137
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:50,520
- What's that?
- It's, uh... it's

138
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,934
something your Uncle Lincoln sent.

139
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:54,682
- Here.
- I don't want to go.

140
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,948
I want to stay with you.

141
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,384
You got to go to school.

142
00:08:58,386 --> 00:09:00,286
And I'm gonna be right
here when the bell rings.

143
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,889
Okay? You walk down those steps,

144
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,957
you hop straight into the car. Yeah?

145
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,579
I love you.

146
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,065
Make it a great day.

147
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,013
I got the note.

148
00:09:28,283 --> 00:09:30,917
I got the note, Michael.

149
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,727
We're going to get you out of here.

150
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:43,096
Look, my name isn't Michael,

151
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:46,265
and I don't know who you are.

152
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:48,067
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:57,443
Hey.

154
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,212
You know I'm a noted economist?

155
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:00,880
I mean, that's what
it says in the paper.

156
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:04,717
"Noted Economist Attacked in Home."

157
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,986
I didn't even know
economists made the news.

158
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,389
That's the first and
last time, hopefully.

159
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:13,960
I've been trying to piece
this thing together.

160
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:16,429
You remember those government guys,

161
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,346
those think tank guys,

162
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,583
trying to pick my
brain about game theory,

163
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,786
how they could use
it for foreign policy?

164
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,950
Yeah, you bored the
hell out of 'em, right?

165
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:28,074
Yeah, okay, but I mean,
did I hear something

166
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:30,443
- I shouldn't have?
- I don't know. Did you?

167
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:31,944
Like who shot JFK?

168
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:34,280
I am trying to be serious here.

169
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,848
No, you're doped up on painkillers

170
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,974
and you're thinking too much.

171
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:40,432
I promise this has
nothing to do with you.

172
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:44,457
You rest. I'm going to, um...

173
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,292
I'm gonna run some errands,

174
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:48,327
and then I'm gonna come visit you, okay?

175
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,763
Okay. Love you.

176
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,833
Love you, too.

177
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:06,946
Okay, no problem. Thanks.

178
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,949
Hi. I, uh, I called earlier
about a missing U.S. citizen

179
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,251
- in the Middle East.
- Yes. I'm Henry Kishida.

180
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,687
Let me walk you to
the director's office.

181
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,194
It's an unusual situation,

182
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,825
which you can appreciate,

183
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,045
since your husband is
declared legally dead,

184
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,359
and the person that you're referring to

185
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:24,063
goes by another name.

186
00:11:24,065 --> 00:11:26,365
I'll take it from here, Henry.

187
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,236
How are you, Sara?

188
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:31,838
Kellerman?

189
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,114
I'll leave you two be. Let me
know if you need anything, sir.

190
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,463
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry, how did I

191
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:44,664
end up with you again?

192
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,632
You asked for the
State Department's help.

193
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,267
I wanted the State Department, not you.

194
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,936
Yeah, you've lived

195
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:51,904
so many lives, I don't know who you are.

196
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,881
That'd be a consistent theme
for you, wouldn't it, given that

197
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,775
you were married to a
man who never existed?

198
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:57,810
What is that supposed to mean?

199
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:00,246
It means you should come
in and let me enlighten you

200
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,382
to all things Michael Scofield...

201
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,617
Or should I say Kaniel Outis?

202
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,046
You shouldn't drink

203
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,246
bottled water... the
dioxins, the BPAs in there...

204
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:15,648
I'm touched by your concern.

205
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,729
Have a seat.

206
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:18,031
Good, thank you.

207
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,801
You know, Sara...

208
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:24,437
you and I have... a checkered past.

209
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,343
But I am evermore a
boring guy now, and...

210
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,221
mellowed by life, trust me.

211
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:31,857
If you have something
you want to tell me

212
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,593
about Michael, I'd sure love to hear it.

213
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:37,216
Okay. When your call came in
and Kishida processed it...

214
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:39,519
well, let's just say
there are certain keywords

215
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,751
that get our system
buzzing pretty quickly.

216
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,387
Kaniel Outis...

217
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,416
Actually, can't stand it

218
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,185
watching you drink out of that.

219
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,838
Hey, Kishida?

220
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:52,275
Could you bring Sara a
glass for her water, please?

221
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:53,310
Thank you.

222
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:54,711
Kaniel Outis...

223
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:55,879
is a known terrorist,

224
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:57,748
ties to ISIL, wanted in the killing

225
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,949
of a senior CIA official.

226
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:00,398
- Michael's no killer.
- You see,

227
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,052
that's the problem.

228
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:03,630
Because Kaniel Outis is.

229
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,006
Thank you.

230
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,108
You're welcome.

231
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:07,510
And...

232
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,793
this is Kaniel Outis.

233
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,361
That's ridiculous.

234
00:13:11,363 --> 00:13:13,296
The record here at State says

235
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:16,166
- that... that's Kaniel Outis's face.
- Okay,

236
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,402
but you and I both know
who Michael Scofield was.

237
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:20,604
No, that's just a memory.

238
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:23,111
The official record... history...

239
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,680
It says otherwise now.

240
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:28,005
Now, that's scary, to think
who could be behind that.

241
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:31,076
Because only somebody very formidable

242
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,274
would be capable

243
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:34,183
of officially turning
one man into another.

244
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:37,287
It would take a genius... like Michael.

245
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,391
You're insinuating that he did this?

246
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:43,226
He disappeared,

247
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,814
just quit on his life?

248
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,417
I want answers just like you do.

249
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,998
Who's capable of this?

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,034
Only a handful of people in the world.

251
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:53,637
Sara? Sara!

252
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:59,509
I figure we got a day, maybe two,

253
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:01,278
tops, to get out of this hole.

254
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:06,616
At that point,

255
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:09,129
either the shelling gets us...

256
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:11,065
or ISIL does.

257
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,509
Does any of this phase you at all?

258
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:16,896
The fact that we're gonna die in here?

259
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,596
We're not gonna die.
We're still getting out.

260
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:20,964
All of us.

261
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,247
How's that? The roof?

262
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,416
- The roof ain't happening.
- The roof is happening.

263
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,418
We don't have time to come
up with another escape plan.

264
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,620
So you are nervous.

265
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:37,360
Great, now I know I'm in deep crap.

266
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,897
I'm only doing this for the money.

267
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,967
Don't think you and I are suddenly good.

268
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:46,436
You just deliver me the sheik.

269
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:49,138
The sheiks are well away from here.

270
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,840
High desert.

271
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:52,059
And I've never heard of one

272
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:54,077
being referred to as Sheik of Light.

273
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,679
Which means it's probably a code.

274
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:59,549
She knows your brother.

275
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:01,985
This tape...

276
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,821
It's the only thing that doesn't belong.

277
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:07,590
Your brother speaks in riddles,

278
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:10,163
- does he?
- Maybe it's Braille

279
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,762
or, uh, Morse.

280
00:15:12,764 --> 00:15:15,098
Or just numbers.

281
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,387
I think it's a phone number.

282
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,550
Voice mail.

283
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,686
Mohammad El-Tunis.

284
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:40,757
Director of Electrical Works in Sana'a.

285
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,358
Director of Electrical Works.

286
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,327
"Sheik of Light."

287
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,100
_

288
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:54,170
Thanks for taking the time to see us.

289
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,972
Where is everybody?

290
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:58,174
They are fleeing ahead of the advance.

291
00:15:58,176 --> 00:15:59,876
We have been trying to reach him.

292
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:02,251
All we know is that
he went to the suburbs

293
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,946
to try to find his daughter.

294
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:05,248
Do you have an address for her?

295
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,717
We tried calling her, but no answer.

296
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:11,888
Address is here.

297
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,123
You are not going to
try to find him, are you?

298
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,544
God be with you, then.

299
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:25,268
Circled the address.

300
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,502
Good luck.

301
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:28,137
You're coming with us.

302
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,319
If you think I'm going into the suburbs,

303
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,040
you're crazy.

304
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,575
What's wrong with the suburbs?

305
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:35,011
The suburbs are out there.

306
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:36,713
The front line of the war.

307
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,881
Nice knowing you, Benjamin.

308
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:39,859
I hope next time

309
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,718
it's under better circumstances.

310
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,082
- Pay up.
- You have to get us past the checkpoint.

311
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,456
Two Americans... we'll
never make it without you.

312
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,824
I am not getting myself killed.

313
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:48,991
Pay up.

314
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:50,693
Deliver the sheik.

315
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,562
Then you get your money.

316
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:01,370
Get in.

317
00:17:24,062 --> 00:17:25,595
Yes?

318
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:28,664
You should check your e-mail, Sara.

319
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,468
What am I looking at?

320
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,505
Footage captured by a
hunter four years ago.

321
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:38,975
One of those motion sensor
devices you hang on trees,

322
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:41,010
takes intermittent photos of prey.

323
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:43,960
Hunter comes out one
morning, finds these images.

324
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:56,692
This is the killing I
was telling you about.

325
00:17:56,694 --> 00:18:01,497
The victim's Harlan Gaines,
Deputy Chief of the CIA.

326
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,232
And the killer...

327
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:04,600
well, you can see,

328
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:06,569
it's who we call Michael Scofield,

329
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:09,739
- or Kaniel Outis, or...
- This is exactly what they did to Lincoln.

330
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,941
And then there's the blood
evidence the next day.

331
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:14,377
Kaniel or Michael or whatever
gets on a flight to Yemen.

332
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,314
We all most nail him when he lands.

333
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:17,814
He gets away.

334
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:19,282
His luggage doesn't

335
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:22,685
and Gaines' blood is all
over the clothes inside.

336
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:25,174
The evidence is overwhelming.

337
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:28,005
Whatever name you want to call him,

338
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,877
Michael's a murderer, Sara.

339
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,293
Hey.

340
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,140
Are you all right?

341
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,242
You all right?

342
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:48,777
Oh, this old thing?

343
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:50,578
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

344
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,214
What's going on?

345
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,050
I need your advice.

346
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,751
It's probably something you're not gonna

347
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:59,087
want to talk about.

348
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,434
I could really use
your clarity right now.

349
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,259
It's about Michael.

350
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,647
Still want to know how
he got that in here.

351
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,782
Hugging naked with the guards.

352
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:29,350
Got to be, right?

353
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,923
What the hell is that?

354
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,891
"We are the Champions."

355
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:42,297
You get stuck in a Porta-Potty
like this, you go Queen?

356
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,431
I mean, where are the girls

357
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,400
riding the washing machines, right?

358
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,164
Look at my screen again,
this goes in your eye.

359
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:53,108
You know, the world
never ceases to amaze.

360
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,509
You get stuck in a
Middle Eastern prison,

361
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,978
the biggest S.O.B. is a Korean.

362
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
He's in withdrawal.

363
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,724
You know, he's
the biggest collector

364
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,960
of Queen paraphernalia in the world.

365
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,838
They say his house in Seoul
is a shrine to Freddy Mercury.

366
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,331
And he got in here how?

367
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,099
Identity theft.

368
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:19,936
Apparently he used to sit on his couch,

369
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:22,475
hack high net worth
accounts all over the world.

370
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:25,240
Turned it into a collection
of Hummers, helicopters

371
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:27,342
and, apparently, Freddy Mercury's ashes.

372
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:30,178
Wait, you mean like his burnt-up body?

373
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,047
The story is Freddy's cremated,
but his ashes go missing.

374
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,416
To this day no one knows where they are.

375
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:38,653
Ja admitted to me once when
he was high he bought them.

376
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,388
Two million bucks.

377
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,524
He's got Queen's lead
singer in his family room.

378
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,392
How exactly do you know all this?

379
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:45,635
I asked him.

380
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:47,938
He's a real mensch when
he's not in withdrawal.

381
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:50,999
I didn't know you talked to him.

382
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,500
Amazing.

383
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,636
Just when I think I
know your game, I don't.

384
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:56,171
You know my game, Whip.

385
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:57,605
See, right there, "Whip."

386
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,274
I don't even know why you call me that.

387
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,875
Because you're my whip hand.

388
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:02,544
My ace in the hole.

389
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,246
Yeah, sure, okay.

390
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:10,285
See, in game theory,
it serves you to be two-faced.

391
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:15,245
Be everyone's friend till
the moment you're not.

392
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:17,979
You make them love you so much
that when they're up against it,

393
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:19,527
their loyalty will make them act

394
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,329
against their own best interests.

395
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,698
That's game theory.

396
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,869
A cold, rational focus on winning.

397
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,572
Even if it's at everyone else's expense.

398
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:33,731
What I'm trying to understand
is what he stands to gain.

399
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:38,154
Leaving his family,
and-and the new identity.

400
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,315
According to the little you've
told me, he was different.

401
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:41,583
Always an agenda, right?

402
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:43,857
Yeah.

403
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,820
I mean, he apparently loved you.

404
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,288
Of course he loved you.

405
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,757
How could he not?

406
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,760
But he also wanted you to open that door

407
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:55,701
in the prison for him.

408
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:57,865
I mean, true game theory,

409
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,868
everything, everyone

410
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,572
is a contingency.

411
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,242
You meet people, you
bring them into your life

412
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,645
and you keep them
percolating until the moment

413
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,915
you need to manipulate the
relationship to your advantage.

414
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm not judging, you
know? That's not my thing.

415
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,888
- I know.
- You know me. But...

416
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,959
schema as deep

417
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,962
and as calculating as
that can, in the end,

418
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,331
spin a man off into madness.

419
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,667
He might initially think
smaller evils are okay

420
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,435
in the service of a greater good.

421
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:37,071
Like breaking Lincoln out of prison.

422
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:40,041
But the dance of good and
evil could become jumbled,

423
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:42,143
and the manipulation itself becomes

424
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:43,945
the most important thing.

425
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,780
Becomes about winning

426
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,816
rather than whether the
game should be won at all.

427
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:59,926
I don't think I've seen
you this scared before.

428
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,303
They say, for Ramadan, as an act

429
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,672
of forgiveness, they're going to release

430
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:12,607
all prisoners from solitary over there

431
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:15,610
back into general population.

432
00:23:15,612 --> 00:23:17,464
Worst of the worst.

433
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,585
ISIL fanatics.

434
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:22,250
Abu Ramal.

435
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:24,759
They're going to kill me, you know.

436
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:28,856
Government gave me 20 years

437
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:32,427
for homosexuality.

438
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:34,195
But the monsters in there,

439
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:36,564
Ramal and his men,

440
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:39,267
won't let me live 20 minutes.

441
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:42,570
Please tell me

442
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:45,073
you still plan on
getting us out of here.

443
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,241
You were responsible
for killing the lights,

444
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,344
and then your Sheik
of Light went missing

445
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,679
at exactly the wrong time.

446
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,350
I don't know what happened to him.

447
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:58,786
Maybe I can find another way.

448
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:00,722
There is something you could do.

449
00:24:00,724 --> 00:24:02,390
Give me a piece of that gum.

450
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:06,094
Piece of gum is going
to get us out of prison?

451
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,719
It'll start the process.

452
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:11,232
Sometimes, my friend, I
can't tell which is bigger,

453
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:13,634
your plans or your lies.

454
00:24:13,636 --> 00:24:16,771
I take that personally,
you calling me a liar.

455
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,807
And I'm gonna show you, just
like the butterfly's wings,

456
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:22,543
this piece of gum is gonna
start a sequence of events

457
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,046
that will finish on the
other side of the world.

458
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,457
Battery, please.

459
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:05,612
Prison lighter.

460
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:14,558
Whip, I need your socks.

461
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:22,462
Sid, water can.

462
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,370
How we doing out there?

463
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,773
We're all good. Quick though.

464
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,950
Okay.

465
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:42,683
Hey.

466
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:44,384
You sure about this?

467
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:45,485
There's no time left.

468
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:47,087
The city's about to collapse.

469
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,590
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

470
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,032
Ah! Got it.

471
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,832
Come on, come on, come on.

472
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:03,570
Go, go, go.

473
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,973
Guards!

474
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:09,342
We got a sick one in here.

475
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,576
What is this?

476
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:15,682
He's burning up, he needs the infirmary.

477
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:17,367
Please.

478
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:24,713
This is it.

479
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,294
Limit of government control.

480
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:30,497
Anything after this is ISIL territory.

481
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:32,599
Stop.

482
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:38,538
Let me do the talking.

483
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,321
He's says us being
Westerners, a woman...

484
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:57,090
we go inside, we are not coming back.

485
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:59,993
They're not letting us through.

486
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:03,764
Tell him I bet $500 bucks
we'll make it back in one piece.

487
00:27:03,766 --> 00:27:06,266
He doesn't have $500 to bet.

488
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:07,567
It doesn't matter.

489
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:10,537
We don't make it back, he keeps it.

490
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,288
He says we have a death wish.

491
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,823
Fine.

492
00:27:40,894 --> 00:27:45,771
The city used to be beautiful, alive.

493
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:48,275
Look what they've done to it.

494
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:57,017
They're putting up
portraits of Abu Ramal.

495
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:59,252
He's only gotten more powerful

496
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:02,088
since he got locked up in Ogygia.

497
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,124
God help us if he gets out.

498
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:26,646
ISIL.

499
00:28:26,648 --> 00:28:28,281
We're gonna get stopped. Get down.

500
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:29,816
Down now.

501
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,920
Cover up.

502
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:37,624
Can't believe this.

503
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:39,125
I know him.

504
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,496
_

505
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,839
_

506
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:49,669
Reza.

507
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:52,138
It's Abu Amir now.

508
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,342
What are you doing
in the suburbs, Sheba?

509
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,466
Took a wrong turn.

510
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:01,348
You got your hair covered up.

511
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,384
That's good.

512
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:06,887
Finally find God?

513
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:09,089
Not your God.

514
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,191
There is only one God.

515
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:14,279
We're gonna take the city, you know.

516
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:18,965
You be nice...

517
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,335
maybe I'll make a good woman of you.

518
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:24,471
Forgive the devil in you.

519
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:28,775
Why don't I just turn around now?

520
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:30,810
We forgive each other.

521
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,546
Forget each other ever existed.

522
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:36,950
Beauty is not so easily forgotten.

523
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:38,752
Lover boy!

524
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:40,186
We have to go.

525
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:41,955
Government's moving in at Aksa Park.

526
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:46,259
Cut her loose.

527
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,513
Get the hell off our territory.

528
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:04,711
They are gone.

529
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:09,720
We have to hurry.

530
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:12,619
We're lucky he didn't
kill me right then.

531
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:14,087
Why?

532
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,058
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

533
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:24,331
They're destroying our city.

534
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:28,635
Your ISIL friends are
destroying our city.

535
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:30,157
And you come in here

536
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,272
wanting help.

537
00:30:32,274 --> 00:30:34,629
Just give me a little something.

538
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,943
Is there a doctor here?

539
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:38,611
I'm burning up.

540
00:30:38,613 --> 00:30:40,714
You should have thought about that

541
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:43,807
when you supplied guns to them,

542
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,585
assassinated good men.

543
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,520
Those charges were a misunderstanding.

544
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:49,923
Oh, Allah. Kaniel Outis says

545
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:52,092
it was a misunderstanding.

546
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:54,147
Was it also a misunderstanding

547
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,062
when you tried to escape the moment

548
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,465
you got into this prison? Hmm?

549
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:04,537
An honest man doesn't try to escape.

550
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:07,707
He asks for a lawyer. But you,

551
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:10,226
you tried to escape the very first week.

552
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:19,419
I'd have left you in solitary
forever if it was up to me.

553
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:17,335
The address at the end of the block.

554
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:19,612
Rebels...

555
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,081
right in front of the house.

556
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:22,582
Son of a bitch.

557
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:24,417
Anything easy in this country?

558
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,786
The question is: is
the sheik even inside?

559
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:28,976
Only one way to find out.

560
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,863
They find us up here,

561
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:38,865
there's no explaining ourselves.

562
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,900
We're all dead.

563
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:02,822
Shh, shh, shh.

564
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:04,591
Quiet.

565
00:33:04,593 --> 00:33:06,459
You... You are not ISIL?

566
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,929
No. But you're Mohammad
El-Tunis, I take it?

567
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,899
_

568
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:16,903
We are from the city center.
We are here to get you out.

569
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:18,304
Not without my daughter.

570
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:20,540
We can bring her. Where is she?

571
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,342
- She's out there.
- Where?

572
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:25,912
In the basement of the
schoolyard, across the street.

573
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:29,233
Pinned since ISIL arrived.

574
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:30,998
I came to get her out.

575
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:33,170
And I got pinned, too.

576
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,655
I hate to say it, Linc,
but I think we might've

577
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:37,157
just got pinned as well.

578
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,034
You okay?

579
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,844
You look like you could
use a few sharp edges

580
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:22,046
knocked off your world.

581
00:34:22,048 --> 00:34:25,116
You don't look so good yourself.

582
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,124
Say what you want about Yemen,

583
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,317
they're not shy about prescriptions.

584
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,687
It's the good stuff.
Morphine derivative.

585
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:44,268
I need access to your cell
phone and a credit card number.

586
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,571
Why?

587
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:50,675
I want to order a pizza.

588
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:57,882
There's a back door,

589
00:34:57,884 --> 00:34:59,681
toward the schoolhouse. Come on.

590
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:05,857
Too late.

591
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,725
Go to the rooftops.

592
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:09,026
They're all over the Rover.

593
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:10,952
- We'll never get to it.
- I can get in that pickup,

594
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:12,230
make a ruckus on my way out.

595
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:14,007
Any luck, they'll be all over me.

596
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,533
Then you got a clean shot to the Rover.

597
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:18,819
Go. Go!

598
00:35:18,822 --> 00:35:19,660
I'm not leaving

599
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:20,729
without my daughter.

600
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,457
You don't know what ISIL will do to her

601
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,041
for educating those girls.

602
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,043
I'll get her out, I promise.

603
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:31,489
- Go!
- Okay! Okay.

604
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:49,311
Your father sent me. I'm
getting you out of here.

605
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,169
Come on! Come on!

606
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,386
Get down! Stay down!

607
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:22,762
He's got to make it.

608
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,464
You know you got to make it. Come on.

609
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:28,234
There he is! There he is!

610
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,309
Yeah, baby!

611
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,617
Oh, no. This isn't good.

612
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,286
This isn't good.

613
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:00,371
This government checkpoint.

614
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,507
They'll think we're suicide
bombers. We have to stop.

615
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,008
Are you out of your mind?

616
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:06,983
Don't shoot at us!

617
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,880
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

618
00:37:13,418 --> 00:37:14,984
Stay down!

619
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,129
I'm so happy, too.

620
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,113
Forgive me, uh...

621
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:18,583
Their parents have been killed.

622
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,649
I'm trying to figure
out how I can help them.

623
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:22,620
They can stay here for now.

624
00:38:22,622 --> 00:38:25,130
As long as you tell me
who you know in Ogygia,

625
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,857
and why they want you so bad.

626
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:29,727
I'm a man with, uh...

627
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:32,129
troublesome children.

628
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:36,734
They're beautiful.

629
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:39,755
But perhaps too modern for this country.

630
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:43,516
My daughter tries to educate girls.

631
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,343
And my son,

632
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,912
he falls in love with another man.

633
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:51,849
They gave him 20 years in Ogygia Prison.

634
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,985
I went to visit him a few weeks ago.

635
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:57,888
He said, maybe there is a way out.

636
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,124
A way I could help.

637
00:39:00,126 --> 00:39:01,626
A man is not a man

638
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:03,508
if he would let his family die.

639
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:07,365
You agreed to help him.

640
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,666
How?

641
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:11,102
He said if I could arrange a blackout,

642
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,804
he... he knew someone
who could get him out.

643
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:14,939
An American?

644
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:16,641
I don't know.

645
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:19,043
I-I was supposed to do this a week ago,

646
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:22,647
but then this happened with my daughter.

647
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:23,981
Thank God you found us.

648
00:39:23,983 --> 00:39:26,384
There's still time to do it.

649
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:28,452
They're waiting for you in there.

650
00:39:28,454 --> 00:39:29,820
Then I have to go now.

651
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:31,922
He said I was to give a signal

652
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:34,291
exactly 24 hours before the blackout.

653
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,460
I will pulse the power grid twice.

654
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:39,043
This city may not have 24 hours in it.

655
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,475
Bye, guys.

656
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:52,515
Bye.

657
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:57,915
God knows I'm no perfect
judge of character,

658
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,885
but Michael?

659
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:03,521
If any of what they're saying is true...

660
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:05,656
So there's more to find out, Sara.

661
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:09,226
I mean, the important thing is
that you are gonna survive this,

662
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:11,204
however it turns out.

663
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:12,204
Mm-hmm.

664
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:15,433
And we're here for you. Okay?

665
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:16,834
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

666
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:17,835
Call me, okay?

667
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,437
Yeah.

668
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,843
Hey, can I just scoop Mike real quick?

669
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:26,277
All the kids have been released.

670
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:28,879
You don't have him?

671
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,181
Mike?

672
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:32,983
- I'll go this way.
- Okay, yeah.

673
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,820
Mike?

674
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:39,390
Hey, hey, have you seen Mike?

675
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:40,691
Mike!

676
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:44,428
Mike!

677
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,997
Mike!

678
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:49,900
There...

679
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:51,569
What are you doing? You scared me.

680
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:53,066
I was looking for where the man went.

681
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:54,202
What man, baby?

682
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:55,940
The man that gave me this.

683
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:58,576
The pizza man.

684
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:00,478
The pizza man?

685
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:09,219
_

686
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:11,122
Michael.

687
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:12,929
What are you into?

688
00:41:19,265 --> 00:41:22,199
ISIL is getting closer by the hour.

689
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:24,602
And the rebels in here know it.

690
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:26,871
When they take over,
they'll kill all of us.

691
00:41:28,141 --> 00:41:32,176
Infidels, the sinners, the foreigners.

692
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:43,998
Praise Allah.

693
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,201
Someone found my father.

694
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,964
Means the escape is on.

695
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,235
24 hours from now.

696
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:56,700
But this may be too late.

697
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:59,537
Ramadan has begun.

698
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,772
The guards are releasing the prisoners.

699
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,676
Abu Ramal and his men,

700
00:42:05,678 --> 00:42:07,444
they'll kill me.

701
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:08,817
And you.

702
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,054
_

703
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:52,086
_

704
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,750
_

705
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,312
