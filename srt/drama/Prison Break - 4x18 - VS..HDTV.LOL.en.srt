1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,596
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:01,664 --> 00:00:03,131
I had a deal with the General.

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,566
You couldn't just
let me handle this?

4
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,234
If by handle, you mean
give Scylla back to the General,

5
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:07,502
then no.

6
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,007
I should warn you I'm
going to do everything

7
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,572
in my power to stop you.

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,606
I want my life back.

9
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:13,141
Linc, Mom is alive.

10
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,543
What?

11
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,045
I guess I'll see you in Miami.

12
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:18,280
If I give Scylla
back to the General,

13
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:19,381
he leaves me
and Michael alone,

14
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,716
and I get to spend time
with my son in peace.

15
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:25,053
What if General Krantz were
no longer in the picture?

16
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:28,123
What's going on?
- Good-bye, Jonathan.

17
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,293
Where are you, Christina?

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,928
I don't like your
tone, Jonathan.

19
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:34,362
Excuse me,

20
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,565
but it's been a while
since anyone's tried to kill me.

21
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,471
The General should know by now

22
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:44,839
not to mess with us.

23
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:48,743
The General didn't send me.

24
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,345
Christina is going
to change the Company.

25
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:51,613
She said after two days

26
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,315
she would make the change?
- Yeah.

27
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:55,750
Look at the date on that
laminate-- two days away.

28
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:57,285
I need to talk to her.

29
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:59,120
<i>Lincoln's back at the plaza.</i>

30
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:01,022
I told him to stay away.

31
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,857
<i>We have a clean shot.</i>

32
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,492
Take it.

33
00:01:07,697 --> 00:01:09,130
Roger that.

34
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,850
Stevenson rooftop, 12 o'clock.

35
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:31,312
Where's Christina?!

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,714
Where's Christina?

37
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:34,749
Somebody call the police!

38
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,431
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Stay in the car.

39
00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:55,937
Where is she?

40
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,105
Where is she?

41
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:59,207
Where is she?!

42
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:02,710
We got his phone;
let's get. We got to go.

43
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:04,579
We got to go.
- Let's go.

44
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:13,655
<i>She only uses the place</i>
<i>in the winter, so...</i>

45
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:17,625
we should be fine
for a while here.

46
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:21,830
(sighing
And that's Deb.

47
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:24,966
Were you guys in college
together, too?

48
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,269
Uh, no,
just medical school.

49
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,004
She's got a practice...

50
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,475
...in New York

51
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,243
and she comes down here

52
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:37,011
once a year
to teach a seminar.

53
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,351
God, good for her.

54
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,993
Nice family photos.

55
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:57,398
Sand, sun,
cheesy matching outfits.

56
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:03,138
We could have that
if we wanted... someday.

57
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,606
Stuart, take a seat.

58
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,347
Scylla is in Miami.

59
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:54,816
Our people are combing
the city as we speak.

60
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,284
Yes, I've heard.

61
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:59,320
Someone's attempting
a hostile takeover.

62
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:00,555
Whoever has Scylla

63
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:03,291
is trying to turn
the cardholders against me.

64
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,393
Oren tried to kill me yesterday.

65
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:06,427
Jonathan...

66
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,930
We're dumping
your cell phone.

67
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:10,798
We've already found
several phone calls

68
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:13,468
between you
and an unknown party.

69
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:20,275
Stuart... who has Scylla?

70
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:21,442
I don't know.

71
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,412
Think, buddy.

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,648
Think.

73
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:28,950
I swear I don't
know anything.

74
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,285
This can be
as painless

75
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:32,887
as you want it to be.

76
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:37,158
Who has Scylla?

77
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:42,697
You have gone
around the bend on this.

78
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,867
I haven't even started yet.

79
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,876
Come on, Linc, this guy
wasn't trying to hurt you.

80
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,278
He just didn't
like your tattoo.

81
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,048
You're a funny guy, Self.
- There's a lot of calls

82
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:02,283
on the sniper's cell
from a blocked number.

83
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:04,319
We'll need the Company
to help identify it.

84
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,487
What if it's your
mom's cell phone, Linc,

85
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:07,989
and we have to
pay a visit?

86
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,090
You got the gumption?

87
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,999
Yeah.

88
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,636
Lincoln, I don't like having
to initiate these calls.

89
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,805
Well, don't.
We'll call you when we get it.

90
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,741
Who has Scylla?

91
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:27,842
We don't know,

92
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,243
but we tangled
with a sniper.

93
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:33,881
Whom you're interrogating
right now, right?

94
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,350
He's dead.

95
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,951
Lincoln,
the point of this action

96
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:39,921
is not to kill as many of them
as you can!

97
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,391
Your methods make me question

98
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,226
whether you are capable
of playing

99
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,328
on a field of this size.

100
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,529
We'll get Scylla.

101
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:51,699
I want answers today.

102
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,270
Aren't you leaving
something out,

103
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,773
something a tad critical,
like it's your mom

104
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,708
who has Scylla, hmm?

105
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:03,044
Don't think too much.
- Let's talk about that.

106
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:04,912
Let's talk about thinking
too much, okay?

107
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,080
Are you stonewalling
the General 'cause it's good

108
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:07,715
for the team here,
or are you protecting the woman

109
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:10,718
who popped you out
lo these many years ago, huh?

110
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,787
If Krantz didn't put
you here, I'd kill you.

111
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:16,224
All right,
all right!

112
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,959
There's my answer.
- If we tell Krantz

113
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:21,162
that Christina has it, he may
know things that'll help us

114
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,030
or he may determine
that we're no longer useful.

115
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:24,399
Everybody
understand that?

116
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,735
We're here to get Scylla,
we need Scylla,

117
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:30,304
and the way to do that
is to stick to the plan

118
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:31,672
and to keep our mouths shut.

119
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:42,517
Hey, look at this.

120
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:45,119
Yesterday he found
us on Interstate 10,

121
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:49,157
near Route 4 in Arizona.

122
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,425
And "MS" are
your initials.

123
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:51,559
Yeah,

124
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:54,262
but the rest of this
could mean anything.

125
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,464
I'll do a search on Rockwell
and we'll figure it out.

126
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,666
Assuming Lincoln hasn't already.

127
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:00,968
He's been here three days

128
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,171
and he's got access
to Company resources.

129
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,006
And once he puts

130
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,841
his mind to something,
that's it,

131
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,776
even if he figures
out he's wrong.

132
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:11,746
Well, and from
what I've gathered,

133
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,515
he doesn't think he is wrong,

134
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,617
so...

135
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:27,195
If I'm MS, then who's VS?

136
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,210
<i>Nomaashkaar, kaam...</i>

137
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:45,046
<i>No... Nomaashkaar, kaam.</i>

138
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:49,183
Bengali has
14 different vowels.

139
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,018
It's a bitch
to pronounce.

140
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,253
Lincoln got away.

141
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:06,501
Have you ever seen a picture
of a supernova?

142
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:09,470
I have.

143
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,340
They're quite beautiful,
aren't they?

144
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:15,009
They're very rare;
they only occur

145
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:19,413
about once every 50 years.

146
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:23,284
We're a day away
from a kind of supernova.

147
00:10:26,288 --> 00:10:30,758
A moment so powerful
it'll eclipse everything.

148
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,029
And nobody's going
to stop me.

149
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:47,822
No?

150
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,190
They haven't got it yet.

151
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,658
Well, I've sent it twice
already. Either they...

152
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:51,959
They got it.
They got it. Okay.

153
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,595
We need you to trace
who called the sniper's cell

154
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,831
and tell us
where he is in Miami.

155
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:57,999
Well, when?

156
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,167
No.

157
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:02,069
Hell, no. We need
it now. We...

158
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,272
Hour earliest.

159
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:05,273
What do you
mean, hour?

160
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,707
We get him, we get to Christina.

161
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:09,410
Damn well almost got our asses
handed to us getting these.

162
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,112
You want to know
what your mama's up to--

163
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
let's start there.

164
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,347
These things are
for tomorrow.

165
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:14,916
I want Scylla today!

166
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,083
Oh, sorry there, Sink.

167
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:18,019
There I go thinking again.
My bad.

168
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,903
Why?

169
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:38,105
I'm getting you out of here.

170
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,714
What is it?
- It's Michael.

171
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:48,249
He's in Miami, wants to meet.

172
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,451
When?

173
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,788
Never.

174
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,024
I warned him not to come.

175
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,781
Hello, Alex.

176
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,850
Glad to see
you're both in one piece.

177
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,485
Where's my brother?

178
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,686
He's not coming.

179
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:27,421
So you're working
with him now?

180
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:28,956
You work for the Company?

181
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:32,593
Sure. Fine.

182
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:33,761
Why are you here?

183
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:34,929
Partly to warn you.

184
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:36,497
I could have
saved you the trip.

185
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,699
'Cause we're seeing
this thing through.

186
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:39,867
What do you know?

187
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:41,302
What do you think
you've walked into?

188
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,903
You tell me.

189
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:46,874
Your mother.

190
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,876
She has Scylla.

191
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:49,977
Whoever's going
to get it

192
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,479
has to go through her.

193
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:53,514
I need to talk to my brother.

194
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:54,615
He's not coming.

195
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,484
He's a little
too busy trying

196
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:57,652
to stay alive because your...

197
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,020
because your mother tried
to kill him.

198
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,322
And if you stay here
with some half-baked plan,

199
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,291
she's gonna try
and kill you.

200
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,925
What are you doing here, Alex?

201
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,160
I'm trying to get

202
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:08,229
some information,
anything that can help.

203
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,331
You need to trust me.
- So that you

204
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,899
can run back
to the General with it?

205
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,167
Everybody can get

206
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:15,002
what they want here.
We don't have to chose between

207
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,871
saving our families and
taking down the Company.

208
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:18,406
We can do both.

209
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:21,409
How?

210
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:23,210
I'll know when we get there.

211
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:25,413
That's why I'm
asking you, please,

212
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,214
trust me.

213
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,785
Now, do you
know anything?

214
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:31,952
Do you have
anything?

215
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,988
The only thing
I can tell you is

216
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,524
that we're gonna burn
the Company down to the ground,

217
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:39,527
and that's with
or without you, Alex.

218
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,167
I'm sorry, Michael.

219
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,536
About your mother.

220
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:55,843
<i>So, the guy</i>
<i>who was posing as a cop</i>

221
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,447
yesterday must have been
working for my mother.

222
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,584
Yeah. Yeah,
I think you're right.

223
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,186
And if he was
following

224
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,954
her instructions, that means...

225
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,289
Guess that means

226
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:10,458
she wanted the two of us
transported somewhere.

227
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:15,329
At least
she didn't want us killed.

228
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,564
I guess I should be grateful.

229
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,401
Does this change anything?

230
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:22,903
No.

231
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:25,106
The fact that
she thrived

232
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:27,541
within the Company,
at the expense of...

233
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,610
everyone else...

234
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,583
...mes me want
to take them down even more.

235
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:39,587
Okay.

236
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:41,856
Rockwell Avenue, South Miami.

237
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,293
Let's go.

238
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,302
All right, the SIM card
information the Company gave us

239
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,271
said this guy should be
a couple of blocks over.

240
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,274
This better be the guy who
ordered the hit on you, Linc,

241
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:02,243
not some pizza delivery boy.
- Why don't you just shut up?

242
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,444
All right, listen,
he's stopping.

243
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,612
Lincoln,
you're gonna make a right

244
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,813
about a quarter of mile up.

245
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:08,783
What's the location?

246
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,442
I do. Whose seal is that?

247
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,777
India. This is the embassy.

248
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:38,579
All right, there he is.

249
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,349
And look who he's with.

250
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,452
She's got Scylla.

251
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,654
We need to get in there.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

252
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,689
Okay, if she's going in,
she's gonna come back out.

253
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,958
And when she does,
we take our shot.

254
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,460
One thing I learned
at Fox River-- just 'cause

255
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,128
something goes in, don't mean
it always comes back out.

256
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:55,296
You're right.

257
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:56,497
Hark, what was that?
One more time?

258
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,665
Look, she's got
that thing on her.

259
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,333
We need to move now.

260
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,935
We need to create a distraction.

261
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:13,247
Ready to go, T-Bag?

262
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:15,883
No, no, no, no.
Well, what do you want me to say?

263
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,551
Run your mouth.

264
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,020
You know how
to do that.

265
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:22,089
Look, when we get in,
we'll let you know.

266
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:24,592
Until then,
you keep 'em busy.

267
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,860
Oh, come on, Donnie.

268
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:30,831
I don't know
about this.

269
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,566
Excuse me?

270
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,768
Excuse me. I'd like a meeting
with your president, sir.

271
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:37,204
Uh... could you notify him
I'm here? Thank you.

272
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:38,772
The president doesn't live
in America, sir.

273
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,940
She lives in Kashmir.

274
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:41,942
She? Oh, well.

275
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,512
That explains a lot, don't it? Listen,

276
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,347
Haji, I got no beefs
with you, okay?

277
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:48,682
It's just, there comes a point
when a thinking man

278
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,017
has to take a stand.

279
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,453
You know who else
thinks? Elephants.

280
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:54,054
That's right. Elephants.

281
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,290
You know, they have
the largest brain

282
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,691
in the whole animal kingdom?

283
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,126
Did you know what?

284
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,569
Come on, Bagwell.

285
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:11,472
Sir...
You folks have a history

286
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,040
of mistreating
these mighty creatures,

287
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,875
and up till now, no one's
been lifting a finger.

288
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:16,043
Up till now.

289
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,311
This is private property, sir.

290
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

291
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:22,049
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

292
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:24,985
Ha!
- Unlock those now!

293
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:27,221
This is station four.
I have a code 11.

294
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,489
Bring it!

295
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,658
Security camera's looking good.

296
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,026
Let him go.

297
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:36,030
Let's move.

298
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:06,594
Sir? Sir? America's on
the other end of that sidewalk.

299
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,429
You're on international soil.

300
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:11,832
For your sake, I hope
you brought the keys for that.

301
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,101
I have no-no gripes
with you at all, okay?

302
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:15,903
I've been calling
my congressman.

303
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,471
I've been writing
United Nations.

304
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:18,772
I don't care.

305
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,107
Did you know that elephants eat

306
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:22,643
over 500 pounds
of food per day?!

307
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:24,612
And their dung--

308
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:26,113
it can be... it
can be processed

309
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:27,581
into parchment.

310
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,617
You're about to be
in a big heap on that, sir.

311
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:30,784
Elephant!
- Front gate now.

312
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,119
Elephant!

313
00:18:32,187 --> 00:18:34,188
Let's go.

314
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:43,864
All right, let's go.

315
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm gonna text Bagwell
and let him know we're in.

316
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:48,636
All right. After 9/11,
DHS implemented some new

317
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,504
protocol regarding...
- Just hurry up.

318
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:52,006
It's an abomination.

319
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,073
That's what it is.

320
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:54,208
It's an abomination.

321
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,777
Why, the elephants,
next to the chimps,

322
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,981
have the closest DNA sequence
as us human beings.

323
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,816
Sir, I don't think that's true.

324
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,027
Sorry to inconvenience
you guys.

325
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,531
Your ride's here, pal.

326
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,699
Take him.

327
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,234
Hey! Hey!

328
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:22,269
Boys! Boys!

329
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:23,504
This is just
a misunderstanding.

330
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:24,905
They're going to
take you down

331
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,507
to visit your
buddies at the zoo.

332
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:28,876
Bagwell's in trouble.
- Are we made?

333
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,778
We're not waiting around
to find out. Let's go.

334
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:32,546
We got about ten seconds

335
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,415
before we go live all over
this place. Come on.

336
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,820
Okay, here we go. Let's go.

337
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,450
Looks good over here.

338
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:52,518
Clear here.

339
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,889
We got to hurry.

340
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:02,395
Have you ever seen
the Taj Mahal?

341
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:06,132
Only in photographs.

342
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,633
You?

343
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:09,936
Several times.

344
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:13,206
It was built by the Shah Jahan
for his favorite wife.

345
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:15,975
I remember telling that
to my ex-husband.

346
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:18,044
Do you know what his reply was?

347
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:21,981
<i>Nomahkaar,</i>
<i>kaamon aachen?</i>

348
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:23,216
That's very sweet,
Christina.

349
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:24,650
I'm fine, thank you.

350
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,652
Please.
- Thank you.

351
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,754
I'm sorry for all
the extra security,

352
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,957
but as I'm sure
you realize,

353
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,258
there's a lot of people

354
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,594
who would like
to get their hands on this.

355
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,028
Mm.

356
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:41,968
This is an overview of
the solar cell prototype.

357
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:44,637
That's just the beginning
of what's on here.

358
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,372
A desalination technique

359
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,507
that can yield
potable water

360
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:50,676
within seconds.

361
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,044
Hmm.

362
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:54,180
Bioengineered crops

363
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:58,084
that will subsist
in the harshest of climates.

364
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:01,621
Revolutionary vaccines.

365
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:06,425
Well, you know, that there's
a rumor floating about

366
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:10,429
that this belongs
to General Krantz.

367
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,067
That eight-carat
purple diamond

368
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,203
your lovely wife wears
on her hand.

369
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:18,838
Did you worry out

370
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:20,973
which South African country
it was taken from?

371
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:26,145
The profit margin would
be split fifty-fifty.

372
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:29,915
Your country would handle the
manufacturing and distribution.

373
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:32,551
I would act as your
silent partner.

374
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,857
Please.

375
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:39,592
Have a seat.

376
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:52,738
Last resort. We clear?

377
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:55,808
No, he's not clear.

378
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:58,144
We fire off a shot in here,

379
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,912
not getting out.

380
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,946
Are we clear?

381
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,815
We're clear.

382
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,117
I sense there's something
that you're not telling me.

383
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:06,819
All you have to do

384
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,922
is show up at the Progressive
Energies conference tomorrow,

385
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,957
go up on the dais,

386
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,426
and present this
technology as your own.

387
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:14,760
So, I'm the one

388
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:17,830
who looks like the fool
if this venture fails.

389
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,565
The leading minds
of this world

390
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,634
will be at that conference
tomorrow,

391
00:22:21,702 --> 00:22:23,736
working on
the crisis

392
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:26,305
that we are facing
with our planet.

393
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:29,342
You will have
the solution.

394
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:32,078
You will be a visionary.

395
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:34,613
Dr. Vincent Sandinsky

396
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:36,649
has done extensive research

397
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:38,017
on the bargain theory.

398
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,186
Says that proof of its
practical application

399
00:22:40,253 --> 00:22:42,154
is pretty shaky.

400
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,523
He's giving a lecture tomorrow
at the conference

401
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:47,093
and I'd like to make sure
that his findings

402
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,629
don't debunk the foundation
of our project

403
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:52,431
before we even get
off the ground.

404
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:53,699
Naveen,

405
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:56,335
the technology that
I am offering you

406
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:58,371
will catapult
your country

407
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:01,207
50 years ahead of its time.

408
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:03,209
Naturally,

409
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:05,878
a few other countries have
expressed some interest.

410
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:07,446
I'm sure that
they would be happy

411
00:23:07,514 --> 00:23:09,382
to sell you this information

412
00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:11,450
at three times the
price in a few years.

413
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:12,718
This is all very sudden.

414
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,120
Well, as I
said, I only

415
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:16,122
acquired this recently.

416
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:20,259
But I assure you,
it is going to sell.

417
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:23,562
I came to you first
out of respect to your father.

418
00:23:29,436 --> 00:23:32,037
I will just say
one more thing...

419
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:33,272
Mm-hmm.

420
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,841
...then I will let you
do what you like.

421
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,412
What do you think your father
would have done with this offer?

422
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:57,630
I need a minute.

423
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,432
And don't worry about Sandinsky.

424
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,401
He won't be a problem.

425
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:11,210
This is 48 Rockwell.

426
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:12,578
Uh,

427
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:14,580
we need B23.

428
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:16,015
Row D.

429
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:17,950
Row B.

430
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:22,154
B23.
This is it.

431
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,375
Fernando was a great influence
on you, huh?

432
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:45,644
And vice versa.

433
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:04,263
Here we go.

434
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:11,437
Car keys.

435
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:17,910
So, there's
no itinerary,

436
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:20,446
but we do have a map to
the Everglade Memorial Airport.

437
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:24,049
And we have a gun.

438
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:27,620
I've been thinking about this.

439
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:30,923
"V" and "S"
are someone's initials.

440
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,993
1630 is 4:30 p.m. military time.

441
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,995
What if our guy wasn't
flying out,

442
00:25:36,062 --> 00:25:38,964
but someone named VS
was flying in.

443
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:50,709
I found one of our guys.

444
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,211
Good. He'll take us to Christine.

445
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,646
Now where are you?
- Second floor.

446
00:25:53,713 --> 00:25:55,714
Near the atrium.

447
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:10,729
Don't move!

448
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:12,765
Freeze!

449
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,167
23, I have Lincoln Burrows
and two male suspects

450
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:17,069
in custody.

451
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,392
We need to clear out.

452
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,262
Excuse me?

453
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,130
Lincoln's in the building.

454
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:30,932
I need close
this deal.

455
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,602
Preferably without looking
like an amateur.

456
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:35,003
Handle it.

457
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,608
Get in there.

458
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,743
Move!

459
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,078
Get on your knees,

460
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:44,713
put your hands
on your head.

461
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,348
Get down.

462
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:50,418
318.

463
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:52,721
Understood.

464
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,756
Move an inch

465
00:26:54,824 --> 00:26:57,192
and I won't hesitate
to kill any of you.

466
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,667
I think we've come
to a decision.

467
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,135
You honor your side
of the agreement

468
00:27:07,203 --> 00:27:09,905
and I will do the unveiling
at the conference tomorrow.

469
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,673
That's great news, Naveen.
Great news.

470
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:13,742
Thank you.
- Thank you.

471
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,381
Let's go.

472
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,358
Is there another way
out of here?

473
00:27:31,394 --> 00:27:33,328
Huh?

474
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:35,130
He just said don't go
near the door.

475
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:36,131
This is an embassy.

476
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,198
Christina can't risk

477
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:40,235
an incident,
just like we couldn't.

478
00:27:40,303 --> 00:27:42,304
Nobody's going to kill us.

479
00:27:43,606 --> 00:27:44,739
Let's go.

480
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:50,712
I don't know how
the hell they found us.

481
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,615
All I care about
is Sandinsky.

482
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:54,916
Is Morris on
his way?

483
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,618
We haven't heard
from him yet.

484
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:57,819
I'll check his status.

485
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,890
Here, give me that.

486
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:09,831
Who are you gentlemen with?

487
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,868
Christina.

488
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:15,837
Here.

489
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:16,905
She dropped this.

490
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:25,880
We're about a mile away.

491
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:30,518
Is that you?

492
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:33,254
I think it's coming from
inside the briefcase.

493
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:37,859
Private caller.

494
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,661
Can they track us on this thing?

495
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:42,130
Put it on speakerphone.

496
00:28:45,635 --> 00:28:47,469
Hello?

497
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,039
Michael?

498
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:03,818
Was that your mom?

499
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:12,560
Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.

500
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:17,265
I don't even know what to say.

501
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,336
There's nothing to say.

502
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:25,807
Nothing at all.

503
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:38,953
What the hell
happened to you?

504
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:40,689
Where's Scylla, huh?

505
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,324
They left before
we could get it.

506
00:29:45,361 --> 00:29:47,429
I got the ass kicking
of a lifetime

507
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,464
and you come back empty-handed?

508
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:50,632
We got this.

509
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,501
A Post-it note?!

510
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:54,769
That's what you got?

511
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:57,138
How about some Elmer's Glue?

512
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:58,306
Did you get any
of that?

513
00:29:58,374 --> 00:29:59,340
Would you calm down.

514
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,575
This is important to us.

515
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:02,677
If we had just told
the General...

516
00:30:02,745 --> 00:30:04,012
just told the General...

517
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,247
One more time.

518
00:30:06,315 --> 00:30:08,783
Hey, if this guy's
important to Christina,

519
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,486
he's important to us.

520
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:13,588
Hey, let's call the Company,
get a read on him.

521
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:15,023
I'll do it.

522
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,785
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

523
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:45,854
I'll be right out.

524
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,536
Whoever VS is,

525
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:04,205
their plane gets in in
less than 30 minutes.

526
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:07,275
We need to g our hands
on that flight log.

527
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,344
Sure.

528
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:18,353
Hi.

529
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,255
Um, sorry,
I notice you have

530
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:22,590
a sign up there that says
I can learn to fly here.

531
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:24,459
Do you have a brochure
I can take a look at?

532
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:26,127
Let me call you back.

533
00:31:26,195 --> 00:31:28,163
Sure, I should have one
around her somewhere.

534
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,531
Thank you.

535
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:35,870
There you go.

536
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,372
Okay.

537
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,373
"Learn how to fly."

538
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,274
This is perfect!

539
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:51,820
Michael.

540
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:59,894
There was an exit
by the bathrooms.

541
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:00,929
I need 30 seconds.

542
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:02,397
They will kill us
if they find us.

543
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,898
Vincent Sandinsky.

544
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,301
VS. N727MG.

545
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:09,070
Let's go.

546
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:13,021
Got it.

547
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:15,090
Vincent Sandinsky's
on a plane right now.

548
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,859
He's heading into
Everglade Memorial Airport.

549
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:17,993
We got 15 minutes

550
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,394
to get to Fort Lauderdale.

551
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:21,763
With traffic, there's no
way we're going to make it.

552
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:23,265
Then stay.

553
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:30,472
Excuse me, can I help you?

554
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,808
Funny you should ask.

555
00:32:32,876 --> 00:32:34,142
I need you to call up
to the tower

556
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,611
with a message for N727MG.

557
00:32:38,982 --> 00:32:40,816
N727MG.

558
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:42,351
This is Everglade Memorial
tower.

559
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,919
We just got word
from another craft

560
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:46,655
that your port side turbine's
trailing black.

561
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,592
Tower, I'm clear across
the board here.

562
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,261
Am I still good for landing?

563
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:53,929
Now tell them he
needs to land

564
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:55,864
at the north end of the tarmac

565
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,432
and follow emergency
protocol.

566
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,767
But that'll...
Tell them.

567
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:00,769
Do you copy?

568
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,940
Tower, this is operations.

569
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:06,975
Have November-Seven-

570
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:10,712
Two-Seven-Michael-Golf approach
from the southwest.

571
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,114
We're not gonna
take any chances.

572
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:14,650
We're gonna send
a crew out to them.

573
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:17,486
Have the passengers evac
as soon as they hit the ground.

574
00:33:17,553 --> 00:33:18,954
Roger that.

575
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:20,856
Now call down to security.

576
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:23,859
Tell them Dr. Sara Tancredi
needs to be let on the tarmac.

577
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:25,861
One of your passengers has had

578
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,362
a heart attack.

579
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,364
He needs immediate assistance.

580
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,168
Security, this is operations.

581
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:57,993
Okay.

582
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,127
One more mine,

583
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,562
and I'll be out
of your hair.

584
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,497
Hey.

585
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,499
You could be getting
in big trouble

586
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:06,535
for this, guy.

587
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:08,270
You could go to prison.

588
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,305
Which one?

589
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:36,465
Something's going on here.

590
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:50,912
I'm not sure what
the problem is.

591
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,214
Vincent Sandinsky?

592
00:34:52,281 --> 00:34:53,949
Yes?

593
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:55,384
Hi. Dr. Tancredi.

594
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:57,586
Sir, I need you to come with me.
- Is there something wrong?

595
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,554
Uh, we have some concerns
about some health exposure

596
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,256
you may have experienced
during the flight.

597
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:04,292
I'm sorry, I don't...
Let's go.

598
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,761
Michael Scofield,
Vincent Sandinsky.

599
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:07,963
Get in the car.

600
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,665
Why...
- Back seat.

601
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,334
Get in!

602
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:22,477
Please...

603
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:23,745
don't hurt me.

604
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,113
I won't.

605
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,984
But they will.

606
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,359
You can take
everything I have.

607
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,994
Just... please let me go.

608
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,301
Do you know
who Christina Scofield is?

609
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:47,502
Who?

610
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,172
No.

611
00:35:54,177 --> 00:35:55,377
Michael, I'm running
out of road.

612
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,645
Head for the hangars.

613
00:36:07,056 --> 00:36:07,956
Oh, my God.

614
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:10,725
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

615
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,294
What's going
on here?

616
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:13,428
Get out of the car!

617
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:14,463
Now!

618
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,864
Michael...
- Get out of the car!

619
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:17,766
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Move it!

620
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,534
We should do what they say.
- Move it!

621
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:21,570
Come on,
before they kill us.

622
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,839
Let's just do
what they want.

623
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,575
Let's just do what they want
before they kill us, please.

624
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,043
Get down.

625
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,578
Get down now!

626
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:31,913
Now.

627
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,283
Put him in
the car.

628
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:37,586
What do we do
with these two?

629
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,421
Kill them.

630
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:08,216
You okay?

631
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,351
Yeah.

632
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:11,219
Thanks to you, I guess. Hey.

633
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,787
Get out.

634
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,855
Here, move it.

635
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:15,757
Where are you taking me?
- Move.

636
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:16,958
What's going on?
- Go, move!

637
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,528
But where are you taking me?
- Move it!

638
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:21,096
What do you want to do with me?

639
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:22,764
Stop talking and start walking.

640
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:23,865
This is a mistake.

641
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:25,967
Lincoln, have you
lost your mind?

642
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,969
But... what's going on?

643
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,205
Just get in the car now.

644
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:31,940
What are you gonna do?

645
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:34,109
Shoot me?

646
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:36,444
I warned you not to come,
Michael.

647
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:39,080
I'm doing this for us,
the family.

648
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,583
Well, it's not over.

649
00:37:41,651 --> 00:37:43,852
Not by a long shot.

650
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:30,381
What?

651
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,084
I... got some information
for you.

652
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:35,252
But I want to make sure
that everything

653
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,355
we talked about
is still heading my way.

654
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:40,224
The car, the office

655
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,425
and the house.

656
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,027
Bagwell, if you're
jerking me around...

657
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:46,597
You trying to talk me out of it?

658
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:48,499
Just tell me.

659
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:57,975
Linc and Michael's mother.

660
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,811
She's got Scylla.

661
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:03,147
Here in Miami.

662
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,049
And, General...

663
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:07,184
Fuel the jet.

664
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:09,253
We're going to Miami.

665
00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:12,056
Christina Rose Scofield.

666
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:13,724
That name mean anything
to you?

667
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,626
No.

668
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:17,361
Then why was she holding on
to your flight information?

669
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:20,431
I have no idea.

670
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:21,432
You ever heard
of the Company?

671
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,466
No.

672
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:23,834
Company!
You never heard of the Company?

673
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,002
You ever heard of Scylla?

674
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,706
What do you do for a living?

675
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,109
I'm a professor at Dartmouth.

676
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:34,011
What are you doing in Miami?

677
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:38,582
I, uh... I just wanted
to get out of New Hampshire

678
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,518
for a few days.

679
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:42,253
To be honest, right now...

680
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,622
I wish I hadn't.

681
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:46,323
Just relax.

682
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,193
I got a call from the
organizing committee

683
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,928
of the Progressive Energies
conference that's here tomorrow.

684
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:53,164
They said they would fly me out

685
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:55,599
and put me up in a hotel

686
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,035
if I gave a short presentation.

687
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,638
Where's your cell?

688
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,843
Uh... it's-it's in my jacket.

689
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,719
Why are you lying to me?

690
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:17,421
I had it
when I got off the plane.

691
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:18,489
I swear to God.

692
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:22,893
Yeah, Michael,
he said he doesn't

693
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:24,495
know your mom,
but there's got to be

694
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:27,531
20 e-mails back and
forth between them.

695
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:30,167
They don't just
know each other.

696
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:31,702
They're working
together.

697
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,071
The question is, on what?

698
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:39,877
Linc.

699
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:48,052
Vincent Sandinsky.

700
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:56,260
What about the last number dialed?

701
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,395
There's a lot of calls
from that number.

702
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,100
I'll be right back.

703
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:58,422
Anything?

704
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,090
Not yet.

705
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:09,767
Yes?

706
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,303
How badly do you want him, Mom?

707
00:42:14,372 --> 00:42:16,507
Michael, listen to me.

708
00:42:16,574 --> 00:42:18,676
That's not an answer.

709
00:42:18,743 --> 00:42:20,978
I'll be in touch.

710
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:29,820
His story checks out.

711
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:31,455
Listen, there are still
some things

712
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:33,924
we need to figure out,
but as soon as we do,

713
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:35,125
we'll let you go.

714
00:42:35,193 --> 00:42:36,593
Thank you.

715
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:45,235
