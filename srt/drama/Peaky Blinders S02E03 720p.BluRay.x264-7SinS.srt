1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,359
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,199
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,479
Tell us your plan.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,919
I can offer you 100 good men.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,759
Get him out of there, get him back!

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,679
Arthur killed a boy.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,519
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,879
Your daughter is dead.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,439
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,399
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,159
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,879
I think she might be my mother.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,719
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,519
He's head of some secret department,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,239
the Irish Desk.

16
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:56,663
<b>WwW.ZooCine.NeT
Watch Movies and Series!</b>

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,439
He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,759
He was Irish. Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

19
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,599
Do you read the papers?

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,479
Birmingham papers.

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,919
I recommend the DailyMail.

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,999
It will broaden your mind.

23
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,639
Now, if you read the national press,
you would know

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,199
that the king has offered
the rebel Irish a treaty.

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,519
Now, some of the Fenians
want to accept it.

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,439
The IRA do not.

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,199
Now, the IRA have a long
and glorious relationship

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,479
with the garrotte.

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,919
Dear.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,879
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,679
- That will be all.
- Right, sir.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,719
Moss, I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,119
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,719
Well, you wouldn't want
to stay in the lodgings

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,239
you had last time then, sir?

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,279
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,079
You should understand, Moss,

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,879
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,439
No, sir?

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,799
I imagine you boys
have quite a laugh at my expense.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,039
A laugh, sir?

42
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,279
You think it's funny
that I developed feelings?

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,199
No idea what you're talking about, sir.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,079
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,519
No "bad memories".

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,479
Right, sir.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,359
He's losing his bloody mind.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,559
Next.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,999
All right, then.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,919
Name?

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,479
The Digbeth Kid.

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,879
The Dig...

53
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,439
What are you? A boxer?

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,279
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.

55
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,599
Spend a lot of time at the pictures?

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,879
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

57
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,199
Yeah?

58
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,639
What are you...

59
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,759
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,879
- Let's have a look then?
- It's made of wood.

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,319
Bang. Bang.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,159
Very nice.

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,839
Where did you get the gun belt?

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,199
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,399
My mum did most of the stitching.

66
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,999
She's not my real mum, but...

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,199
She does what mothers do.

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,199
So she made you a gun belt.

69
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,999
All right then, mother's boy.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,119
There's the door. On you go.
We're looking for...

71
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,999
Have you ever been arrested?

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,479
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,359
- No.
- Good.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,079
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,439
Arthur, we can stand him up.

76
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,919
Do you know what that means?

77
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,519
The new Home Secretary wants something
done about illegal gambling.

78
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,119
Damn right.

79
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,519
About bloody time.

80
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,519
So we help our coppers make their quota
of convictions by having men stood up

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,039
to be arrested.

82
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,719
First offence, you'll get a week inside.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,839
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,959
How does that sound, cowboy?

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,279
Yeah.

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,279
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,359
I can't write.

88
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,759
That's all right, Finn can't read.

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,839
Don't worry.

90
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,639
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,759
If the sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,039
Good man.

93
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,959
I don't know, Tom. Kids these days.

94
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,719
They didn't fight.

95
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,719
So they're different.

96
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,839
They stay kids.

97
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,239
How was it?

98
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,599
I was starving,
so I would have eaten anything.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,079
But really it was super.

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,039
Super.

101
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,879
So, are you a cook?

102
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,959
Not a cook. No.

103
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,799
The man who came to the house,

104
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,759
he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,959
What does he do?

106
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,199
- He works with horses.
- Really?

107
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,439
I love horses.

108
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,199
- I've got a bay mare.
- No!

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,319
I ride it all the time.

110
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,839
Then it's in the blood.

111
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,039
I've got about a million questions.

112
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,719
So do I.

113
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,639
I've had different pictures in my head.

114
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,759
Well, here I am.

115
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,599
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,239
I don't have any choice.

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,799
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,559
We don't choose.

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,479
And that's it.

120
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,719
Yeah, that's right.

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,959
God gave you to me.

122
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,399
People took you away.

123
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,399
And it is all right
that it's me, isn't it?

124
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,599
In a place like this.

125
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,920
I thought it would be worse.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,919
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!

127
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,239
Get out of town, kid,
or I will shoot your fucking head off!

128
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,119
Time's up!

129
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,119
- You're dead, go down.
- John!

130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,399
All right then, Polly.

131
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,479
Who's this?

132
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,679
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.

133
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,479
Polly's son, Michael.

134
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,239
Pleased to meet you.

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,439
John.

136
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,239
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,399
I used to throw you out of the window,
so John could catch you.

138
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,399
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,519
I bet you're glad to be back.

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,439
I don't remember any of it.

141
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,559
All I remember is the day
they took me away.

142
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,319
Well, you're here now, son.

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,239
Welcome to the Shelby family.

144
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,919
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.

145
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,119
Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

146
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,559
Let's leave him be for now?

147
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,559
Come on, boys.

148
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,679
Nice suit.

149
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,439
They seem nice.

150
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,119
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.

151
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,119
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

152
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,119
How are you feeling?

153
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,599
I've just come out of bandages myself.

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,759
Ready for active service.

155
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,399
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

156
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,559
It's all right, Bill.

157
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,056
You don't have to stand in line for us.

158
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,039
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

159
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,119
But you have to pass the medical first.

160
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,119
Sheffield mob showed up
at Wincanton trotting track.

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,919
I took a bullet.

162
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,999
When do the bandages come off?

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,959
When I take 'em off.

164
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,199
One week. Not before.

165
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,039
You'll smell no rot.

166
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,119
There's no gangrene.

167
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,239
It's been a long time. Billy?

168
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,079
What did you do with your medals?

169
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,799
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

170
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,239
It was never a hardship having you
Black Country boys on our left flank.

171
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,559
And you Brummies did all right
on our right.

172
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,119
Damn right.

173
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,519
I want you to be the head
of a brigade, Bill.

174
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,599
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,519
You'll have 100 men under your command.

176
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,879
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,119
maybe your cousins and brothers will let
our boats pass through the Black Country

178
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,039
without being held up and robbed.

179
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,559
I don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,399
Go home, Bill.

181
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,599
Round up any good men you can trust
and put the word out.

182
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,799
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

183
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,159
That'll be the bloody day.

184
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,559
Well, this is the bloody day.

185
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,599
London, man. There for the taking.

186
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,639
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.

187
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,279
Polly said you had one in the pub.

188
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,079
All right, be quick. I have business.

189
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,479
Sir.

190
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,919
Polly said you own this place.

191
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,199
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

192
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,519
You call her Polly or Mum?

193
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,759
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.

194
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,639
Who are you calling?

195
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,999
My mother. I mean...

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,999
I know what you mean.

197
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,559
And what are you going to tell her?

198
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,399
I'm going to tell her where I am.

199
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,239
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

200
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,239
Polly said I could stay for a few days.

201
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,279
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,559
What age are you Michael?

203
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,719
Seventeen.

204
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,079
Seventeen. Which means
it's not up to you, right?

205
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,759
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

206
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,839
You smoke?

207
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,079
No.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,199
Drink?

209
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,839
You're going to call your mother,

210
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,479
going to tell her you're getting
the next train home.

211
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,719
And when you get there,

212
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,679
you're going to write a letter to Polly
saying when you're 18,

213
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,239
you'll come back here
and sort things out.

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,039
I just told you.

215
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,319
I make up my own mind.

216
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,119
Do you know what we do, Michael?

217
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,039
We, Shelbys.

218
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,039
Yes. I think I know what you do.

219
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
Yeah.

220
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,479
You've got smart eyes.

221
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,079
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

222
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,479
It's not all right.

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,279
People get hurt.

224
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,759
Now, call your mother
and I will drive you to the station.

225
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,959
No.

226
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,759
In my village,

227
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,959
there's this little wishing well.

228
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,879
It's made of white bricks, right
in the middle of the village green.

229
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,079
Everybody says how pretty it is.

230
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,479
But I swear to God,

231
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,959
if I spend another day in that village,

232
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,999
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,199
Probably blow my hands off with it,
but it'd be worth it.

234
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,479
Just to see
all those pretty white bricks

235
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,279
spread over the pretty village green.

236
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,519
Yep. You're Polly's son, all right.

237
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,079
All right boys, let's go to work.

238
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,919
Let's be having it!

239
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,119
Don't wait!

240
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
Keep it moving.

241
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,359
Move!

242
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,679
Next lad!

243
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,799
Name?

244
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,999
Abbey Heath.

245
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,239
Abbey Heath. Profession?

246
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,439
Baker.

247
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,919
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

248
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,999
Next lad!

249
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,439
Name?

250
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,999
Buddy Halls.

251
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,679
Buddy Halls. Right. Profession?

252
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,039
Baker.

253
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,679
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

254
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,599
Next lad!

255
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,119
- Name?
- Billy Kitchen.

256
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,679
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

257
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,239
Head baker.

258
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,599
Fill it out.

259
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,479
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.

260
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,359
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

261
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,359
Never give power to the big man.

262
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,039
Next lad!

263
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,359
Name?

264
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,719
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

265
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,519
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

266
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,839
If anyone asks, that's what you do.

267
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,519
You're bakers.

268
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,959
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side,

269
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,959
but north or south,
you show them that piece of paper.

270
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,439
Tell them you've come down from
north to find work, to break strikes.

271
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,759
Tell them you're fascists,
if you have to.

272
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,919
We're finding lodgings for you, but
for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.

273
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,919
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

274
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,719
Any questions?

275
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,439
Yes?

276
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,639
I haven't even seen any bread.

277
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,599
He'll wake up.

278
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,719
Granted, he won't have any teeth left,
but he will be a wiser man for it.

279
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,879
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,359
Right!

281
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,679
There are fucking rules here.

282
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,559
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

283
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,879
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?

284
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,559
Rule number one.

285
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,679
The distinction between bread and rum,
yeah, is not discussed.

286
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,279
Rule number two.

287
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,759
Anything, right,
that your superior officer

288
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,919
says to you or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

289
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,479
Not discussed!

290
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,159
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

291
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,239
For the rest of your fucking
miserable measly lives, yeah?

292
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,319
Because I, like you,

293
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,039
am also a complete fucking sodomite.

294
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,919
Jewish women.

295
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,959
You do not go anywhere near them

296
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,679
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

297
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,239
I think that's fair.

298
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,959
All right, that's it, yeah.

299
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,959
Forgive me, I interrupted you.

300
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,519
Pick him up.

301
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,719
Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.

302
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,839
Don't fucking wait!

303
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,679
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!

304
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,919
You're a fucking disgrace!

305
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,439
Go!

306
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,159
You've got a key?

307
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,999
I kept a spare.

308
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,199
Give it to me.

309
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,559
Could do with some paint?

310
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,879
Yeah, when I decide.

311
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,919
What is it that you want, Tommy?

312
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,199
Just came by to say hello.

313
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,719
Tommy Shelby never goes
anywhere for no reason.

314
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,559
Fine.

315
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,959
I've got 800 pounds left
in the Shelby property fund,

316
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,959
and I need someone down here
to look for suitable properties.

317
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,319
To rent?

318
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,799
Yes.

319
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,319
To poor people.

320
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,839
Ten to a room.

321
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,959
No repairs, no water.

322
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,999
And if they complain, you just send
Arthur and the boys round.

323
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,999
You know, I give advice
down at the library.

324
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,519
Families thrown on the street.

325
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,759
It's men like you we're fighting.

326
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,759
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.

327
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,879
Tommy.

328
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,519
There are always men outside
watching the house.

329
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,159
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

330
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,439
But they're there to keep you safe.

331
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,679
No there are others.
They look like coppers.

332
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,479
Well, they're on your side as well.

333
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,079
I don't have a fucking side.

334
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,319
Ada, yes, you do.

335
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,519
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

336
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,359
I couldn't sleep.

337
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,199
Cheerio then.

338
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,079
That was great. Well done.

339
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,879
Out we get then.

340
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,279
This house is mine.

341
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,159
I've taken on a maid.

342
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,239
She's made up the big room for you.

343
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,479
Come on, let's have a look.

344
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,439
I thought we could spend the week here.

345
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,959
You know, get to know each other again.

346
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,639
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

347
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,959
I like ham, yes.

348
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,919
- I've got a maid...
- Yes, you said.

349
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,279
She's upstairs.

350
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,439
She can give us some tea.

351
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,519
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

352
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,239
Yes, madam?

353
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,639
I think we'd like some tea.

354
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,399
You get used to it.

355
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,439
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

356
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,559
I'm not a cleaner.

357
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,159
But I have come to clean away some dirt.

358
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,319
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

359
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,559
You killed my son!

360
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,359
You Peaky bastard!

361
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,359
You beat him

362
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,279
and beat him and beat him.

363
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,759
Your son was a boxer.

364
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,439
No!

365
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,399
He was a boy

366
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,919
who got into a ring with an animal.

367
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,479
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

368
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,479
I've come to stop you

369
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,399
because the coppers
and nobody else will.

370
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,839
If you're going to use it,

371
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,199
point that thing at my head.

372
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,479
That's where the trouble is.

373
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,239
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

374
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,159
I've seen 'em.

375
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,719
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

376
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,759
Hold that gun up and do it!

377
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,719
Fucking do it!

378
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,719
Do it!

379
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,359
I'm going to finish my drink.

380
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,599
You can finish it with me, if you like.

381
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,199
Now, look. Look at me.

382
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,519
We've got a fund.

383
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,999
For you. You'll get paid weekly.

384
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,839
I know it won't bring back your son.

385
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,079
I know that.

386
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,679
You have other sons.

387
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,599
You do.

388
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,559
And we'll find them work.

389
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,159
And you won't have to work.

390
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,759
You'll be...

391
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,119
Somebody has got
to stop you people.

392
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,919
Who broke the fucking mirror?

393
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,639
Seven years' bad luck, that is.

394
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,319
There'll be another
four boatloads tomorrow.

395
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,679
What's up, Charlie? Business is good.

396
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,639
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

397
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,719
Cigarettes and booze is all right,
but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.

398
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,679
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

399
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,799
Some of it is legally purchased.

400
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,719
One day, all of it will be.

401
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,479
It's like having a fucking job.

402
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,239
Hey! Easy with them fan belts.

403
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,279
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

404
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,119
Done.

405
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,519
You don't even fight me any more.

406
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,839
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

407
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,959
They just fucking wave
at you from the bank.

408
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,399
Well, just wave back?

409
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,999
And all these fucking cars.

410
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,719
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

411
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,919
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

412
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,439
Major Campbell.

413
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,199
Beg pardon?

414
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,559
It doesn't matter.

415
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,959
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

416
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,079
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

417
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,959
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

418
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,439
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

419
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,079
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

420
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,679
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

421
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,879
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

422
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,799
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

423
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,119
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

424
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,279
There is a chophouse two streets away.

425
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,079
But I myself serve sandwiches.

426
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,439
Egg and cress, or ham.

427
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,079
Or anything that pleases you.

428
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,239
No. No. No.

429
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,759
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.

430
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,199
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

431
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,759
I decided to bring it forward.

432
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,919
You just wanted to show me that
you know where I live, isn't that it?

433
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,359
Am I supposed to be impressed?

434
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,719
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.

435
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,079
Yes, he was.

436
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,599
All my demands have been met.

437
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,399
Did he tell you?

438
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,039
Yes.

439
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,679
Yes. We had a meeting
and your letter was read aloud.

440
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,839
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

441
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,959
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.

442
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,679
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.

443
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,799
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

444
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,319
We will discuss our business on Sunday,

445
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,279
on the agreed day, at the allotted time,

446
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,679
and at the place that has
already been determined.

447
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

448
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,279
There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

449
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,799
I just didn't want you
to be made a fool of, is all.

450
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,119
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

451
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,919
how shall I put this?

452
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,839
Well, your landlady used to run the most
famous whorehouse in Stechford.

453
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,719
She's only semi-retired.

454
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,839
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny?

455
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,919
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

456
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,319
See you Sunday!

457
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,839
- Name?
- Digbeth Kid.

458
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,119
Your real name.

459
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,799
Harold Hancox.

460
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,319
Profession?

461
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,519
Illegal bookmaker.

462
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,239
You don't admit that.

463
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,719
You say something like,
"Umbrella mender".

464
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,039
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

465
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,959
Umbrella mender.

466
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,079
You were found
in possession of betting slips,

467
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,839
race cards and ticker tape.

468
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,279
Any explanation?

469
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,319
No.

470
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,239
"No."

471
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,879
"I have no explanation"

472
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,879
"for my possession
of those items, officer."

473
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,879
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

474
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,439
Come on, son.

475
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,799
Bloody hellfire.

476
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,919
You've killed him?

477
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,359
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

478
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,639
He's got an army round him.

479
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,719
But when the time is right...

480
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,919
The time is right. It's right now.

481
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,879
When he's away from
his familiar territory, I will take him.

482
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,799
- So what do you want?
- We heard from a guard

483
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,919
at Winson Green prison that one of
their bookies has just been put inside.

484
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,119
Kid called Harold Hancox.

485
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,959
We could make a point.

486
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,199
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

487
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,079
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

488
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,799
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

489
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,839
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

490
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,359
Ragman.

491
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,279
- Where's my dry cleaning?
- It's been collected.

492
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,279
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

493
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,439
- What? You don't know?
- I can find out.

494
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,159
No need. I know already.

495
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,999
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

496
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,959
And the second favourites
are being done.

497
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,479
He's bewitching them.

498
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,599
Bewitching?

499
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,319
Gypsy stuff. Herbs, potions.

500
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,319
And he's tipping off our big punters,
so they know who's going to win.

501
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,079
Regular customers
betraying us for profit.

502
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,159
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,

503
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,679
comes before race, creed, family.

504
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,119
Results look normal to me.

505
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,959
You see shit!

506
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,079
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

507
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,439
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

508
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,119
- I gave you a job already.
- And the job will be done.

509
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,639
- But meantime...
- Meantime, fuck!

510
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,159
Meantime, what do you want us
to do about the kid

511
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,679
in the cage in Birmingham?

512
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,119
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

513
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,799
Is there somebody listening?

514
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,679
All right, I'll say it.

515
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,759
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

516
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,959
Good, and then you deal
with Tommy fucking Shelby.

517
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,959
You wanted to see me?

518
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,799
Aye.

519
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,479
Take off your clothes.

520
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,399
I know what you are.

521
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,079
So, take off your clothes.

522
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,999
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

523
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,959
Indeed not.

524
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,079
So it's true. Stop.

525
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,439
I only wanted proof. Not satisfaction.

526
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,239
Or indeed infection.

527
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,279
Are you in on the joke?

528
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,479
What joke?

529
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,199
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

530
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,359
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

531
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,359
And then my wrath will
come down on all of youse.

532
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,679
But now,

533
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,599
tell your friends in the police station

534
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,999
that I know.

535
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,239
And when my judgement comes,

536
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,839
I'll be the one that's laughing.

537
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,599
Get out.

538
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,399
On the right. On the right.

539
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,199
We haven't got all night. Come on!

540
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,639
Let's be having you, Watkins,
in there on the right.

541
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,959
On the right! Come on, boys!

542
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,159
Harold Hancox?

543
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,599
Tell everybody,

544
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,879
this is what happens to Blinders
who come into the Green from now on.

545
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,439
Orders of Sabini.

546
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,239
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder. I've been stood up.

547
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,519
I'm not real! I'm not real!

548
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,079
I'm not real!

549
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,039
This had better be good
to interrupt my holiday.

550
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,279
Where's the boy?

551
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,359
In the back room.

552
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,880
I only brought him because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

553
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,279
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
- Shut up, John.

554
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,079
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

555
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,199
Tommy, get on with it.

556
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,679
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

557
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,199
This morning, I had a telegram
saying it was Sabini who ordered it.

558
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,239
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

559
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,159
If our men think we can't
look after them in prison,

560
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,319
they'll not work for us.

561
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,079
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.

562
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,479
Scudboat, you and one of the boys

563
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,079
break a couple of windows,
get yourselves arrested.

564
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,039
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

565
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,039
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

566
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,280
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

567
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,399
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.

568
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,079
I'm still on a donkey.

569
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,159
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.

570
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,839
And before you all laugh,

571
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,799
a boy is dead.

572
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,119
He was just a kid.

573
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,599
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.

574
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,999
Agreed.

575
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,519
So is that it? Can I go now?

576
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,839
Well, as company treasurer,

577
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,039
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

578
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,319
On what?

579
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,759
On a horse.

580
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,839
A thousand guineas on a horse?

581
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,039
That's right.

582
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,479
When was this decided?

583
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,519
You've been busy with Michael.

584
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,119
My God.

585
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,199
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

586
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,559
Polly, there's a thoroughbred,
quarter-Arab filly

587
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,559
up for auction
at the Doncaster Bloodstock.

588
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,639
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

589
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,639
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

590
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,479
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

591
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,519
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

592
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,279
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

593
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,079
We'll be in there with all the toffs.

594
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,399
Coppers won't know where to look.

595
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,159
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

596
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,879
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.

597
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,079
The Derby?

598
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,959
Did he say the Derby?

599
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,839
That's right.

600
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,719
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

601
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,839
If we're going to take him down, might
as well make it there, as a symbol.

602
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,999
Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance?

603
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,159
Pol.

604
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,799
A good racehorse is an investment,
like property.

605
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,479
We need to diversify the portfolio.

606
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,359
So when is this sale?

607
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,559
Tomorrow.

608
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,879
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll
have to go with him for protection.

609
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,719
So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

610
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,519
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

611
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,359
Quarter-Arab is better!

612
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,399
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
- Curly, shut up.

613
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,959
I thought I told you to lock that door.

614
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,279
He did. I used the key on the nail.

615
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,679
Look, I've been listening.

616
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,039
- I want to go with them.
- You see?

617
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,919
I love horses. I could even help.

618
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,039
Over my dead body!

619
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,999
It'll be all right, Mum.

620
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,679
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

621
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,879
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

622
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,079
Yeah, and their posh wives!

623
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,559
And their mistresses.

624
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,639
Let him come, Polly.

625
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,399
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.

626
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,079
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

627
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,119
No.

628
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,879
Fucking no!

629
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,839
All right, that's it. Back to work.

630
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,279
Come on!

631
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,439
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,

632
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,279
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.

633
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,199
If you want to scare
that kid away forever,

634
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,519
carry on how you're going.

635
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,599
If you want him to stay,

636
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,239
let him come.

637
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,679
I can't believe it.

638
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,519
AllJohn's old things fit me.

639
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,239
Christ, you look like your father.

640
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,879
Shrimp, ham.

641
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,919
What was he like? My dad?

642
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,639
How did he die?

643
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,479
Well, I won't lie to you.

644
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,879
He died drunk,
squeezed between a boat and a lock.

645
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,319
A real river gypsy's death.

646
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,679
But he could sing,

647
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,519
play the piano...

648
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,879
His smile would break your heart.

649
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,239
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

650
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,559
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

651
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,359
His trouble was,

652
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,639
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

653
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,879
I have told them not to blow that horn.

654
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,319
This is a respectable
fucking neighbourhood!

655
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,919
- She's heating up, Curly. Take a look.
- Yeah.

656
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,999
Let me out for a piss.

657
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,519
She made loads. Do you want one?

658
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,879
What the bloody hell's that?

659
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,559
Sandwiches. Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

660
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,079
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns 'cause there's only one cup.

661
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,839
What?

662
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,479
Sandwiches?

663
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,319
- Yeah.
- Polly made bloody sandwiches?

664
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,999
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?

665
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,479
All right. We will drink
the tea and we will eat the sandwiches

666
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,559
and then we will drive on. All right?

667
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,319
No crumbs, Charlie.

668
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,079
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.

669
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,279
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!

670
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,039
All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

671
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,519
and we will all behave accordingly.

672
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,959
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

673
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,639
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

674
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,519
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer.

675
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,879
So he knows to expect my bids.

676
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,159
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?

677
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,839
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

678
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,199
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

679
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,159
It's all right, Curly. You're just
in an unfamiliar place, we all are.

680
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,719
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
- It's all right, Curly. It's all right.

681
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,639
- Shut up, Curly.
- Do I hear 1,450?

682
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,639
Do I hear 500, 500,

683
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,079
1,600, 1,700? Thank you.

684
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,399
1,900, 2,000,

685
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,199
2,100, 2,200...

686
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,439
Why do people come late to these things?

687
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,359
People come late
'cause they know what they want.

688
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,599
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

689
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,319
Am I bid?

690
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,519
2,600. I am bid!

691
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,519
Sold!

692
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,679
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrarch out of LadyJosephine.

693
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,159
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.

694
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,919
All right, Tommy, this is her.

695
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,039
Do I hear 800 guineas?

696
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,839
850?

697
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,479
850. Do I hear nine?

698
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,239
Do I hear nine? Nine, am I bid?

699
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,919
Bid for this one.

700
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,599
The grey? Why?

701
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,199
- He's beautiful.
- It's a filly.

702
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,519
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.

703
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,519
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

704
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,479
1,100?

705
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,879
1,200?

706
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,439
Do I hear 250?

707
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,959
250.

708
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,359
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

709
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,599
1,300?

710
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,879
1,400?

711
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,999
Do I hear five?

712
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,079
1,500.

713
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,719
1,600.

714
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,519
Do I hear seven?

715
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,799
1,700. Thank you.

716
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,239
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.

717
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,439
You don't have it in your belt.

718
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,839
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

719
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,159
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.

720
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,199
- I feel something bad!
- Shut up, Curly!

721
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,759
2,000. Do I hear 2,050?

722
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,199
2,050. Am I bid?

723
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,759
- 2,050...
- Enough!

724
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,639
Billy could use one of my geldings.

725
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,759
2,000, I am bid. Do I hear 2,050?

726
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,199
Last time.

727
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,639
2,050?

728
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,439
Sold! To Mr...

729
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,519
Thomas Shelby.

730
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,439
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,

731
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,519
Small Heath.

732
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,199
- What kind of premises?
- Boat yard.

733
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,599
Yachts?

734
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,519
Canals.

735
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,159
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

736
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,879
Import, export.

737
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,439
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.

738
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,439
You beat us to it.

739
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,159
Did I?

740
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,159
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.

741
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,199
- Sorry.
- Thomas Shelby from where?

742
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,639
From Birmingham.

743
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,719
Goodness!

744
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,359
No, not much.

745
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,999
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

746
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,599
What is it you do?

747
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,479
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.

748
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,839
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!

749
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,559
Well, before you go, if you ever
decide to put that filly out,

750
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,399
- I'd be interested in having her.
- I plan to race her.

751
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,479
- Do you have a trainer?
- I know people.

752
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,639
- I know people, too.
- Tommy!

753
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,679
We've got to get
this kid back before dark

754
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,599
or Polly will have your balls!

755
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,159
She will have 'em!

756
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,119
We know different people, I would guess.

757
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,999
My father knows Mick Hancock.

758
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,439
- Trained three Ascot winners.
- So that was your father?

759
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,759
Yes.

760
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,159
We're joint-owners of the stud.

761
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,199
He took the majority share
when my husband was killed.

762
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,399
Ypres.

763
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,279
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!

764
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,159
The chickens are hungry!

765
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,239
So will you consider me?

766
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,639
I will consider you.

767
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,199
You still didn't tell me what you do.

768
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,399
I do bad things.

769
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,639
But you already know that.

770
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,999
Right, about bloody time!

771
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,759
It's the fucking truth, John boy.

772
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,679
Rich women these days,
all they want is working-class cock.

773
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,639
Tommy, maybe she was the
something bad I had the feeling about!

774
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,359
She looks all right to me, Curly!

775
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,679
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.

776
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,759
Yeah, by us.

777
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,199
All I'll say is she has good contacts
in the racing world.

778
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,359
Here, Michael, you drive.

779
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,719
Thomas Shelby?

780
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,559
Tommy!

781
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,479
Tommy! Down!

782
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,999
Tommy Shelby?

783
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,639
How about fucking Arthur?

784
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,519
Fucking good to meet you.

785
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,119
Get him off him!

786
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,519
Arthur! Arthur!

787
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,359
Get him off him!

788
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,279
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

789
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,359
Get him off.

790
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,279
Arthur, that's enough.

791
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,599
Arthur, come on!

792
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,359
Come on, Arthur, come on.

793
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,199
That's it. It's over.

794
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,079
Arthur!

795
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,799
Come on, shut up.

796
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,919
Come on, come on.

797
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,999
He's still breathing.

798
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,119
Don't get blood on the kid!

799
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,439
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?

800
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,439
Give me the keys.

801
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,079
Michael, give me the keys.

802
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,199
I'm all right to drive.

803
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,839
All right. Go on. Go on, go on!

804
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,879
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!

805
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,039
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
- Come on!

806
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,879
So?

807
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,279
How'd it go?

808
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,519
Well, it was cold in the van,

809
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,719
but it was super. Really.

810
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,999
Let me smell your breath.

811
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,079
Did they behave themselves?

812
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,239
They were amazing, Mum.

813
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,039
They were really amazing.
