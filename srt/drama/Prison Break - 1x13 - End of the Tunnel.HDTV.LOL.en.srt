1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:03,130
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,232 --> 00:00:06,807
There's a whole lot of real estate in
between here and the outside walls.

3
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:10,311
The infirmary's the weakest
link in the security chain.

4
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,157
These were seriously
hard to get.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,341
- What you need them for anyway?
- None of your business.

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,921
If I'd have known that this is how this
whole thing was going to turn out,

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,674
I'd have gotten some
crap job with the Feds.

8
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,571
Keep talking like that, I'm going to be
forced to put a bullet in your head.

9
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:23,927
We gotta go.

10
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:25,501
You're in trouble, aren't you?

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,531
- Veronica Donovan?
- Who... who is this?

12
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:31,338
I have information that will lead to
the exoneration of William Burrows.

13
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:33,515
I have to check the
status in there.

14
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:36,675
It's all good.
Then you won't mind me checking it out.

15
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,099
Get up off him!

16
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,374
Get off him!

17
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,173
Get off...

18
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:43,823
We leave tonight.

19
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,387
Michael, we got a big problem.

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,044
No! No!

21
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:54,273
Back out.

22
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:57,357
- Of the escape?
- Or die.

23
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:07,458
Stay with me, John!
I want you to stay with me!

24
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,276
We're almost...
Keep breathing...

25
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:12,381
Everything's going to be okay,
as long as you keep breathing.

26
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:17,177
You stay with me, John.
Come on, John. You stay with me.

27
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,401
Stay with me.
Keep breathing for me, all right?

28
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,521
Keep breathing for me, all right?
You stay with me.

29
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:25,980
Almost there; almost...

30
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,453
He's lost a lot of blood.
He's hypovolemic!

31
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:50,721
- What's his blood type?
- A Neg.

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,856
His blood pressure's too low!
He's desperately hypovolemic!

33
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:57,560
- We got to get him to Chicago!
- Cook is a 20-minute flight!

34
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:02,723
We've gotta go, Doc!

35
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:25,395
And then there were six.

36
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:30,363
Far as I know... there's five.

37
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,993
Don't you ever step up
to me like that again!

38
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:40,348
Who's the tough guy now, huh?

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,904
Warden?

40
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:55,844
Where's my brother?

41
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,826
He's in a lot of trouble, son.

42
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,909
You have to let me see him.

43
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,567
That's not a request I
can grant at the moment.

44
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:03,557
Please...

45
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,787
We're 36 hours away
from his execution.

46
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,295
He panicked. He got violent.

47
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,919
For that reason,
for the rest of his time at Fox River,

48
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,851
we're going to keep him in AdSec--
for his safety and everybody else's.

49
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:20,940
But I'm his brother.
I deserve to see him, that's my right.

50
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:23,887
It's not your right to
see him until tomorrow.

51
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,377
At his execution.

52
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:32,161
I'm sorry, son.

53
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:15,039
The name is John
Abruzzi. A-B-R-U-Z-Z...

54
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:20,623
I don't care what protocol is.
I just want to know if he's okay.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,424
Hello? Hello?

56
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:34,163
The hospital won't give
out any information.

57
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,325
Wonder what happened
to that boy.

58
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:40,724
Maybe them Mafia chickens
came home to roost after all.

59
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,539
We got to put this
whole thing on hold.

60
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,719
Oh, easy, Fish,
we're not putting nothing on hold.

61
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:46,099
I don't think you heard me.

62
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:48,986
Until I get my brother out of that hole,
no one's doing a damn thing.

63
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,247
Look, God bless Sink,
but the man is gone.

64
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:53,714
You go to the tombs,
you don't get out.

65
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,255
Not until they strap you up.

66
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:58,224
If you think I'm going to
leave my brother behind,

67
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,456
you have massively
underestimated me.

68
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,564
- Really?
- Really.

69
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:03,870
Yeah, but that ain't my fight.

70
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm through that hole,
Pretty, with or without you.

71
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,520
Next time I'm on P.I.

72
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,330
- We're not having this debate.
- We're not?

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,116
We're not having this debate.

74
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:14,598
Why don't we just all have the
floor open to everybody else, huh?

75
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:17,575
- Just see what they all say.
- You got a clear shot, baby.

76
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:21,154
Every day we don't use that hole is
another day the screws can find it.

77
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:22,702
The way is not finished.

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,648
We are clear to the infirmary,
that's all we need.

79
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,627
Through that window.

80
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:33,187
Over that wire, over that wall.

81
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:36,235
The two of you will
never make it.

82
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,504
Oh, Fish, it's not just two.

83
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:45,297
If it's now or never,
we got to go.

84
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:48,193
Go with us, Michael.
You've done everything you could.

85
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:51,854
They're grown men, Michael,
they can all decide for themselves.

86
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,508
You son of a...

87
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:55,359
Whoa, wait a minute, back off!

88
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,836
The two of you separate now!

89
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,159
Hey, it's good, boss.
It's good.

90
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:00,997
Just playing around.
It's all good.

91
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:08,600
Now, you know what? There are two things
that everybody needs to get with here.

92
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,581
First, hillbilly,
you have got to learn some respect.

93
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,816
The man here made
everything possible.

94
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,531
And you, Fish?

95
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,969
Now, you're going to have to get with
that we are doing this thing
this afternoon,

96
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,425
as soon as we get on P.I.

97
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,885
So you're just going
to make a run for it.

98
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:30,590
In the middle of the day.

99
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,584
Man, you got to do what you got to do,
huh, baby?

100
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,620
You are going to screw
this whole thing up.

101
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,541
That's  not for you
to decide anymore.

102
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,584
Now this train is leaving the station,
and I suggest you get on it.

103
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:49,494
Get on the train,
Fish, get on the train.

104
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:53,437
Well, you know what,
you sons of bitches?

105
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:54,941
I won't let you do it.

106
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,982
What you going to do?
Blow the whistle on your own escape?

107
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,162
He'll be back.

108
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:35,998
Those guys.

109
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:41,081
They  go before us tonight,
they use that hole, it's over.

110
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:44,691
CO's will turn this whole place
upside down till they find it.

111
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:46,290
Well...

112
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,090
sounds like you're
thinking about it.

113
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,617
I'd be lying if
I said I wasn't.

114
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,734
I want to be out
of here yesterday.

115
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,528
I got a kid coming, man.

116
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:04,832
Michael, you can't
get him out of there.

117
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,154
Can I say something?

118
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:16,998
I know you're not going to
want to hear it, but, uh...

119
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:20,034
they're strapping him
up either way now.

120
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:23,835
Once he's gone, you'll be stuck
here for another five years.

121
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,351
And if they trace the hole back to you,
they'll toss another dime.

122
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,295
That's 15 years, papi.

123
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,355
Course, if I were you I wouldn't
leave my brother behind either.

124
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:42,524
Not to die like that,
no. Uh-uh.

125
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:48,092
Worse thing in the world they can do to
a man is strap him to a chair like that.

126
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,658
- We're in business.
- What do you mean?

127
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,664
I just spoke to a friend of mine
who's a clerk at Superior Court.

128
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,123
I told him about the informant,
that you'd be seeing him at 8:00.

129
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,353
He gives us any evidence
that would warrant a stay,

130
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:15,041
my friend said
he'll hear us out.

131
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,714
We still might be able
to stop this thing.

132
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:18,165
I got to tell Lincoln.

133
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,744
You go to that prison, they're going
to be all over you, you know that.

134
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:22,735
They've wanted to keep us on
the run this entire time,

135
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,885
because if anybody hears from us,
we can do them damage.

136
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:29,546
Maybe it's time we do the
exact opposite: go big.

137
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:30,922
What do you mean, big?

138
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,237
You mean media big?

139
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,086
We got all the ammo we need.

140
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,476
There's a string of murders a mile long
connected to this thing; we
expose that...

141
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:41,502
Are you ready to show
your face again? Huh?

142
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:43,441
Are you ready for that?

143
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,918
It's the bottom of the ninth,
what else are we going to do?

144
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,861
Hello?

145
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,808
Hey, this is Daddy, baby girl.

146
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:15,315
Daddy!

147
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,097
Daddy's on the phone.

148
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,515
How are the camels?

149
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,450
Oh, well, the camels, uh...
the camels are fine.

150
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,910
When do I get to see you?

151
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,942
Earlier than I thought.

152
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,360
Daddy said he's
coming home soon.

153
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,148
Hey, hey,
put Mommy on the phone.

154
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:37,994
Thank you, sweetie.

155
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,724
First Sergeant Benjamin Miles Franklin,
how are you?

156
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,147
Aw, baby...

157
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,071
just driving trucks,

158
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,921
eating dates,
trying to keep the sand out of my eyes.

159
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,722
I saw the news the other day.
It was 110 in Kuwait.

160
00:10:51,862 --> 00:10:53,904
You must be melting over there.

161
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:55,433
You have no idea.

162
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:58,072
What's  this I hear about
you coming home soon?

163
00:10:58,397 --> 00:11:00,597
You're not getting your
daughter's hopes up, are you?

164
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,197
- Sitting down?
- Sure.

165
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,363
Your man is coming
home this week.

166
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,225
This week?
What are you talking about?

167
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,263
They said you were going to
be there for another year.

168
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,532
Hey, the orders just
came down the pipe.

169
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:15,298
Now, hell if I care where
they came down from.

170
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:18,001
The only thing that matters is that
we're going to get to see each other.

171
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,264
When? When is this happening?

172
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:23,592
Thursday, Friday, uh...
I'm not sure yet.

173
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,798
Oh, my God. Do you need me to
pick you up from the airport?

174
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:30,341
Oh, no, no, no, uh...
the Army's got that all arranged.

175
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:32,930
You know,
you just be waiting for me.

176
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:35,366
Well, you know I got that down.

177
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:38,507
Today, C-Note.

178
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,940
Why don't you back off?

179
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,650
Hey, uh, you know,

180
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,507
Comm is only letting me use this link-up
for a few more minutes, so, uh...

181
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,840
uh, is Darius there?
I need to speak to him.

182
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,341
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'll go get him.

183
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:58,988
- I love you.
- I love you more.

184
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,880
Yo.

185
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,517
Yo, what's up, money?

186
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,467
Is sister out of the room?

187
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
She is now.

188
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:17,886
So, how is it out there, man?
Fox real about how they say it is?

189
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,263
It ain't all that.
Not for long, anyway.

190
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:22,777
What you mean by that?

191
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,570
I need you to do
something for me.

192
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,278
Yeah, yeah, all right.

193
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,278
Still driving that Escalade?

194
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,172
Is Michael Jackson still white?

195
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,342
You got jokes, son.

196
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:35,085
How many does it hold?

197
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,621
Okay.

198
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,616
Okay, what?

199
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:47,087
Let's do it.

200
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,896
What, you mean tonight?

201
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,116
What about Lincoln?

202
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,497
I need a razor blade.

203
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,975
Michael, a razor blade
ain't gonna get him out.

204
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:02,099
Do you have one or not?

205
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,075
Careful, bro.

206
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,879
Leadeth me beside
the still waters.

207
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:19,044
Restoreth my soul.

208
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:22,027
Leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for Your sake.

209
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:24,747
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

210
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,532
I will fear no evil.

211
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:28,761
For Thou art with me.

212
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,753
Thou preparest a
table before me

213
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,070
in the presence
of mine enemies.

214
00:14:34,396 --> 00:14:37,107
Surely the goodness
and mercy...

215
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,579
shall follow me all
the days of my life,

216
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:45,143
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

217
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:46,847
Amen.

218
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,949
Amen.

219
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,818
He does hear our prayers, you know--
the Lord.

220
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,492
Yes.

221
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:56,484
On behalf of Lincoln.

222
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:02,506
All who seek forgiveness
will be delivered.

223
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,162
Yes.

224
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:07,265
If your brother accepts the Lord,
he'll be free of this cage forever.

225
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,490
- It can't bind him.
- Yes.

226
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,841
I'll be available through this
whole thing, if you need me.

227
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:18,190
Reverend...

228
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:24,464
Reverend, would you give
this to my brother?

229
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:30,517
It'd mean a lot to him,
knowing it came from me.

230
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,977
I will.

231
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,237
That was my mother's.

232
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,679
Tell her it's going to save
someone a lot of pain.

233
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,592
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

234
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,158
It's in God's hands now.

235
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,972
Feels like you've been the cleanup crew
for me the whole time I've been in here.

236
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,949
Toes, contusions...

237
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:13,803
insulin shots.

238
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,074
Well,  somebody's got to do it.

239
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,204
I'm grateful.

240
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:22,093
You ever think...
in another life...

241
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,117
I won't be that woman, Michael.

242
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:26,346
I wasn't asking you to be.

243
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:30,519
But it is something
I wonder about.

244
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,494
What if...

245
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:38,913
Anyway, just wanted to
make sure it was said.

246
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,208
Why do I feel like you're
saying good-bye to me?

247
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:45,612
I don't know.

248
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:50,393
I guess in a place like this, you never
know which day is going to be your last.

249
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,436
Sarah, we've got
a backup out here.

250
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:56,245
Okay.

251
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,352
You're set.

252
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:02,204
I, um...

253
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:06,024
I'm sorry about your brother.

254
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:11,413
Doctor...

255
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:21,800
Thank you.

256
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,979
This is it, bro.

257
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,186
Hey.

258
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,531
Good luck to both of us.

259
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:28,723
P.I., let's do it!

260
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,395
Came to your senses, did you?

261
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:53,627
What, you figure some magic way to
get your brother out of that hole

262
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:55,222
and into the guard's room?

263
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:57,306
He's not going to be there.

264
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,460
Could you put the light on?

265
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:10,636
You okay?

266
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,600
What do you think, Rev?

267
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:20,639
I spoke with your brother today.
He's been praying for you.

268
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,404
He must be desperate.

269
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:26,538
What about you?
Are you feeling desperate?

270
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:30,659
No. Just for everyone else.

271
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:33,518
The ones you leave behind.

272
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,311
The ones I never got
to say good-bye to.

273
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:40,648
I can be with you all day tomorrow,
you know...

274
00:19:40,863 --> 00:19:42,601
right up to the time.

275
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,230
Thank  you.

276
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:49,783
Um, he wanted me to
give this to you.

277
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,378
Michael.

278
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:25,301
He's back in play.

279
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,400
Good. Who's there with you?

280
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:28,761
Tangren.

281
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:32,690
- What about Hale?
- Nope, MIA.

282
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:35,292
He's supposed to be there.
What do you mean, MIA?

283
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,121
I think it's a
fairly concise term.

284
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:47,316
Don't get it.

285
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:53,596
What time's the flight?

286
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,794
11:00. Speaking of which,
I've got to head up to Wrigleyville.

287
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,719
I'll be back in a couple
of hours to collect you.

288
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:00,449
Now make sure you
pack everything.

289
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:03,428
Once we're out that door,
we're not coming back.

290
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,874
What are you going to do?

291
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:07,407
There's a letter
I've got to deliver.

292
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,707
Lady, you're going to
have to step away.

293
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,675
Listen to me. My name's Veronica
Donovan. I represent Lincoln Burrow.

294
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:17,352
Great, but this isn't
the time for it.

295
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:18,893
You're gonna have
to step aside.

296
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:22,192
I'm sorry, Ms. Donovan? Did you say
that you represent Lincoln Burrows?

297
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:23,114
That's right.

298
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,619
Angela West.
I'm a producer with News Six.

299
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:08,193
So, Mr.
Pied Piper, what's the play?

300
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,322
We do what we always do:

301
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,843
pretend to be working,
being model citizens...

302
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:16,409
until the time comes.

303
00:22:16,538 --> 00:22:19,281
- And that'd be...?
- Nine o'clock.

304
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,196
Seem to be forgetting the fact that P.I.
shuts down at 5:00, pretty.

305
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:26,011
Then we have to make sure it doesn't,
don't we?

306
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,895
Hammer.

307
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,558
Whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing, man?

308
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:07,109
What the hell happened here?!

309
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:08,913
Messed up, hit a pipe.

310
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:11,962
Should have killed the
water before we started.

311
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:13,154
Should have, huh?

312
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,123
It's not that big a deal.
We can fix it in the morning.

313
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,676
I don't think mold should
be a problem before then.

314
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,908
- Mold?
- Scofield, shut up.

315
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,199
No, you shut up.
What are you talking about?

316
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,887
You get drywall and
insulation soaked like this,

317
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:30,514
you run the risk of
stachybotrys mold.

318
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:35,361
Boss... that's just like one
time in a thousand, for real.

319
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,286
Tell you what.

320
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:40,272
You and all your
companeros here

321
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:41,992
aren't stepping
outside this door

322
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:45,477
until every damn molecule
of water is out of here.

323
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,013
That's gonna take all night.

324
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,414
Well, then it's going
to take all night.

325
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,786
Don't  catch a sniffle.

326
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:05,086
Man.

327
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,314
Good, thanks.

328
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:14,770
A lot of it checks out.

329
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,062
Her?

330
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:19,072
Ms. Donovan, if you don't mind,
we'd like to put you on.

331
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:20,844
- That's why I'm here.
- All right, great.

332
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:22,359
Holly here will be
asking the questions.

333
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:24,579
Just watch his hand, okay?

334
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,405
Evening, Peter.

335
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:33,392
I'm with Veronica Donovan,
the lawyer for Lincoln Burrows.

336
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:35,642
You're petitioning for a stay,
is that right?

337
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:36,475
That's right.

338
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:37,936
On what grounds?

339
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:40,566
On the grounds that my
client's been framed.

340
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:42,110
Get specifics out of her.

341
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:44,449
Ms. Donovan,
do you have any proof to that effect?

342
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:46,816
There's a whole string
of proof: murders...

343
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,330
Leticia Barris,
a potential exculpatory witness;

344
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,634
Lisa Rix,
the mother of Lincoln's child.

345
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:54,900
Bishop McMorrow, the man who could have
petitioned the governor for clemency.

346
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,016
You're saying someone's
killing these people off?

347
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:59,946
I'm saying somebody's trying
to hide what really happened.

348
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,674
What the truth about Terrence
Steadman really was.

349
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,209
Is this all just speculation,

350
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:07,040
or is there hard evidence that
can substantiate your claims?

351
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,475
- I have a source.
- Get a name.

352
00:25:09,537 --> 00:25:11,596
- Could you elaborate on that?
- Not at this time,

353
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:14,461
but somebody on the inside claims
they can exonerate Lincoln.

354
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:17,236
That Steadman wasn't
in the car that night.

355
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:20,126
Someone's been talking.

356
00:25:30,956 --> 00:25:33,520
There a reason you're
on direct current?

357
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:34,364
Sorry?

358
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:39,332
You know, AC/DC.
Alternating current, direct current.

359
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:43,553
DC's kind of yesterday's
news for this sort of thing.

360
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:47,146
You could kill a man with
half the energy, you go AC.

361
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,279
Okay. Let's see what we got.

362
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,179
Ready to run one?

363
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,849
I think you better turn
these lights on, Officer.

364
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:38,607
Can't do it, lady.
Your client's being disciplined.

365
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:41,119
You're violating my client's
Eighth Amendment rights.

366
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,325
Either you turn those lights
on in the next five seconds,

367
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:46,405
or you're going to be the first
defendant named in a lawsuit.

368
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,487
You okay?

369
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:14,161
LJ?

370
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,813
He's good.

371
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,510
He's scared, but he's good.

372
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:24,115
I found someone
who's going to talk.

373
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:25,094
Who?

374
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:26,649
I don't know,
but he knows things.

375
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,398
I'm going to go meet
him in a few hours.

376
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:30,478
A few hours is cutting
it close, sweetie.

377
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,301
We don't have any other choice.

378
00:27:32,462 --> 00:27:34,506
You have to have faith, okay?

379
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:37,379
Nick's already primed the
court to hear our case.

380
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:42,024
Whatever Michael's doing,
he doesn't need to do it now.

381
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,494
We're gonna beat this
thing the right way.

382
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:46,447
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

383
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:47,955
What if you are?

384
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:49,808
You got to trust me, okay?

385
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:05,398
Don't give up on me.

386
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,328
Promise.

387
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:32,806
Didn't mean to scare you.

388
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,264
No, it's all right.
Paul, how are you?

389
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,088
I'm good. I'm good.

390
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,498
You?

391
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:50,755
- Where you going?
- Vacation. Bahamas.

392
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,558
Packing kind of heavily for the Bahamas,
aren't you?

393
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,612
- You know women.
- Yeah.

394
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,601
So, um...

395
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:02,674
...where's Danny?

396
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,550
Uh, running errands I think.

397
00:29:04,658 --> 00:29:06,177
Errands, huh?

398
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:11,250
Where... where might
those errands be?

399
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:31,421
- Louis, you there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, Linc.

400
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:32,588
What time you got?

401
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:37,665
A little after 8:00.

402
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:01,487
It's 8:15.

403
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,708
You okay?

404
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,513
No.

405
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:55,052
Oh, Michael.

406
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,061
9:00, Fish.

407
00:31:30,896 --> 00:31:31,940
Show time.

408
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,238
Let's go, man.

409
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,833
Tancredi leave yet?

410
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:56,257
No, I don't think so.

411
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:58,258
You better call her.

412
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:30,239
See you on the other side.

413
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:50,180
Well, everything tells me
it's food poisoning, which

414
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:53,719
means you should be feeling better
in a couple of hours, but, uh...

415
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:59,104
I wish I could say that this would be
enough to forestall the execution.

416
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:00,399
It's not going to be.

417
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,433
It's all right.

418
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:05,255
I can stay with you,
if you want.

419
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,733
No.

420
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:12,777
It's fine... thank you.

421
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:14,567
Okay.

422
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:47,839
We got a lot to talk about and
not a lot of time to do it.

423
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,931
Your boyfriend...

424
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,487
he can still be saved.

425
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:58,315
Burrows was chosen
a long time ago.

426
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,816
He was hand-picked
to be an assassin.

427
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:04,230
But he never pulled
the trigger.

428
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:05,324
Who did?

429
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,424
Come on.

430
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,749
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

431
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:12,470
Nobody.

432
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:14,332
What?!

433
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,786
Terrence Steadman's
still alive.

434
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:22,253
There's three sheets
of paper inside here.

435
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,783
You'll find all the names
you need are on them.

436
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:27,976
Everyone that started this whole thing,
from top to bottom.

437
00:34:31,576 --> 00:34:34,623
You need to take two
steps that way right now.

438
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,378
- What?
- Get behind the car.

439
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,849
You want to stay alive?
Do as I say. Now.

440
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:03,909
Your boys better be there,
rug head.

441
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:07,197
They'll be there, Cletus.
Don't you worry.

442
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:18,576
This is crazy.

443
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:37,257
So, uh...
what are we doing here, Danny?

444
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,054
Where's the lawyer?

445
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,690
I don't know what
you're talking about.

446
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,789
Allison told me.
I got it out of her.

447
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,259
You didn't touch her.

448
00:35:50,374 --> 00:35:52,424
Why would I do that?
Why would I do that?

449
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:54,954
We're partners, right?
We're on the same side.

450
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:56,604
No.

451
00:35:58,028 --> 00:36:00,884
Allison's fine. She's just...

452
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,781
Well, I guess you're gonna have to
ask yourself who you want to give up--

453
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:09,480
your wife or this lawyer.

454
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,452
Just tell me where she is.

455
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,461
Is she here? Has she been?

456
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:18,150
- What exactly have you...
- Don't do this.

457
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:25,546
- Give me your gun.
- Can't do that.

458
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:27,253
Yes, you can.
I'm your superior.

459
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,780
I give you a command,
you obey it.

460
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:35,154
Give me your gun.

461
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:43,522
Paul, it's nothing. It's not...

462
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:44,555
Don't!

463
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:06,254
It's amazing.
You've got it all on only...

464
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,093
three pages.

465
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,951
You know what would happen if
this fell into the wrong hands?

466
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,666
You named me?

467
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:26,577
Right there along with
the rest of them?

468
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,281
I got scared, man.
That's all it was.

469
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:30,443
You named me, Danny?!

470
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,600
Please, man!
Allison's due in one month.

471
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:39,689
Paul, you and me,
we've been friends since the academy.

472
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:50,568
You named me.

473
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,131
Okay. Let's go.

474
00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:44,570
Hey, hey, hey. Put that away, man.
What you doing? Put that away, man.

475
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,315
Hey, yo-yos.

476
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,705
This is a state penitentiary.

477
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,659
You can't park here.

478
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,917
Oh, you think we
meant to park here?

479
00:39:00,573 --> 00:39:02,924
Put your hands where
I can see them.

480
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,811
I said put your hands
where I can see them!

481
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,659
All fixed.

482
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,468
What do you say you
two hit the road?

483
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,024
You two hit the road,
right now...

484
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:33,734
or we're gonna have a problem.

485
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:06,208
All right?

486
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:07,273
I'm good.

487
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,198
Haven't been this
good in years.

488
00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:27,841
They replaced it.

489
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,495
Michael...

490
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,353
He's there.

491
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:43,037
Son of a...

492
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:44,950
He's there.

493
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:48,733
He's there.

494
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,458
Here, Michael, use this.

495
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:58,563
You ready?

496
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,341
Shh-shh!

497
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:27,804
Ready?

498
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,772
What? Talk to me.

499
00:41:58,877 --> 00:42:01,083
- It can't be done.
- What?!

500
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:02,663
It's too thick.

501
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:05,970
I'm so sorry.

502
00:42:15,188 --> 00:42:16,980
We're not getting out of here.

503
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:25,564
Unfortunately, pretty,
that ain't an option.

504
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:36,546
