1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:02,920
- Previously on Prison Break:
- I'm breaking out,

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,464
and you're going to make sure
my brother goes with me.

3
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,007
I'm sorry, Henry.

4
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,135
This message is for Maricruz.
I'll be there

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,764
in the airport in
Ixtapa waiting for you.

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,391
Sucre, down the road,
if you're in trouble,

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,894
- post a note on the message board.
- What's it called?

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,023
- Europeangoldfinch.net
- That's a bird, right?

9
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:26,610
Go pack your things.
We're moving.

10
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:30,030
We will be a family
if it kills us.

11
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,610
Pull this off and
you're halfway home.

12
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:36,628
- You remember what home is like?
- Stay away from my family!

13
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,334
She needs that medicine--
she can't go two days without it.

14
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,462
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, sweetie...

15
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,501
Michael, I want for
this to be over.

16
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:50,143
That makes two of us. It's just a
question of looking at whatever it is
your father gave you.

17
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,381
It's just a key.

18
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:54,343
It's in a lockbox at the
Corona de Oro cigar club.

19
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:56,512
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

20
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,050
Give me the key. I'll do it.

21
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,601
You want to take a walk?

22
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:30,341
Miss Tancredi?

23
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,592
I need to have a word with you.

24
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,893
- Miss Tancredi?
- Of course.

25
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:49,612
Ma'am?

26
00:01:56,827 --> 00:01:57,992
Miss Tancredi?

27
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,702
It's time to go.

28
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:04,793
Ma'am? They're
going out the back.

29
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,170
Come on, come on.

30
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:31,730
Pediatrics, please.

31
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,113
Hello.

32
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,240
- Cameron.
- Hi, Dad.

33
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:41,281
- How are you doing, big guy?
- Good. I'm eating my lunch.

34
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:44,203
- How is it?
- Pretty disgusting.

35
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:48,000
Maybe your mom can bring
you some dinner from home.

36
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,871
- Did you see the doctor today?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,833
He said I can go home this week

38
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,293
as long as I stay
out of the street.

39
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,093
You're a smart young man.
You know how to cross the street.

40
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,011
Are you mad at me?

41
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:01,592
Listen to me.

42
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:08,600
No one is mad at you.
And this wasn't your fault.

43
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:12,520
- I'm the one who should
have been looking out for you.
- You weren't even there.

44
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:15,112
But I should have been.

45
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:20,953
Hey, buddy, listen. I got to go,
but I'll call you back later, okay?

46
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:22,073
Okay. Bye.

47
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:24,372
Cameron... I love you.

48
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,292
Cam?

49
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:34,923
Yeah. What have we got on Franklin?
- Nothing new since this morning.

50
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:38,462
Another witness from the Minnesota
diner robbery gave a positive I.D.

51
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:41,343
Good. 'Cause I just landed in
Minneapolis 15 minutes ago.

52
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:42,591
Anything else?

53
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,051
Yeah. The girl. Dede.
Apparently, she's been ill,

54
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,933
some chronic condition.

55
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:50,350
Fax Franklin's mug shot to every
hospital in southeastern Minnesota.

56
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,560
Already done. With any luck,

57
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:55,981
she'll get sick enough to need one,
then he'll show his face.

58
00:03:56,735 --> 00:04:00,070
- You don't have kids, do you, Lang?
- Nope.

59
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:04,741
Call me when you have something else.
I'll take that.

60
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:13,000
- We didn't get it.
-  What?

61
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:17,000
And we need to get back in there soon.
Once the Company finds out Sara was
in there,

62
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,462
it won't be long before
they start wondering why.

63
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,803
Find a spot close to
the club and sit tight.

64
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,553
We're going to take the car.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

65
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:25,470
Where you going?

66
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:28,720
Turns out that maybe there's one
member of the club who can help us.

67
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:29,771
Who?

68
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:32,061
Pope?

69
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,101
Just a minute.

70
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:38,863
Henry.

71
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,610
What are you doing here?

72
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:46,621
Aside from jumping bail and
evading the authorities?

73
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:49,450
There's something that you need to hear,
but, first,

74
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:50,842
I need to know if
you'll listen.

75
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,840
I can assure you, Sara,
we've got nothing to discuss.

76
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,891
Sir, please. I need five minutes. After
that, if you want us to, we'll leave.

77
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,923
Who's "us"?

78
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,960
I don't want any trouble.

79
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,293
Good. Because that's
not why we're here.

80
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,921
What the hell are you thinking about,
waltzing in here?

81
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,423
You're a wanted criminal!

82
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,093
In case you've forgotten,
I dedicated my career--

83
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:49,342
my entire life--
to keeping people like you behind bars.

84
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:51,911
You're talking about guilty people.
My brother is innocent.

85
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,810
And we may have the
evidence to prove it.

86
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,572
Well, I don't care;
I want you out of here.

87
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,402
It's in a lockbox at
the Corona del Oro club,

88
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:00,731
- and you're a member.
- Out!

89
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:02,573
Henry, please listen.

90
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:05,741
Sara, I'm tempted to say you
should have known better.

91
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,492
But after what you did...

92
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,411
My father was looking into the
Burrows case when he was murdered.

93
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:13,581
This key is the only thing I
could recover from his body.

94
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:28,882
Where are we going?

95
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:36,020
They're hungry.

96
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:39,021
We've been driving all day.

97
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,771
Chick-O-Stick.

98
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,283
They need real food.

99
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,441
Soon enough, pumpkin.

100
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,411
Alackaday.

101
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:05,920
Miscreants.

102
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,630
Defilers.

103
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,093
Defacers.

104
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:12,591
Despoilers.

105
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,901
What is this?

106
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:25,570
My home.

107
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,582
Aw, no, no, no!

108
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,961
No.

109
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,121
Por favor, please, please.

110
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,180
Okay. All right, sweetie,
why don't you sit over here, okay?

111
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:29,021
All right. I'm going to go over there
and I'm going to talk to the lady.

112
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:31,020
All right? You need anything?

113
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:32,482
You sure?

114
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:34,363
Okay.

115
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,952
My daughter, Dede,
she's really sick.

116
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,871
She's had this kidney thing
since she was real young.

117
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:49,001
- Where is she?
- She's sitting right there.

118
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,753
- Have you been here before?
- No. I'm from out of town.

119
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,300
Can I see your insurance card?

120
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:59,432
Um... no, no. I don't have any
insurance. After I left the army,

121
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:03,100
- they discontinued my insurance.
- Are you a resident of Hennepin County?

122
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:06,192
Like I said,
we're from out of town.

123
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:08,400
You have a driver's license?

124
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,901
Look, I don't have
a driver's license,

125
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:14,742
an insurance card, or anything
like that, but I do know the law.

126
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:17,571
You have to see my little girl.

127
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,781
Let me go get my supervisor.

128
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,820
Good.

129
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:27,750
I don't give a rat's ass
about you or your brother.

130
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,920
I trusted you,

131
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,712
I took you under my wing,
I treated you like my own son.

132
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:33,630
I believed you!

133
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,590
Day after day, you lied to me.

134
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,092
What kind of a man does that?

135
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:40,090
A desperate one.

136
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:46,271
Yeah. Well... you two made a
big mistake coming here today.

137
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,020
You give me no choice.

138
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:50,771
I'm going to notify the
authorities right now.

139
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:53,613
I'm sorry...

140
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,903
...but I can't let you do that.

141
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:03,830
I don't want to
hurt you, Henry.

142
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:05,701
Said by the man with the gun.

143
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:08,160
If it's the only way I can convince you,
so be it.

144
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,450
Well, you're not going to
convince me by doing that.

145
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,468
I'm not the man you think I am.

146
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:14,934
Yeah, well, I have a pretty
good idea who you are, Michael.

147
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,132
If that's true,

148
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,390
then you already know I never
wanted to be in Fox River.

149
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,781
I never wanted to
meet you, Henry.

150
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,561
I certainly didn't want
to ruin your life.

151
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,482
Yeah. Well,
you've done a pretty damn good job.

152
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,603
You're not saying anything to
him I haven't said myself, Henry.

153
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,600
I've looked into this. What he's
saying to you is absolutely true.

154
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,560
I just want my
brother's life back.

155
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:33,152
I want people to
know the truth.

156
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:34,731
I'd give anything for that.

157
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:36,440
I'd lay down my life.

158
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,290
Well, that's easy for you to say,
standing on that side of the gun.

159
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,202
What if I'm standing
on this side?

160
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,630
There are places that can
better serve your needs.

161
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,040
Look, I know my rights, okay?

162
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:57,090
This isn't a primary
care facility.

163
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,882
We provide necessary care in
life-threatening situations.

164
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:00,942
Look, I know what this is.

165
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:03,363
Are you going to wait until she's
dead before you give her some help?

166
00:12:03,398 --> 00:12:04,610
Is that what you're
telling me?!

167
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,142
I'm not going to
argue with you, sir.

168
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,603
This is a hospital,
not a homeless shelter.

169
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:09,431
A what?

170
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,060
What did you just say to me?

171
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:18,071
I can't believe you people.

172
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,451
Come on.
The line is a little bit too long, okay?

173
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,570
We'll go somewhere else.

174
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,490
Where are we going?

175
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,790
We got to find another
doctor, sweetie.

176
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,003
Let's go.

177
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:43,632
Move!

178
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:50,972
Come on, baby.

179
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,071
Franklin!

180
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,453
Move out of the way!

181
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,830
FBI! Stop!

182
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:13,542
Stop!

183
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,793
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

184
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:23,381
Just one second, baby.
Baby, you got to get down, okay?

185
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,441
-No! No, sweetie, you got to get down.
- You got to let him go, honey.

186
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,971
- Get down. Get down.
- Honey, you got to let him go.

187
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,762
- Get down.
- No.

188
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,472
Man, she's not letting go.

189
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:35,101
Don't let her pay
for your mistakes.

190
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:37,860
You hear me?

191
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:55,713
I could shoot you right now
and not even think twice.

192
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,001
But you won't.

193
00:13:57,178 --> 00:14:01,003
You spent too much time around prisons
to throw your life away like that.

194
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,960
What the hell are
you trying to pull?

195
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,513
It's simple-- that's the key
to an innocent man's freedom.

196
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:06,802
Come on, Henry.

197
00:14:07,015 --> 00:14:09,011
We both know there's
something going on here.

198
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:10,761
Too many people have died.

199
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:12,313
Look me in the eye,

200
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,030
tell me you don't believe there's
a cover-up going on right now.

201
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,482
I've got no moral
obligations here, Michael.

202
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:22,321
As far as I know,
Lincoln is as guilty as hell.

203
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,740
Then take a ten-minute drive with me,
and we'll find out.

204
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,282
That's all I ask.

205
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,322
Henry, you've looked into this before.
You've thought about it.

206
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:31,910
I have.

207
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,161
And I've come to
one conclusion--

208
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,961
this has nothing to do with me.

209
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,173
But I am a man of the law,

210
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,923
and right now, I've got a convicted
felon standing inside my house.

211
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,932
Well, maybe there's something I can
offer you to make you change your mind.

212
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,811
What do you intend
to do with us?

213
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,030
You grease monkey.

214
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,451
You don't deserve minimum wage.

215
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,700
The hell I don't,
working graveyard.

216
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:38,041
There ain't no man
deserve more pennies

217
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,561
on a dollar per hour than they
got IQ points in their head.

218
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,832
I ain't stupid.

219
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,753
Seems equal stupid
as the rest of you.

220
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,420
Seems to run in the genes.

221
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:53,592
Teddy. Ten symonyms.

222
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,432
Pick a word.

223
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,011
Pick a word.

224
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:01,140
Destroy.

225
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:07,110
Ten synonyms for "destroy."

226
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:14,111
Annul.

227
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,032
Mutilate.

228
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:25,333
Liquidate. Abrogate. Quell.

229
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:33,050
Ravage. Expunge. Demolish.
Extirpate. Extinguish..

230
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:36,432
- Whoo, you see that?!
- Stupid, my pail,

231
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,183
my boy's gonna be president.

232
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:06,041
How come you ain't studying?

233
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:08,333
'Cause I'm tired.

234
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,591
'Cause I feel like
a circus freak.

235
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:18,430
Well... now...

236
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:25,021
it's in your own best interest.

237
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:29,270
Don't you understand that? Hmm?

238
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:40,661
Now, you're going to
be president someday.

239
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:47,291
You mark my words.

240
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:52,212
Theodore.

241
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,631
Theodore, do you hear me?

242
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:00,393
What are you going
to do with us?

243
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:20,241
We're gonna put
down some roots.

244
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:24,541
You wanted me dead, Paul.

245
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,832
Just following orders.

246
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,583
Sent me to the chair for
something I didn't do,

247
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:30,923
all for your president.

248
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,713
You were willing to do that.

249
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:35,712
Just... following... orders.

250
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,880
Steadman said you loved her.

251
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,970
Steadman was a deranged man
that lived in a locked box.

252
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,763
You don't love someone that
loves power more than life.

253
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:45,263
Bitter, huh?

254
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,893
Am I?

255
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,181
No offense, but

256
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:52,272
you're not capable of
understanding the relationship.

257
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:00,451
Okay, any way you look at it,

258
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,781
there is no light at
the end of this tunnel.

259
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:06,202
One way or another,
you and I, we die.

260
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,582
Your brother, too.

261
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:11,291
Which is a shame given
all he's done for you.

262
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,461
I have a sister I haven't
talked to in 15 years.

263
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:16,962
- Think she's better off for it?
- We'll make it.

264
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:19,012
What is that, faith?

265
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,051
Yeah, that's faith.

266
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:23,220
All I see is a black hole.
And sooner or later,

267
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:26,681
they are going to suck
each one of us into it.

268
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:29,060
But when they come for me,

269
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,270
I'm going to take as many
of them with me as I can.

270
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,520
She must have really
broken your heart, Paul.

271
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:42,610
President Reynolds attended a
Chicago fundraiser last night

272
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:45,283
as part of her two-day
stop in the Windy City.

273
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:48,291
Reynolds' popularity continues
to soar in the Midwest

274
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,121
with appearances scheduled
in Indianapolis, Detroit

275
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,371
and Flint,
Michigan later in the week.

276
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,751
Mr. Kim...

277
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,671
Sarah Tancredi
surfaced in Chicago.

278
00:20:57,845 --> 00:21:00,632
She was spotted at the Corona
de Oro Club about an hour ago.

279
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,221
- Corona de Oro Club?
- It's a cigar club.

280
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,971
Her father was a member.

281
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:08,222
He kept a private
humidor there.

282
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:14,313
Get me a jet to Chicago.

283
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,613
Tell me you're not still
thinking he's going to show.

284
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:02,993
He's let you down so many times.
You know that.

285
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:07,530
Maybe it's the baby in me that's telling
me that this time it's going to
be different.

286
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:12,040
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but he's not going to show.

287
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:19,540
Bubble's not burst.

288
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,713
- I got three words for you.
- Yeah?

289
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:26,433
We gotta run.

290
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,590
Good seeing you, Theresa!

291
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,161
I'm so glad you came.

292
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,203
You're crazy.

293
00:22:55,046 --> 00:22:57,333
How did they know?

294
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:16,021
You're certain...

295
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,732
about what's in the box?

296
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,023
No,

297
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:22,230
but it's all we've got.

298
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:24,533
Thank you, Henry.

299
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,543
You sure about this?

300
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:42,672
No.

301
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:45,752
Either way,
you still owe me dinner.

302
00:23:48,016 --> 00:23:49,511
Is that so?

303
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,973
Yeah. First week in Fox River,

304
00:23:53,187 --> 00:23:56,471
you promised me, if you ever got out
of there, you'd take me to dinner.

305
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,932
Well, maybe, after we wrap this up,
we can stop off

306
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,402
and get you a burrito on the
way back to Pope's house.

307
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,280
Scofield, I don't know
what you're used to,

308
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:07,111
but anything short of a filet mignon
is not going to cut it with me.

309
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,572
It's a date.

310
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:19,792
Give me the phone.

311
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:28,382
Hey.

312
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:30,803
- How did you pull that off?
- I'll tell you later.

313
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:32,550
- Is he in yet?
-  Yep.

314
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:34,482
This shouldn't take more
than a couple of minutes.

315
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,221
Any longer than that,
we'll know we've got trouble.

316
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,773
This way. Mr. Pope.

317
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,230
Thank you.

318
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:48,233
Hey, Warren How's it going?

319
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,040
Did you hear what
happened this morning?

320
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:51,652
Sara Tancredi came in.

321
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,410
Yeah. So I heard.

322
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:57,913
Next time,
don't let her get away. Thanks.

323
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:58,391
Excuse me, do you mind if I borrow
your computer for a moment?

324
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:00,471
- No problem.
- Thanks.

325
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:14,402
Pitch in, chitlins!

326
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:15,952
We can't do this.

327
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,202
We can't live here.

328
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:20,283
No, of course not like this.
We gonna clean.

329
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,910
We are cleaning!
We gonna rebuild!

330
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,503
You can't do this to them.

331
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:26,000
Look at them.

332
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,922
Y'all mind coming along
here for a minute.

333
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:39,973
Come on. I think we're past me waving
that gun around, don't you think?

334
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,392
- What are you doing?
- Nothing is gonna happen to them.

335
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:48,270
Susan. Susie Q.

336
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:50,231
Do you think I'd
bring you here to

337
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:53,651
so sacred a place to me as
this if I meant you ill?

338
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,193
Look at me!

339
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:01,622
I am not the animal you
think you see before you.

340
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,792
I am the laws of karma
all come down wrong.

341
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,040
Don't you understand?

342
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:09,371
I don't.

343
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:16,882
What I'm trying
to say is that...

344
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,050
I am the sin of my father.

345
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:25,020
Why are you telling me this?

346
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:27,061
Because I love you.

347
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,650
Because I want you
to understand me.

348
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,231
I am the last in the
line of Bagwells.

349
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,153
The tail end of a
corrupted breed.

350
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:42,910
The earth, thank God,
shall see no more of our generations.

351
00:27:54,598 --> 00:27:58,220
I cannot procreate, Susan.

352
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,680
And yet,
there's something in that

353
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,802
that gives me great hope.

354
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:06,601
No more Bagwells shall
roam this planet.

355
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:08,981
Not with that vile
blood in their veins.

356
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,193
All I want to do is
end the bloodline,

357
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:12,813
extirpate it,

358
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:14,611
and start another, afresh.

359
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,490
- A new family.
- Oh, Teddy.

360
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:21,242
Those children
are my salvation,

361
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:25,413
my chance to make this
world a better place.

362
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,622
I will be good, Susan.

363
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,543
I will love them.
I will love you.

364
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:37,342
I will take communion,
be baptized under a truer light.

365
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:41,301
All I ask is that

366
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,642
you love me back,
just a little.

367
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:49,810
Or learn to do so in time.

368
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,980
Can you do that, Susan?

369
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,452
I can't.

370
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:06,411
I can't.

371
00:29:18,176 --> 00:29:19,882
I'm sorry.

372
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:37,400
Teddy. Teddy. Please, please.

373
00:29:44,918 --> 00:29:52,373
Teddy, I'm sorry.

374
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:17,690
- Where are we?
- At the doctor's office, sweetie.

375
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:26,820
Hello. Hello,
I have an emergency in here. Hello?

376
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:37,881
Hello.

377
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:45,422
- Hey, you the doctor?
- Need to wait your turn.

378
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:47,441
No, it is my turn.
This is an emergency right here.

379
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:51,310
I need you to look at my daughter, okay?
She's not feeling too good.

380
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:53,683
Please.

381
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:59,810
Sweetie, hold on, so I can...

382
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:05,570
All right, look, this is all the
money I got, okay? That's $400.

383
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:14,082
Please look at my daughter.

384
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:15,873
What's the matter with her?

385
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:19,582
She has a kidney disease-- PKD.

386
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,762
Normally, we have it under control, but
I don't like what I'm seeing right now.

387
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:26,172
Her stomach hurts, okay?
And she's always hot.

388
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:27,091
How's her appetite?

389
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:30,550
It's gone. She's always tired,
ain't that right, baby?

390
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:31,893
All right.

391
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:36,480
- Hop up here.
- Thank you.

392
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,483
He just wants to take a
good look at you, okay?

393
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,153
May need to run a few tests.

394
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,192
Just do what you
have to do, man.

395
00:31:47,618 --> 00:31:50,242
I'm gonna be right here,
okay, baby?

396
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:51,283
Okay.

397
00:31:57,627 --> 00:31:58,331
Yeah.

398
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:01,080
- What's going on now?
- Still in there.

399
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:03,171
This is taking too long.

400
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:06,962
Wait, wait, wait.
Here he comes.

401
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:15,350
- What's happening?
- We got company.

402
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,061
Hello, Henry.

403
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,732
I didn't know you
were a cigar man.

404
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:31,243
- Who are you?
- Uh, a friend. A colleague, in fact.

405
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,123
We're both in law enforcement.

406
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:36,582
- I'm not anymore.
- That's right. You're, uh,

407
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,712
retired.

408
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:42,333
- Know the guy?
-  Yeah.

409
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:47,553
Looks like the lifestyle's
treating you well. Yeah?

410
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:50,381
Socializing over
Cubans and cognac?

411
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:55,473
But that's not what you were doing,
is it?

412
00:32:57,396 --> 00:32:59,063
Henry.

413
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:02,903
You don't mind if ask you
to empty your pockets?

414
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,443
As a matter of fact, I do.

415
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,440
I'm not going to play
any games with you.

416
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,073
We both know why
you came here today.

417
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:15,073
I suggest you get out of my way,
young man.

418
00:33:17,335 --> 00:33:19,542
I can't do that.

419
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:28,922
Unless you'd like to cause serious
trouble for yourself and your family,

420
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:32,262
I advise you to hand over
whatever it is you found.

421
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,890
Now.

422
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:39,432
Michael?

423
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:55,863
Get in!

424
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,300
Let's go!

425
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:17,140
Linc!

426
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:29,692
Sara!

427
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:59,223
Whoa, whoa, it's okay, it's okay.
Easy, easy, it's okay, it's okay.

428
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,522
Ma'am, are you all right?

429
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,482
I don't understand.

430
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,730
We got a call.

431
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:10,193
Someone said there's a
hostage situation here.

432
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,151
No one knew we were here.

433
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,882
Are you okay? Okay.

434
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,390
Hey, so what's going on?

435
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:43,722
I'm afraid your daughter
shows signs of renal failure.

436
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:46,853
She ever had hemodialysis?

437
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:52,062
No, hemo... No.
No, this has never really gone that far.

438
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:57,073
What, are you planning
on doing it right here?

439
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,530
We're not set up for it.

440
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:01,070
And neither is she.

441
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:05,201
But there is a county dialysis
clinic a few blocks away.

442
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:08,790
But we're gonna have to
place a catheter in her neck

443
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,633
so she can be examined.

444
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:14,802
Hold on, sweetie,
this is gonna be a little cold.

445
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,713
It's okay, baby.

446
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,063
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, what, what is that?

447
00:36:27,225 --> 00:36:30,230
It's a trocar.
It's used for placing the catheter.

448
00:36:37,908 --> 00:36:39,863
Do we really have
to go this far?

449
00:36:40,036 --> 00:36:41,070
Look.

450
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,701
I'm doing the best I can here,

451
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,452
but you got to
understand something.

452
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:46,912
Your daughter is sick.

453
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,712
Now, this may look like a
desperate measure because it is.

454
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,712
This is gonna hurt
a little bit.

455
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,632
Stop! Stop.

456
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:03,091
Come on, baby. Come with me.

457
00:37:05,146 --> 00:37:06,890
I can't do this.

458
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,911
What's going on?

459
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:30,661
I made a deal with Pope.

460
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,923
You made a deal with Pope?
What kind of deal?

461
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:42,342
If he came with us and if
we got what we needed,

462
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:44,970
I said I'd turn myself in.

463
00:37:45,185 --> 00:37:45,971
What?!

464
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,971
We don't even know
what this thing is!

465
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,383
It could be nothing, Michael.

466
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:53,352
- You know about this?
- Not until it came out of his mouth.

467
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:55,401
It's the only thing
I could think of.

468
00:37:55,528 --> 00:37:57,610
You two can still finish this.

469
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:00,283
You'll just have to
do it without me.

470
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:02,151
I'm not gonna let
you do this, Michael.

471
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:04,531
There's no coming
back from this.

472
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:07,781
Hold on.

473
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:09,491
What's the holdup?

474
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:14,001
Your brother's right. I wouldn't count
on the courts to show you any leniency
in this.

475
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,792
That doesn't matter.

476
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:20,250
I said I'd hold up
my end of the deal.

477
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,170
You already did.

478
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,090
I listened to this.

479
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:27,262
You have something here.

480
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:31,220
There's gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

481
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:32,182
Listen, Henry...

482
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,683
I'd go now if I were you.

483
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:36,271
And don't consider
this forgiveness.

484
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,983
In fact, I'm about ten seconds
away from changing my mind.

485
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:42,480
Thank you.

486
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,210
Okay...

487
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:05,763
Here, listen...

488
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,473
let's tuck you in, all right?

489
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,640
Come on. Let's go.

490
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:29,701
Let's just...
let's just sit for a bit longer, okay?

491
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:34,620
We're gonna go in
a little bit, okay?

492
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:56,643
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

493
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:58,853
I love you so much.

494
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,732
I'm so sorry.

495
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,322
I'm so sorry, baby.

496
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:26,761
- Yeah.
- Got a call for you.

497
00:40:26,888 --> 00:40:29,383
I'll call back.
I just heard from some clinic up north.

498
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:31,930
They had contact with
Franklin a half an hour ago.

499
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,851
I think you want to take this.

500
00:40:35,355 --> 00:40:36,720
Put it through.

501
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:41,771
- Yeah? Mahone.
- Is this the man in charge?

502
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:50,073
- Oh, yeah.
- My name... is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

503
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:53,952
And I want to turn myself in.

504
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:59,501
But I got one condition.
My wife, she goes free.

505
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:02,673
My little daughter,
she needs her mother.

506
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:06,340
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

507
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:12,383
And what if I got
something you need?

508
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,552
Your wife was
released an hour ago.

509
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:55,091
She'll be here soon.

510
00:41:55,268 --> 00:41:58,471
You promise me that
she will be okay.

511
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:07,111
Just hold up your
end of the deal.

512
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:10,611
I will.

513
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:16,950
I'll get you Scofield.

514
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,391
Come on. Here we go.

515
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,733
You think it's a conversation?

516
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:49,902
One they don't want us to hear.

517
00:42:51,907 --> 00:42:53,282
You ready?

518
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:54,900
Let's do it.

519
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:03,901
