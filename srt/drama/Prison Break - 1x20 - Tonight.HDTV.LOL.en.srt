1
00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:01,794
Previously, on Prison Break:

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:04,861
I want him under
24-hour surveillance.

3
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:06,661
I have to be there when
they kill this man.

4
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:10,061
The least you could do
is review his case.

5
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:11,095
VICE PRESIDENT:
Terrence.

6
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:13,061
The thing I can't
quite figure is

7
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:15,461
with the the crap storm
this thing's become

8
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:17,394
why they haven't killed you.

9
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,461
Have at him.

10
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:24,161
<i>( stabbing )
( screaming )</i>

11
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:26,362
Now, out of respect
for what you once were,

12
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,794
I'm going to let
you walk away.

13
00:00:31,262 --> 00:00:33,628
<i>( shouting )</i>

14
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,262
Why don't you hand me
that shank you're holding?

15
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:47,095
I'm not even sure
why you need it.

16
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,262
Thank you.

17
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:51,095
Your keys are right over there
by your in-box.

18
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,380
You got a maintenance guy

19
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:53,714
waiting outside here,
says you want him

20
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:54,848
to change the locks.

21
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:56,281
Want me to
call him off?

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,480
No, send him in.

23
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:00,747
It's your last chance,
Tweener.

24
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:03,081
Scofield
and his whole PI crew...

25
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:04,521
They're escaping.

26
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:26,087
You know I can't
let you leave here, boss.

27
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,661
dogs

28
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:16,294
The numerous times
I've been apprehended

29
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:17,727
while trying to elude
the authorities

30
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:19,760
it's always because
of the damn dogs.

31
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,727
Turns out you can run from just
about everything

32
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,760
in your life
'cept your own particular stink.

33
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:33,627
Yeah, Well, some of us
stink more than others.
Kinte,

34
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,294
you can smell
like a bouquet of bonbons,

35
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,994
but unless you get rid
of your smell

36
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:40,061
you might as well
send a note to the police

37
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,727
with directions
and some cab fare.

38
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,361
Theodore's right, man.

39
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,428
We got to scrub down our cells.

40
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,194
What about our bunks?

41
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:48,394
Pillows, sheets, everything.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,760
Either get rid of your smell
or change it.

43
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,261
Well, how much time we got?

44
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,261
MICHAEL:
John?

45
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:00,593
Three days. That's the soonest

46
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,760
I could get us
into the Guards' Room for PI.

47
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:05,227
You think you'll have
the extra suits by then?

48
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,894
Probably. They should
be here tomorrow.

49
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,094
Good, so we're good to go.

50
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:11,460
All we got left is figuring out

51
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,261
how to get through
that door in the infirmary.

52
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:14,627
And how to get Linc
out of that box.

53
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,261
And you can do
that in three days?

54
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:19,094
Three days should
be plenty of time.

55
00:03:20,294 --> 00:03:22,460
We got to get out of here.

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,161
Now.

57
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,620
ow
how he found it.
He just did.

58
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:01,821
SUCRE:
The hole's just sitting there?

59
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,388
I covered it the best I
could, but it's just

60
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:05,887
a matter of time before someone

61
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,654
discovers
Bellick's missing.

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,188
What do you mean
Bellick's missing?

63
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,388
<i>SUCRE:
Okay, okay, okay.</i>

64
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:22,587
Fox River is a big place.

65
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:24,388
Maybe they won't
notice for a while.

66
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:26,354
Nothing happens around here
without Bellick's say-so.

67
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,854
Somebody is gonna notice
that he's missing.

68
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:31,188
And when they do, they're gonna
close this place down

69
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:32,188
until they find him.

70
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,455
What are we going to do?

71
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,021
As soon as it gets dark...

72
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,121
we go.

73
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:38,221
SUCRE:
Tonight?

74
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:39,521
Pretty, we ain't ready
to escape tonight.

75
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:40,787
Escape already started.

76
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,455
It started the minute
Bellick found that hole.

77
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:45,021
It's gonna end the minute they
figure out that he's missing.

78
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,421
Then stay!

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,754
I'll be sure to read
the papers in the morning.

80
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,654
See how many years you got
when they realized

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,321
which crew was working
in that room

82
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:54,654
and dug that hole.

83
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,121
So what's the play, man?

84
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:02,654
You think you can have the plane
ready by tonight?

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,455
Sure.

86
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,455
You had kitchen
duty, right?
Yeah.

87
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:08,254
What'd you use
to scrub down the floors?

88
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,521
I think it was some peroxide
or something like that.

89
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,254
That'll work. Get as
much as you can.

90
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:15,188
I'll work on getting us
that key to the infirmary.

91
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,787
The rest of you find
whatever you can

92
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,455
to get rid
of the scent
in your cells.

93
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:20,720
None of this matters, if we
can't get in the guards' room.

94
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,254
We're gonna leave after dinner,
during tier time

95
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,654
when the gates are open.

96
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,887
7:00, one by one,

97
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:26,321
through my cell.
Whoa,
whoa, whoa,

98
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:27,555
whoa, whoa.
Now, we were supposed

99
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,954
to go through
the guards' room.

100
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,754
That was going to give us
a head start hours before

101
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,288
they even found out
we were missing.

102
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,821
T-BAG:
We leave through your cell,
we ain't got no lead time.

103
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:37,154
7:00. Count's
at 8:00, that's...
60 minutes.

104
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:38,587
60 minutes to get over that wall

105
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,188
and as far away
from here as possible.

106
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,954
They'll be right on our asses.

107
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:43,921
PATTERSON:
Quit your talkin'
and start your walkin'.

108
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:46,221
Ladies, yard time is over!

109
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:47,720
They already are.

110
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:59,587
Let's go, let's go.

111
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:01,754
SUCRE:
You know, there's one thing

112
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,754
we didn't talk about
out there-- your brother.

113
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,188
I mean, he's under
24-hour surveillance.

114
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:09,821
I'm just saying, if you
can't get to him by tonight,

115
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,787
we still have to go,
you know that, right?

116
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:20,221
<i>( buzzer )</i>

117
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,354
Hey, boss.

118
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:40,654
What do you want?

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,254
My brother's in Gen Pop.

120
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,421
He's got no clue
I was in an accident.

121
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,488
So?

122
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:49,854
Well, is there any way
I can get a message to him?

123
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:50,987
Yeah.

124
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:52,288
Put it in your will.

125
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,887
And you're sure
all those dots connect?

126
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:06,887
Okay.

127
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,254
Thank you.

128
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,254
Who was that?
A friend of mine

129
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,587
at the title company, handled
a lot of my firm's business.

130
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:14,587
She dug up an address for that
phone number in Blackfoot.

131
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:16,221
Where is it?

132
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:18,521
It's not the where that's
interesting, it's the how.

133
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,687
It turns out our little
place in Montana

134
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:23,088
was purchased for $2 million
by an offshore

135
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,455
holding corporation.

136
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:25,921
That's pretty standard
for a transaction

137
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,954
that size, though, right?

138
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,854
Sure. Only this
holding corporation

139
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:30,754
was bankrolled by a trust--

140
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:34,021
a trust financed by the estate
of Terrence Steadman.

141
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,921
Looks like you and I
are going to Blackfoot, Montana.

142
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:57,121
<i>( muffled yelling )</i>

Bellick today?

00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:02,288
No, Why?

145
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:05,288
Mack was asking.
I guess he ain't showed up yet.

146
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:07,488
He's probably just late.

147
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,288
Bellick? I haven't beat that guy
to work in eight years.

148
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:14,154
Scofield, this ain't
Gibson's. Move it.

149
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,421
They're already starting
to ask questions, man.

150
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:20,987
We're not going to make it
out of here in seven hours

151
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:22,921
without them
finding answers.

152
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,854
How we coming with
that peroxide?

153
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm going to need it before
we meet up for yard duty.

154
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,154
Probably not till later.

155
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,555
You want to tell me
what you need it for?

156
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,921
Makkos, you going
to be eating them there

157
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,754
brussels sprouts?
No.

158
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,088
You mind if I, uh...

159
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,121
Take 'em.

160
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:48,854
They smell like crap.

161
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:49,854
Do they, now?

162
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,455
What's up?

163
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:07,854
Yo, if you...

164
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:09,154
Tonight.

165
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:10,887
What?

166
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,587
Change of plans.

167
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,254
Why, did something happen?

168
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,954
Just find Sucre.
He'll tell you

169
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,521
what you need to do to be ready.

170
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,088
What about...?

171
00:09:20,154 --> 00:09:21,587
Tonight.

172
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,521
<i>MAN:
What the hell's going on?</i>

173
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:33,521
The president changed his mind.

174
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:34,821
We were given
assurances

175
00:09:34,887 --> 00:09:36,288
he would veto
the energy bill.

176
00:09:36,354 --> 00:09:38,088
Assurances can tell
you everything

177
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:39,521
that a man is going to do,

178
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:42,421
until he wakes up in the morning
and changes his mind.

179
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,221
Then change it back.

180
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:46,154
I don't think you understand.

181
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,254
The president...

182
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,221
Have you enjoyed
our support?

183
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,720
Yes.
Good.

184
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:54,921
We certainly wouldn't want
you to take it for granted.

185
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,088
Are you threatening me?

186
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,054
Why?

187
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,321
Do you feel
threatened?

188
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:00,787
Caroline, we've all
been through this before.

189
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:02,421
The ebbs and flows of
political conscience,

190
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:05,987
but we've found at the end
of the day, we get what we want.

191
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:08,121
It's simply a matter
of who helps us get it.

192
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:10,254
If you can't convince
a doddering old fool

193
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,921
finishing up
his second term

194
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,154
what the best thing is
for this country's economy,

195
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,854
perhaps you're not the kind
of helper we're looking for.

196
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:36,121
Sara...

197
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,521
I was thinking
about something...

198
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:40,221
Enough, Michael.
Enough with the-the lies

199
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:42,121
and the coincidences
and the stories, all of it.

200
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:44,221
It's not what you think.
I know what you did.

201
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:46,455
The question is, are you
man enough to admit it?

202
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,821
The keys.

203
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,821
Congratulations.

204
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,954
Is that the first time
you've been honest with me?

205
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,754
It's not...
The second?

206
00:10:56,821 --> 00:10:58,488
What are you after,
Michael?

207
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,121
Is it drugs?

208
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,288
Is it needles?

209
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:02,620
Neither.

210
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:04,188
Then what?

211
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:10,321
Please understand
that I never meant...

212
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,021
I never wanted
to involve you in this.

213
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:16,654
Well, you've done
a pretty poor job of that.

214
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,687
I came here to
tell you something.

215
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:22,254
I'm getting my brother
out of here.

216
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,887
Tonight.

217
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,521
And I need your help.

218
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:43,420
Michael, uh, honestly,
for your own good,

219
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,787
don't say anything more.
You know
he's innocent.

220
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,953
Do what you're talking about
and he won't be.

221
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:49,120
But he'll still be alive.

222
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,286
You understand that
I'm required to report

223
00:11:51,353 --> 00:11:52,520
everything you're telling me.

224
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,854
Yes.
Then why would you?

225
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,487
Because you're the only one
that can help.

226
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:57,820
And because I know
you want to be part
of the solution.

227
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:59,953
Yeah, aiding and abetting
is not part of the solution.

228
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,086
Neither is doing nothing

229
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,620
knowing what you know
about his case.

230
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,086
How dare you put this on me.

231
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,520
I did what I could.
I gave my father
the information from...

232
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:07,919
No offense
to your father,

233
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,653
but the people who
are framing Lincoln,

234
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,453
let's just say they have
a higher security clearance.

235
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,186
So now it's a conspiracy?
I didn't come here
to have a debate.

236
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:16,553
You're asking me
to break the law.

237
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,919
I'm asking you
to make a mistake.

238
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:21,019
Not hurt anyone,
not steal anything.

239
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:22,919
Just...

240
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:24,387
forget to lock up.

241
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,086
Leave the door
unlocked when you
leave tonight.

242
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:29,553
That's it.

243
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,353
Please.

244
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,986
This is where
you're breaking out of?

245
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,553
This room?

246
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:40,854
There are alarm contacts

247
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,387
on the glass
surrounding the door.

248
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,387
Otherwise I wouldn't
need you to...

249
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:46,153
I was part of your plan.

250
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,387
Was it all an act?

251
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,886
At first,

252
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,453
yes.

253
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,120
I needed
to be here.

254
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:01,120
But then I wanted
to be here with you.

255
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:02,787
Right.

256
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:06,220
And it's killing me to know
that you'll never believe that.

257
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,420
Whatever you may
think of me,

258
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,453
this is about Lincoln.

259
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:14,320
Don't make him pay
for my mistakes.

260
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,854
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

262
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:31,919
Yeah?

263
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,353
Hi, it's me.

264
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,520
There's been an acceleration.

265
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,286
How fast we talking about?

266
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:38,620
Fast. Tonight.

267
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,253
Son of a bitch.

268
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,086
I think what you're trying to
say is no problem?

269
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:45,353
Yeah, of course.
It'll be taken care of.

270
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
Good.

271
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:47,587
The van?

272
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,787
Waiting up Fitz Street,
200 yards...

273
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:50,854
Behind the old mill?

274
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,353
Behind the old mill, I got it.

275
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,919
One question, John.

276
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,520
Don't you want a bigger plane?

277
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,919
You've only got three seats.

278
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,653
I thought you said there were
seven or eight guys.

279
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Well, not everybody
gonna have a ticket.

280
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:07,120
You gonna tell me who is?

281
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:09,854
The three of us still breathing.

282
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,153
Two tickets.

283
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,919
Whatever airport's
closer to Blackfoot.

284
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,787
Aisle, window,
it doesn't matter,

285
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,253
just get us on the next flight.

286
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,353

Hello?

290
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,453
Change of plans.
We're going to need you

291
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,019
to have the girl
at the airstrip tonight.

292
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:31,387
Tonight?

293
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,186
Was I not enunciating?

294
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:36,720
No, it's just that, uh...

295
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,754
things could get messy.

296
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,520
So wear a smock.

297
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,153
<i>( men chuckling )</i>

00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,854
Come on, man, like you
wouldn't hit that.

300

I don't know, Vegas,
2:00 a.m. maybe, but...

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,286
if she didn't have
such a big booty.

302
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:14,687
Man, the booty is
the man's biggest weakness.

303
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:16,120
I know I would've hit it.

Find a way to
the infirmary yet?

307
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,086
I'm working on it.

308
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,553
Yo, you seen Bellick today?

309
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,653
Not yet.

310
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,986
I need to talk to him.

311
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,420
Do you know if
he went somewhere?

312
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,153
Do I look like
his mother?

313
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,720
The guy hasn't
shown up yet.

314
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,019
You sure he ain't
showed yet?

315
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:18,320
'Cause I thought I saw him
here this morning, man.

WESTMORELAND:

Yeah, I'm on it.

319
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,754
All right?

320
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,886
Fine.

321
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:34,186
Just, uh...
just sore, that's all.

you'll know all about it.

323
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,720
You know you got
a couple foxes

324
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,286
in your hen house, right?

325
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,687
Who are we talking about?

326
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,320
The bastard
and the born again.

327
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,886
They both want out of here.

328
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,520
They'll behave
until then.
Think so?

329
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:14,919
I just picked this
off of T-Bag yesterday.

330
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,820
If I would've been there
ten seconds later,

331
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:17,919
they'd have been serving

332
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:19,520
Abruzzi with red sauce
over at the morgue.

333
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:21,520
Now I know you want to be

334
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,320
shot caller and everything,
and that's cool,

335
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,019
but you got to handle
things, man.

336
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,854
Are you picking up
what I'm putting down?

337
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,053
Yeah.

338
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,153
Look, this is it, man.

339
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,019
Ain't no do-overs
this time.

340
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,953
Can't be no complications.

341
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,120
We break out tonight

342
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,520
or we ain't never
getting out.

343
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,787
We got that paperwork
in from the county.

344
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,687
Sara?

345
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,086
Yeah. Sorry.

346
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:58,186
The paperwork
from the county.
Right.
I got it.

347
00:17:58,253 --> 00:17:59,453
Um... do me a favor,

348
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,053
could you take care
of that for me?

349
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,019
I got to get
out of here.
Sure.

350
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:04,387
Thanks.

351
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,353
Wait, where are
you going?
Out.

352
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:26,086
Put your blues on
over your PI gear.

353
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:27,453
What?
Just do it.

354
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:31,053
You want to tell us why?

355
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,953
If we don't have time to get
the suits we need,

356
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,553
we're gonna have
to make them.
What the hell

357
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,754
are you doing, man?
We got company.

358
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,153
It's okay.

359
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,653
He's coming with us.

00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,620
Hey, whatever happened to

362
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,053
"We got too many
people"?

363
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,720
When the plan changed,
so did the timing.

364
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,453
We'll make sure
we all get through.

365
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,787
Well, for health
reasons, information
like that should be

366
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:51,387
disseminated
a little more pronto.

367
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,687
Uh-uh, Fish.

368
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:53,986
One more person means

369
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,320
there's one more thing
that can go wrong.

370
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,720
He is not coming.

371
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,487
It's not up
for discussion.
The hell it ain't.

372
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:00,720
I owe him.

373
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:02,553
I don't owe you a damn thing.

374
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,754
You're gonna...

375
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,487
if we get nailed
'cause you didn't want

376
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:10,019
to cut down on
your damn guest list.

377
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,986
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

378
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:28,086
Hey.

379
00:19:28,153 --> 00:19:29,820
Hold up, cons.

380
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,153
I saw some drops of blood on
the floor of the PI locker room.

381
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,520
Now who's going to tell
me what's going on?

382
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:53,153
That'd be me, boss.

383
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,019
I, uh, did it
while I was

384
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:02,053
loading some equipment
back into the shed.

385
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,420
You make sure and
get that patched up.

386
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,754
Will do.

387
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,587
Okay.

388
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,487
Move it.

389
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,053
Are you okay?

390
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,186
Okay enough to make it
out of here tonight.

391
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,086
I swear.

it's me.

394
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,420
I, listen, I know I'm supposed
to call you as my sponsor

Right.

400
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,387
I think we should break
a bottle of champagne

00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:57,919
across its bow.

402
00:21:57,986 --> 00:21:59,453
Well, if you're intending
to get this thing home

403
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,986
for your anniversary tonight,
I wouldn't recommend it.

404
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:03,854
No!

405

Listen, I want you to know
that I... well,

406
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,754
I feel very fortunate
to have met you.

407
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,019
Yeah. I'm guessing not
many structural engineers

408
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,387
make their way
into Fox River.

409
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,286
No, no, I don't mean
because of your vocation.

410
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:18,854
I mean because you're
a decent young man

411
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,153
and there are not
many of those

412
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,620
who make their way
into Fox River.

413
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,353
Well, for what it's worth,
there are a few down there.

414
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,520
Well, that's good to hear.

415
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:29,820
Listen, I know this goes
without saying,

416
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:33,253
but, uh... if there's
anything you need...

417
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,220
well, let's just say
that I owe you one.

418
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:42,986
Actually... there is one thing
you can do for me.

419
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:46,986
LINCOLN:
So this whole thing
this whole time,

420
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:48,220
was never about me.

421
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:50,387
It was about Dad.

422
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,220
I can't believe...

Michael!
What?

425
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,019
You got something you want
to tell me?

426
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,553
Just told you everything
we knew about Dad was a lie

427
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,019
and you barely blinked.

428
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,886
We have to go.

429
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:08,186
Tonight.
What are you talking about?

430
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:13,253
Bellick found the hole, so
either we go now or it's over.

431
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,820
Michael...
Look, I know it's
going to be tight,

432
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:16,854
but I can do this.

433
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,120
Michael, stop it.

00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,153
Listen to me!

00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,553
Go.

438
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,953
You gotta go.
Don't say that.

439
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,919
Look at me!

440
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:33,620
You can't do this.
There's not enough time.

441
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,453
If you stay here,
they'll nail you

442
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,687
and you'll rot in here.

443
00:23:36,754 --> 00:23:40,186
I'm not asking you, man,
I'm telling you.

444
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,620
Leave me behind.

445
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,153
Go.

446

your punk ass

NANCY:
Rumors coming out
of Vice President Reynolds' camp

465
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:19,242
detail a preliminary
short list of running mates

466
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:22,041
should she, as expected,
win her party's nomination.

467
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:24,908
Perhaps the biggest surprise
is the inclusion

468
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:27,041
of Illinois governor
Frank Tancredi.

469
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,275
His consideration
is attributed

470
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:30,975
to his reputation for being
tough on crime.

471
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:34,441
And some point to his recent
refusal to grant clemency

472
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:35,741
to Lincoln Burrows,

473

the murderer of the vice
president's brother,

Are we clear?

484
00:26:52,003 --> 00:26:54,303
<i>( inmates talking )</i>

485
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:59,536
Let's cut
the chatter, convict.

486
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:14,836
Open on 88!

487
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,703
Yo, what's that?

488
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,237
Avocado's gear.

489
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:25,103
He's getting out
of the infirmary tonight.

490
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,903
Tonight?

491
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,636
So you got plenty of time
to bake him a cake.

492
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,270
Hey...

493
00:27:32,337 --> 00:27:35,103
I heard you were asking
Patterson about Bellick.

494
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,836
Said you thought you
saw him this morning?

495
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,536
Yeah. I was.

496
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,303
No, it was yesterday.

497
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,903
That's when I saw him.

498
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,037
You sure?

499
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:59,636
Yeah.

500
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:03,137
You know, time just sort
of blends together up in here.

501
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:05,970
All right.

502
00:28:08,037 --> 00:28:10,536
Close on 88!

503
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:19,103
What am I supposed
to do with this?

504
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,569
Pour it in the toilet.

505
00:28:20,636 --> 00:28:22,303
You got C-Note to steal
some peroxide

506
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,870
from the kitchen
so we can clean the toilet?

507
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,703
We got to get all of us
into psych ward tonight

508
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,270
to access the pipes.

509
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:29,303
A bunch of cons wearing
their prison blues

510
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,070
would stick out
like a sore thumb.

511
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,569
But the inmates
in the psych ward

512
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:34,703
all wear...
White.

513
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,370
Peroxide acts as a bleach.

514
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:37,970
Camouflage.

515
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,203
Just a few more hours now.

516
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,669
Looks like we got
everything we need...

517
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,237
Everything except your brother.

518
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:53,636
You worry about the suits.

519
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:58,404
I'll worry about Linc.

520
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,504
Could you, uh, give
us a couple of minutes?

521
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:02,636
Of course,
Mr. President.

522
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:04,404
You probably know
why I'm here.

523
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,736
If I were
a betting man,

524
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:08,170
I have a pretty
good idea where
I'd lay my chips.

525
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:10,504
The energy bill, Richard.

526
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:11,870
Why did you change your mind?

527
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,303
You've been saying for months

528
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,569
it's so full of pork
the damn thing's

529
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:17,569
ready to squeal, and
now all of a sudden...

530
00:29:17,636 --> 00:29:19,836
Yes, the bill is flawed, but
it's better than doing nothing.

531
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:22,569
Frankly, I find it
a little curious

532
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,404
that you're here,
telling me to veto a bill

533
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,970
you voted in favor of.

534
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:27,437
You're on the way out.

535
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,370
Some of us need
to think ahead.

536
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,936
Actually, I've been doing

537
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,770
some thinking ahead
as well, Caroline--

538
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:36,070
specifically, about
my endorsement.

539
00:29:36,137 --> 00:29:37,303
What?!

540
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,303
I'm considering
making a switch,

541
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,504
throwing my weight
behind Senator Challis.

542
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:44,070
You can't do that.

543
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:45,037
Can't I?

544
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:47,070
Caroline,

545
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:50,337
you are everything
that's wrong with politics.

546
00:29:50,404 --> 00:29:52,603
You vote not
to legislate change,

547
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:54,303
but to profit.

548
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,137
You run not to make
a difference,

549
00:29:56,203 --> 00:29:58,903
but to make demands.

550
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,636
You put me on your ticket

551
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:03,170
not because
I share your views,

552
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:06,003
but because I didn't
share your gender.

553
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,803
So don't take
the moral high ground.

554
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,404
We all know how
this game is played.

555
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,404
Richard, please, I...

556
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,070
Good day, Caroline.
Richard!

557
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,603
R-Richard!

558

my wife for our anniversary?

560
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:21,169
What?

561
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,169
A scarf.

562
00:30:22,236 --> 00:30:23,302
Well, this is a big one for me.

563
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,369
I had to do something special.

564
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:28,336
Okay, let's get this thing
down to the car.

565
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:31,036
We'll do it all together
on three.

566
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:32,436
Ready? One...

567
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:34,336
two... three.

568
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:35,469
Upsie...
Oh, no! Oh, no!

569
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:37,169
Put it down,
put it down, put it down.

570
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:40,535
Oh...

571
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:43,802
All right, get Scofield up here
right away!

All right, get 'em out
and get 'em dry.

575
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:51,702
We got to get 'em on
under our clothes

576
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:54,302
before tier time,
which is in... 45 minutes.

577
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,169
You think everyone else
will be ready?

578
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:57,302
We don't have a choice.

579
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:58,535
As soon as the gate's open,
we go.

580
00:30:58,602 --> 00:31:00,202
We're going to need
every second.

581
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:01,735
MACK:
Open on 40.

582
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:06,336
Scofield, Pope needs
to see you, ASAP.

583
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:07,702
Now?

584
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,336
What for?

585
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:10,735
A Bar Mitzvah. Let's go.

MACK:
Now.

588
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:31,568
Hey, Pretty-- Tick Tock.

the pleasure?</i>

592
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:37,236
I guess to
congratulations.

593
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,735
Can't believe I had to hear
about it on the news.

594
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:41,602
Oh, the VP thing--
well, that's just talk.

595
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,269
Is it?
Yeah. What was it
your mother used to say?

596
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:47,336
"It's always nice
to be invited to the dance,

597
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:49,403
even if you don't have
the right shoes."
Yeah.

598
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,436
She also used to say,
"You're father's a lying
bastard," but I figured

599
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,069
that was just
the booze talking.

600
00:32:54,136 --> 00:32:56,302
You know, it's always nice
to see you, Sara.

601
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:57,735
Is there something
that you needed,

602
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:00,302
or did you just
come by to...
Just tell me something.

603
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:03,036
Did you... did you look at
the information I gave you

604
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:05,136
from Lincoln
Burrows' attorneys?
Sweetheart, move on.

605
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:06,702
The man's attorneys had a window

606
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:08,202
to present new evidence--
they didn't.

607
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:09,602
Now that window is closed.

608
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,336
I just need to know, did you
look at the information?

609
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:14,069
Come on, Sara.
Answer me.

610
00:33:14,136 --> 00:33:17,702
I swear, working at Fox River
has changed you.

611
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:19,969
You're always saying
you want to make a difference?

612
00:33:20,036 --> 00:33:22,002
At that place?
It's too late.

613
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:24,769
You should be a teacher,
so that you can get
to these people

614
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,602
before they become...
Did you look at
the information?

615
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:27,802
I didn't need to.

616
00:33:29,535 --> 00:33:31,802
I supported the findings
of the court.

617
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,302
If you have a problem
with the verdict,
go after them.

618
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,869
But before you do, I suggest
you look at the guy's rap sheet

619
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,602
and ask yourself if the world
will be a better place

620
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:42,069
with Lincoln Burrows
walking the streets.

621
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:44,269
Just tell me one thing--
did they promise you

622
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:45,802
the vice presidency
before or after

623
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:47,469
you signed his
death warrant?

624
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:50,503
I will not discuss morality
with an addict and a thief.

625
00:33:50,568 --> 00:33:51,869
You want to talk
reality, Sara?

626
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:54,136
<i>How many times did I use
my influence to keep</i>

you and one of your junky
boyfriends out of jail?

628
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:58,935
How many?
Was it three, four times?

629
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,202
I swear, Sara, it's
funny, you know?

630
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:04,036
You have no trouble whatsoever
with me bending the law...

631
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:05,535
especially when it's bent

632
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,902
in your direction.

633
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:09,969
Grow up.

634
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:17,469
PATTERSON:
You talk to that Tweener kid?

635
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:19,503
STOLTE:
Yeah, he says he got
his days mixed up,

636
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:21,036
but I don't know.
What?

637
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,102
Something about
the way he said it.

638
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,336
Oh, come on, man, Bellick's
just taking a personal.

639
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:28,302
I don't want to get
the guy busted.
And if he's not?

640
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:31,735
I'm just saying, it's 6:30
and no one's heard from the guy.

641
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:33,568
We got to tell Pope.

642
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:37,702
Okay. I'll tell him.

643
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:43,436
VERONICA:
Did you call the cab
for the airport?

644
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,769
No, not yet.
Why not?

645
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,969
Come on, the flight
leaves in an hour.

646
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:48,835
Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:52,102
I'm starting to think
that us going to Montana
might not be

648
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,469
a good move.
What are you talking about?

649
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:57,769
What if you are right,
and the smoking gun
is in that house?

650
00:34:57,835 --> 00:34:59,835
You think they're just
gonna let us walk in there

651
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:01,369
and make a citizen's arrest?
Look, Nick,

652
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:02,869
I don't know what
your deal is lately,

653
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,769
but I'm getting on that plane
with or without you.

654
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:12,256
i can't let u do it

655
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:22,741
All this time
you were one of them?

656
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:26,109
Who's pulling
your leash, Nick?

657
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,975
Steadman? Kellerman?

658
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,476
Look at me.

659
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:31,876
I want you to remember

660
00:35:31,942 --> 00:35:34,376
my face when you do whatever
the hell it is you're gonna do.

661
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:38,142
Look at me!

662
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:41,276
You're a coward.

663
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,910
<i>( door opens )</i>

664
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:53,109
Ah, Scofield's
outside, sir.

665
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:54,376
POPE:
Okay.

666
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,342
I want you to try
every number we have

667
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:57,843
for Brad Bellick--
try his home first.

668
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,709
His mother
usually answers.

669
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,276
Mrs. Bellick?

670
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:08,910
Hi. Uh, one moment, please.

671
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,942
I have Warden Pope here
for you.

672
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:12,776
Mrs. Bellick?

673
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,176
No cause for alarm, no, no.

674
00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:16,209
We just... we haven't seen him,
and we were wondering

675
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:17,942
if he might be home
under the weather.

676
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:27,309
So Brad called you when
he pulled in this morning?

677
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:29,376
And he said he was here?

678
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:31,209
Okay, well, uh,

679
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:32,509
thank you, Mrs. Bellick.

680
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:34,342
We'll keep you posted.
I'm sure he's fine.

681
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,709
Radio Mack.

682
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:38,942
Have him check the parking lot
for Bellick's truck.

683
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:41,476
If he finds it,
have him call me immediately.

684
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:47,409
BECKY:
457.

685
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:48,576
This is base.

686
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:51,142
What's your 20?

687
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,342
<i>MARICRUZ:
I'm pregnant, Fernando.</i>

688
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,009
<i>I'm gonna have your son.</i>

689
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:04,009
But all I know is
that I'm really scared.

690
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:06,609
I'm really scared
to do this alone.

691
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:15,676
<i>John, it's never too late.</i>

692
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,975
<i>If you'll agree to accept
Christ into your heart</i>

693
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:21,409
<i>and turn from your sin,
He will forgive you</i>

694
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:23,676
<i>and save you in eternity.</i>

695
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:25,309
Where's Fibonacci?
I'll give you Fibonacci

696
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,009
when the time is right.

697
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:28,109
The time is right now.

698
00:37:28,176 --> 00:37:29,910
No, the time is right
when you and I

699
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:31,176
are both standing
outside those walls.

700
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:51,176
I'm gonna get
out of here someday,
and when I do...

701
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:56,942
...don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like,

702
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,543
Susie.

703
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,643
<i>( spits )</i>

704
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:14,209
<i>C-NOTE:
I'm... being shipped back off.</i>

705
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,209
<i>How many times I got to say it?</i>

706
00:38:33,276 --> 00:38:35,176
You only got
one thing I need.

707
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:01,309
<i>POPE:
I've got some bad news,
Charles.</i>

708
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,709
<i>Your daughter's got
esophageal cancer,</i>

709
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:07,376
<i>and she wants to see you
while there's still time.</i>

710
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:08,942
How long does she have?

711
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,810
Hospital says a week.

712
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:25,643
<i>( soft, gasping breaths )</i>

713
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,876
<i>( pained groan )</i>

714
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:22,109
<i>( gasping breaths )</i>

715
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:23,643
<i>( electrical buzzing )</i>

716
00:41:03,176 --> 00:41:06,176
<i>POPE:
I read somewhere where
the actual Taj Mahal</i>

717
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:09,443
<i>appears pink in the morning,
milky white in the evening,</i>

718
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,975
<i>and golden
when the moon shines.</i>

719
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,643
<i>The changes, they say,</i>

720
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:16,209
<i>depict the different emotions
of a woman.</i>

721
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:18,476
I can tell you something,
if we don't get this
thing fixed tonight,

722
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,776
I don't want to know
what kind of emotion
my wife is gonna have

723
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,942
if I walk through that door
empty-handed.

724
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:24,676
It's strange-- I mean,
it just gave way.

725
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,709
We lifted it up, and
the support beam snapped.

726
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:31,075
What's this?

727
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:32,309
The support.

728
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:35,643
The one that holds up that beam.

729
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,776
You took it?

730
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:42,276
I'm sorry...

731
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:45,509
but I needed to get
back in here.

732
00:41:45,576 --> 00:41:47,810
I-I-I don't understand,
why would you...

733
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:49,342
I'm breaking out.

734
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,942
And you're gonna make sure
my brother goes with me.
