<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,403
Welcome home, boss.

3
00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:06,211
Where's Mommy?

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,261
Mommy is gonna meet us later, okay?

5
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:11,035
I'm not a murder.

6
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:13,766
Terrence Steadman,
the President's brother.

7
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,041
I didn't do it.

8
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,679
Mr. Steadman, it's contraband.

9
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,051
I brought it to protect myself.

10
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:20,841
That's what we're here for.

11
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:23,197
Can I write a check for the food?
'Cause I don't have...

12
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:24,560
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,901
Daddy's home.

14
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:28,368
<i>It's Pam.</i>

15
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:30,369
- What's going on?
- I love you.

16
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:32,075
<i>Give Cam a kiss for me, okay?</i>

17
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:35,028
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

18
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:36,932
You want my help, Bill,
and I want my job back.

19
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:39,272
- What's your plan?
<i>- When those brothers get in the van,</i>

20
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:40,837
it'll be the last thing they ever do.

21
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:41,996
<i>Kellerman has a team ready</i>

22
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:44,142
to move on the caravan
just outside of Albuquerque.

23
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,845
<i>When it goes down, there's sure
to be lots of bullets flying.</i>

24
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:50,198
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

25
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,211
President Reynolds ruined your life.
She ruined my life.

26
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,852
You want to take the bitch down,
you just found your inside man,

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,249
but it's got to be right now. Let's go!

28
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,038
I know the way out!

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,958
I want a team flanking west.

30
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:48,970
Give me another team down by the river.

31
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:59,196
Man down! Give me a medevac, ASAP!

32
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,456
Officer Tuggle.

33
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,919
Officer Tuggle?

34
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm looking for Alexander Mahone.

35
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,694
I'm his direct supervisor.

36
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,284
Sorry to tell you this, sir, but...

37
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:21,085
your boy's been shot.

38
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,162
Who are you?

39
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,208
I used to work for the President.

40
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:33,875
Why are you helping us?

41
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:36,812
Lay down on the floor, now.

42
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,379
Federal agent. Let me through.

43
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:02,081
Air support is telling us
that they saw your vehicle

44
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:03,888
traveling alone down Route 46.

45
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,332
Route 46--
possible exit route for the convicts.

46
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:08,483
I was securing it.

47
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:11,474
No offense, sir,
but we're searching every vehicle.

48
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:14,790
No offense, you either let me through
or you get me your supervisor.

49
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,750
I'm supervising this roadblock,
Agent Kellerman.

50
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,895
I'm sorry, but I need you
to get out of the vehicle.

51
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:22,022
Sergeant...

52
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,525
Humphries.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,496
Burrows and Scofield have been
on the loose for 10 mins.

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,960
That means, that at this stage,
every second is critical.

55
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,308
So if you detain me for one moment more,

56
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,490
I will have all of your jobs,
do you understand me?

57
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:38,849
- Go ahead.
- What?

58
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,731
Just let him go.

59
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,206
You still haven't answered my question.

60
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,446
Why am I helping you?

61
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,643
Because the enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

62
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:12,005
You said something
about taking down the President,

63
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,724
I'm gonna assume you have a plan.

64
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,725
I do.

65
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:17,259
<i>It was a Great Dane.</i>

66
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:18,610
<i>We had a bird hound.</i>

67
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:20,273
<i>It was very peaceful.</i>

68
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:23,575
<i>One minute she was breathing.
The next, she wasn't.</i>

69
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,599
Turn around.

70
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,486
Get up!

71
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,944
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't blow your brains out!

72
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:57,650
Because I can give you
the one thing that's gonna set you free.

73
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,752
I know where Terrence Steadman is.

74
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:31,226
2x14

75
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:34,968
www.sub-way.fr (V.1.00)

76
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,212
How do you know where Steadman is?

77
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,337
Because I arranged this whole thing.

78
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,286
- You arranged to set me up?
- That's right.

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,172
You arranged the killing
of all the people I know.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,309
I was given orders,
I executed those orders,

81
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:53,664
and now I have a bull's-eye on my chest,
just like you two.

82
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,657
I don't trust him.

83
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:03,566
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

84
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,064
You guys want to keep running, fine.

85
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,326
You want to be free, get in the car.

86
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:11,597
Last time I'm gonna offer.

87
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:40,013
What's up, Fish?

88
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,103
Looks like you're having
a tough time of it.

89
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,225
- I'm all right.
- Well, I'm just curious.

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,583
Why don't you hang out with

91
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:56,147
the rest of the ex-guards
that are locked up here?

92
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,382
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:59,234 --> 00:07:00,234
There ain't any.

94
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,176
It's just you.

95
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,037
Hey, ho-ho-hold up, hold up.

96
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,478
Now, I got what's called a mutual
beneficial arrangement in my mind.

97
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,755
I'll look out after you,

98
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:17,873
make sure nobody get up in your mix.

99
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:22,110
And all you got to do is bring me
your dessert after the next meal.

100
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:23,719
It's real simple.

101
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,610
I'm just looking to do my time.
I don't want any trouble.

102
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,373
Yeah, there's what you want,

103
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:30,538
and there's what I want.

104
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,543
Your dessert after the next chow.

105
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,403
You bring it to me.

106
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,689
You got it?

107
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,091
Wrong guy.

108
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,682
Break it up, convicts!

109
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:43,946
We're good, boss.

110
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,850
We're good.

111
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,269
You bring me my treats,

112
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:52,709
or else this goes next level.

113
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:54,975
Do you understand?

114
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:00,318
He asked you a question, boy.

115
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,573
Yeah.

116
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,697
- I ain't hear him.
- I ain't hear him.

117
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah, okay.

118
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,869
See how easy that was?

119
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:16,173
We're gonna be good friends, man.

120
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,898
There's no reason for you to be scared,
Susie Q.

121
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,180
'Cause you see, I've forgiven you.

122
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:45,047
And you, in turn, can

123
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:47,521
forgive me for my indiscretions,

124
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:48,840
which are so far in the past,

125
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,384
they're nothing but specks
in our respective rearviews.

126
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,688
It's been such a long time.

127
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:00,556
You look lovely.

128
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:06,619
Okay. Let's go, right now.

129
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,409
We can, we can go away,

130
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:11,231
spend some time together.

131
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:14,810
Listen, I'm not a Victrola,
so please don't play me like one.

132
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:17,141
There's not a white man's chance
in Harlem

133
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,377
you'd ever leave your children behind.

134
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:22,346
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,277
Don't fret now.

136
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,043
When you came to Fox River,

137
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,758
and you spat at me
like I was some kind of...

138
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,170
rabid animal...

139
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:39,872
I was happy.

140
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,738
'Cause such a visceral reaction

141
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:46,860
could only come from a woman
who still cares.

142
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,593
The children don't know anything.

143
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,983
I didn't want to scare them,

144
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,518
so I never told them about you,
so please don't.

145
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:56,428
That is so perfect.

146
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,144
'Cause you see what we got here now?

147
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:07,640
We got ourselves a clean slate.

148
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,954
Right?

149
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:18,852
So, this is the conspiracy, huh?

150
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,738
Bunch of little boys in suits
running around,

151
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,050
trying to kill each other?

152
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:25,374
It's pathetic.

153
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:29,427
Well, you were a little more formidable
than we anticipated.

154
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,948
We don't need compliments out of you,
jackass.

155
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:33,637
Oh, yes, there it is,

156
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,611
the winning Burrows personality!

157
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,663
Shut your mouth and drive.

158
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,521
The one we really knew
would win over a jury.

159
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:39,412
Good work.

160
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:46,905
Mr. Kim?

161
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:49,948
What the hell is going on out there?

162
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,872
<i>Well, it was touch-and-go there
for a minute,</i>

163
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,262
but I got everything handled.

164
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:54,492
<i>Mahone's been shot.</i>

165
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,939
Yes, I know, Bill. I was there.

166
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,276
I saw Burrows pull the trigger.

167
00:10:58,315 --> 00:10:59,707
<i>We lost a valuable asset, but...</i>

168
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:00,753
Mahone's alive.

169
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:06,977
That's good. It looked bad.

170
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,081
Where are Burrows and Scofield?

171
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,864
Burrows and Scofield are dead.

172
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:14,353
And they're in my SUV.
I'm heading out to bury them right now.

173
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,665
Don't bury them.

174
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:19,241
I need visual confirmation.

175
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,397
I'll get you a photo.

176
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:22,726
I'll say it one more time.

177
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:25,262
Don't bury them.

178
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,133
<i>You know what'll be nice
to hear now, Bill?</i>

179
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:28,434
A "thank you."

180
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,941
I'll report back
when they're in the ground.

181
00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:36,194
- You leave that on, he'll trace it.
- Yeah...

182
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,838
Secret Service. It's untraceable.
Thanks.

183
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,141
Hey, baby girl.

184
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,509
What?

185
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:05,902
What's the matter?

186
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,837
Where's Mommy?

187
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:09,436
Come on...

188
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:12,580
I told you that Mommy
was helping a friend.

189
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,861
All right? Now we're gonna see her
real soon.

190
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:15,950
When?

191
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:18,068
Baby...

192
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,982
we're gonna be with your mommy
real soon.

193
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:22,081
I promise you that.

194
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,821
I don't believe you.

195
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,730
Dede!

196
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,650
<i>Yo, Trey, it's me, man.</i>

197
00:12:43,947 --> 00:12:44,947
What's up?

198
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,523
<i>Yo, what's going on with Kacee?</i>

199
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:47,845
I'm at the courthouse.

200
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,321
She's getting arraigned soon.

201
00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:51,408
Okay. Will you talk to her?
Is she all right?

202
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:53,909
She's in jail!
So, no, she's not all right.

203
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,180
What the hell happened?

204
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,415
Your stupid ass think
I wanted it to go down this way?

205
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,868
Whatever. Man, I gotta go.

206
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,250
Her lawyer'll be here
any minute.

207
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,521
No. Listen, listen.

208
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,892
Now look, I want you to tell Kacee

209
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,970
to put it all on me, all right?

210
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,237
And that she didn't know what to do,
she was scared.

211
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:09,579
Okay? All that.

212
00:13:09,737 --> 00:13:11,910
Yeah, I already told her to do that.

213
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:27,998
I'll do the talking.

214
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,823
- Owen Kravecki?
- That's me.

215
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:30,949
Hey.

216
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,110
Ben and Phil.

217
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,618
Let's get it going before our wives
figure out this is a fishing trip.

218
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,641
Where's your gear?

219
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,515
- I keep it up north.
- Okay.

220
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:39,643
How long is the flight?

221
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:41,266
Hour 40.

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,387
We don't have a choice.

223
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,748
Glad you're awake.

224
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,276
Collarbone rotator cuff.

225
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,656
Six inches to the right, you're dead.

226
00:14:23,435 --> 00:14:24,774
Yeah, he just woke up.

227
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:35,942
<i>Mr. Mahone?</i>

228
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,392
Bill Kim.

229
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:39,272
You're a lucky man.

230
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:40,492
Am I?

231
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,348
<i>Kellerman finished the job you couldn't.</i>

232
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:45,145
But he, unfortunately,
is still out there.

233
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,280
And he's a loose end.

234
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,913
You have to finish
what you were supposed to take care of.

235
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,226
<i>Something funny?</i>

236
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:57,067
Keller is more of a loose end
than you realize.

237
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,332
He shot me.

238
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,048
<i>That guy...</i>

239
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,145
<i>... you wanted to double-cross
screwed you first.</i>

240
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:05,908
Scofield and Burrows...

241
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,904
... are probably alive.

242
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,750
and on the run with Kellerman.

243
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,606
Have a good day, Kimmy.

244
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,323
We neutered Kellerman.

245
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,957
He doesn't even officially exist
anymore.

246
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:30,419
He knows everything.

247
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,305
<i>Reports have been coming in
from New Mexico officials</i>

248
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,984
<i>that escaped convicts Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows</i>

249
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,404
<i>have somehow managed
to extricate themselves</i>

250
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,270
<i>from a transport van that was
bringing them back to the Chicago area.</i>

251
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,143
<i>According to this early information,
the convicts were--</i>

252
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:55,591
You're great.

253
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,513
Top-notch. I swear to God.

254
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:01,567
Don't get yourself worked up,
Mr. Steadman.

255
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:04,476
I was supposed to have my life back
by now!

256
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,073
Playing golf...

257
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:09,932
Going to movies...

258
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:11,774
Seeing people...

259
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:14,399
But because you guys can't get a handle

260
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,925
on an engineer and a petty crook...

261
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,360
I've been a ship in a bottle
for over three years.

262
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:21,669
Perfectly safe here.

263
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:29,948
I wish.

264
00:16:35,715 --> 00:16:36,932
I just spoke to Kim.

265
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,877
He wants you to finish the job.

266
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,470
Yeah?

267
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,705
Well, that's not gonna happen.

268
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,360
This isn't a request.

269
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,282
And this isn't a negotiation.

270
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:51,317
Kim and Kellerman can try
to kill each other all day long.

271
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:54,825
But I'm out.

272
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:58,639
You must have forgotten how discreet
we've been with what we know.

273
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,075
Go tell the world about Shales!
In fact I will.

274
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:03,658
I killed a predator, a man who tortured
and raped women

275
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:06,087
and I buried him in my backyard.
I'll do the time.

276
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,602
I don't care anymore. I'm out.

277
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:11,043
Is that clear enough for you?

278
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:47,759
My man!

279
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,486
That's delicious.

280
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,921
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

281
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,435
We've got a problem.

282
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,173
There's one brownie.

283
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:08,562
There's five of my boys.

284
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:11,808
You see the position you put me in?

285
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:14,494
They gotta stand here
with their stomachs growling

286
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,120
will I savor this delicious treat.

287
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,985
That makes me look like a real ass.

288
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,824
Are you trying to make me look
like an ass?

289
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,170
You said the deal was I was supposed
to bring you one dessert.

290
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:31,687
Yeah, well...

291
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:33,888
I'm fickle, bitch.

292
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:36,044
Now it's five desserts.

293
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,824
Every meal.

294
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,432
Now, if you can't come up with that...

295
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:45,562
there are other ways...

296
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:47,229
... to making me happy.

297
00:18:48,514 --> 00:18:51,494
Well, I've got some other candy on me
if you want some of that.

298
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,337
Well bring it out, bitch. It's all good.

299
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:05,315
Who wants some candy?

300
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:26,128
If memory serves, I was
at Storytime Village that day, too.

301
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,514
And I'm not in any of these pictures?

302
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,197
I could have sworn I was.

303
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,036
I'm just teasing, baby.

304
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,187
Every woman has burned
the photographs of her paramour

305
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:39,462
only to later realize her love burns

306
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:42,136
even harder than the flame she used.

307
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:47,354
Please!

308
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,246
Teddy!

309
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:56,817
Uncle Teddy!

310
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,115
How's my girl been?

311
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,201
Good.

312
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,917
You still getting more A's
than an aardvark?

313
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:05,366
Yeah, I missed you!

314
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:07,676
Oh, same here, shortcake.

315
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,349
Yes, I painted my hair.

316
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:11,230
Look at you, Zack.

317
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:14,392
You are a boy no more.

318
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,175
I'm gonna have to lend you
my razor soon enough.

319
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:19,837
What are you doing here?

320
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:22,256
Mom said you got a job on an oil rig...?

321
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,083
That's right, right out
in the middle of the ocean.

322
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:28,701
But those metallic beasts are dangerous.

323
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,450
Got myself injured.

324
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:33,716
And don't be frightened now, sugar.

325
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,250
The good lawyers
at Dewey, Cheatham and Howe

326
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,301
got me a million bones

327
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:40,679
for every digit I lost.

328
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,895
Five million dollars?

329
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:46,937
Which means

330
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:49,547
with all that cash,
I can do anything I want now.

331
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:51,241
And all I want to do

332
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:54,387
is spend all my money
and all my time...

333
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:56,483
... with you...

334
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:11,966
What's the neighborhood like?

335
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:14,421
No neighborhood.
The house sits on 50 acres.

336
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:15,909
We coming out the way we go in?

337
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,652
No, there's a back road we take.

338
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,839
- How many guards?
- Usually none.

339
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:22,594
At this point,
I really couldn't tell you.

340
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,282
The second I feel this thing going bad,

341
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:27,299
you get a bullet in the head.

342
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:30,966
I expect nothing less.

343
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,266
I will inform you every half hour.

344
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:36,929
Understood.

345
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:39,810
Private jet was chartered
by Owen Kravecki this morning.

346
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,200
- Headed where?
- Montana.

347
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,577
Stop it from taking off.

348
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:46,460
It's already on the ground, sir.

349
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:57,194
If that's my sister, I would like
to speak to her.

350
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,842
Right away, sir.

351
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:08,147
Evac.

352
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,304
Mr. Steadman, do you have a jacket?
We need to leave.

353
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:12,305
Leave?

354
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:13,356
What? No.

355
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,171
Agents will be arriving shortly
to take you to a safe house.

356
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,505
What do I need to be kept safe from?

357
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:19,697
Do you have a jacket, sir?

358
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,172
I don't want to leave.

359
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:22,685
I want to talk to my sister.

360
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,092
I've been authorized to use force
if necessary.

361
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:27,145
Now, is there anything
you'd like to bring?

362
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:32,814
My meds.

363
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,520
Go with him. Car's here in five minutes.

364
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:44,192
I don't know, Stella.

365
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,725
She won't come out.

366
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,803
Who wants to be up
in the trailer all day, huh?

367
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:49,907
Would you?

368
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,246
Exactly, me, neither!

369
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,379
You feel like baking a pie or something?

370
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:56,773
A little cherry or lemon meringue?

371
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,176
Daddy?

372
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:01,498
Is Mommy in trouble, like you?

373
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:10,586
Sweetheart, come here.

374
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,598
Come here.

375
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:18,953
Now, you listen to me, okay?

376
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:22,227
Mommy did nothing wrong.

377
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,138
She's helping out a friend.

378
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:27,946
Okay?

379
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:34,799
Okay, let me go see
how Mommy's doing, all right?

380
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,822
- I wanna come. I wanna talk to her.
- No, no.

381
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,812
You sit here like a good little girl,
okay?

382
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,911
Don't give me that.

383
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:43,989
<i>Things are looking up.</i>

384
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,269
That's what I wanted to hear.
Man, kick it down to me.

385
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:49,397
Her lawyer seems like he knows
what he's doing.

386
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:50,977
He thinks he can get the bail reduced.

387
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,405
<i>Good. All right, listen.</i>

388
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,854
When Kacee gets out,

389
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,009
I want you to deliver this message
for me. Okay?

390
00:23:57,618 --> 00:23:58,643
Tell her

391
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,691
that we can all get lost.

392
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,510
You want her to jump bail now?

393
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,275
You better be glad
you ain't

394
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,475
<i>in front of me, or I'd have my hands
around your neck.</i>

395
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,389
Listen, punk, just deliver the message.

396
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:10,841
Then what y'all gonna do?
Go live in a cave?

397
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:13,124
I got a plan, all right?

398
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,204
Well, let's hear it.

399
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,036
This guy back in my unit

400
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:19,786
when I was in Iraq...

401
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:24,166
He used to go up to Alaska
and work at these fish hatcheries, man.

402
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,996
They pay you cash
and nobody asks questions.

403
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,106
<i>Alaska?</i>

404
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:29,433
<i>Yeah, Alaska, man.</i>

405
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,558
<i>They don't bother you up there, man.</i>

406
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,369
You know, me, Kacee and Dede,
we could be a family again.

407
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:35,424
You feel me?

408
00:24:35,463 --> 00:24:36,566
Man, you don't quit.

409
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,390
You damn straight I don't quit!

410
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:42,532
Do I get to know where I'm going?

411
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:45,054
You'll get all the information
you need upon arrival.

412
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:48,969
We need to move Steadman
to Location Beta.

413
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,405
We're sending a car to pick him up.

414
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:52,138
It's already here, sir.

415
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,400
Couldn't be.

416
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:56,590
The car just left.

417
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:00,072
Weapons down!

418
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,171
Now!

419
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:08,657
Down!

420
00:25:09,077 --> 00:25:10,211
Put your weapons down!

421
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,606
Don't get stupid!

422
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:18,928
Put your weapons down.
On the ground. Now!

423
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,236
Terrence, step away. Get in the car.

424
00:25:23,794 --> 00:25:25,502
You look pretty good for a dead man.

425
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:27,345
- Get in the car!
- Wh-where? Why?

426
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,034
- Who's there?
- It's Kellerman.

427
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,151
He's got Steadman.

428
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:31,973
Do not let him escape !

429
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,269
Kill Steadman. Kill them all now.

430
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:43,209
- Paul, please. Don't, don't...
- Get in!

431
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:45,016
- Don't kill me.
- Get in the car!

432
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:52,092
Let's go.

433
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:05,212
Vomiting.

434
00:26:05,213 --> 00:26:07,624
It's the worst side effect
of anesthesia.

435
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,738
That should be the last of it.

436
00:26:11,524 --> 00:26:12,930
You figure I'm on empty by now?

437
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:13,931
Yeah.

438
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:20,989
Pam.

439
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:24,823
Alex, Cameron's been hurt.

440
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:26,884
- What happened?
- It was a car,

441
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:28,761
a hit-and run. He's at the hospital.

442
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:31,032
His leg is broken in 2 places.

443
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:32,923
I'll be on the next plane to Colorado,
okay ?

444
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,198
<i>He's in surgery now.</i>

445
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,972
I'll be right there ! Just hold on !

446
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,072
They won' let me see him.

447
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,924
They call me at work, I come right here

448
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:40,606
and now they won't let me see him !

449
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:41,794
Pam, please..

450
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:44,288
Keep it together until I get there.
Can you do that for me?

451
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:45,908
Please, please, hurry !

452
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:48,528
Mr. Mahone, you can't get on a plane.

453
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,054
You need to stay at least another day
for observation.

454
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:52,296
You were shot !

455
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:54,899
Mr. Mahone, please.

456
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:58,557
- I gotta go see my son.
- Mr. Mahone, I understand.

457
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,826
Please.
At least stay and talk to a doctor.

458
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,649
How's your boy?

459
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:12,681
Tib-fib fractures are bad.

460
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:15,216
but if the growth's plate is affected,

461
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:16,675
there's a whole host of problems.

462
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:18,976
- You made a mistake.
- No, you did.

463
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:22,578
You think you can just quit
like you work at a post office?

464
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,571
Now you're needed back in.

465
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,731
Go clean up your mess.

466
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:31,183
Maybe there won't be another accident
on the streets of Durango, Colorado.

467
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:34,773
Understand?

468
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:45,962
Every road shut down,
every car stopped and searched.

469
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:48,037
I don't care if it's
a group of nuns touring Yellowstone.

470
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,571
Their camper gets turned inside out.

471
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:50,460
Logistically speaking,

472
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,549
- every road's gonna take some time.
- It's Montana.

473
00:27:53,065 --> 00:27:54,084
Not Manhattan.

474
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:55,922
Get it done.

475
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,124
Yes, sir.

476
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,507
If we get a camera, we can

477
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,800
we can take a picture of him
holding a current newspaper.

478
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,236
If we put that on-line, well,
that'll prove he's still alive.

479
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:09,561
It'll prove that we found a guy.

480
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:12,105
that looks like kind of
like the president's brother.

481
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:13,773
Fingerprints, dental records?

482
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:14,879
We white-washed him.

483
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
pullet out his teeths,

484
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:17,636
burnt his fingerprints.

485
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:18,814
DNA.

486
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:20,971
To compare against the homeless guy

487
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,570
who was killed and put in his car

488
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,683
but
we destroyed all exterior DNA samples,

489
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:27,389
so that
there'd be nothing to compare them to.

490
00:28:27,637 --> 00:28:30,186
There's gotta be someone somewhere
who can identify this man.

491
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:32,069
Which is why we did the surgery.

492
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,448
Cheek bones raised two centimeters,
ears lowered a quarter of an inch.

493
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,317
Not so much that someone
who knew him wouldn't recognize him,

494
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,201
but enough that any forensic comparison

495
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:43,860
of a photograph of that man
would conclude that he is a look-alike.

496
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:44,901
A hoax.

497
00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:45,987
Trust me.

498
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:48,662
We are very good at what we do.

499
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,079
Please just let me go.

500
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,532
Terrence, you've made
every man in this room a prisoner,

501
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,650
including yourself.

502
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,538
It's time to set up free.

503
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:01,682
Nothing you do will work.

504
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,998
They will not let it.

505
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,655
Cut the victim act, Terrence.

506
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,170
He was more than happy to play along

507
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:09,199
when he was lining his pockets
with taxpayer money

508
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:10,276
funneled through EcoField.

509
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:12,971
And then,
when the indictment is about to fall,

510
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:15,979
who do you come running to for help,
Terrence?

511
00:29:19,748 --> 00:29:21,607
Now we are gonna stay here
for a day or two,

512
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:24,372
until they think
we're a thousand miles away...

513
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:26,866
and then we're gonna make our way to DC.

514
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:27,867
Okay?

515
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:30,845
So that's the plan?

516
00:29:30,886 --> 00:29:33,894
We take him to a city
crawling with Company and feds?

517
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:36,531
And government agents, still in power,

518
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:38,074
who've been working
from inside with your father,

519
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,086
people who can get
that pain in the ass

520
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,589
to safely tell his story, on the record.

521
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,012
And we just stroll right into
he lion's den then, huh?

522
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:46,288
Pray we don't get mauled.

523
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:48,359
I don't think
they're gonna come to Montana,

524
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:49,945
Scofield, so we're gonna go to them.

525
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:54,185
<i>No, leave her alone!</i>

526
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:55,709
<i>What do you want with her?</i>

527
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,852
<i>What I want is...</i>

528
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:58,711
<i>to date her.</i>

529
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,645
I'll make us some more popcorn.

530
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:05,708
Honey,

531
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,726
if any of us could eat any more corn,

532
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:09,990
I'd be a-maized.

533
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:11,540
See what I did there, Gracey?

534
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,493
Indian word for corn is maize

535
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:15,339
and I said "a-maized."

536
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:18,815
I don't get it. I'm corn-fused.

537
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:22,643
You are smarter than a bee sting.

538
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,473
Second female president
of these United States,

539
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,532
right here watching TV with us.

540
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:32,818
Look what I did.

541
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,327
- Honey, that's all right.
- No, I'll get a rag.

542
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:36,328
No, I can...

543
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,578
I thought we had wiped the slate clean.

544
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:48,993
Please.

545
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:52,925
I thought we had put
the past where it belonged.

546
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,545
We did.
We did put the past where it belonged...

547
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:57,002
Do not...

548
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:58,866
Do not...

549
00:30:58,872 --> 00:30:59,872
lie to me, woman.

550
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,426
After turncoatin' me to the authorities,

551
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,075
after ruin' everything we had,

552
00:31:04,076 --> 00:31:06,477
after breakin' my heart
into so many pieces

553
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,268
that I will never
be able to find them all,

554
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,648
you can at least...

555
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:13,622
do me the favor as to not stand there
and lie to my face!

556
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:14,989
Mom?

557
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:18,467
Zack,
you get your ass back on that couch.

558
00:31:20,037 --> 00:31:21,207
Get Gracey! Go!

559
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,775
I gave y'all a chance.

560
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,330
Remember that.

561
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,423
Open on 22.

562
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,806
Dude, you're crazy.

563
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,401
Is that what the other cons are saying?

564
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,402
Yeah.

565
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:18,887
- Good.
- But you took it to Banks!

566
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:21,117
I don't think
you want to be messing with him.

567
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:23,941
I'll mess with anybody
who tries to punk me out.

568
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:27,315
Hey, you know I just been..

569
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,873
- testing you.
- Yeah,

570
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:30,870
well, the test results came back.

571
00:32:31,687 --> 00:32:33,390
And top bunk's mine now.

572
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:35,331
You got a problem with that?

573
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:47,387
Hey, what's up, Stolte?

574
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:49,681
You screwed up, Brad, big-time.

575
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:51,316
No, I had a message to send,

576
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,140
and that message got delivered.

577
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,381
The guy you schlocked-- Banks--

578
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,542
he's got connections
with the guards working nights.

579
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:03,252
Word is, Banks is gonna have you
pulled out of your cell tonight.

580
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:05,616
Well, can't you do nothing?

581
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,916
Yeah, I can warn you,

582
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,229
which is what I'm doing.

583
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:11,689
Well, can't you talk to
some of the guys working nights?

584
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,511
They're working nights
'cause you put them on nights.

585
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:16,766
You should've treated the men better
when you were here.

586
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,496
They ain't gonna do you any favors.

587
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,515
I treated you right, didn't I?

588
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:22,159
Come on, Stolte.

589
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:23,873
Can't you do something?

590
00:33:24,147 --> 00:33:25,165
Please?

591
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:27,004
You did treat me right,

592
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:31,032
but there is nothing I can do now
except warn you.

593
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:32,925
Watch your back.

594
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:43,291
we can use the fire roads

595
00:33:43,342 --> 00:33:45,786
that the park rangers use
in Glacier National Park.

596
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:47,093
They don't patrol them at night.

597
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:48,640
We get up into Canada, we head east,

598
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,104
we cut down through New York.

599
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,413
The borders won't be a problem.

600
00:33:51,414 --> 00:33:53,414
No, nobody will look for us there.

601
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,827
This is...fun for you, Terrence, really?

602
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,919
No, this isn't fun.

603
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:00,968
What was fun was when Caroline and I
would talk about you,

604
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,557
and the schoolboy crush
that you had on her.

605
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,091
He proposed to her.

606
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:11,292
You actually thought that you would be
the First Husband,

607
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:12,881
the serf who would be king?

608
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,529
We laughed so hard...

609
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,702
You stood there
and watched them kill Veronica!

610
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:22,657
And you did nothing!

611
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,392
She died because of you!

612
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,192
- What I was supposed to do?!
- Shut up!

613
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,341
Burrows, he has no value to us dead.

614
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,459
He has no identity.

615
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:39,155
- You kill him, you have a John Doe.
- Put your gun down.

616
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:40,056
When he puts his down.

617
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:41,292
Linc, we're so close.

618
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,209
Was it worth it?

619
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:47,234
- Killing those people, ruining my life?
- Scofield, get a handle on your brother

620
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,543
Shut up. You're not helping.

621
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,426
Linc, you don't want to do this.

622
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,542
Trust me.

623
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,670
This isn't what you want.

624
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:55,888
You don't want to do this. Okay?

625
00:34:56,598 --> 00:34:57,598
Trust me.

626
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:16,302
So many people dead.

627
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:20,564
And he gets to live.

628
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:27,944
Hello ?

629
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:29,898
They denied bail.

630
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,129
What?

631
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,049
Judge didn't buy that it was all you.

632
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,854
Case is going into the system now.

633
00:35:34,855 --> 00:35:36,149
Aiding an escaped con.

634
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,255
She's looking at major time, man.

635
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:40,863
All right, uh...

636
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,972
I want you to tell her lawyer--

637
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,321
all right, you listen to me--
you tell her lawyer...

638
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:56,640
I love you.

639
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:00,131
Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in,
okay?

640
00:36:00,752 --> 00:36:01,990
Kacee said you need to run.

641
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:03,837
If you get busted or turn yourself in,

642
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:05,391
Dede won't have either of you.

643
00:36:05,392 --> 00:36:07,980
<i>And they'll just throw her
into foster care.</i>

644
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,650
<i>Look, man, I'm gonna hang up this phone
right now,</i>

645
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,846
'cause I feel
I might say something I regret.

646
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,188
You just take care of Dede.

647
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:33,031
You know that...my daddy wasn't
really in the picture much

648
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:34,186
when I was growing up.

649
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:38,862
So as a result, I never really learned
the art of carpentry.

650
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:42,332
But I figure, Jesus was a carpenter,

651
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:44,200
and his daddy wasn't around to teach him

652
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,090
so, I taught myself.

653
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:51,327
Over time, I got to be
a pretty good swinger of the hammer.

654
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,697
Now, the good news is,

655
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,037
unlike my papa and the Great Almighty,

656
00:36:59,188 --> 00:37:01,004
I'm here for good.

657
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,963
Don't make no mistake about it.

658
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,893
We will be a family...

659
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,399
if it kills us.

660
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,084
So sweet.

661
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,290
Car's out front.

662
00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:44,227
Let's get covered up and move out.

663
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,302
These 2 are never gonna make it
in a car together.

664
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:47,984
You'll have to keep your brother

665
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:49,366
- in check.
- You don't know him.

666
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:50,861
Then get my gun from him.

667
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:52,006
We don't have time for this.

668
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:54,564
You still think you're running the show,
don't you?

669
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:55,976
You still think I'm not?

670
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:09,392
Yes. I'd like the number for
Channel 11 News, please.

671
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:10,510
What are you doing?

672
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:11,795
This is not the plan.

673
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:12,747
Hang up.

674
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,203
Yes, connect me. I'll hold.

675
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:17,027
Scofield, you call the news,
they call the cops.

676
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,381
Yes, put me through.

677
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:20,656
Hang up.

678
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:26,311
Hang up the phone now!

679
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,370
Hang it up!

680
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,773
<i>Channel 11 News. Can I help you ?</i>

681
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:36,322
This is Michael Scofield.

682
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,599
I'm at the Cutback Motel, room 11.

683
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,069
And I want to turn myself in.

684
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:51,176
Brad... ley...

685
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,310
Brad... ley...

686
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:04,685
Warden's gone home, bitch.

687
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:07,472
Mice are gonna play.

688
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,668
Brad... ley...

689
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:24,660
If anything jumps off,
you get my back, I won't forget it.

690
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:27,305
Why don't you just forget it right now?

691
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:29,482
You're in this cell, you're top bunk.

692
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:33,361
Out there... you're on your own.

693
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:41,525
You want a piece of me,
you sons of bitches?!

694
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:42,526
Come and get me!

695
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:43,685
You hear me?!

696
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,151
I ain't scared of you!

697
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,013
I ain't scared of nothing!

698
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:04,107
Start praying.

699
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:17,546
Mr Kim...

700
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,845
I just wanted you to know

701
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:23,888
that I'm getting back to work.

702
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:27,359
<i>Good.</i>

703
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:30,854
So, I take it you got my message.

704
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:33,185
Oh, yeah.

705
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,583
Loud and clear.

706
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:50,226
Please, don't do this, please, come on.

707
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,400
I'm sorry, Terrence, it's too late.

708
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,252
The press is already on their way.

709
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:56,017
You can put the guns away now.

710
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:58,927
This goes wrong,
you guys are on your own.

711
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,829
- If I go back home, OK, let me, please.
- You can't go back home.

712
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,659
Terrence, none of us can, okay?

713
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,975
So just relax and keep your head.

714
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:14,278
I'm leaving!

715
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:21,244
- We can't let you do that, Terrence.
- Terrence, all we need is your mouth.

716
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,360
I will shoot out
both your knees right now.

717
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,605
I never liked you, Paul.

718
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:26,664
I won't hesitate to take your life!

719
00:41:30,212 --> 00:41:33,286
All right. Just...
Terrence, listen to me.

720
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:34,619
Just listen.

721
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,537
Terrence, for once in your life,
do the right thing.

722
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,079
All right?

723
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:44,671
So many people have suffered
because of this, because of you.

724
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,991
But when the press get here,
you can tell the truth.

725
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:50,045
You can end this.

726
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:53,897
Where does it end for me?

727
00:41:53,898 --> 00:41:55,746
Disgrace, life in prison?

728
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:58,204
You're already in prison, Terrence.

729
00:41:58,205 --> 00:41:59,460
How many more people have to die

730
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:01,609
so you can stay locked up
in some cabin in the woods?

731
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,610
It's over.

732
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:24,672
- Sorry.
- Terrence, no!

733
00:42:47,324 --> 00:42:48,546
All right. We have to go.

734
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:49,461
Go where?

735
00:42:49,548 --> 00:42:50,475
We got Steadman.

736
00:42:51,022 --> 00:42:52,198
No, we have nothing.

737
00:42:55,384 --> 00:42:56,854
All we got is a John Doe.

738
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,268
Michael, let's go.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
