1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,079
I'll be in London one week,
at this address.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,639
Finish your business here
and join me.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,279
"Dear Grace..."

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,919
"Before the war, when I had
an important decision to make,"

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,199
"I used to flip a coin."

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,679
"Perhaps that is what
I will do again."

7
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:41,203
<b>WwW.ZooCine.NeT
Watch Movies and Series!</b>

8
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,479
and give him peace. Amen.

9
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,879
Amen.

10
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,359
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

11
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,719
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

12
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,599
if he should pass before me.

13
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,799
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law.

14
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,759
When we were in France,
fighting for the King.

15
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,079
Amen.

16
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
And in the end it
wasn't war that took Freddie.

17
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,199
Pestilence took him.

18
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,639
Come here.

19
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,479
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

20
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,319
before he was cruelly taken.

21
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,199
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

22
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,319
you might come back to Birmingham.

23
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,039
God, do you know how funny it is

24
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,759
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

25
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,079
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

26
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,079
Do you know how unfair it is

27
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,399
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,799
So now they've made you ashamed
of us?

29
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,959
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

30
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,639
Karl's with his cousins.

31
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,879
Ada.

33
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,159
Are you coming home?

34
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,839
I'm going home.

35
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,599
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

36
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,479
That's not what I said.

37
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,919
There's another reason
we want you home.

38
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,279
We're planning an expansion.

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,279
I'm taking premises in London...

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,359
Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait.

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,799
Polly, if Ada was
weeping then I'd stop.

42
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,319
But she's not.

43
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,559
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

44
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,519
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

45
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,079
Yeah.

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,519
Well, I'm not a Shelby any more.

47
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,559
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,639
I'm free.

49
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,999
I've got to get Karl home.

50
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,999
I told you.

51
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,919
Let me do it.

52
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,559
It's all right.

53
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,799
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,159
"Till the danger passes"?

55
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,359
That'll be the bloody day.

56
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,279
Go on, move away, go on.

57
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,519
It happened at, exactly 7 a.m.

58
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,559
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

59
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,159
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

60
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,999
I'd say it was something to do
with the gas.

61
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,039
It's just been fitted.

62
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,559
Er, madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

63
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,559
Madam!

64
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,159
This is all over the place.

65
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,239
Confetti.

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,039
You can go.

67
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,319
Right.

68
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,519
Who?

69
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,479
Who did this to us?

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,439
Whiskey. Irish.

71
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,359
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

72
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,439
Gas and electric don't mix.

73
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,559
Who'd have thought they would?

74
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,119
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

75
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,799
You know something?

76
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,479
In these times of hunger
and hardship,

77
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,559
business is surprisingly good.

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,679
Which one of you is
the Peaky Blinder devil?

79
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,279
Gentlemen.

80
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,879
Finn! Get in here.

81
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,399
Finn! Hold the phone. Come here.

82
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,239
- Take the odds.
- Yeah, sure.

83
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,999
Polly.

84
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,439
Did he say who did it?

85
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,559
He's gone to the Black Lion.

86
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,719
On his own?

87
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,559
Tommy does everything on his own.

88
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,159
- Should I go to the Black Lion?
- What?

89
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,839
- Should I go there and see him?
- No.

90
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,439
Where the fuck is Arthur?

91
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,359
Protecting the Garrison's
whisky from the police.

92
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,679
For fuck's sake!

93
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,039
Polly, it feels a little bit to me
like things are getting out of hand.

94
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,599
So get 'em in hand.

95
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,559
Do you know what Ada said to me
this morning?

96
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,319
She said we all look like we work
in a factory under the ground.

97
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,639
She said we look like ghosts.

98
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,039
She'll be back.

99
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,959
When?

100
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,919
When she needs us.

101
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,599
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

102
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,359
- Six.
- Six what?

103
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,799
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

104
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,439
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

105
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,559
Why?

106
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,639
Seven.

107
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,719
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

108
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,599
or we'll find somebody else who can.

109
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,879
Thomas Shelby.

110
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,439
You blew up my pub.

111
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,279
Anger defeats fear, good.

112
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
You blew up my pub.

113
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,439
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

114
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,599
A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

115
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,159
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

116
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,759
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you?

117
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,639
I read somewhere that you Paddies

118
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,839
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

119
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,719
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

120
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,839
That's funny, don't you think?

121
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,159
A war about peace.

122
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,079
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

123
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,359
Forgive me, I get confused.

124
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

125
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,879
So stop fucking smiling.

126
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,319
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

127
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,799
You have a son at the
Cherrywood Road School in Harborne.

128
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,959
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

129
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,959
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

130
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,519
Poor boy if the race was important.

131
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,359
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

132
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,399
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

133
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,879
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

134
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,879
No.

135
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,519
He researches his enemies,

136
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,719
that's why he's been chosen.

137
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,839
I am chosen?

138
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,479
I'm chosen.

139
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,399
Can the chosen one smoke?

140
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,119
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

141
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,879
Chosen by whom?

142
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,519
By an informed consensus.

143
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,879
I have things to do.

144
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

145
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,279
what he's been chosen for.

146
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,879
From now on, Mr Shelby,

147
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,519
you shut your fucking gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

148
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,799
Fuck!

149
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,759
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

150
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,079
clear of coppers between
midnight and 4:00 tonight.

151
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,439
Right. Could I ask why?

152
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,719
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

153
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,279
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

154
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,999
That's all. You can go.

155
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,479
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

156
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,439
No charge.

157
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,119
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

158
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,639
He's, just passing through, he says.

159
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,679
Very grand these days.

160
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,439
He's head of some
secret department,

161
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,439
the Irish Desk.

162
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,959
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us?

163
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,599
I'll say good night, Tom.

164
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,359
I demand to speak
to a representative!

165
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,839
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

166
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,399
Father! Father!

167
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,519
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

168
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,119
Get the fuck off me!

169
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,039
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

170
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,439
I demand to speak to a representative
of His Majesty the King!

171
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,799
Make your peace with God.

172
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,999
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

173
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,559
- Father.
- Come on.

174
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,719
Now, wait!
Where are you going?

175
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,599
Does someone here have
business with the King?

176
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,679
Major Campbell.

177
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,159
About time.

178
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,759
I am a very busy man, Governor.

179
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,199
In seven and a half minutes,

180
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,079
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

181
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,879
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

182
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,759
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

183
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,319
No, Governor,

184
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,359
I hear no bells.

185
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,559
Since yesterday morning,

186
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,639
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

187
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,799
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

188
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,879
It's a little late
to be coming up with nonsense like that,

189
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,159
don't you think?

190
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,079
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

191
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,199
there would be a last-minute pardon,

192
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,559
which has not materialised.

193
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,599
Forgive me, Governor,

194
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,919
but what business is this of mine?

195
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,079
He says the man who hired him

196
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,719
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

197
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,079
an Ulsterman.

198
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,999
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

199
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,199
a bullet wound in his right leg.

200
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,119
No.

201
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,359
Still no bells. Governor,

202
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,279
you have a very clear remit.

203
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,439
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

204
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,839
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

205
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,879
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man

206
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,159
to the gates of hell.

207
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,199
Is that clear?

208
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,479
And if you should ever have
the desire

209
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,199
to discuss this matter
with anyone else

210
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,239
I know where you live.

211
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,959
Arthur, Tommy's
called a family meeting.

212
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,519
Arthur!

213
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,919
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

214
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,599
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

215
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,039
Arthur.

216
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,359
2,000.

217
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,679
Come on.

218
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,679
Sit down, Finn.

219
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,399
- Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
- He's on his way.

220
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,439
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

221
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,079
Whisky.

222
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
Left over from the explosion.

223
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,359
It's good stuff, as well.

224
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,119
Right.

225
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,359
Before Tommy gets here,

226
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,239
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

227
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,719
between the rest of us.

228
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,039
You think?

229
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,399
Yeah.

230
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,519
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

231
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,119
When did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

232
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,599
You have anything to say,

233
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,359
you wait for Thomas.

234
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,759
Polly's fucking right.

235
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,519
I see all the books.

236
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,439
Legal and off track.

237
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,599
Sort of stuff you don't see.

238
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,079
And in the past year

239
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,559
the Shelby Company Limited

240
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,039
has been making £150

241
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,199
a day.

242
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,959
Right? A fucking day!

243
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,599
Sometimes more.

244
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,919
So what I want to know

245
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,439
is why are we changing things?

246
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,239
Polly, look what's happened already.

247
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,199
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

248
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,039
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

249
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,479
- Who said anything about cockneys?
- Who else?

250
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,399
Do you know who did it, do you?

251
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,119
No, she doesn't know who did it.

252
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,839
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

253
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,159
Everyone's allowed to speak.

254
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,239
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

255
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,239
I speak for our household.

256
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,959
- So...
- John, this company is

257
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,439
a modern enterprise and believes in
equal rights for women.

258
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,999
On your feet, Esme.

259
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,359
I'm not a blood member
of this family

260
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,199
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm not a member

261
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,559
I can see things
in a different light.

262
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,359
So I'll get to my point.

263
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,159
That would be nice.

264
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,399
As my husband said,

265
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,199
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

266
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,279
But London...

267
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,199
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

268
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,519
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

269
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,959
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

270
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,119
And there are foreigners
of every description

271
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,519
and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

272
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,639
I have a child,

273
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,519
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

274
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,999
I want John to see him grow up.

275
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,239
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

276
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,399
and keep chickens or something.

277
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,559
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

278
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,239
Thomas?

279
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,399
That's all I have to say.

280
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,719
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

281
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,679
Wash them down with a nice drink.

282
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,679
Thank you, Esme.

283
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,199
Firstly, the bang in the pub
had nothing to do with London.

284
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,679
Understood?

285
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,799
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

286
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,759
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

287
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,759
so long as we stick together.

288
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,159
And after the first few weeks,

289
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,599
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

290
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,719
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

291
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,159
That's right.

292
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,279
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed your reservations.

293
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,679
Fair enough.

294
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,119
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

295
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,759
walk out the door...

296
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,239
Right now.

297
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,599
Go raise your chickens.

298
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,879
For those of you with ambition

299
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,839
the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

300
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,119
Tomorrow?

301
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,279
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

302
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,199
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

303
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,839
We have 18 staff.

304
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,239
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

305
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,599
I changed the combination.

306
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,879
So what's going on, Thomas?

307
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,839
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

308
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,839
Give me the combination, Polly.

309
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,279
Polly, give me the combination.

310
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,239
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

311
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,559
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

312
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,639
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

313
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,839
So why tomorrow?

314
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,759
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

315
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,119
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

316
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,479
What say you just roll up
and take the city?

317
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,199
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

318
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,879
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

319
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,879
have been at war in London
for six months.

320
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,079
It's not our war.

321
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,479
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

322
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,919
- Yeah, but we don't.
- We need a foothold

323
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,079
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

324
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,439
The Jews control Camden Town.

325
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,079
Your mother said,

326
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,599
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

327
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,399
No-one gets killed, Polly.

328
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,239
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

329
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,519
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

330
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,999
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

331
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,799
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

332
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,079
Now please, open the fucking safe.

333
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,679
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there,

334
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,879
about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

335
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
But when it comes to it,

336
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,999
you don't listen to a word we say.

337
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,199
Maybe you don't trust us.

338
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,799
She was one woman, Thomas.

339
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,919
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

340
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,599
Forgot about who?

341
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,159
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

342
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,639
Are you going to London now?

343
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,599
No, there's something
I have to do first.

344
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,119
I've got a typewriter like that.

345
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,439
I got it out of a catalogue.

346
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,479
I'm doing a correspondence course.

347
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,319
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

348
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,159
It's a test you have to do.

349
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,799
Will you come back before you go?

350
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,599
No.

351
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,519
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

352
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,879
as if we were ordinary people.

353
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,359
Yeah.

354
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,719
Let's begin.

355
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,999
Hands on the table.

356
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,799
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

357
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,159
So, let's welcome them.

358
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,999
Starting with you.

359
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,919
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

360
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,199
My husband.

361
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,959
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

362
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,519
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

363
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,559
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

364
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,719
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

365
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,839
She's an unsanctified charlatan.

366
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,039
And you?

367
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,919
Who do you seek?

368
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,799
Well, truth...

369
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,839
Sorry, truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

370
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,039
So I came here to find out.

371
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,999
Er...

372
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,199
You see, my son and my daughter

373
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,199
were taken from me
when they were very small.

374
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,119
Taken by the parish authorities

375
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,239
and I never knew
what happened to them.

376
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,319
But lately...

377
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,679
I've had a feeling.

378
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,199
Like, a feeling...

379
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,239
I can't put it into words.

380
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,399
And I keep having a dream.

381
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,599
I see a pretty girl,

382
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,319
about 18-years-old.

383
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,639
She's standing across the street

384
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,359
and she tells me
she's passed over.

385
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,999
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

386
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,039
On May 15th.

387
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,359
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

388
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,679
And she shouts and shouts.

389
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,399
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

390
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,399
because I'm her mother.

391
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,119
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

392
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,559
after they stole her from me.

393
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,159
But if she does want
to say goodbye,

394
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,119
I thought this would be the place.

395
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,159
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

396
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,319
You're gypsy?

397
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,319
The part of me that dreams is gypsy.

398
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,279
My maiden name is Shelby.

399
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,079
So,

400
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,919
perhaps you could do me first.

401
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,879
No!

402
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,879
No!

403
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,119
No!

404
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,439
No...

405
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,079
Eamonn Duggan?

406
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,639
All right, Tommy's here.

407
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,519
Hang on!

408
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,599
John!

409
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,119
I'm coming!

410
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,079
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

411
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,999
10 if I'm still sober.

412
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,439
I got it from the doctor.

413
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,719
Keeps me nice and calm.

414
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,719
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

415
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,559
to stop us fucking wanking.

416
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,239
Polly said it's good for me temper.

417
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,399
- It slows me down, Tom.
- Arthur,

418
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,159
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

419
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,199
I need you fast. Not slow?

420
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,879
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

421
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,559
I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of.

422
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,839
Right. You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

423
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,599
Nothing wrong with opinions, John.
Come on.

424
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,479
- Get in the fucking car!
- Shut up.

425
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,679
Right!

426
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,679
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

427
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,159
Sit down, you mad bastard.

428
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,159
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

429
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,039
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

430
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,199
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

431
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,399
She's one of ours.

432
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,439
Anything over a pound, tell me.

433
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,119
Polly,

434
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,639
I don't wish to pry
into your business,

435
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,959
but you should know something.

436
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,239
That woman is a trickster.

437
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,919
What woman?

438
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,079
Her sister was in
the washhouse early,

439
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,199
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

440
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,359
What woman?

441
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,159
Gypsies talk to each other.

442
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,919
What woman?

443
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,039
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

444
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,759
I'm sorry...

445
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,079
So what do you know?

446
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,079
I know they push the glass.

447
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,279
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

448
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,639
It's a trick.

449
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,239
They tell you what
you already believe.

450
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,119
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

451
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,199
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

452
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,119
And in this fucking washhouse,

453
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,159
did they tell you why I went there?

454
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,079
You tell a soul in this family,

455
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,399
and I swear I will cut you.

456
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,519
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

457
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,679
It is a matter of honour.

458
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,319
Look at this! Look.

459
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,039
I love it.

460
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,519
Your Esme was right
about one thing,

461
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,999
you can't beat the countryside.

462
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,759
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day

463
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,799
and keep chickens.

464
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,519
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

465
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,679
- For fuck's sake!
- Take this.

466
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,559
We need to bury him.

467
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,359
Who the fuck is that?

468
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,959
It's Irish business.

469
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,399
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

470
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,359
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

471
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,919
John, grab his head.

472
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,239
So, we're not really
going to London?

473
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,479
Once we bury him,

474
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,679
then the holiday begins.

475
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,919
Much obliged.

476
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,519
It's a fucking freak show.

477
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,519
What the fuck is that racket?

478
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,879
This is what they call music
these days, brother.

479
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,239
Music?

480
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,479
Oi!

481
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,999
Oi! Put it away.

482
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,559
Fuck off!

483
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,679
Fucking look at this spot?

484
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,759
It's all right, isn't it?

485
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,679
Irish whiskey, a bottle.

486
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,999
And hurry up!

487
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,599
Fucking hell,

488
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,799
I recognise a few of these lads.

489
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,959
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

490
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,399
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

491
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,799
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

492
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,999
Just the lieutenants, John.
No sign of the officers.

493
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,239
Right, let's line them up.

494
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,279
Holiday!

495
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,599
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

496
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,759
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

497
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,719
We just bought a fucking bottle.

498
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,199
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

499
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,559
Yeah, we get that a lot.

500
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,679
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

501
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,759
without prior agreement.

502
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,199
And what line would that be,
my friend?

503
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,839
They say this is provocation.

504
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,639
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

505
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,039
You're breaking the rules.

506
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,999
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

507
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,719
Peaky scum!

508
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,879
Who the fuck's next?

509
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,639
Come here!

510
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,999
Put some ice on 'em!

511
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,479
Get out.

512
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,039
Yeah?

513
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,639
Are you going to use that?

514
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,679
Didn't think so.

515
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,599
We came here
not to make enemies.

516
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,759
No.

517
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,759
We came here to make new friends!

518
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,359
Those of you who are last

519
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,999
will soon be first.

520
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,839
And those of you who are downtrodden
will rise up.

521
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,999
Yup.

522
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,399
You know where to find us.

523
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,919
I think I've lost a tooth.

524
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,799
I'll have none left at this rate!

525
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,759
Some fucking holiday this is.

526
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,999
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

527
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,559
- Here, this'll fix you.
- Give me that!

528
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,919
You, John boy? How are you?

529
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,559
- Or should I ask your fucking wife?
- Give over!

530
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,159
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

531
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,919
Fuck the chickens.

532
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,719
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

533
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,279
Let's paint the town?

534
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,719
Come.

535
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,759
- Dear God!
- Good Lord, I assumed

536
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,719
it was Betty with tea.

537
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,719
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

538
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,159
No, because she takes lunch,
like normal people.

539
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,559
And you can turn around,

540
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,279
this lady is
a professional life model.

541
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,079
She does this for a living.

542
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,119
I... I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

543
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,319
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the House. Just, erm,

544
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,559
keep your back turned,
if you must.

545
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,119
Yes, sir.

546
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,079
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

547
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,359
Well, I... I...
I play cards on occasion.

548
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,999
You're a stranger to cocaine and
exotic dancing, too, I would imagine.

549
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,399
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

550
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,439
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

551
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,959
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

552
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,119
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

553
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,639
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

554
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,519
I'm horrible at faces.

555
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,719
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for...

556
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,999
The bigger task.

557
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,399
Expressions elude me,
I think too much.

558
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,759
Sir?

559
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,879
I need your authority

560
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,879
to proceed with all urgency

561
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,639
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

562
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,399
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

563
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,759
Yes, sir.

564
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,239
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

565
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,439
Well, to apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

566
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,119
you have to know his weaknesses

567
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,799
and I know this man's
weaknesses intimately.

568
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,079
And after "mission accomplished",

569
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,759
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

570
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,199
Absolutely not, sir.

571
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,919
So when he's served his purpose,

572
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,759
he will be consigned to history

573
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,039
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

574
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,559
You mean at the end of a rope?

575
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,879
Well, the end of the rope has
been this man's destiny

576
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,879
since the night he was born.

577
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,119
You're early.

578
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,079
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

579
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,879
What?

580
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,079
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

581
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,159
Good. Now, come with me.

582
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,879
No, shut your eyes!

583
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,599
This way.

584
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,359
What are you doing, Tom?

585
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,599
You've got to sit down
here. Right.

586
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,719
Sit down. Now, okay...

587
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,879
- Type this.
- Why?

588
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,519
Lizzie, type this.

589
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,199
"If wi..."
Put your cigarette out.

590
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,279
Right. "If winter comes..."

591
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,639
"then can spring be far behind?"

592
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,079
Why?
Did you say spring?

593
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,119
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

594
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,159
Let's see.

595
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,639
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

596
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,159
Put in the question mark.

597
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,839
Now type this.

598
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,359
"Wanted, secretary
for expanding business."

599
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,719
Slow down!

600
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,839
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch type."

601
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,279
"Five days a week."

602
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,199
"Eight pounds
and four shillings a month."

603
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,639
"Must be able to start immediately."

604
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,279
Are you serious?

605
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,919
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

606
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,119
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

607
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,639
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

608
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,439
All of it this time.

609
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,719
No exceptions.

610
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,799
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

611
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,079
Don't be late.

612
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,719
Newmarket was profitable.

613
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,879
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

614
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,399
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

615
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,679
he said you poured it away.

616
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,359
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

617
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,239
That's how it works
in London, isn't it?

618
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,959
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

619
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,319
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

620
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,439
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

621
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,679
- Stop fucking fighting me!
- Somebody has to.

622
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,399
That arrived an hour ago.

623
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,199
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

624
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,319
I was going to burn it.

625
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,799
I should have.

626
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,159
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

627
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,559
Now you're at war with Sabini.

628
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,519
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

629
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,239
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

630
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,159
She goes mad if I'm late!

631
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,759
- Ada Shelby?
- No.

632
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,759
Your brother broke the rules.

633
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,119
I don't have a fucking brother.

634
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,679
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

635
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,479
- Let's go for a drive.
- No!

636
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,519
- Hold her steady, boys.
- Don't! Get off!

637
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,999
Fucking hold him!

638
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,759
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

639
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,159
I was at the races.

640
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,959
Sabini.

641
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,879
Don't say my name.

642
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,359
Jesus!

643
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,959
Franco,

644
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,639
take my name out of his mouth.

645
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,319
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

646
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,719
Pay for the petrol.

647
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,359
You see how much I know about you?

648
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,039
I even know what's in
your fucking mouth.

649
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,719
Look at me.
Look at me!

650
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,919
Look at me.

651
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,279
You take up with the Jews.

652
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,839
Yeah, you think that's
what London's all about.

653
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,319
You can just come down,
pick a side.

654
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,639
You fucking clown!

655
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,159
Now your life is over.

656
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,719
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

657
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,359
Your mistake.

658
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,839
You remember that
when you get to hell.

659
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,839
Finish him off.

660
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,119
You! Get back here!

661
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,959
I suppose we should
see if the bastard's still alive.
