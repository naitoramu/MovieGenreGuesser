What are you doing?

3
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:04,830
I'm trying to remember
those blueprints--

4
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:07,222
what we lost
to the burn.

5
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:09,656
Without them, we'll never be
able to navigate those pipes

6
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:10,855
beneath Psych Ward.

7
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:12,756
<i>But I need to know</i>

8
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:15,022
where you got that burn
right now.

9
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:17,222
Otherwise, your ass
is going to solitary.

10
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,722
I put my blood into this.

11
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:21,055
Why don't you
elaborate on that?

12
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,122
How about you stop
with all the questions?

13
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:26,821
You are a glorified
bodyguard, that's it.

14
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,821
Okay, I got it.

15
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:32,222
Put it down.
You're not a killer.

16
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,255
Get out of the way.
( <i>retches</i> )

17
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:37,555
You know, maybe they give
you those things for a reason.

18
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:41,255
Yeah, to keep me in their
invisible freakin' handcuffs.

19
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:42,188
Hello, roomie.

20
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,855
You were right
about my tattoo.

21
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,855
<i>It is a path.</i>
<i>And I need you</i>

22
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,155
to remember
when you saw it.

23
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,921
Who are you?

24
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,656
Scofield.

25
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,422
Michael Scofield.

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,322
Doesn't ring a bell.

27
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:03,355
We met a while ago
in Gen Pop. Cell 40.

28
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:05,055
Gen Pop?

29
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:06,821
General Population.

30
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:09,921
Officer Bellick assigned
you to my cell.

31
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:14,756
I have a tattoo,
you drew it.

32
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:21,289
Haywire, do I look
even vaguely familiar to you?

33
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:33,022
Are you the guy
who stole my toothpaste?

34
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,888
Yes, yes.

35
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,155
( <i>chuckles</i> )

36
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:38,289
I stole your toothpaste.

37
00:01:38,355 --> 00:01:40,222
So you do remember.

38
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,489
NURSE:
Candy man.

39
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:43,622
Mr. Patoshik.

40
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:49,555
Mr. Scofield.

41
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:52,088
No, thank you.

42
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,888
NURSE:
Medication is mandatory.

43
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,656
Just a mild sedative prescribed
by Dr. Tancredi. Come on.

44
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,589
MICHAEL:
Then I'll talk
to her directly.

45
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:00,821
I'm feeling better.

46
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,155
Oh, really?
That's great.

47
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,222
Now take the pill.

48
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,422
Take 'em.

49
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:05,622
They're good.

50
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,756
I'm fine. Thank you.

51
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:12,322
Carter, can you come here
a sec?!

52
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,888
Scofield went J-Cat?

53
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,589
Sure did.
I saw it coming, too.

54
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:18,855
I knew he was going
to crack first time
I saw him.

55
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,255
So he's not coming
back here.

56
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,255
Doubt it.

57
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:23,155
They got him
in the whack shack.

58
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,289
What about Sucre?

59
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,055
He's in Ad Seg. Why?

60
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:27,489
Middle cell,
middle tier,

61
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,921
prime piece
of real estate.

62
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:31,188
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

63
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:32,888
Maybe.

64
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,389
We promise to keep
it a single for a
couple of months,

65
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,988
auction it off.

66
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:39,522
Make it happen.

67
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:46,821
I don't need medication.

68
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:50,489
Swallow it, or it's going
in the rear door.

69
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:57,988
All gone?

70
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:02,656
Nice.

71
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,222
You were right,
Haywire.

72
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,088
I did steal your toothpaste,

73
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,756
and you drew that tattoo
from memory,

74
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,022
and I need you to do it again.

75
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:42,122
Middle cell, cool in the summer,
warm in the winter.

76
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,022
How much you asking?

77
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:46,988
How much you got?

78
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:48,088
$200.

79
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:50,222
Got a deal?

80
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:51,355
Deal.

81
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,722
Now get your ass
out of here

82
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:54,222
and I'll put in
the transfer.

83
00:03:56,122 --> 00:04:00,188
Hey, man,
the toilet's leaking.

84
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:04,622
Look, it's dripping.

85
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,355
I'll put in
a work order.

86
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:07,589
It'll be replaced in 24 hours.

87
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:10,122
You got it, boss.

88
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,022
I heard you was
moving some real estate.

89
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,355
Already been moved.

90
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:18,988
That Scofield's cell?

91
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:20,055
Not anymore.

92
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:21,955
Close up 40!

93
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:02,808
Is that your daughter?

94
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:07,309
My wife game me this
when she was born.

95
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,275
Outliving your wife
is bad enough.

96
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:19,275
Outliving your daughter--

97
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:22,475
no man should have
to endure that.

98
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:27,175
How long does she have?

99
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:31,175
Hospital says a week,
maybe two.

( <i>hushed</i> ):
We got us a problem.

102
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,542
Mojo's moving in
Scofield's cell,

103
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,142
and that ain't all.

104
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,776
He's bitching about the toilet,

105
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,642
so Geary's putting in
a work order.

106
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,175
They move that toilet...

107
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:46,208
They find the hole.

108
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:47,875
We are all screwed.

109
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,309
How much Mojo
promise him?

110
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,676
$200.

111
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:54,042
Oh, Gomer, see,
you had me scared
there for a second.

112
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,208
I hear you got a cell.

113
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,042
Not anymore.

114
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:06,208
And if you were smart,
you'd keep quiet about that.

115
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,142
Hey, look, I'll double
what you're getting.

116
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,075
I'm getting $250.

117
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,808
$500? Ain't a problem.

118
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,142
I ain't talking
cigarettes

and extra chow line
desserts here.

I'm talking green paper
with dead white guys on it.

I said it ain't
a problem.

It's a surprise.

Oh, yeah.

Right there.
I don't.

132
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,875

"Invisible handcuffs."

140
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:31,275
Handcuffs on your mind.

141
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:34,642
You hate them,
remember?

142
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:46,676
You got a phone call.

143
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:47,808
Who is it?

144
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,575
Your son.
It's an emergency.

145
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:55,008
Oh, L.J., what were you
thinking, kid?

146
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,309
I don't care what happens
to me anymore, okay?

147
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,509
<i>They won. They'll always win.</i>

148
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:01,542
I just wanted to take one
of them down with me.

149
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:04,676
Put Veronica back on.

150
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,342
Lincoln?

151
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,342
What are the charges?

152
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,808
Attempted murder.

153
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,908
He's also being arraigned
for the murder of his mother

154
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,642
and his stepfather.

155
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,208
I guess bail's out
of the question?

156
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:20,875
Exactly.

157
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:22,808
Anything you can do?

158
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,008
Right now, his only shot

159
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:25,676
is if we can get him tried
as a minor.

160
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:28,309
But he needs to show
some remorse.

161
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,676
I need to sell to the court
that he was just a scared kid.

162
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:33,208
Where his head's at right now,
he won't listen to me.

163
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,975
He'll listen to me.
I need to see him.

164

Lincoln, there's no way.

165
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:37,642
He gets tried as an adult,

166
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,676
he may as well sit in my lap

00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:42,242
You got to do something,
Veronica.

168
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,008
Okay, I'll petition the D.O.C,
but it's a million-to-one shot

169
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,442
they'll let you out to see him.

170
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,042
All right.

171
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,575
Yo, Trumpets.

172
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,142
Yo, I got to round up
all outstanding debts

173
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,609
that are due ASAP,
all right?

174
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:02,709
Do it right now?

175
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,609
Like yesterday,
all right?

176
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:05,742
I'll put it
out there.

177
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:06,941
Good.

178
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:16,309

Are you insane?

181
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,875
You are done, bodyguard.

182
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:41,742
Lincoln's son,
a 16-year-old pothead,

183
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,609
managed to track you down
and shoot you.

184
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:46,776
You are now a witness
in his criminal investigation.

185
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:48,142
I can still
do my job.

186
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,841
You are not to make
a move on Burrows

187
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,342
under any circumstance.

188
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:52,975
We make that call.

189
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,208
You know what, Trixie?

190
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:58,875
There are actually higher
agendas here.

191
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:03,042
Yes, there are,
and they don't belong to you.

00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:06,142
Paul Kellerman no longer works
for the Secret Service.

193
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,475
You're just good ol'
Owen Kravecki from now on.

194
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:12,841
Have I made myself clear?

195
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:16,742
( <i>fingers snapping</i> )

00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:18,642

I need you to focus.

00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,642
I need you to remember
what you drew.

Haywire.

Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

204
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,676
There we go.

205
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:50,309
HAYWIRE ( <i>whispers</i> ):
It's a path.

206
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,442
MICHAEL:
Yes.

207
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,008
It is a path.

208
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,742
Let's go.

209
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:15,442
So, what's up, man?

210
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,075
Here's the thing.

211
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,008
You got nothing coming.

212
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:21,275
All your outstanding markers,
they're mine now.

213
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,542
Is that so?
You got a problem with it,

214
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:25,542
go cry to your new crew--

215
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,642
T-Bag and the white boys.

216
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,642
Oh...

217
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,142
'Kay, so that's what
this is all about.

218
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,342
This is about staying true
to your own.

219
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,908
C-NOTE:
Well, you know what, man?

220
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,042
I can have tea with

221
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:40,875
the Grand Wizard of
the KKK if I want,

222
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:42,509
and I still get my money.

223
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:43,841
You got that, little boy?

224
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:46,309
No. We don't got that.

225
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,575
Now, out of respect
for what you once were,

226
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,442
I'm gonna let you walk away.

227
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,046
you were right

228
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:05,046
The pills don't let me
see the pathway.

229
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:17,380
That's a pathway to hell.

230
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,380
No, it's not.

231
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,313
It's just the opposite.

232
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:37,913
I remember.

233
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:50,347
Whoo! Looks like the
Bank of Africa wasn't
allowing any withdrawals.

234
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,413
Look, we are gonna have to find
another way to get that money,

235
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,580
okay?
Well, then I reckon
it ain't too much

236
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,614
of a problem for our friend here
to rummage up, ain't that so,

237
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,646

238
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,646

240
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,946
there's no
visitation today.

241
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:07,980
Which means that none
of us can get any money
from the outside world.

242
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:09,514
( <i>frustrated sigh</i> )

243
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,280
I guess that only leaves us
with one real option.

244
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:16,080
The Kitchen Game.
C-NOTE:
Gambling?

245
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,280
That's your solution?

246
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,614
Uh-huh. Son, trust me.

247
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,480
When I play cards,
it ain't gambling.

248
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,046
There's maybe five people

249
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:28,614
in this country that can do
what I do with a deck of cards.

250
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,113
So why are you just
bringing this up now?

251
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,980
'Cause if Jesus over
there catches you

the Kitchen Game,

253
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,679
well, let's just say
there are lots of knives handy.

254
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,547
Of course, you need 50
bucks just for the sit-in,

255
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,380
and since we don't
have any money,

256
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,779
I'd say we're
in a catch-double-deuce.

257
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,080
You sit right here.

258
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,679
All right.

259
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:56,913
Take this.

260
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,213
And this.

261
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,514
Oh, no...

262
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,313
It's gone.
That's why I need you
to fix it.

263
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,080
That's why I need
you to remember what
was there before.

264
00:15:20,147 --> 00:15:21,347
Oh, this is bad.

( <i>whispers</i> ):
You can't break a path.

266
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,779
Then it doesn't lead anywhere.

267
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:25,980
That's right.

268
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,846
That's why I need you
to remember

269
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:30,447
what was there
before it was broken.

( <i>quietly</i> ):
I remember.

271
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,480
I remember the demons.

00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:36,880
Wait, maybe they were pilgrims.

273
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,913
They were pointing the way,
they were saying,

274
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,946
"This is the way,
this is the way."

( <i>exhaling</i> )

00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:44,080
I can't see it.

277
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:46,480
I can see it,
but I-I can't see it.

278
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,980

I need you to give
Sucre a message.

Tell him I'm okay,
and that I'm trying
to fill in the blanks.

He'll know what
that means.

You're trying
to fill in the blanks?

Just do it. Please.

What the hell am I gonna do now?

You've been down on 13
as long as I can remember.

00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:38,013
Why the sudden interest
in moving?

Second-story units
like this don't come
on the market too much.

00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:44,213
I figure since
I'm getting on in age,

290
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,413
maybe it's time
I retired in comfort.

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Open on 40.

292
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:53,213

Quit kicking the tires
and make a decision.

296
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:15,679
I'll give you

297
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:17,147
100 bucks for her.

298
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:18,614
You wasted my time.

Get the hell
out of here.
Sorry, boss.

300
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,846
I thought it was a good bid.

That's your buy-in.

306
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:54,080
The rest is up to you.

for the card game.

T-BAG:
Unfortunately, you and I

00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,380
are gonna have to be partners

313
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,213
in this endeavor.
Oh, hell, no.

314
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,113
I don't play cards;
I'm a dice man.

315
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,046
Look, all you need
to know is this:

316
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:20,514
every time I deal,

317
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,746
you bet big and never fold.

318
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:25,679
See, if I'm winning every time
I deal, I end up

319
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:28,046
with a Colombian necktie,
you know what I'm saying?

320
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:30,013
But if you're the one

321
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,113
raking in all the cash,
well, I seriously doubt

322
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,080
anyone would ever think
you and I are working together.

323
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,080
Excuse me.

324
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:49,013
I've been all over town--
I can't find a charger for this.

325
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,946
Well, let me check.
Thanks.

326

How you doing, Savrinn?

327
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,547
Where's your girl?

328
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,813
She's doing her
job, all right?

329
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,247
Filing a petition
down at the courts.

330
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,913
She'll... she'll be at my
place in about an hour.

331
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,080
See, that was easy.

332
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:21,779
I shouldn't have
to chase you down
to get that information.

333
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:23,779
Why don't you just
take a step back?

334
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:27,080
Why don't you remember
who you're talking to,

335
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,980
who I work for?

336
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,880
You need to keep an eye
on Veronica Donovan.

337
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:36,480
Not some of the time;
all of the time.

338
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:38,880
'Cause pretty soon,
we're gonna call in our favor,

339
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:42,113
unless you want
to go back on our deal.

340
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,779
No.

341
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,580
Good.

342
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,614
Be in touch.

343
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:00,946
Haywire.

344
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,779
Haywire...

345
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:08,913
did you take your meds?

346
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,514
Come on.

347
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,679
You got something
in your teeth again.

348
00:20:17,514 --> 00:20:19,113
You should be careful

349
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,413
when you tell people
to remember things, Michael.

350
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Because I remember
everything now.

351
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,846
I remember
how you set me up!

352
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:32,013
How you smashed
your own head...

353
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,480
and had me sent back here.

354
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:36,813
I also...

355
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,846
remember this.

356
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:44,646
The pathway.

357
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,746
Your map.

358
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,347
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Your escape.

359
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:50,247
Give me that.

360
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,180
Don't. Don't.

361
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:57,347
Now, do I tear this up...

362
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:01,447
...or do you tell me
exactly where and when

363
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:02,580
you're doing this?

364
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:11,904
It starts in the basement.

365
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,138
Okay.

366
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:17,004
This line leads
from a hatch in the coal room

367
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:18,971
to this pipe
system here.

368
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:21,037
And that runs to
the infirmary.

369
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:22,804
That's how we'll get out.

370
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,604
I just need to get out of
Psych Ward to set things up.

371
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,204
Three days after I'm gone,

372
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,737
I'll come back up
through the basement

373
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:30,971
and get you out.

374
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:32,771
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

375
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:33,704
No, I'm not.

376
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:37,437
I need you to let me
get us out of here.

377
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:40,270
I need you to trust me.

378
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,804
If you try to screw me over
again, I'll kill you.

379
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,138
Hey.

380
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:08,504
Hey. How did it go?

381
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,337
Filing the petition was easy.

382
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:13,171
Getting it approved,
that's a whole 'nother story.

383
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,937
You found the charger?

384
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,504
Oh, yeah.

385
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,670
Why didn't you
plug it in?

386
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:26,270
I was just, uh...
just thinking for a minute.

387
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:27,804
About what?

388
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,370
Nothing.

389
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:35,437
We're in business.

390
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:36,804
What is it?

391
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,904
His entire phone book
is still in here-- 322 numbers.

392
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:17,238
No open seats. Gotta wait.

393
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:21,270
C-Note,
crap or get off the pot.

394
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:22,837
I'm thinking.

395
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,171
We ain't betting
on CPT here, man.

396
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,804
Either you going to see his bet

397
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,971
or you can go outside
and Million Con March

398
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,504
or whatever your people do.

399
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,204
Either way, get on with it, son.

400
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,437
I'm in.

401
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:42,604
Three bitches,

402
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,004
bitches.

403
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:46,604
What you holding?

404
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,204
You tell me.

405
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:55,537
Full house.

406
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,670
Full house?

407
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,704
That's a concept
a Mexican should

408
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,771
be quite familiar with,
eh, Jesus?

409
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,737
She said what?

410
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:09,270
She said,
in unequivocal terms,

411
00:24:09,337 --> 00:24:11,303
that I was not to
move on Burrows.

412
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,104
Whatever their agenda
is with Burrows,

413
00:24:13,171 --> 00:24:15,604
it is not
the same as ours.

414
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,171
This whole business
with his father--

415
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,737
it interferes with
the one thing

416
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,403
that we set out to do
in the first place--

417
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,104
put Lincoln Burrows
in the ground.

418
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,637
If he lives,
you're the one

419
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:27,570
that stands to lose,
not the company.

420
00:24:27,637 --> 00:24:29,071
They get themselves
another candidate,

421
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:31,171
and you're the one that
suffers the brunt of it.

422
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:35,437
Then maybe it's time
we broke ranks.

423
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:36,937
We do that, they'd

424
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:39,238
pull support for the campaign.
You know that, don't you?

425
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:44,270
That is... if they know, Paul.

426
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,138
( <i>sniffs</i> )
Mmm! Smell that kitty.

427
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:52,071
Jacks or better,

428
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:55,138
trips to win.

429
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:03,504
Last hand. I'm tired
of losing all my money today.

430
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,138
How much you up?

431
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:09,403
I don't know. $300.

432
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,537
Does it hurt?

433
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:11,537
What?

434
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:12,837
The horseshoe up your ass.

435
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:16,004
Rather be lucky
than good, Ping-Pong.

436
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:24,171
Misdeal.

437
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:25,437
Bury the card.

438
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,604
Man, I don't care
if y'all saw my card.

439
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,238
Yeah, I bet you don't.

440
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,004
Bury the card, young blood.

441
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:34,037
Hey, chill, Wrinkles.

442
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:35,470
Ain't my fault Saltine here

443
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:36,570
got a sloppy deal.

444
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:38,303
Aw, that there
was just uncalled for.

445
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,737
Now, all right. You know what?

446
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,837
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to deal another hand,

447
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:42,537
you gonna be such a baby
about it.

448
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:48,238
On a misdeal, you bury the card,

449
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:49,737
finish out the hand.

450
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:52,437
House rules.

451
00:26:26,737 --> 00:26:28,204
Warden.

452
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,937
I have some good
news for you, Linc.

453
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:33,537
Somehow, your lawyer's
petition went through.

454
00:26:33,604 --> 00:26:35,904
The Department
of Corrections

455
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,904
is allowing you a one-
hour visit with your son.

456
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:43,737
I've never seen one of these
granted before... ever.

457
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:46,837
Good lawyers.

458
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:48,337
No lawyer's that good.

459
00:26:48,403 --> 00:26:50,071
I'll make the
travel arrangements,

460
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:52,570
but this is not going to
be a ride in the country.

461
00:26:52,637 --> 00:26:54,771
You're gonna be Y-cuffed,
and the men are gonna
be heavily armed.

462
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:56,238
I don't want any problems.

463
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:59,071
There won't be;
I just want to see my son.

464
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:18,771
I'll bet all I got.

465
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,871
$82.

466
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:28,470
You better have some aces
shoved up there

467
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:31,004
with that horseshoe,
or that pot's mine.

468
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,104
You in or out?!

469
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:05,470
I'm in.

470
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:11,337
And I raise you $74.

471
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:15,604
I said I only got $82 left.

472
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,570
Then I guess you're out of luck.

473
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:18,937
You never heard of
a gentleman's game?

474
00:28:19,004 --> 00:28:20,403
Yes, I have, but this ain't it.

475
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:23,337
You want to borrow some money?

476
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,071
Ask your boys.

477
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:27,104
But I'm in here
to make money, bro.

478
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:28,937
You want welfare,

479
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:31,937
you'd better vote Democrat.

480
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:47,403
If you know
what's good for you,

481
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,737
you'll stay away from me
in the yard.

482
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:58,004
( <i>sighs</i> )

483
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,138
You think you're smarter
than me?

484
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,837
( <i>alarm ringing</i> )
No! No! No, no, no!

485
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,171
( <i>indistinct shouting</i>
<i>in distance</i> )

486
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,704
There's a pathway--
no, there's a pathway!

487
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:36,804
There's a pathway!

488
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,138
He's trying to escape!

00:29:38,204 --> 00:29:40,971
He's trying to escape--
this is his map!

490
00:29:41,037 --> 00:29:42,071
He set me up!

491
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:44,037
Zap him!

492
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:45,971
( <i>electricity surging</i> )

493
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:51,037
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

494
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:00,570
There he is.

495
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:10,303
Hey boss, I think you
dropped something, man.

496
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:13,837
That's half a Gino.

497
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:15,804
So when do I move in?
You don't.

498
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:17,071
What?

499
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,071
Come on, chief,
now, we had a deal.

500
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:21,670
Renegotiation:
the price is $700 now.

501
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,470
That ain't right.

502
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:26,270
I just gave you $500.

503
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:28,037
What you gave me
was a down payment.

504
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:29,971
If you can't come up
with the rest, well...

505
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,670
No, no, no, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait.

506
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:32,804
Hold on.

507
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:34,537
One minute, all right?

508
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,737
Man, he's trying
to shake us down.

509
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,971
I'm gonna need that watch.

510
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:43,971
Not an option.

511
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:45,971
Look, would you rather
be looking at a picture

512
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:48,670
of your daughter or
holding her in your arms

513
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:50,238
once you get outside?

514
00:30:56,937 --> 00:30:59,104
( <i>metal jingling</i> )

515
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,437
Look, man, Father Time
owed me a few bones.

516
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:16,804
He gave me this in trade.

517
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:19,804
That should be more
than enough to cover it.

518
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:21,403
Eh, not bad.

519
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,470
Your problem is somebody already
gave me $700 for the cell,

520
00:31:25,537 --> 00:31:26,837
so you're S.O.L.

521
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:29,303
No! Hey, whoa, whoa!

522
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,670
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

523
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:32,904
So you're just gonna
take my money and walk?

524
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:36,004
Yeah, well,
write your congressman.

525
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:54,102
Hey.
Hi.

526
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:55,835
They said you wanted
to talk to me.

527
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:57,869
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:00,236
Okay.

529
00:32:00,303 --> 00:32:02,002
( <i>whispers</i> ):
Okay.

530
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,203
Please.

531
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,603
Thanks.

532
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,536
Okay.

533
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:12,735
I made you something.

534
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:21,069
It's an ashtray.

535
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:23,002
Um...
I don't smoke.

536
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:26,835
Yeah, I know. But, uh, they only
let us make these and jewelry,

537
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:29,902
and I didn't figure you for
the macaroni necklace type.

538
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:32,802
It's very sweet. Uh...

539
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,236
How about we talk about how
you're doing?

540
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:38,236
Hmm...

541
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,835
I think we both know
I don't belong here.

542
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:45,835
I don't remember much
about that night, but
being locked up in Ad Seg,

543
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:47,503
something must've snapped.

544
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,436
What I'm trying to say is,

545
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,036
I think I've had enough
of arts and crafts.

546
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:56,336
( <i>giggles</i> )
But that's your call.

547
00:32:56,403 --> 00:32:59,069
And the doctors here do say that
you've been acting fine.

548
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,702
The problem is that
if you don't tell the
Pope who burned you,

549
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:03,536
he's gonna lock you back up
in Ad Seg.

550
00:33:03,603 --> 00:33:07,203
And after a couple days of that,
you're gonna be right back here.

551
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,403
Michael, I hate
what happened to you,

552
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,969
and I hate that you're here.

553
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,303
But you have got
to let me help you.

554
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:23,802
If you want to get out of Psych
Ward, and stay out,

555
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,536
you've got to tell the Pope
the truth about that burn.

556
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:33,036
Out with the old,
in with the new, cons.

557
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:44,902
I got a message
from your cellie, bro.

558
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,503
He says he's okay

559
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,369
and he's trying to
fill in the blanks.

560
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:51,303
Did he say he's trying,
or that he already got
the blanks filled in?

561
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,802
Yo, man, I don't know.
I didn't write it down.

562
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:56,936
Okay. Now you gotta tell him
that I filled in the hole.

563
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,702
Yeah, yeah,
I'm done with

564
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:00,636
your little secrets
and messages, bro.

565
00:34:00,702 --> 00:34:02,636
I saw Scofield's back.

566
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:05,902
He's got a burn in the
same spot as the burn
in that guard's shirt.

567
00:34:05,969 --> 00:34:07,570
I don't know
what you're doing

568
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:10,702
but I have an idea, huh?
And I'm through helping you

569
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:12,336
until you tell me
what's going on.

570
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,835
I can't, bro.

571
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:17,769
Then good luck
in the hole, <i>jefe.</i>

572
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:19,835
No, no, no, no, no!
Wait, wait.

573
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:21,902
LINCOLN:
Manche.
Who's that?

574
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,002
That's Linc, bro.

575
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:25,536
Linc the Sink?

576
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:26,936
Yeah.
LINCOLN:
Come here.

577
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,169
I think we can work
something out.

578
00:34:41,236 --> 00:34:45,503
All I can say is, before I get
out of here, Geary will pay.

579
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,969
Believe that.

580
00:34:47,036 --> 00:34:48,802
No one's getting outta here

581
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:51,503
if Maintenance goes to replacing
Scofield's toilet.

582
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,536
I got a way
to help you with

583
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:54,769
your Scofield problem.

584
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,203
What'd you say, Slim?

585
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,269
I said I got a way
to help you with...

586
00:34:59,336 --> 00:35:01,069
Who the hell said
we had a problem?

587
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:03,002
It's cool, man.
Relax.

588
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:04,702
Lincoln and Sucre told me
everything.

589
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,769
What in the hell
did they tell you?

590
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:08,702
Exactly what did they tell you?

591
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:11,236
MANCHE:
Everything. They said
I can come with you,

592
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:13,102
you know, on early parole,

593
00:35:13,169 --> 00:35:15,069
if I can help get the Fish
outta Psych.

594
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:18,303
What're we, the A-Train?

595
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,436
Everyone gets to ride with us?

596
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,802
Why don't you take a walk,
before I give you a smack?

597
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:30,636
You got another solution
to our situation?

598
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,203
I didn't think so.

599
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,969
Me and my cuz and Lincoln...

600
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:44,069
came up with something.

601
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:45,636
Now, it can work...

602
00:35:45,702 --> 00:35:47,436
but it's risky.

603
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,503
( <i>whispers</i> ):

( <i>wheels squeaking</i> )

605
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,802
Assure me I'll be protected.

606
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:15,969
Michael, you know
me well enough by now.

607
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:18,069
Such assurances
are not necessary.

608
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:21,036
With all due respect, Warden,
if I had been protected

609
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:23,369
in the first place, none of this
would have happened.

610
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:34,102
A name.

611
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:36,636
Geary.

612
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,636
Geary?

613
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:40,902
He shakes cons down for money,

614
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,702
anything he can get
his hands on.

615
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:45,936
He knew I went to college,
so he must've...

616
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,102
he must've thought I was rich
or something.

617
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:52,136
Anyway, when, uh...
when I couldn't pay up,

618
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:55,102
he held me down with one arm,
and burned me

619
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:58,269
with the other.

620
00:37:58,336 --> 00:38:02,102
I don't know
what he used, but...

621
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:05,236
it was hot as hell.

622
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:13,036
What a surprise.
Disconnected.

623

covering all 50 states...

London, Martinique,
Jakarta, Dakar...

625
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:21,469
All the numbers out of service.

626
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:22,835
As soon as Quinn
disappeared,

627
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:24,969
they must've erased
the paper trail within days.

628
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,670
Is there anything
they can't do?

( <i>sighs</i> )

630
00:38:28,403 --> 00:38:31,236
My P.I. buddy in DC.

631
00:38:31,303 --> 00:38:33,236
What if I send him
all this, see if

632
00:38:33,303 --> 00:38:35,203
he can make a connection
between the numbers?

633
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:36,802
I'll tell him I need it ASAP.

634
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:38,336
Thank you.

635
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,670
It's no big deal.

636
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,203
I'll just overnight him
all this stuff.

637
00:38:44,436 --> 00:38:46,570
No.
For everything.

638
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:48,536
For hanging in there,
keeping me going.

gets a raise.

643

You suck at your job.

644
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:02,670
You should ask

to our little clubhouse?

647
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,969
Hey, what gives?

648
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:41,636
Hey, that was a gift
from my old man.

649
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:46,002
Since when is your name Charles
and your Dad's name Ann?

650
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:22,069
This is a railroad.

651
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:23,469
I didn't do nothing!

652
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:25,369
Don't look at me
like I'm some con.

653
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:27,469
You're as crooked as scoliosis.

654
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,670
( <i>whispers</i> ):
I don't get caught.

655
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:06,769
When we get there,

656
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:09,603
I'll take you out of the Y-cuffs
and put you in a four-piece.

657
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,769
Got it?

658
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,236
Got it, boss.

659
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,603
You play nice,
I play nice.

660
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,269
Understand?

661
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:18,303
Got it.

662
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,802
She's here.
I've got her.

663
00:41:50,936 --> 00:41:55,869
POPE:
Scofield.
For readmittance to Gen Pop.

664
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:59,735
Welcome home.

665
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:01,969
Thanks.

666
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:05,069
I never thought I'd be so glad
to be back in my cell.

667
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:06,369
( <i>chuckling</i> )

668
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,969
Um... Pope...

669
00:42:12,036 --> 00:42:15,670
wanted me to
give you this.

670
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:51,735
TRANSPORT GUARD:
What the hell are
you staring at, anyway?

671
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,570
Everything.
