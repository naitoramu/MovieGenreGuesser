1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,665
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:05,325
Give me the number for
a Sundown Hotel, please?

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,626
Got one in Gila, New Mexico.

4
00:00:08,272 --> 00:00:12,791
Tomorrow. Who is this?

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,385
I think you already know.

6
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,509
But if I buried someone
in my own backyard,

7
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,101
I'd think about
it all the time.

8
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:20,951
Let me and my family
disappear and in return,

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,759
I'll keep your little secret.

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,670
I know it's not how you
wanted this to play out.

11
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,770
Sometimes things happen
that are just...

12
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,228
out of your control.

13
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:29,754
I'll see you soon, Michael.

14
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,551
It just may be sooner
than you think.

15
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:32,483
You can't be here!

16
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,261
Where's your sister?
I need to see Maricruz.

17
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,463
The wedding's at 2:30.

18
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:38,563
Maricruz, she told him,
"No." Can you believe that?

19
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,393
Go on, get your girl.

20
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:44,603
LJ!

21
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,122
- Both of you face down, now!
- Please...

22
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:54,983
Suspect in custody.
Possible I.D.: Lincoln Burrows.

23
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:03,991
You're going to tell me

24
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:06,342
where you stashed
Westmoreland's money

25
00:01:06,486 --> 00:01:08,540
or I'm gonna pluck
you like a chicken,

26
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,393
stitch-by-stitch.

27
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:44,182
For a millionaire,
you travel light.

28
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:48,451
Hey. Hey! What is this?

29
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,162
It's for my blood pressure.

30
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:00,221
Looky what I found.

31
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,512
Guess Ms.
Hollander liked to beat some meat.

32
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,783
Maybe a couple of whacks
in the temple with this

33
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:06,702
will help you remember
where you put the money.

34
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,712
Hey, we've been beating his ass all
night. He ain't coming off the goods.

35
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:11,391
We need to do
something different.

36
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:15,891
It don't matter what you do to me.
I ain't talking.

37
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:19,181
Well, I ain't stopping till
I get what I came for.

38
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:21,101
How about we listen
to that again?

39
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,460
Tell me where that money is,
or I'm gonna read it on your tombstone?

40
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:36,520
Okay... okay.
We'll give you a little clue.

41
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:41,120
It ain't here.

42
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,723
Confirmed, Burrows
is in custody.

43
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:10,840
Unbelievable. He made it
all the way to Arizona.

44
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:14,691
Another day, he would have been gone.
You find Mahone?

45
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,921
No. Keep trying to call,
it goes straight to voicemail.

46
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:22,630
This is Alexander Mahone.
Please leave a message.

47
00:03:28,177 --> 00:03:30,780
- Mr. Kim.
- Mr. Kellerman.

48
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:35,050
- Lincoln Burrows is in custody.
- That's the reason I called.

49
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:38,050
- Who has him?
- Wilcox, Arizona PD.

50
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,853
We need to extricate him,
right away.

51
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,241
Where's Mr. Mahone?

52
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:43,822
I'm getting in touch
with him right now,

53
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,650
but I can take care
of this one myself.

54
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:47,652
This is why we
hired Mr. Mahone.

55
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,980
He's the official face here.

56
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,603
Don't worry.
This won't be official,

57
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:55,613
- and there won't be any questions.
- Of course, there will.

58
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:59,553
Just make sure no one's
left to answer them.

59
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,761
My son had nothing to
do with this, please.

60
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,352
A judge will decide that.

61
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,802
- You call ahead?
- Yeah, Phoenix is sending backup.

62
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,293
I don't think it's
one of ours, Jimmy.

63
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,400
What the hell?!

64
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:09,272
Come on!

65
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,963
Run, run!

66
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:24,183
Come here!

67
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,570
let go of me!

68
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,973
Okay, calm down.

69
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,561
- You try that again...
- Who the hell are you?!

70
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:36,780
We're on your side!
We're with your father.

71
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,200
Mahone, Lincoln Burrows
has been apprehended.

72
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,840
- Arizona.
- Where?

73
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,571
I'm on my way and I need your talents,
on the ground as well.

74
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:49,200
I'll get there as
soon as I can.

75
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:52,380
I don't think you heard me.
Get to Arizona.

76
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,582
I'm this close to Scofield.

77
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:58,193
- We have a bird in the hand.
- Yeah, well, so might I.

78
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:02,723
You wanted me to figure out
Scofield's rendezvous with Tancredi?

79
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,982
It's happening today...

80
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,212
...and I'm sitting
right on top of it.

81
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,512
What are you looking at?

82
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,911
- Where are we?
- It doesn't matter.

83
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,023
You're safe here.

84
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,162
You can take a seat.

85
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,410
I ain't doing a thing
until I see my dad.

86
00:08:39,738 --> 00:08:41,632
All I can tell you
is he's on his way.

87
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,393
His flight lands in an hour.

88
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:45,301
Why should I trust you, lady?

89
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:50,150
I don't see you have
much of a choice.

90
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:53,133
I could drop you back off with
the cops if you'd prefer.

91
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:00,032
You have somewhere else to be?

92
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:02,942
- Matter of fact, we do.
- We can't let you leave.

93
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:05,582
And your father was expecting
your brother to be with you.

94
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,201
Do you know where he is?

95
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:09,643
Do you really think I'm
going to answer that?

96
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,932
You need to start
cooperating with us, Lincoln.

97
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:15,952
We're only trying to help.

98
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:25,683
Michael Scofield. Escaped from
Fox River penitentiary a week ago.

99
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,683
No, never seen him.

100
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:31,673
Well, if you do,
please call me at that number.

101
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:32,882
Will do.

102
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:36,183
There's another
hotel down the road.

103
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,112
Thanks.

104
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,671
- Yeah?
- You got a fax.

105
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,443
Uh, could you put it
under the door, please?

106
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,222
Thank you.

107
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:45,040
Theresa. It's Fernando Sucre.

108
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:48,713
- Fernando.
- Theresa.

109
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,690
- She's not here.
- Please don't hang up.

110
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,823
I'm... I'm so sorry. Please.
Just... I need to know something.

111
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,512
You've got bigger problems
than my sister right now.

112
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:01,443
No, no. Wait. Please. Please.
I need to talk to her. Please.

113
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:04,592
You can't.
We're leaving this afternoon.

114
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,652
- Where you going?
- Ixtapa, Mexico.

115
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:08,383
We won't be back for a week.

116
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,292
We're taking the honeymoon
she had planned with Hector.

117
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:13,180
She's picking me
up in a few hours.

118
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:16,452
- What time?
- A little before 2:00.

119
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,102
She's going to have to call me.

120
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,501
- Okay. I'll give you the number.
- Where are you?

121
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:23,540
Take this number off caller I.D.
Please, Theresa,

122
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:28,803
just have her call me, okay?
I'll be right here.

123
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,043
Hello, Sara.

124
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:27,300
I wasn't sure you'd come.

125
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:31,072
I didn't have a choice.

126
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,953
This isn't going to
be easy for you.

127
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:40,830
You said in your message that you
had a plan to make this right.

128
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,662
I need to know what that is.

129
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:57,472
Yeah, she checked
in last night.

130
00:14:57,618 --> 00:15:02,410
- Was she alone?
- Yeah.

131
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:05,183
Kelli Foster.
I put her in room nine.

132
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,061
You the guy that was trying
to call this morning?

133
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,740
A guy tried to
call this morning?

134
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:10,681
Yeah. He was trying
to send her a fax.

135
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,131
- Did he do it?
- Yeah. 20 minutes ago.

136
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:16,941
- Does the fax have memory?
- I guess so.

137
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:25,511
- Do you know where that is?
- It's five minutes away.

138
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,960
Hey, if she comes back,
is there anything you want me to do?

139
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,250
She isn't coming back.

140
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:36,493
I've arranged for us
to get to Panama.

141
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,881
We're meeting up with
my brother tomorrow.

142
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:42,162
Wait. That's your plan?

143
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:49,190
To run away to Panama with the
two most wanted men in America?

144
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:56,790
Michael, I came here because I thought
you were going to have real answers
for me.

145
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:58,238
This is an answer.

146
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:02,684
And, right now,
it's the only one we've got.

147
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:10,382
Running away into the sunset with
the man who lied to me? Really?

148
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,723
I mean,
did you know about the other guys?

149
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:15,643
Did you know that I would be putting
T-Bag back out on to the street?

150
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,440
I never meant for
that to happen.

151
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,203
I was doing what
I needed to do.

152
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:24,051
- My brother was going to die.
- Well, my father's dead.

153
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:40,201
I am sorry about your father.

154
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:48,343
I'm sorry for a lot of things.
For what I did to you.

155
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:54,701
I have many, many regrets,
but that's the biggest.

156
00:16:54,836 --> 00:17:02,473
- That doesn't help me right now.
- I'm sorry for that, too.

157
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,781
I didn't expect you to, uh...

158
00:17:09,427 --> 00:17:11,300
I didn't expect you forgive me.

159
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,992
But I don't want you, to, uh...

160
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:18,950
I don't want you to
be alone in this.

161
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:32,810
I don't want to be alone.

162
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:46,150
- Let's go. Get in the car.
- You can't get out this way.

163
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:49,813
- That's the only way out of here.
- Then that's where we're going.

164
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,633
Hold on. Just hold on.

165
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:11,110
- Michael, what are you doing?
- Just hold on.

166
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,001
Come on.

167
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:48,462
- You're alright?
- He's still behind us.

168
00:18:58,677 --> 00:18:59,512
Hold on!

169
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,192
On your feet, Bagwell.

170
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:46,882
Skewers are hot.

171
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:07,241
I'm going to get that
key if I have to...

172
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,470
We're going to see that
key again, friend.

173
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:30,173
We're going to
see it real soon.

174
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,872
Give me my credit card.
What did you get me?

175
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:42,770
What else you get?

176
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,763
Prune juice, smokes,
a little dip,

177
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,440
and a bag of sliders.

178
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:50,890
What do you want first?

179
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,212
Looks like a chew guy to me.

180
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:13,083
- No spitting.
- He's had worse things in his mouth.

181
00:21:48,986 --> 00:21:53,922
What do you want,
Fernando, from the future?

182
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,203
Would you run if I said you?

183
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:02,582
Would you chase me if I did?

184
00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:21,213
We got to get back to my car.

185
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,040
It's too far.

186
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,212
If we go now,
before he gets more people...

187
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:32,252
He's not gonna call for backup.
He wants his privacy.

188
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:35,441
- Why?
- He's not trying to catch me.

189
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:41,711
He's trying to kill me.

190
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:50,783
Your grandfather.

191
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:54,480
He was the reason I was
set up in the first place.

192
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:59,180
He used to work for the
people who wanted me dead.

193
00:23:00,108 --> 00:23:02,221
This is all just to get to him.

194
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,391
Your father should be
arriving any minute.

195
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:09,641
- Jane, right?
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,192
Sorry.

197
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:15,303
Don't worry about it.

198
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,360
- You know my dad?
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,733
- Well?
- Well enough.

200
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:26,660
- We used to work together.
- Ah, the company.

201
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:30,362
Yeah. But that was
a long time ago.

202
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,273
And now I work against them,
just like he does.

203
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,520
So I guess you walked
out on your family, too.

204
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:38,372
- No explanations, no good-byes.
- I don't have a family.

205
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:41,750
Lincoln, he really wants to
see you and your brother.

206
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,951
He hasn't seen Michael
since he was ten years old.

207
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:45,010
They're here.

208
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:47,052
Wait here.

209
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:58,980
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

210
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,470
Michael never met
your grandfather.

211
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:02,681
Hey!

212
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,083
Dad.

213
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:17,222
I don't want to get
trapped in here.

214
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,493
There's got to be an
exit on the other side.

215
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,681
- You go on.
- Michael.

216
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:25,461
I'll be right behind you. Go.

217
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:42,400
The news is not good. Burrows was
intercepted before I got here.

218
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,810
It is a setback,
but we're not that far behind.

219
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:48,610
Paul, Paul, calm down.
It'll be all right.

220
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:51,520
- Someone will take care of it.
- Someone... who?

221
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:55,393
Bill, tell me you're not bringing
someone else in on this.

222
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:57,931
You didn't think you were alone on this,
did you?

223
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,882
You're a soldier.
There's an army.

224
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:05,271
Tell me,
what do you have on Sara Tancredi?

225
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:09,272
- What does that have to do with this?
- Go back to your original assignment.

226
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,980
Bill, I'm here now.
I can do this, and then...

227
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:15,980
The girl. We need to know
what her father told her.

228
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:19,033
When you find out,
give me a call.

229
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:26,402
This is Agent Kellerman.

230
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,643
I need that rental car
information on Sara Tancredi.

231
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,212
Yeah, this is it right here.

232
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,340
75-foot twin diesel Azimut,

233
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,291
flybridge, panoramics--

234
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,882
you pull up in a boat like that,
you're somebody.

235
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:25,180
- Let me see.
- Get off.

236
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,230
How ya doin', Bagwell?

237
00:28:42,258 --> 00:28:44,700
- Get the stool.
- What stool?

238
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:45,773
The stool.

239
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:58,062
It's from one of them
lockers in a bus station.

240
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,772
I'll try not to think
about where it's been.

241
00:29:11,177 --> 00:29:13,711
No, no, no, no--
don't do that, now. Come on.

242
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:16,990
Hey, there. Send the police.
Some scumbag broke into my house.

243
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,790
- Your address?
- Yeah, 1505 Marberry Hill.

244
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,431
- Is he still there?
- Yeah, you better come quick.

245
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:26,230
- Let's hit it, Roy.
- Please don't do this.

246
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:28,261
Don't-- just don't leave
me like this, okay?

247
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:30,603
I can take you right to the money,
I know right where it is.

248
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:32,131
So do I. Adios.

249
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,273
I'm begging you,
don't do this. Please!

250
00:29:34,895 --> 00:29:36,913
Geary, come on,
we can make a deal, man.

251
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,033
No deals.

252
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,801
You just crapped out your
last bargaining chip, pal.

253
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:41,910
Please!

254
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,341
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Alex.

255
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:35,131
You smell that?

256
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:36,900
It's propane.

257
00:30:37,695 --> 00:30:38,900
It's filling the room.

258
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:43,683
And if you pull that trigger,
we both die.

259
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,731
I'll do it.

260
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,310
I'll do it!

261
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:01,621
Maybe.

262
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:03,480
But before you do,

263
00:31:04,316 --> 00:31:06,000
let me ask you a
question, Alex.

264
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:09,142
Do you think you're still
one of the good guys

265
00:31:09,275 --> 00:31:10,681
fighting the good fight?

266
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,401
Because I think we both
know you've crossed over.

267
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,361
You're on the wrong,
side chasing the wrong guys.

268
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:20,360
My brother is innocent.
He never killed anyone.

269
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:22,840
Oh, thanks for opening my eyes.

270
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:26,660
Okay, Alex, shoot.

271
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:28,300
We both know what will happen.

272
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,133
The propane will
kill me anyway,

273
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:32,671
what difference does it make?
Might as well do it right now.

274
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,103
That's a good point.

275
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:36,892
There.

276
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,232
There!

277
00:31:40,696 --> 00:31:44,270
That'll give you some time to
think about what you're doing.

278
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:47,180
But first,
a word of advice: stop.

279
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:52,161
Because when you get close,
I will win every time.

280
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,460
You think?

281
00:31:57,638 --> 00:31:59,461
I'm not the one in the cage.

282
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:01,240
No, you're not.

283
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:04,210
There's one big difference
between you and I, Michael.

284
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,150
And you just proved it.

285
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,251
You can't kill.

286
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:12,071
And that's what it's
gonna take to stop me.

287
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:15,832
'Cause I don't have the
same reservations. I can't.

288
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,730
So whether it's today in Gila

289
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,463
or tomorrow in Albuquerque
or two months from now...

290
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,232
in Panama.

291
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,672
I will get you.

292
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:35,680
I don't have a choice.

293
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,422
I bought us some time.

294
00:33:01,077 --> 00:33:04,083
- You okay? You're bleeding.
- Yeah, let's go.

295
00:33:04,688 --> 00:33:05,551
Your seatbelt.

296
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,930
Here. 804.

297
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:27,361
Move.

298
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:50,482
Ain't that the most beautiful
thing you ever seen?

299
00:33:50,668 --> 00:33:51,912
All that green.

300
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,811
It's prettier than
the Grand Canyon.

301
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,573
You know, Roy, this is a
monumental moment for both of us.

302
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:00,343
Hand over the bag, Bellick.

303
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:03,641
- Put down the pounder, Grandma.
- Hey, hey. I am not kidding around.

304
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,462
Well, you think
your pansy ass...?

305
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:22,102
Next time,
you pick through the crap.

306
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:55,970
Okay, first-aid kit, disposable phones,
couple of toothbrushes.

307
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:57,612
What about the motel?

308
00:34:57,756 --> 00:35:00,382
They charge by the hour,
so they didn't ask for ID.

309
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:09,601
- Do you have the keys?
- Yeah.

310
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,783
Sorry, we're not home.

311
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:33,431
Leave a message at the beep
and we'll get back to you.

312
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:36,280
Theresa. Listen.
This message is for Maricruz.

313
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,263
I was right there
waiting for your call,

314
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:41,821
but the cops showed up and I
couldn't pick up the phone.

315
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:44,543
I know probably that's
the exact reason

316
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,431
why you may not
want to be with me.

317
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:48,661
Listen to me.

318
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,601
My Aunt Idalyz,
she lives outside Mexico City,

319
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:55,701
in the mountains,
on a farm, with...

320
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:57,960
with a llama for
the baby to ride.

321
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:02,742
So, next week,
when you fly back home,

322
00:36:02,836 --> 00:36:05,652
when you go to the airport,
I'll be there.

323
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:07,083
In the airport.

324
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:13,843
In Ixtapa waiting for you.
I promise you, Marita. I love you, Mari.

325
00:36:13,985 --> 00:36:17,092
I love you more than anything
and I can't live without you.

326
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:21,083
I just know I can
make it work, baby.

327
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:28,212
This is, uh, in case you run
into trouble down the road.

328
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:33,220
I have a way.

329
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:36,853
- Where is she?
- Who?

330
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:39,570
Maricruz. She wasn't home
and she's not at work.

331
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,831
Well, she's not here.
I don't know where she is.

332
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,542
You want problems, Kalinda?
Don't lie to me.

333
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:54,432
She went to Mexico, didn't she?

334
00:36:56,097 --> 00:36:58,020
And on our honeymoon.

335
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:01,373
Paid for with my money.

336
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:08,480
This isn't gonna feel good.

337
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:11,480
I have a high tolerance for pain.
You know that.

338
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:12,460
You do.

339
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,890
And you're not a diabetic,
are you?

340
00:37:21,378 --> 00:37:22,442
All right.

341
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:33,503
Michael, tell me something.

342
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,263
You think there's a part
of you that enjoys this?

343
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:40,800
Peroxide in an open wound? No.

344
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:44,250
I mean escaping from prison and

345
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:49,420
being on the run and the danger and
the fear and the rush, all that.

346
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,940
It, uh...

347
00:37:52,548 --> 00:37:55,173
It feels to me like...
chasing a high.

348
00:37:57,535 --> 00:38:02,240
And... And I know what
that's like and...

349
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,711
I should know better by now.

350
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:10,522
I never thought
about it like that.

351
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,222
I know you've
heard this before,

352
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:22,943
but it won't always
be like this.

353
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,281
From everything you've told me,
it's just getting worse.

354
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:28,040
They can't chase us forever.

355
00:38:28,236 --> 00:38:30,592
The guy who caught up with us today,
he stops at the border,

356
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,831
and that's why we
have to get across.

357
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,142
And I have the people in
place to help us do that.

358
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:36,902
We're meeting them tomorrow.

359
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,430
One more day, Sara.

360
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:44,622
One more day.

361
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:48,162
That's all I'm asking.

362
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:53,532
You can go get cleaned up.
Keep this dry.

363
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,483
Sara.

364
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:14,641
I'm glad you came.

365
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:25,331
So...

366
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,321
this is him.

367
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:31,000
Lincoln, Jr.

368
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:36,102
- You named him after yourself.
- I wasn't gonna name him Aldo.

369
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:45,460
LJ, this is your grandfather,
Aldo Burrows.

370
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:47,262
Hi.

371
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:52,890
Waited for this
for a long time.

372
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:03,542
Uh, I've arranged a safe place
for both of you to go to.

373
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,812
Well, thanks for bailing us out,
but, uh,

374
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:11,581
- we got to meet Michael.
- Where is he?

375
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:15,563
Down by the border,
a place called Bolshoi Booze.

376
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,651
- I can go alone and get him.
- No.

377
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:25,251
Things are different.
There's some evidence.

378
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:27,491
We just need a
little more time,

379
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:30,273
and we can blow this
whole thing wide open...

380
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:32,421
But there is no time.
I trust Michael;

381
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,071
he has a plan to
get us to Panama.

382
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:37,441
You don't understand.
You don't need to go to Panama.

383
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:40,342
You don't need to run anymore.

384
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:52,012
- Tell me good news.
- Hey.

385
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:55,180
I got Burrows-- the trifecta.

386
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:57,131
Take care of them.

387
00:40:57,275 --> 00:40:59,471
What about Scofield?
They're gonna meet him.

388
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:02,202
It doesn't matter. Do it now.

389
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,442
Sara?

390
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:57,933
This time I know better.
I'm sorry...

391
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,581
Hi, Sara.

392
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:06,981
