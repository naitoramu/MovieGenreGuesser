1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,600
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,820
You have hypothalamus Hamartoma,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,490
the doctor feels you need surgery

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,900
Otherwise you could die

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,660
You are not following direct orders?

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,700
Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,040
Just not from you anymore.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,170
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, Doc.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,940
What?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,540
Time to come home now.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
You're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,040
His name is Vikan, and he's not a buyer, he's a conduit.

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,570
Let's go.

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,670
And Bagwell's staying here.

15
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,440
I warned you not to screw me over.

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,800
It's been a long time, Gretchen. Who's he?

17
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,300
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.

18
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,570
It's incomplete. There's a piece missing, slick.

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
I believe you have something that belongs to me.

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,640
Come and get it.

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,470
Just so it's fresh in your mind, this isn't a magic elixir.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,740
You still need a hospital.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,100
You need real equipment.

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,140
Could probably use a doctor

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,770
who's still got a license to practice medicine.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,770
First we get Scylla.

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,770
Then I'll go to the hospital.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,340
You finished?

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Just about.

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,300
So, I take it you're ready to talk now?

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,700
Actually, I'm ready to meet.

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,540
I got a better idea.

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,370
Everyone out!

34
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,700
You're surrounded.

35
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,200
Come out with your piece of Scylla, Michael.

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,240
You first.

37
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,040
Come out, or I'm going to gas you out.

38
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,700
If it's the latter, I have a full magazine with 30 rounds.

39
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,240
Want to bet at least one of them could outrun you?

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,070
What makes you think I'd even keep the piece on me?

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,270
Oh, I know you, Michael.

42
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,000
You're not letting that thing out of your sight.

43
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,940
I stand by my original offer.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,040
Come and get it.

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,270
Okay.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,370
Stay low. Let the gas rise to the ceiling.

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
This is a big space, but it won't take many more of those

48
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,040
before we start to asphyxiate.

49
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,300
Where's Lincoln?!

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,770
Here we go, Michael.

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,060

52
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,400
All right, now we take a ride and we pick up Scylla.

53
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,740
Or I put a bullet in your head.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
It ain't gonna happen.

55
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,300
Try me.

56
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,500
Good morning.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,170
Okay, all right, now that we all have guns pointed at us,

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
let's talk, okay?

59
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,600
Fine.

60
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,640
You could start by telling me who I'm talking to, Don?

61
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,200
You're talking to a guy who spent 17 years

62
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,000
in service of his government, all by the book.

63
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,070
You know what the sum total of it was?

64
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,800
Nothing. Nada.

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,300
But we're very similar, Michael,

66
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,640
and fundamentally, we want the same thing.

67
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
And I have a way to get it.

68
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,700
How's that?

69
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,100
I got a buyer for Scylla.

70
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,800
A guy who wants to destroy the Company as much as you do.

71
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,900
And he's willing to pay a lot of money for it.

72
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,470
How much?

73
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,840
Nine figures in an offshore account of your choosing.

74
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
So, there it is.

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,300
Or...

76
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,300
you could stand by your principles.

77
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,600
I'll pass.

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
Look, I burned you, right?

79
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,000
And I'd apologize, but what's the point?

80
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,170
We're all out in the cold now.

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,200
But we're not going to be able to hide from the Company

82
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,300
on a shoestring budget.

83
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,500
Who's the buyer?

84
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,200
He's an ex-Company guy with a bone to pick.

85
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,740
Just like your father.

86
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
Michael?

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,300
I'd need to meet him first.

88
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,640
That can be arranged.

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,500
And just so you know, this...

90
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,670
This wasn't personal. This is just business.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,240
We'll be in touch.

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,700
We stick to the plan, all right?

93
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,200
We're going to get Scylla.

94
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,200
We wait for Alex to come through on his end.

95
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,770
All right?

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,900
WHEELER: Hello, Alex.

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,100
You came.

98
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,270
I always do,

99
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,740
to the detriment of my pay grade.

100
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,300
These last few weeks,

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,900
I've been part of an off-the-books operation

102
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,640
under the hand of Homeland Security.

103
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Felicia, the people I'm working with,

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,700
we're this close to coming up with

105
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,370
the one thing that can destroy the Company:

106
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,070
their little black book. We can get it. Names, numbers.

107
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,400
Look, I don't want to get caught up in some interagency politics.

108
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,870
So, if this is Homeland's show...

109
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,800
Homeland buried the operation. We can't come back in.

110
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,770
But we could still take the Company down.

111
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,800
So, my question to you is:

112
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,140
Who do you know in the Bureau that you can trust?

113
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
It used to be you, Alex.

114
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,100
I've lost a lot of things these last few months,

115
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,270
not the least of which is your trust.

116
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,270
But I don't come to you hat in hand.

117
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Scylla is real.

118
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,800
But if you don't want anything to do with it, it's okay.

119
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,470
It's all right; I could walk away.

120
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,600
Yeah, there is someone who might be able to help.

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,870
FERGUSON: Sir, there are over ten million faces in Los Angeles.

122
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,600
Even with NSA and CIA satellite links, we're going to be sifting

123
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,800
through millions of gigabytes of image data.

124
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,600
The chances of finding Don Self,

125
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,600
Scofield and Burrows... it's not good.

126
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,940
Well, let's improve the odds.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,470
Self and the brothers

128
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,470
may have stolen Scylla but none of them have

129
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,140
the connections to off-load it.

130
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,370
Add Gretchen's face to the search.

131
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,070
She won't be welcome in Scofield's camp.

132
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,300
So, connect her image with Self's.

133
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,870
We find those two within five feet of each other

134
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,340
anywhere in Los Angeles, and we've found Scylla.

135
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,570
Are you friends with my Auntie Gretchen?

136
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,340
Go play in your room. Mommy will be in soon.

137
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,000
Where's her daddy?

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,500
Gretchen doesn't talk about him.

139
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,740
So, Emily doesn't know that you ain't...

140
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
That Gretchen's her mama?

141
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,700
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.

142
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,370
Cute girl.

143
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,400
Don't hurt my little girl.

144
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,070
If you have to do something, do it to me.

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,800
What do you think I am?

146
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
A monster?

147
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,500
You're holding us prisoner in our own home.

148
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,970
I'm just as much a prisoner as you.

149
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,140
Eggshell white. Bold lettering.

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,500
Double embossed. I was Cole Pfeiffer.

151
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,140
Respected businessman.

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,100
Top salesman in the Northeast Region.

153
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,270
Now I'm back being prisoner

154
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,940
of my own identity.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,740
Theodore Bagwell. Convict.

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,270
To hell with it. We are who we are, right?

157
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,100
What were you selling?

158
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,440
Never you mind.

159
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,800
You just pray your sister comes through.

160
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,100
The Company gets destroyed  and we get paid.

161
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,670
It's a great deal.

162
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,940
This guy is just another General Krantz waiting to happen.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,070
Let's say we do sell it to him and the Company burns,

164
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,470
You know what happens then?

165
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,170
Another company is built right on top of that one.

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,440
We're not selling.

167
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,170
Sucre pulled it off.

168
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,870
Great.

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,070
Is this going to work?

170
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,170
It's like an ultrasound.

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,170
It can see through everything.

172
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,200
You're building up a tolerance.

173
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,930
Then we'll up the dosage.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,660
Yeah, I have,

175
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,000
and at this point, a higher dosage would have

176
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,500
more side effects than the tumor itself.

177
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,530
I'll manage without it.

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,900
Sit this one out.

179
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,430
Let me and Sucre handle it.

180
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm going.

181
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,600
Why can't he understand I need to finish this?

182
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,230
Everything that happened,

183
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,560
it all started with the Company.

184
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,930
Maybe not for Lincoln.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,300
Maybe for him, this all started

186
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,930
with his little brother breaking him out of prison.

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,300
Michael, you saved his life.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,960
If anything happens to you,

189
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,630
he spends the rest of his life feeling guilty for that.

190
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,630
Tell me something,

191
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,200
at what point does a noble deed become fanaticism?

192
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,200
Fanaticism is the only way to beat them.

193
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,760
Even if it kills you?

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,100
Hey, pop the trunk.

195
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,860
Micheal?

196
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,300
Sucre just sent a text. He's found Gretchen and Self.

197
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,760
Good, good.

198
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,500
You all right?

199
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, for now.

200
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,660
All right.

201
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,030
-Linc?  -Yeah?

202
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,600
After your trial that day I came to see you at Fox River...

203
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,800
What about it?

204
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,000
I thought you did it.

205
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,360
I thought you killed Terrence Steadman.

206
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,700
Along with everyone else?

207
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,500
But by the time I left, I...

208
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,230
I knew you were innocent.

209
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,160
And I had to get you out of that place.

210
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,030
So, however this plays out,

211
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,000
I have no regrets.

212
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,260
Scofield's hiding something in the washroom.

213
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,300
I think we just found

214
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,530
our missing piece of Scylla. Call Vikan.

215
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,300
I want to talk to my daughter first.

216
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,760
Just call him, okay, they're fine.

217
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,030
I have a history with Vikan.

218
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,800
No money exchanges hands unless I tell him you're legit.

219
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,930
I want to talk to my daughter. Now!

220
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,030
Yeah?

221
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,600
Put the daughter on the phone.

222
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,030
Is there a problem?

223
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,600
Just put her on the phone.

224
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,660
Hello?

225
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,060
Emily, baby, it's your Auntie Gretchen.

226
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,200
Where are you?

227
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,300
I'm not far. Are you okay?

228
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,100
There's this mean man here.

229
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,900
Emily, baby, do you remember the mean man

230
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,630
that used to live with your mommy Rita?

231
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,000
The one that used to yell at you all the time?

232
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,000
Roy?

233
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,460
That's the one.

234
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,060
And what happened to Roy?

235
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,500
He went to the store one day

236
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,960
and never came back.

237
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,600
That's right.

238
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,660
And I think that if you don't like this mean man,

239
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,730
then very soon, he's going to leave

240
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,000
and he's never coming back.

241
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,930
You think so?

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Baby, I know so.

243
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,130
All right, that's enough.

244
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,130
Emily, baby, put the mean man back on the phone.

245
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,830
Listen to me. I'm going to call you

246
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,700
in two hours with the exact location of the exchange.

247
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,860
If you don't hear from me,

248
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,130
kill them both.

249
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,360
You expecting somebody?

250
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,600
No.

251
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,730
Look lively.

252
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
Hey, buttercup, why don't you

253
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,160
go play with your dollsies or something.

254
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,030
It's okay, honey. Go to your playroom.

255
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,030
Hi, there.

256
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,400
My name is Ralph Becker, and I'm selling Bibles

257
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,560
to raise money for the Church of the Holy Trinity.

258
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,930
And I wonder if I could spend five minutes

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,060
of your time and talk about the Gospel with you.

260
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,300
We're a bit, uh, indisposed at the moment, Ralph.

261
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,700
Can you come back tomorrow?

262
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,260
Well, actually, today is the last day of the fund-raiser.

263
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,860
I said we're busy.

264
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,360
We're never too busy for God.

265
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,330
And what's a few minutes

266
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,430
of your afternoon for a place in His kingdom?

267
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,530
You're a bit pushy for a Bible salesman, ain't you, friend?

268
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,580
I'm on a mission.

269
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,260
You're on a mission, right?

270
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,800
-What are you doing?!  -Close the door!

271
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,960
-This guy is Company!  -What company?!

272
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,800
Get me some rope to tie him up with.

273
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,530
This guy is a Bible salesman.

274
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,430
Get me the rope, now!

275
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,330
Good choice for a meeting spot, Alex.

276
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,330
Crowded place. Two exits.

277
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,160
Corner table with a full view of the room.

278
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,500
Looks like you're getting acclimated to life on the run.

279
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,260
I hear you got promoted.

280
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,060
Your own field office, Wheeler.

281
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,560
That's impressive.

282
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,930
When you're neither a disgrace to the Bureau

283
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,060
nor a drug addict, good things can happen.

284
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,100
He's clean, Mark.

285
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,560
Thank you, Felicia.

286
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,630
Look, I know you, Mark.

287
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,930
You're a good agent, ambitious.

288
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,330
So, let me appeal to the side of you

289
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,830
that likes to see your name in print.

290
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,930
Want to be on a short list for Deputy Director? Huh?

291
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,460
Right. Lang filled me in.

292
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,100
You've got solid gold intel.

293
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,160
I don't know if I'm more skeptical of a burned out ex-Fed

294
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,130
or the mythical cabal known as the Company.

295
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,530
You came all the way here for a myth?

296
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,700
What do you want, Alex?

297
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,300
Felicia tells me you have the attorney general's ear.

298
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,500
That's right.

299
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,660
The Bureau is compromised.

300
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,630
Homeland Security is compromised.

301
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,230
I need someone I can trust. Can I trust you?

302
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,200
You get me credible intelligence against the Company...

303
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,200
I'll walk you into the

304
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,230
attorney general's office myself.

305
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,930
We'll get it.

306
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,860
Alex, talk to me.

307
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,230
I think I found someone in government we can trust.

308
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,030
How close are you to getting Scylla?

309
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,500
Very. Michael...

310
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,060
We're in escrow here. You've got to come through with the house.

311
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,560
Don't worry.

312
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,100
We're getting Scylla.

313
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,730
All right.

314
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,330
Look what I found.

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,260
Problem is, there's no way to shoot them.

316
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,560
Yeah, we do.

317
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,230
Sucre, go buy some hairspray and a lighter.

318
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,660
What's this?

319
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,400
My resignation.

320
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,960
Lisa, I tried to shield you from everything

321
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,430
I didn't think you could handle.

322
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,600
The only thing you shielded me from

323
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,200
was knowing who you really are.

324
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,260
Now I know.

325
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,130
I wanted a son.

326
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,300
FERGUSON: Sir...

327
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,330
Taken less than an hour ago.

328
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,730
You were right-- Gretchen's with Self.

329
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,300
What are the coordinates?

330
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,700
GENERAL: Your mission is the safe retrieval of Scylla.

331
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,840
one of the Rules of engagement?

332
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
there are none shoot on side

333
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Fauntleroy Hotel, downtown.

334
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,560
Who sent you?!

335
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,160
The Church of The Holy Trinity.

336
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,960
Liar!

337
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,760
Are you out of your mind?!

338
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,760
You're beating up

339
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,800
a Bible salesman!

340
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,100
I ain't Scofield.

341
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,430
I ain't Burrows.

342
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,730
This ain't my lot! Leave me alone!

343
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,460
I'm not a part of this

344
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,160
Company!

345
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't know anything, I swear.

346
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,500
Look at him! Please, please, just look at him!

347
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,060
Does he look like some kind

348
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,560
of a undercover agent to you?!

349
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,330
They blend in!

350
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,500
That's how they get you!

351
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,800
Okay, his wallet, okay?

352
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,900
He's got a California driver's license.

353
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,100
"Ralph Becker," okay?

354
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,700
He's got a library card and a prayer card.

355
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,830
That is pretty convincing.

356
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,760
Look at this.

357
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,500
"Freedom, Honor, Country.

358
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,600
Southeastern Military Academy, Class of '98."

359
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,630
How many Bible salesman do you know graduate

360
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,300
from a military academy?!

361
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,460
No! I didn't go to Southeastern! It's my kid brother's ring!

362
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,930
He died in Baghdad last year!

363
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,060
It was a car bomb!

364
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,830
I swear!

365
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,660
RITA: Listen to me.

366
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,630
That made sense.

367
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,200
Okay...

368
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,000
that made sense.

369
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,100
BECKER: Please!

370
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,530
We're not going nowhere!

371
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Not till I get a phone call!

372
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,730
It's $25 for the hour.

373
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,460
We don't need a room.

374
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,000
I, uh, I'm looking for my sister.

375
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,130
Her name's Gretchen Morgan.

376
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,830
Can you tell me what room she's in?

377
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,730
You want information, call 411.

378
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,500
How about now?

379
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,300
No Gretchen Morgan.

380
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
No refund.

381
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,500
She's about five-seven.

382
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,100
She's got black hair and blue eyes,

383
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,560
and I imagine she'd stand out

384
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,400
in a fine establishment like this one.

385
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,360
Room 308.

386
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,130
Thank you so much.

387
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,500
No urinating in the stairwell.

388
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,100
That's the golden rule.

389
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,130
Yeah?

390
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
Yeah, they're on the third floor,

391
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,360
front of the hotel,

392
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,560
just to the left of center.

393
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,630
Got it, thanks.

394
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,430
Third floor up, just left of the balcony.

395
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,700
Why don't you set up on that rooftop over there?

396
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,260
Scylla's almost complete.

397
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,360
Is everything ready on your end?

398
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,760
Let me talk to Gretchen.

399
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,230
No, you're talking to me.

400
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,160
The buyer has touched down.

401
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,230
This isn't the kind of person you keep waiting.

402
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,460
Likewise.

403
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,800
Just make sure he has the money ready.

404
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,160
Listen to me, you mook.

405
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,960
You're in the deep end of the pool now.

406
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,700
At least act like you can swim.

407
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,230
And the next time I call, I want to talk to Gretchen.

408
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,500
No, no, no, you listen to me, okay?

409
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,960
The next time you call, it better be

410
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,100
to tell me that the money's ready, you understand?

411
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,100
Hello.

412
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,330
I thought you should know

413
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
a man and a woman came in looking for you.

414
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,830
Scofield found us. How?

415
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,830
Who cares? Just get ready.

416
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,100
How long ago?

417
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,330
A couple of minutes.

418
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,800
I don't want no trouble in my place!

419
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,700
I'm gonna recon the hallway.

420
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,530
Anything goes down, get Scylla, get out.

421
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,660
I will find you.

422
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,000
Okay.

423
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,630
Michael, like I said before, this is just business.

424
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,770
My ear!

425
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,430
FERGUSON: Don't move!

426
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,270
Get in!

427
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,070
Help me get him in the back of the van!

428
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,800
Michael!

429
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,770
What is that?

430
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,000
It's the warehouse.

431
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,500
The chip.

432
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,470
You sure it's here?

433
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,500
Yeah, I'm sure.

434
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:37,530
From the schematic, it can only be in one place.

435
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,970
Look, don't be stupid, okay, Gretchen?

436
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,530
You're gonna get your daughter back and your money.

437
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,930
I'll see you in the car.

438
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,570
He was brought in like this.

439
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,030
Who's there?

440
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,870
I'm giving him 10cc's of clonazepam

441
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,100
and taking him downstairs. We'll know more soon.

442
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,230
Try and relax.

443
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,570
Don't worry, we're gonna get Michael back.

444
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,030
How? Self took the piece.

445
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,700
We got nothing to trade for Michael.

446
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,300
SARA: He's sick, Lincoln.

447
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,930
If they haven't killed him already...

448
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,130
We'll get him back, I promise.

449
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,770
Hello.

450
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,130
Hold on.

451
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,770
It's Alex.

452
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,170
Yeah.

453
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,630
Did you get it yet?

454
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,830
No, Self's got it.

455
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,130
All of it.

456
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,930
What?

457
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
Just forget about Scylla.

458
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,070
The Company's taken Michael.

459
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:50,270
Your friend in government-- can he do anything for him?

460
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,300
No, I don't think so.

461
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,370
There's no reason for you to come back, Alex.

462
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,870
I'm sorry.

463
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,270
Yeah, me, too.

464
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,470
Should have known.

465
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Vikan's meeting us here?

466
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,400
We'll be off the Company's radar here.

467
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,900
Yeah.

468
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,270
We got a problem.

469
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,500
Well, whatever it is, it can wait.

470
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,540
We're in the home stretch here.

471
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,900
Grab the sister and the girl.

472
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,970
I'm going to call you back

473
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,270
with the exact location of the exchange.

474
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,270
I'd love to, but a, uh...

475
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,570
third party has been introduced into the mix.

476
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:41,700
Who?

477
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,400
I'm not sure yet.

478
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,070
He might be a Company operative.

479
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,100
So kill him.

480
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,100
He could also be a Bible salesman.

481
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,470
Then he should have no problem

482
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,770
getting past St. Peter. Kill him.

483
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,370
Go back in the bedroom

484
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,940
with your daughter. What are you going to do?

485
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,240
Go now!

486
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,240
Please... please, please don't kill me.

487
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,370
Please don't kill me.

488
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,200
Please... Look, I won't tell anyone!

489
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,640
I won't tell anyone, I promise!

490
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,300
Please don't kill me!

491
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,770
I swear I won't tell anyone.

492
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,140
Don't do this.

493
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,140
I told you to go back yonder, okay?

494
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
You don't want to see this!

495
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,270
Cole Pfeiffer ain't here no more.

496
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,300
Just ol' T-Bag.

497
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,770
Our Father who art in Heaven

498
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,340
hallowed be thy name...

499
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,100
You want to be free?

500
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,400
Start now.

501
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,800
Right this minute.

502
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,170
If you pull that trigger...

503
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,270
Cole Pfeiffer is gone forever.

504
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,640
Don't do this.

505
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,470
Don't do this.

506
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,040
You know, my daddy was a religious man, too, Ralph,

507
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,370
just like you.

508
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,170
We used to... pray together

509
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,200
in my room at night.

510
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,340
I used to go down to the floor crying

511
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,700
just like you now.

512
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,640
Sometimes when I just couldn't take it no more,

513
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,840
my daddy would recite a particular piece

514
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,440
of Scripture that he was fond of...

515
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,200
"Weeping

516
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,670
may endure through the night..."

517
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,040
"But joy cometh in the morning."

518
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,870
Psalms 30:5.

519
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,070
Rita...

520
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,200
Yeah?

521
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,370
Have you got a car?

522
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,440
My car's in the... it's in the garage.

523
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,270
You get in that car right now

524
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,900
and you drive far, far away from right here,

525
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,200
right now, okay?

526
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,600
Here.

527
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,870
Take this.

528
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,170
Rita...

529
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,600
Thank you.

530
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,140
What are you going to do to me?

531
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,370
I want you to go.

532
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
I want you to be free.

533
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,740
Be as free as me.

534
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,270
Thank you.

535
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,400
Thank you so much.

536
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,670
Yeah, I got one.

537
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,840
Not Gretchen. It's Bagwell.

538
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm bringing him in.

539
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,700
DOCTOR: The growth is malignant.

540
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,470
It's pushing up against his temporal lobe

541
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,470
and it will kill him if it's not removed.

542
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,570
Have you seen

543
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,070
anything like this before?

544
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,340
This advanced?

545
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,440
Once.

546
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Sir...

547
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,740
You'll never guess who just came through the door.

548
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,340
I want to see my brother.

549
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,430
Thank you, gentlemen.

550
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,160
Mr. Burrows, won't be a problem... will you?

551
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,800
This started with me. It ends with me.

552
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,800
Let Michael go.

553
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,800
I think you made the right decision.

554
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,130
Let's go downstairs and see your brother.

555
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,460
Gretchen.

556
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,700
Don... this better be the real thing this time.

557
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,730
It's all here.

558
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,060
Well, no offense,

559
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,500
but I'll check it myself.

560
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,200
So the buyer's on the way?

561
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,360
He will be here shortly.

562
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,300
And he's bringing the money?

563
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,560
Yes, Don, he is bringing the money.

564
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,930
Scylla is complete.

565
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,100
Gretchen, you did it.

566
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,260
What I wouldn't give to see

567
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,730
the look on the General's face.

568
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,730
What the hell are you doing?!

569
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,730
We need him alive to sell this thing!

570
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,500
You heard what he said.

571
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,130
Buyer's already on the way.

572
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,430
You think I'm going to give this clown 30%

573
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,400
for just making introductions?

574
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,560
BECKER: It's the one with the glass door in front.

575
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,430
Okay, we're coming out.

576
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Well?

577
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,130
The attorney general is willing to hear you out.

578
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,830
You know, from where I'm sitting, it looked like...

579
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,500
Your flight to Dulles leaves in 45 minutes.

580
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,930
Can I trust this guy?

581
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,600
We better go.

582
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,800
Come on, Alex, short trip to the airport.

583
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,500
Attorney general's waiting.

584
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,360
There is no meeting

585
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,360
with the attorney general, is there?

586
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,230
Thank you, Felicia.

587
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,860
For everything you've done.

588
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,830
Everything.

589
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,260
What did you do to my brother?

590
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,900
GENERAL: Michael needs an operation to remove a tumor

591
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,760
from his temporal lobe, and he needs it now.

592
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,500
The Company can provide

593
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,060
such an operation at a cost.

594
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,130
What do you want from us?

595
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,330
Not "us," Link...

596
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,030
you.

597
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,900
The price of the operation

598
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,330
is the safe return of Scylla.

599
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,160
You bring back to me what you stole,

600
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,300
and I will make sure Michael gets the finest medical care

601
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,600
in the world.

602
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,330
The Company has science and technology

603
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,060
that's years ahead of anything available to the public.

604
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,560
And it's all right here--

605
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,960
in this facility.

606
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,230
Now I would imagine

607
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,760
that working for me would be difficult for you to accept.

608
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,530
What's this?

609
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,200
Added incentive.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
