1
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,443
Rough night?

2
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:09,844
I got your message.
What's the problem?

3
00:00:10,497 --> 00:00:12,018
I lost my keys.

4
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:14,655
Where'd you find them?

5
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:16,218
Four feet that way.

6
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:19,016
Must've dropped them.

7
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:22,894
How you doing?
It's been a while.

8
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:25,079
Fine. How are you?

9
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,786
Cold.

10
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:29,698
I, uh...

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,511
I need to talk to
you about something.

12
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,648
- Grab some lunch at Fascastti's?
- I have to get back to work.

13
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:38,345
Speaking of which,
I heard you got fired a few weeks ago.

14
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:40,716
What was it this time?

15
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,519
You really want to know?

16
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,375
Or you're just enjoying the
view from your high horse?

17
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,648
You know what I want?

18
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:52,799
To not have to be the older
brother to my older brother.

19
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:11,952
What you doing here, Crab?

20
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,058
Long time no see, Mr.
Linc. Where you been?

21
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:15,893
- Here and there.
- Mm.

22
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:20,386
I'm gonna get your 90 grand,
all right...

23
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,749
Oh, relax, man,
that debt's already been paid.

24
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:23,692
By who?

25
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,913
Someone who likes to
do people favors.

26
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,527
I don't know what it is you're
thinking you're getting,

27
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,994
but let's be clear
about something.

28
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:34,037
It's gonna be a few days before
I get the money lined up.

29
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:35,396
Let's not kid ourselves.

30
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,884
You can't get anywhere
near that kind of money.

31
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:41,602
So let's talk about
what you can do for me.

32
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,343
Allies are like family.
We have disagreements,

33
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:49,627
but we always seem to smooth
things out by Thanksgiving.

34
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:52,481
Okay, if you had to choose...

35
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:56,869
Vice President Reynolds
or Kathy in HR?

36
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,457
I'll take door number three.

37
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:00,501
Come on, if you had to choose.

38
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:04,454
The chick in HR.
Michael never cared much for blondes.

39
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:06,052
V.

40
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:08,043
How you doing, Michael?

41
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,990
Um, good. I'm good.
How are you?

42
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,464
I'm okay.
You know, I'm over at Glazer & Ross.

43
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:15,774
Lawyer #97.

44
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,657
Benefits are good.

45
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,280
How's Lincoln?

46
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,688
You guys haven't talked?

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,680
No, not for a few years.
He kind of dropped off the radar.

48
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,991
How is he?

49
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,676
He's, um...

50
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:35,007
He's... He's Linc.

51
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,372
I don't care who the guy is.

52
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:38,678
I ain't killing no one.

53
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:40,926
I must have missed the part
where I gave you a choice.

54
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:42,571
Black leather jacket.

55
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,664
Two buttons down the front,
three on each sleeve.

56
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,932
One missing on his left--
no, right arm.

57
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:54,316
Jeans. Faded.

58
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,637
Stain on the right knee.

59
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,577
He does bad things
to good people.

60
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,928
Think of this as
a $90,000 bullet.

61
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,685
You start fresh,

62
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,912
and you keep me
from finding out

63
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:16,770
if there's someone in your life
you will do something for.

64
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:25,792
Uh, I should...
I should call you a cab.

65
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,676
You know how you can
tell God is a man?

66
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:30,096
Shoes.

67
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:31,737
Oh!

68
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:33,663
Easy.

69
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:54,706
What?

71
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:56,779
It's, uh...

72
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:00,704
You're gonna answer it?

73
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,452
He'll leave a message.

74
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:08,049
He always does.

75
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,254
Michael, it's Linc.

76
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:13,693
I need your help, bro.
I'm in something real bad.

77
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,462
I can't get out of it.

78
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,829
I need you to straighten me out.
My head is all messed up and...

79
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:22,732
Anyway, it's real important, bro.
You gotta call me.

80
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:24,529
You gotta call me now.

81
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,113
We can't do this.

82
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,813
I know.

83
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:40,260
I know.

84
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:49,969
I'll call you a cab.

85
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,660
Did we get him?

86
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,509
I believe we did, partner.

87
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:45,396
Whoo!

88
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:47,706
Are you kidding?

89
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:51,795
Nando, we should've
whooped that guy's ass.

90
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:55,174
Please, only time I
seen you whoop some ass

91
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:57,817
is when that old man cut
in front of you at Arby's.

92
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,737
And he was, like,
102 and blind.

93
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,627
With a plastic hip.

94
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:05,649
Oh, my God.

95
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:07,909
What?

96
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,976
Hey, they're waiting
for you in 4B.

97
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:34,637
Oh, pull his film.
I'll be there in a  minute.

98
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,277
Okay.

99
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:51,130
Sergeant Franklin,
you never cease to amaze me.

100
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:53,163
Is there anything
you can't get here?

101
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,241
All  right, a deal's a deal.

102
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:58,656
Prison guard duty.

103
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:00,950
Away from the front.
Safest place you could be.

104
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,735
Thank you.

105
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:04,827
And my wife and daughter back
home thank you, too, sir.

106
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,365
These cold seams are
pretty significant.

107
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,541
- Hey.
- Hi.

108
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:23,154
Would you give us
a minute? Thanks.

109
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,251
Have  you been
watching the news?

110
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:27,770
Why?

111
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:29,093
It's Lincoln.

112
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,277
I didn't do it.

113
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:38,570
Terrence Steadman?
The Vice President's brother.

114
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,226
Do you have any idea what
they're gonna do to you?

115
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:44,922
I didn't do it, man, it was a setup.
I didn't do it.

116
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:46,295
You knew him.

117
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:48,238
- Who?
- Steadman.

118
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:48,991
No.

119
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,903
- You worked for his company.
- So what?

120
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,612
From which you were
fired a few weeks ago.

121
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,799
I loaded containers in the warehouse.
Never met the guy.

122
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,738
What the hell, Mike? You sound
like one of the damn detectives.

123
00:09:57,768 --> 00:10:00,722
- I'm just saying...
- You think I did it?

124
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,245
I heard you owe
someone 90 grand.

125
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,137
- Who told you that?
- People talk.

126
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:16,543
And I know Steadman
had a lot of money.

127
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:19,058
I may be a lot of things,
but I'm not a murderer.

128
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,807
Then what were you doing
in that garage last night?

129
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:27,487
You admitted to the
police you were there.

130
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,024
Honestly, Linc,
I don't know how it's come to this.

131
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,448
And you can't keep
blaming Mom for dying

132
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:40,831
and Dad for leaving,
because I was there, too.

133
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,528
Difference is, I got out.

134
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,716
Mom had life insurance, I took my half,
put myself through school,

135
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:53,434
What did you do with
your half, Linc?

136
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:58,134
Everything's not how
it looks, Michael.

137
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:01,869
I hope for your sake,
that's true.

138
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:05,912
Here... here is where we
want the turn to anger.

139
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:08,186
Trust me,
that won't be a problem.

140
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:11,799
Now remember to stress his
record as a repeat offender.

141
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:14,623
We need the public behind us
if we want the death penalty.

142
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:17,922
And where are we with
Governor Tancredi?

143
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,528
He has aspirations.
He won't be a problem.

144
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,921
Uh, 30 seconds,
Madam Vice President.

145
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,718
The papers have
already crucified him.

146
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,955
The police say they got a phone
call right after the murder

147
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,907
from someone claiming they saw
Lincoln running from the garage.

148
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,472
He was into someone
for 90 grand.

149
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:39,553
What do you need that kind of money for?
Drugs? Bribes?

150
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:41,791
Forget about what
you want to be true.

151
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,194
Let's look at this objectively.

152
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,981
- Maybe you should, too.
- I am.

153
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,747
All right, you know what?
I promised I wouldn't say anything,

154
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:49,409
but I'm getting tired of
you talking about him

155
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,546
like he's some guy from the
neighborhood that you used to know.

156
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:53,476
He's your brother.

157
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,715
I know, and I know he helped you
out with your dad back in the day,

158
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:57,760
but you should see the
kind of person he is now--

159
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,744
the kind of people he
keeps friends with.

160
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,597
You want to know what
the 90 grand was for?

161
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,528
- I think I do.
- You.

162
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,126
What  do you mean?

163
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,661
The money you got when you were 18 years
old from your mother's life insurance.

164
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:09,986
The money that paid
for your degree,

165
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:12,357
that got you this job,
that bought you your loft.

166
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:15,737
Your mother never had life insurance.
That money came from Lincoln.

167
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:19,634
- How?
- He borrowed it.

168
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:20,879
Knew it would be
tough to pay back,

169
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,687
but that didn't matter,
because he thought you deserved it.

170
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:26,968
He also knew you'd never accept
it if you knew it came from him.

171
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,524
Michael....

172
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:32,845
you are where you are
because of your brother.

173
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,777
You're telling me he is
where he is because of me?

174
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,815
Why?

175
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,507
Why didn't you tell
me about the money?

176
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:52,123
- No need to.
- Lincoln...

177
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:54,180
Who told you? Veronica?

178
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,674
What did she make of all this?
About me?

179
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,302
I don't know.

180
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,928
Glad she got out
when she did, huh?

181
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,163
You know how she
feels about you.

182
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:08,968
It's been the same way
ever since we were kids.

183
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:10,799
Yeah.

184
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,938
Linc...

185
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:19,772
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

186
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:23,464
The night you called.

187
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:27,342
If we talked,
maybe I could have stopped you...

188
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:30,156
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's not your fault.

189
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:33,037
Then whose is it?

190
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,309
Listen up.

191
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,306
You need to forget about this.

192
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:41,539
Move on.
Work hard, do what you do.

193
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:45,525
I can't do that.

194
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,511
Oh, yes, you can. And you will.

195
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,194
Here's the part I
don't understand.

196
00:13:58,334 --> 00:14:02,101
All the evidence is lining up in
a path that leads directly to you.

197
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,714
They say they have you on tape.

198
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:09,913
Pulling the trigger.

199
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,018
If you didn't kill
Terrence Steadman...

200
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,447
How the hell did someone
make it look like you did?

201
00:14:26,922 --> 00:14:28,680
Perfect.

202
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:30,945
Perfect's a strong word, Cuz.

203
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,669
I got strong feelings, bro.

204
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,466
I'm telling you,
she might be the one.

205
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:39,273
- She from the block?
- Nope. Uptown. Pill hill.

206
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:43,404
Do you think you could hold
on to a girl from the PH?

207
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:45,017
I want to take
her out to dinner.

208
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,160
You'll see.
Someplace real nice.

209
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,010
Come on, Fernando.

210
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,731
How are you going to
afford a place like that?

211
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,652
- Open the drawer!
- Hey, hey, okay!

212
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:05,390
- Open the drawer! Yo, yo!
-Okay, okay!

213
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
- Quick! Quick! Quick!
- All right, okay!

214
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:08,593
Now!

215
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,501
Actually... This is all I need.

216
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,042
Okay.

217
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:23,063
Appreciate your business, man.

218
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,440
Ah...

219
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:47,643
I brought you a gift
from the hospital.

220
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,341
Oh! Oh...

221
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,956
I brought you a gift
from the hospital.

222
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:57,277
I'm telling you,
this is like Christmas.

223
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,362
And you...
work at the north pole.

224
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,608
If the north pole had
gunshot wounds and...

225
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:06,831
Seriously, I don't know
how you work there.

226
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:09,152
What do you mean?

227
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:12,576
I like to help people.

228
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:15,312
And you like helping yourself.

229
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:19,655
And you like
helping your friend.

230
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,177
Oh, my God.

231
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,364
Oh, my God!

232
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:42,910
Call somebody!
Who's got a telephone?! Call 911!

233
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:51,576
Help!

234
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,147
Are you a doctor?

235
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,700
Well, do something!

236
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:47,469
At ease.

237
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,964
The whiskey that you ordered, sir,
will be here in a couple of days.

238
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:53,844
That's  fine. I actually brought you here
to talk to you about something else.

239
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:56,427
Prisoner abuse
report you filed?

240
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,519
Yes, sir.

241
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:00,449
I need to know how far you're
willing to go with this.

242
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:01,935
Whatever it takes, sir.

243
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:04,387
I particularly have no love
for the desert donkeys,

244
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,456
but I do have some for
the Geneva Convention.

245
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:07,890
Something like this gets out,

246
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,654
might open up our boys to
similar treatment from the enemy.

247
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:11,995
I understand that, sir.

248
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,951
But I'm not planning on
calling a press conference.

249
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:19,364
What I'm saying is,
what I saw was wrong,

250
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,349
and someone needs to take
responsibility for it, sir.

251
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,591
All right.

252
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,055
Please take Mr.
Franklin into custody.

253
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,811
What? What the hell
is going on, sir?!

254
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,755
Sergeant Franklin,
I'm hereby recommending

255
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,999
that you be dishonorably discharged
from the United States Army.

256
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,279
What?! For what?

257
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,407
For engaging in illegal,
black market...

258
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,162
You asked me to get that stuff!

259
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,055
I kept it to myself.
Maybe you should learn to do the same.

260
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:50,941
You can't do this.
You can't do this!

261
00:19:51,081 --> 00:19:52,745
You cannot do this!

262
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,707
Has the jury reached a verdict?

263
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,477
We have, Your Honor.

264
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:00,807
What say you?

265
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:04,948
In the matter of The People of The
State of Illinois v. Lincoln Burrows,

266
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:07,086
on the count of murder
in the first degree,

267
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:10,166
we find the defendant guilty.

268
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:14,232
The defendant will remain in
custody until one week from today,

269
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:16,445
when we commence
the penalty phase.

270
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,493
Lincoln.

271
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,315
I'm so sorry, Linc.

272
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,612
Don't be. It's not your fault.

273
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,346
- Know what I like?
- Hmm?

274
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,411
How after we make love...

275
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,324
you  get this little puddle of
water in your belly button.

276
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,238
Fernando, that's sweat!

277
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,847
And get out of there!
It's disgusting there!

278
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,392
I think it's beautiful.

279
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:10,630
I think you're beautiful.

280
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:14,496
What do you want, Fernando?

281
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,706
Oh, you got to give me
a few more minutes.

282
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:19,001
Stop!

283
00:21:20,524 --> 00:21:25,379
From the future.
What do you want from the future?

284
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,751
Would you run if I said you?

285
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:34,397
Would you chase me if I did?

286
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,887
I don't get it.

287
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:43,136
All these commercials show brothers
learning computer skills,
new technologies.

288
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:46,841
Uncle Sam didn't teach me
nothing but cadence and kill.

289
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,691
You check over at
the Price-Mart?

290
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:50,112
Ain't hiring.

291
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:53,613
Especially with a brother with
a dishonorable discharge.

292
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:56,019
Goes right to the
bottom of the pile.

293
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,145
How long you think you
gonna keep this up?

294
00:21:58,175 --> 00:21:59,983
Until somebody gives me a job.

295
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:02,168
Nah, I'm talking
about lying to Kacee.

296
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:05,461
Your unit's been on leave
for a long damn time now.

297
00:22:05,636 --> 00:22:07,552
Pretty soon they gonna stop
thinking you're lucky,

298
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,452
and she's gonna start
asking questions.

299
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:12,067
Yeah, well, then I need to
start finding some answers.

300
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,697
Look, I happen to know of
an employment opportunity.

301
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:18,026
Come on, man,
you know I don't get down like that.

302
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,926
- It's just driving a truck.
- Yeah.

303
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:21,904
A to B. That's it.

304
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:24,733
Uncle Sam taught you how to
drive trucks, didn't he?

305
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:28,817
Yeah. He also taught
me to look inside.

306
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:33,127
It might be illegal,
but it's also rent.

307
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,090
A to B, your call.

308
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:37,873
Yeah.

309
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,204
They didn't even
let her testify.

310
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:43,044
- Who?
- Leticia Barris.

311
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:44,647
And that cop?

312
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:46,388
Changed his story
a dozen times.

313
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,972
What part of "move
on" don't you get?

314
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:55,309
After Mom died,
and it was just you and me.

315
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,878
I remember having
trouble sleeping,

316
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,620
never knowing where you were.

317
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:04,190
But when I'd wake
up in the morning,

318
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:07,058
there'd be this paper bird,

319
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,615
an origami crane,

320
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,537
sitting next to my bed.

321
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:14,650
And I never knew what
it meant exactly,

322
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:19,395
but I figured it was your way of letting
me know you were checking in on me.

323
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:27,324
Anyway, I looked it up.
The crane.

324
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:30,946
It stands for
familial obligation...

325
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:34,091
watching  out for your own.

326
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:39,854
Maybe it's my turn to
watch out for you.

327
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,127
So, same time tomorrow.

328
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,996
No, man, they're, uh,

329
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,760
transferring me to a prison where
I wait until they execute me.

330
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:56,044
- Can I still visit?
- Yeah.

331
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,039
It's not that far.
Place called Fox River.

332
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,877
- Fox River?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,937
Why?

334
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,558
Nothing.

335
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:11,861
How come there's four?

336
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:17,003
Well, uh, Mommy's new friend is
coming over for dinner again.

337
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:18,807
Again?

338
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:20,403
He just came over last night.

339
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:23,679
- I like him.
- Well, I do, too.

340
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:25,990
And I want you both
to be extra polite,

341
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:29,463
because he's stopping by Malarkey's
on his way home from work,

342
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,598
and he's bringing us
a really good meal.

343
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:36,371
In fact,
you two go wash your hands.

344
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:51,092
Evening, Mrs. Hollander.

345
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:54,300
Don't you look
lovely this evening.

346
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:30,930
Ay...

347
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,966
- I'm gonna do it.
- Do what?

348
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:38,556
I'm gonna propose to Maricruz.

349
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,916
Are you serious?

350
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:42,704
When?

351
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:44,728
As soon as I can
afford the ring.

352
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:47,367
So what, like, 10, 20 years?

353
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:50,514
What's your problem, man?

354
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:52,427
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

355
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,546
I'm just trying to protect you.

356
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:56,931
What, you think you can give
her everything she wants?

357
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:59,165
Takes more than
money to do that.

358
00:26:03,643 --> 00:26:06,119
You know I love you, Cuz.

359
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:12,979
Just think you should
look at the reality here.

360
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,074
Seriously, Primo,

361
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,067
how are you gonna afford a ring
for a girl like that, huh?

362
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:28,234
- Open the door!
- Hey, hey, hey, okay, okay!

363
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:29,209
Now!

364
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:31,279
Hey, this fine?

365
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:34,577
Actually, I'm gonna need a
little bit more this time.

366
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:35,942
Okay, okay.

367
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:40,872
Here you go.

368
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:45,736
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

369
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,797
Anyone asking questions?

370
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:16,643
Not loud enough to hear.

371
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:22,638
God, I can't remember the last time
I was this much of a nervous wreck.

372
00:27:23,104 --> 00:27:26,107
School Board,
second term, 1992?

373
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:33,358
Secluded, no real access roads,
perfect for what you're looking for.

374
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,065
- Only one problem.
- What's that?

375
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,664
It's over $2 million.

376
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:42,831
Didn't my poor brother, Terrence,
leave something for me in his will?

377
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:45,033
You'd have to ask your
accountants, ma'am.

378
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:48,189
Tell them to use that money.

379
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:52,303
I'm paying for his mistake;
he can pay for the damn house.

380
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:55,990
And I've been clean
for 18 months now.

381
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,918
I'll tell you,
I've never been happier.

382
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:02,949
That actually might
be the wrong word.

383
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:06,610
I'll be honest, there were times I
was using I left pretty damn happy.

384
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:12,184
But... what I feel is different now.
I feel, uh...

385
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:15,283
I feel joy.

386
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,625
So here I am.

387
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,004
I know that...

388
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:24,247
all I can do every day
is the next right thing.

389
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:28,942
And I think, for me right now,
that means going back to work.

390
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:32,505
I, uh... I don't know, maybe...

391
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:35,244
maybe counseling, um...

392
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,875
I want to help people get from
where I've been to where I am.

393
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,631
Hey, Sara.

394
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,954
You used to be a doctor, right?

395
00:28:47,117 --> 00:28:49,643
Uh, I still am, in theory. Why?

396
00:28:49,736 --> 00:28:51,399
Well, I was just thinking that

397
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:53,943
I might know of a job
opening where I work.

398
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,343
Really? Where's that?

399
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:58,166
- You ever heard of Fox River?
- The prison?

400
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:01,225
Yeah. I know it sounds
like a strange idea.

401
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,023
Uh, maybe...

402
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,061
maybe you and I could, uh...

403
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,772
maybe we could talk
about it over dinner.

404
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,320
I got a gift card to the Red
Lobster over off the interstate.

405
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:13,459
Oh, my God. Um...

406
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,959
Thank you. Really. Uh...

407
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:21,863
I... Tonight's kind of my night
to work on my resume. Um...

408
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:22,912
Oh.

409
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:26,277
Yeah. 'Course.

410
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,262
Sorry. I, uh...

411
00:29:28,494 --> 00:29:32,552
But thank you, really,
for the, um, the referral.

412
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,855
- Fox River.
- Yeah.

413
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:38,873
You know, math was never my best
subject, either. But, um...

414
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:42,193
I got through it by
learning some new tricks.

415
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:44,298
You want to learn
some tricks, Gracey?

416
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:47,622
- Like what?
- Like your nine-times tables.

417
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:51,668
Ready? Nine times one is...

418
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:52,988
Nine.

419
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:55,935
Nine times two is...

420
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,178
- Eight... een.
- Teen. Yeah.

421
00:30:58,352 --> 00:31:02,874
- Nine times three is...
- Twenty-seven!

422
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,678
Exactly. You got it.
Now keep on going.

423
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,362
Mommy, Mommy,
did you see what Teddy taught me?

424
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:11,869
Yes. That's great, honey.
Go show your brother.

425
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,966
Zack, look. Nine times one...

426
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:16,962
Thank you.

427
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:08,400
Right, right, left, left...

428
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:48,584
Hey. Um, thank you.

429
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:53,087
Let me get your change.

430
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:13,998
You want your change?

431
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,021
Keep it.

432
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:39,488
- Hey.
- Hey.

433
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,069
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetheart, come here.

434
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,419
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

435
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:48,828
You know, I got, uh...

436
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,372
I got to tell you something.

437
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:57,481
And it's going to be
really hard to hear.

438
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:02,074
- Okay.
- Okay.

439
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,158
What?

440
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,651
Well, the thing is...

441
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:23,129
...I'm being shipped back off.

442
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:24,676
What?

443
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:26,165
Yeah, um,

444
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:30,941
my unit just got called back
for another tour, baby.

445
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,575
I can't believe it.

446
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,480
Deployment orders
just came down.

447
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,680
With the Italians pulling
out and everything...

448
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,847
- Tell them no, Daddy!
- Aw.

449
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,508
Yo, B!

450
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,433
Come here, baby.

451
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,130
Can you give me a hand
with something out back?

452
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:03,101
That's my sister you're
lying to in there.

453
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:08,120
Which is why I know you're gonna
take care of them when I'm gone.

454
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,940
This is crazy.

455
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,711
Maybe.

456
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:13,986
So is the way I got
kicked out the Army.

457
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:17,106
So's the way I got busted
for driving that truck.

458
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:21,073
And so's the way I feel
about that woman up in there.

459
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:23,676
She married a military man,

460
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:27,181
who knows how to take
care of his business.

461
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:30,498
Now, if I look like one
of these thugs, now...

462
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,420
what do you think
she's gonna do? Huh?

463
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:36,665
How long you think she's gonna
wait for me while I'm inside?

464
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,993
I don't know, man.

465
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,476
You owe me this, man.

466
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:48,984
Don't you ever let her know where I am.
You feel me?

467
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:29,638
Usually, I do this
the other way.

468
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:32,895
- Why do you want to...
- I want what I want.

469
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:42,048
You show this to anyone else...

470
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,622
I am calling the
whole thing off.

471
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:07,795
My therapist said...

472
00:38:08,824 --> 00:38:11,232
she said that I'm
holding too much in

473
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,376
and that I need to confront you

474
00:38:14,844 --> 00:38:17,415
to let you know how
betrayed I feel.

475
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,961
I let you into my life,
my home...

476
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:25,487
My God,
I let you near my children!

477
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:26,994
I never touched them.

478
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:29,471
You should have told
me what you were.

479
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:34,083
You think you're the only
one who feels betrayed?

480
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:42,760
I... loved you, Susan.

481
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,208
Real love.
For the first time in my life.

482
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,221
And then to have
you do me like that,

483
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,990
to just throw me out to the dogs,
just toss me out the back door like...

484
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:04,184
- You're a murderer, Teddy!
- That's not...

485
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:12,555
I have sinned in the past,
but when I met you, that

486
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:16,568
person, that one that did all
those terrible things, he died,

487
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,597
and I was reborn.

488
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:22,621
By the grace of your love,
I was a...

489
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:26,300
a new man, a better man.

490
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:34,916
No. That doesn't just erase the man
who killed 6 students in Alabama.

491
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:41,253
I guess that's
where you're right.

492
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:48,843
'Cause when you sent me here,
to this place, with these people,

493
00:39:50,133 --> 00:39:53,875
it brought that old,
dirty bastard right back home.

494
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,268
In fact,
there was a candle in the window,

495
00:40:00,937 --> 00:40:04,253
just waiting for me to
walk up them front steps.

496
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,237
You know, I'm gonna...

497
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,827
I'm gonna get out
of here someday.

498
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:25,706
And when I do...

499
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:35,617
...don't think I won't remember what
your front steps look like, Susan.

500
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:07,169
It's almost over.

501
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,464
Burrows will be dead soon, and then
things will start getting back
to normal.

502
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:23,122
I know that you've
been through a lot,

503
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,453
but I promise you,
the worst is now behind us.

504
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:43,265
My dear sister...

505
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:48,345
...you have no idea
what I've been through.

506
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,080
Good night, Terrence.
