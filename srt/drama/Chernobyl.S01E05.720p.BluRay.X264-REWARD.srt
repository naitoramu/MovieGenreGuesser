1
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,321
I hear they might
promote Bryukhanov.

2
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,201
This little problem
we have with the safety test...

3
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,401
..if it's
completed successfully...

4
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,241
..yes, I think promotion's
very likely.

5
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,361
Who knows? Maybe Moscow.

6
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,641
Naturally, they'll put me
in charge once he's gone

7
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:39,081
and then I'll need someone
to take my old job.

8
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,881
I could pitch Sitnikov.

9
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,801
I would like to be considered.

10
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,281
We'll keep that in mind.

11
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:01,641
Viktor Petrovich.

12
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:04,281
Preparations for the test
have gone smoothly.

13
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,961
Comrade Dyatlov's been working
per my instructions.

14
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,761
And Reactor4 output's
been reduced to 1600 megawatts.

15
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:14,721
With your approval, we're ready
to continue lowering power...

16
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,361
It'll have to wait.

17
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:18,961
Is er...

18
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,521
Are you going to ask me
if there's a problem, Nikolai?

19
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,361
You can't read a fucking face?

20
00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:26,401
Three years
I've tried to finish this test.

21
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:28,081
Three years.

22
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:36,921
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

23
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,881
He says we can't lower power
further for another ten hours.

24
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,041
A grid controller?
Where does he get off...

25
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:45,161
It's not the grid controller's
decision, Dyatlov.

26
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,841
It's the end of the month.

27
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,281
All the productivity quotas.

28
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,121
Everyone's working overtime,
the factories need power,

29
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,201
someone's pushing down
from above.

30
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,001
Not that we'll ever know who.

31
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:06,961
So, do we have to scrap it,
or what?

32
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,841
No, I don't think so.

33
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:12,121
No, if we need to wait
ten hours, we wait.

34
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:15,121
Running at half power, we're not
going to have stability issues?

35
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:17,721
- No, I should think...
- I'm not asking you.

36
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,161
It's safe.

37
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:24,001
We'll maintain at 1600.

38
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,401
I'll go home, get some sleep,
come back tonight.

39
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,881
We'll proceed then.

40
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,081
I'll personally supervise
the test...

41
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,361
..and it will be completed.

42
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:38,161
Well, I'm not waiting around.

43
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,601
Call me when it's done.

44
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:15,601
How do you feel?

45
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:20,281
You went to the doctor
yesterday. How is your health?

46
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,121
You don't know?

47
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,761
From Vienna.
Do you read German?

48
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:33,521
It says, "At last, a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

49
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,241
Obviously, I resent the
insinuation but it's fair to say

50
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,121
you made an excellent impression
at the conference.

51
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,281
Turns out
you're quite good at this.

52
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,241
At what? Lying?

53
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:45,801
Statecraft, Legasov.

54
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,161
Statecraft.

55
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:49,321
The West is now satisfied

56
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:52,481
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error.

57
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,321
Which it essentially was.

58
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,201
We have you to thank for that.

59
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,961
And we intend to.

60
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:03,721
Hero of the Soviet Union.

61
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:06,201
Our highest honour.

62
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,441
They haven't even
given it to me.

63
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,521
Promotion to Director
of the Kurchatov Institute.

64
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:16,921
I'm humbled.

65
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:19,881
I don't think there's anything
humble about you,

66
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,401
Valery Alexeyevich.

67
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,521
And these rewards
are not yours yet.

68
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,601
First, your testimony
at the trial.

69
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,361
Comrade Charkov, I understand
my duty to the state.

70
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:35,401
But you gave us assurances
the reactors would be made safe.

71
00:07:35,561 --> 00:07:37,721
It's been months.
No changes have been made,

72
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,401
no changes even discussed.

73
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,481
First, the trial.

74
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,001
Once it's over,
we will have our villains,

75
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:48,281
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

76
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,681
After that,
we can deal with the reactors.

77
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,841
Did you take a train?

78
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,841
Yes, I took a train.

79
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,041
Now, let's talk about Vienna.

80
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:22,801
I'm not here to scold you.

81
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,561
I know how the world works,

82
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,281
despite what Shcherbina says.

83
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:30,241
So... why are you here?

84
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,201
Because I'm brutally stubborn.

85
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,281
Which you were hoping for.

86
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:43,641
Charkov is saying they will fix
the reactors after the trial.

87
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,841
Do you believe him?

88
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,961
The state will never
willingly fix the reactors,

89
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,721
because acknowledging
the problem

90
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,401
means admitting that they lied.

91
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,001
They will have to be forced.

92
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:06,881
At the trial, you're going
to tell the truth.

93
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:10,201
You're going to convince a jury.

94
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,561
It's a show trial!

95
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,881
The jury's already been
handed their verdict.

96
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,121
I'm not talking about them.

97
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,721
The Central Committee

98
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,241
have invited members of
the scientific community

99
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:23,761
to observe the trial.

100
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:27,201
Our colleagues from Kurchatov,

101
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,721
from Sredmash, from Minenergo,

102
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:31,521
they will be sitting
in the crowd,

103
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,321
listening to every word
you say -

104
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,161
a jury that
only we know is there.

105
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:36,881
And when your testimony arrives

106
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,681
at the moment of
the explosion...

107
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,401
..that is when our jury
will finally hear the truth.

108
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,321
And do what with it?

109
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:46,841
Insist on reform.

110
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,681
Not just to the RBMK,
but the entire industry.

111
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:51,961
No, no, no, no, no.

112
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:54,081
They can't function without us.
If we...

113
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,561
Do you know
what happened to Volkov,

114
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,881
the man whose report you found?

115
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,961
They just removed him from
his position at the institute.

116
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:05,641
Sacked,
for the crime of knowing.

117
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,961
And you think
that these scientists,

118
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:11,721
hand-picked
to witness a show trial,

119
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:15,121
will somehow be stirred
into action by me,

120
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:18,881
because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the state?

121
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,001
- Yes.
- Why?

122
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:24,801
Because you're Valery Legasov
and you mean something.

123
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:29,441
I'd like to think that if I
spoke out, it would be enough.

124
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,121
But I know how the world works.

125
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,161
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

126
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,081
You told me to find out
what happened.

127
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:46,041
I spoke to dozens of people.

128
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,761
Every word they said,
I wrote down.

129
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,441
All in these books.

130
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,921
These are the ones
who are still alive,

131
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,521
these are the ones who are dead.

132
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,761
They died rescuing each other,
putting out fires,

133
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,281
tending to the wounded.

134
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,441
They didn't hesitate,
they didn't waver,

135
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,121
they simply did
what had to be done.

136
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,721
So have I.

137
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,801
So have I.

138
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,161
I went willingly
to an open reactor,

139
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:15,121
so I've already given my life.

140
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:18,921
Isn't that enough?

141
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:21,201
No, I'm sorry, but it is not.

142
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,801
The Central Committee

143
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:30,841
of the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union

144
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,321
and Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of the USSR

145
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:35,161
is determined that justice
be carried out

146
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:36,721
on behalf of the people

147
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,161
in accordance with
the general goal of our Party,

148
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:43,201
as determined by its 20th,
21st and 22nd Congresses,

149
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,641
which is a Leninist goal.

150
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,281
It was, is and will be

151
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,361
the only immutable goal
in the Soviet state.

152
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,041
The path of Leninist principles

153
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:53,001
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed,

154
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,841
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet people,

155
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,321
its hopes and aspirations

156
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,481
as we guide the life
of the Party and state.

157
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,681
This session of court
is now open.

158
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,241
Comrade Judge
Milan Kadnikov presiding.

159
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:11,161
Indictments - Viktor Bryukhanov,
Anatoly Dyatlov,

160
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,881
Nikolai Fomin

161
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,121
are accused of violating
Article 220, Section 2

162
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,401
of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

163
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:22,561
resulting in a nuclear disaster
on April 26th, 1986.

164
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:25,881
The state calls witnesses
Comrade Khomyuk

165
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,081
of the Belarussian
Nuclear Institute,

166
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:32,161
Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy,

167
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,961
and Comrade Boris
Edvokimovich Shcherbina,

168
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:39,001
Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

169
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,721
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

170
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:19,441
It began with, of all things,
a safety test.

171
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,361
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

172
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:27,361
Reactor No.4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

173
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:31,881
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

174
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,801
And 11 days later,
on the last day of the year,

175
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:41,161
plant director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document...

176
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:47,401
..certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

177
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,601
As a result
of finishing the work

178
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,241
before the end of the year...

179
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:56,721
..Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labour.

180
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,801
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labour.

181
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,481
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

182
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,201
But the work was not finished.

183
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:15,041
This document was a lie.

184
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,681
In order to sign
this certificate,

185
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:23,121
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

186
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,961
and yet one remained.

187
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:32,201
A nuclear reactor generates heat
in the core, here.

188
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,161
A series of pumps,
here and here,

189
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:38,401
send a constant flow of
cooling water through the core.

190
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,921
The core's heat
turns the water to steam

191
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,121
and the steam
spins the turbine here,

192
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,001
and the result is electricity.

193
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,521
But what if a power plant
has no power?

194
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,441
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted -

195
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:57,881
a blackout, equipment failure
or an attack by a foreign enemy?

196
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,561
If there's no power,

197
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,441
the pumps cannot move water
through the core,

198
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:07,761
and without water, the core
overheats, the fuel melts down.

199
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,881
In short, a nuclear disaster.

200
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:15,081
The solution: three diesel fuel
backup generators, here.

201
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,681
So, problem solved?

202
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,561
No.

203
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:22,041
Bryukhanov knew the problem
was not solved at all.

204
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:25,321
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

205
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,361
to reach the speed required

206
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:29,801
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown.

207
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,041
And by that time,
it would be too late.

208
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,041
So we arrive at the safety test.

209
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,721
The theory was this:

210
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:43,161
if the facility lost power, the
turbine which had been spinning

211
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,121
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

212
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,441
What if you could take

213
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,401
the electricity
it was still generating

214
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:51,921
and transfer it to the pumps?

215
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:53,481
What if the dying turbine

216
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,321
could keep the pumps working
long enough

217
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:59,281
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

218
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,601
Any questions?

219
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,041
No. Continue, please.

220
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,201
To test this theory...

221
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,521
..the reactor is placed in
a reduced power mode,

222
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,321
700 megawatts,

223
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,921
to simulate
a blackout condition.

224
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:23,121
Then the turbines
are turned off,

225
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,921
and as they slowly spin down,

226
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:26,881
their electrical output
is measured,

227
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,001
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

228
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:31,841
The science is strong.

229
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:37,241
But a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

230
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,841
The first time they tried,
they failed.

231
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,401
The <i>second</i> time they tried,
they failed.

232
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:47,361
The <i>third</i> time they tried,
they failed.

233
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,121
The fourth time they tried...

234
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:54,201
..was April 26th, 1986.

235
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,521
Comrade Khomyuk.

236
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,481
To understand
what happened that night,

237
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,161
we have to go back
ten hours earlier:

238
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:37,281
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

239
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,881
By two in the afternoon, the
reactor has been lowered by half

240
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,721
from its normal output level
of 3200 megawatts,

241
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,241
to 1600 megawatts,

242
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,121
and is stable
and ready to be reduced

243
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:50,561
to its final output level
for the test: 700 megawatts.

244
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:54,801
But, before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

245
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,561
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

246
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,921
a further reduction in
electricity till after midnight.

247
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:05,401
They are asking
for a ten-hour delay.

248
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,321
This is the first
critical moment,

249
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,041
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

250
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:13,641
Competent management would have
insisted on cancelling the test.

251
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:17,401
These three men
allowed it to proceed.

252
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:20,961
Why was this delay so dangerous?

253
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,121
It created two problems.

254
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,721
One of them
is scientific in nature.

255
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:29,641
And the other is very human.

256
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:32,081
This is the one
we will consider first.

257
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:34,721
<i>At midnight...</i>

258
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,441
<i>there is a shift change.</i>

259
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,081
- Khodemchuk...
- Forget it. Find another fool.

260
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:56,761
Toptunov, want to buy
a motorcycle?

261
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,081
Toptunov?
He's just a little boy.

262
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,361
He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

263
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,401
Hair? Is that what's on his lip?

264
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,001
Leonid Fedorovych?

265
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:09,441
Akimov says come to the
control room as soon as you can.

266
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,281
- He's already here?
- He came in early.

267
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,161
Something about a test.

268
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,921
You see? Desperate!

269
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,201
Sasha.

270
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,841
You know the test they were
supposed to run?

271
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,441
Turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

272
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,041
They couldn't do it
on the dayshift,

273
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:37,601
so they've given it to us.

274
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:38,921
To us?

275
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,001
- We don't know what...
- Ssh.

276
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,001
- We don't know what it is.
- It's fine.

277
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,161
We take it down to 700,
hold it there.

278
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:48,841
The rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum.

279
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,161
But... Dyatlov
is gonna be supervising.

280
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,201
I have to do something
I've never done

281
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:54,961
with Dyatlov
looking over my shoulder?

282
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:57,761
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

283
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,921
I'm just looking
at the instructions now.

284
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,121
Are we supposed to do those,
or not?

285
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,201
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

286
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:17,401
I have the manual
for the rundown test.

287
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,721
You did it last year on...

288
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,681
Yes, in the programme, there's
instructions of what to do.

289
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:27,121
Well, there's a lot of things
crossed out, what should I...

290
00:22:28,201 --> 00:22:29,721
Well, what should I...

291
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,201
What, you're sure?

292
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,721
Right. Thank you.

293
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:40,161
He says to follow
the crossed-out instructions.

294
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:42,121
Then why are they crossed out?

295
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:50,441
We've been cleared
to run the test.

296
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,161
1600, good.

297
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:55,761
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

298
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,561
- Well...
- Yes, absolutely.

299
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,761
Stolyarchuk?

300
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,361
- Yes.
- Kirschenbaum?

301
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:04,521
I haven't reviewed.
We only just found out.

302
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,561
There. Review it.

303
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:08,441
Or you can just do
what I tell you.

304
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:11,521
I think even you, as stupid
as you are, can manage that.

305
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,201
Well, let's go.

306
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:20,041
Switch the turbine off while
the reactor's still running?

307
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,201
- That's not good...
- Shut up and do your job!

308
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,041
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

309
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:31,401
I've never done this with
the power so low before.

310
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:33,201
It's OK, I'm with you.

311
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:39,681
Reducing power to 700.

312
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,761
<i>I want you to think
of Yuri Gagarin.</i>

313
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,841
I want you to imagine
that he has been told nothing

314
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,201
of his mission into space

315
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,441
until the moment
that he is on the launch pad.

316
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:54,561
I want you to imagine that all
he has is a list of instructions

317
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,321
that he has never seen before,

318
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,601
some of which
have been crossed out.

319
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,441
This is exactly
what was happening

320
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:02,481
in the control room
of Reactor4.

321
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,561
The nightshift had not been
trained to do the experiment.

322
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:08,321
They hadn't even been warned
it was happening.

323
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,241
Leonid Toptunov,

324
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,601
the operator responsible
for controlling and stabilising

325
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,561
the reactor that night was...

326
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,561
..all of 25 years old.

327
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:23,681
And his total experience
on the job: four months.

328
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:28,521
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

329
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,761
But inside the reactor core,

330
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,041
in the space between
the atoms themselves,

331
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:38,241
something far more dangerous
is forming: a poison.

332
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:42,281
The time is 28-past midnight.

333
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:01,401
Comrade Legasov.

334
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,601
I'm pleased to see
some of my colleagues here

335
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:42,241
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

336
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,041
But you don't need to be
a nuclear scientist

337
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:48,481
to understand what happened
at Chernobyl.

338
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:50,241
You only need to know this:

339
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,201
there are essentially
two things that happen

340
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:55,521
inside a nuclear reactor.

341
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,241
The reactivity,
which generates power,

342
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:01,081
either goes up or it goes down.

343
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,841
That's it.

344
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,521
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

345
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:11,041
Uranium fuel.

346
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:17,401
As uranium atoms split apart
and collide, reactivity goes up.

347
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:19,401
If you don't balance
the reactivity,

348
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:20,801
it never stops rising.

349
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:22,361
So...

350
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:25,561
..boron control rods.

351
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:30,241
They reduce reactivity,
like brakes on a car.

352
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:36,001
But there's a third factor
to consider: water.

353
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,281
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

354
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:42,561
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a void.

355
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:46,121
In an RBMK reactor of the type
used at Chernobyl,

356
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:50,441
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient".

357
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:52,201
What does that mean?

358
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,721
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

359
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,961
the higher the reactivity,

360
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,481
which means more heat,

361
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,001
which means more steam,
which means...

362
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:06,721
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

363
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,481
And we would,
were it not for this...

364
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:19,881
And we would,
were it not for this:

365
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,841
the negative temperature
coefficient.

366
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:28,441
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive.

367
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,841
So...

368
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:32,681
..fuel increases reactivity.

369
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:35,801
Control rods and water
reduce it.

370
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:38,001
Steam increases it.

371
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:40,881
The rise in temperature
reduces it.

372
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:46,481
This is the invisible dance
that powers entire cities

373
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,561
without smoke or flame.

374
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:51,161
And... it is beautiful...

375
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:54,241
..when things are normal.

376
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:58,161
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

377
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:01,361
it breaks down into
a new element, xenon.

378
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:03,881
Xenon reduces reactivity.

379
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:07,401
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

380
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,961
When the core is running
at full power,

381
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,801
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

382
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:16,641
But, because of the delay,
Chernobyl Reactor 4

383
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,841
has been held at half power
for ten hours.

384
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,321
The xenon did not burn away.

385
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:27,121
It built up, poisoning the core.

386
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,401
We're starting to lose balance.

387
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:34,361
At 28 minutes past midnight,

388
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:37,321
the reactor is now
primed to slow down.

389
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:41,001
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

390
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:44,881
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

391
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,041
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

392
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:48,801
After all, you don't work in

393
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,121
the control room
of a nuclear power plant.

394
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:54,561
But, as it turned out,

395
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:58,201
the men who did
didn't understand it either.

396
00:29:04,081 --> 00:29:05,841
Easy now.

397
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:08,841
Take it down.
Good.

398
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,041
- Like that.
- You should've finished by now.

399
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,401
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

400
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:14,801
You're procrastinating!

401
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,881
Ten other men in this plant
would've done it already.

402
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:20,201
Keep working.
You're doing fine.

403
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:31,841
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

404
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,841
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

405
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:53,801
OK, very slow now.

406
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:56,721
Let's... ease it down to 700.

407
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:01,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow.

408
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,081
I-I didn't move any rods there.

409
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:14,801
- What is this?
- I'm not even touching it.

410
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:42,241
We did everything right.
Maybe the core is poisoned.

411
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:44,481
If so, then
you didn't do everything right.

412
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,961
Because you're choking
my reactor! Get it back up!

413
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:48,641
I think if we turn off LAC,

414
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,561
it may be possible
to get more control.

415
00:30:50,721 --> 00:30:52,161
Do it. Go.

416
00:30:52,321 --> 00:30:54,801
Switch off local automatic
control, go to global.

417
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:56,401
Leonid.

418
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,121
LAC disabled,
Global control activated.

419
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,481
What did you do?

420
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:08,961
I-I did what you said,
I switched...

421
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:11,681
- Look at it!
- I don't understand.

422
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,481
Fucking amateurs,
you stalled the reactor.

423
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:17,361
- How did you get this job?
- Comrade Dyatlov...

424
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,801
You're gonna tell me you
did everything right again,

425
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,641
you incompetent arsehole?

426
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:24,321
I apologise for
this unsatisfactory result.

427
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:30,521
What are you doing?

428
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,641
We have to shut
all the way down.

429
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,081
- No.
- We could be in a xenon pit.

430
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,801
We have to shut down,
wait 24 hours.

431
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,601
Test's tonight.
Raise power to 700.

432
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:40,601
We can't raise the power
from here - the rules.

433
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:42,681
- Don't talk about rules.
- If we fall from 80%...

434
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:44,601
No, no,
we fell from 50% of power.

435
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:46,761
The rules don't say 50.
There is no rule!

436
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,561
Comrade Dyatlov...

437
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:51,041
I apologise, but what you're
saying makes no sense.

438
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,201
- Raise the power.
- No.

439
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,241
I won't do it. It isn't safe.

440
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:07,481
Safety first. Always.

441
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:10,321
I've been saying that
for 25 years.

442
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,441
That's how long I've done
this job. 25 years.

443
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,161
Is that longer than you, Akimov?

444
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:16,001
- Yes.
- Is it much longer?

445
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,481
Yes.

446
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:20,281
And you, with your mother's tit
barely out your mouth?

447
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,561
If I say it's safe, it's safe.

448
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:25,841
If the two of you disagree,

449
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,801
you don't have to work here,
and you won't.

450
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:29,961
But not just here.
You won't work at Kursk,

451
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:32,521
or Ignalina, or Leningrad,
or Novovoronezh.

452
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:35,561
You won't work anywhere
ever again. I'll see to it.

453
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:38,161
I think you know
I will see to it.

454
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:40,841
Raise the power.

455
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:46,601
I would like you to record
your command in...

456
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:48,761
Raise the power.

457
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,681
Together, then.

458
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,761
<i>I wasn't even there.</i>

459
00:33:10,641 --> 00:33:11,881
What?

460
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:16,161
I wasn't in the room
when they raised the power.

461
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:18,201
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

462
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:21,321
Comrade Legasov, you are
a witness, not a prosecutor.

463
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,601
I will ask the questions here.

464
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:26,321
If you weren't in the room,
then where were you?

465
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,081
The toilet.

466
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,321
The toilet?

467
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,641
Khomyuk interviewed everyone
who was in the control room.

468
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:40,001
They all told the same story.

469
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:44,841
"I knew what Dyatlov ordered
was wrong.

470
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:48,321
But if I didn't do what he said,
I would be fired."

471
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:52,881
Leonid Toptunov,
one day before he died.

472
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:55,761
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

473
00:33:55,921 --> 00:33:58,601
You ordered them to raise
the power. This is a fact.

474
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:10,521
The court is now in recess
for 30 minutes.

475
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,801
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

476
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,161
Not really, no.

477
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,361
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

478
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:07,321
The Jews were killed in pogroms
and Stalin forced the Poles out.

479
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:11,361
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

480
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,441
But after the war...

481
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:16,761
..people came to
live here anyway.

482
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:21,001
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

483
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,881
but they didn't care.

484
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,161
Dead Jews, dead Poles...

485
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:29,081
..but not them.

486
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,601
No-one ever thinks
it's going to happen to them.

487
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,601
And here we are.

488
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:48,561
How much time?

489
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:50,121
Maybe a year.

490
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,441
They call it a...

491
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:57,161
They call it a long illness. It
doesn't seem very long to me.

492
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,721
I know you told me,
and I believed you.

493
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:05,841
But time passed and I thought
it wouldn't happen to me.

494
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,601
I wasted it.

495
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,121
I wasted it all for nothing.

496
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,921
For nothing?

497
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,321
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

498
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:19,641
how unconcerned I was?

499
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:22,161
I don't believe much
that comes out of the Kremlin,

500
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,601
but when they told me

501
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:26,721
they were putting me
in charge of the clean-up,

502
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:29,561
and they said it wasn't serious,
I believed them.

503
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,961
You know why?

504
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,081
Because they put you in charge.

505
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:38,721
Yeah.

506
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:43,441
I'm an inconsequential man,
Valery.

507
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,401
That's all I've ever been.

508
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,481
I hoped that one day
I would matter, but I didn't.

509
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:54,481
I just stood next to people
who did.

510
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,721
There are other scientists
like me.

511
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:01,441
Any one of them
could have done what I did.

512
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,561
But you...

513
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:07,241
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed...

514
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:12,441
..men, material, lunar rovers...

515
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,881
..who else could have done
these things?

516
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,121
They heard me,
but they listened to you.

517
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:25,641
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies,

518
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:29,561
the entire congregation
of obedient fools,

519
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,521
they mistakenly sent
the one good man.

520
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,561
For God's sake, Boris...

521
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:39,801
..you were the one
who mattered most.

522
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:03,401
Ah, it's beautiful.

523
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,601
Comrade Legasov.

524
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,841
The time is 38-past midnight.

525
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:02,521
The reactor is nearly shut down.

526
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:04,881
The operators of Reactor 4
are locked on a path

527
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,961
that leads directly to disaster.

528
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:09,081
There's no way to turn back.

529
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:11,601
They do not yet know it,
but the die is cast.

530
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:15,841
At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

531
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,001
but none of it is burning away.

532
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:21,841
The reactor is
drowning in poison.

533
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:24,441
To make matters worse,

534
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:28,081
the reactor isn't hot enough
to produce sufficient steam.

535
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,721
The only way to safely
raise power from this state

536
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:35,081
is to do it very, very slowly,

537
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:38,041
over the course of 24 hours.

538
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,761
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

539
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:45,001
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action:

540
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:48,921
they begin pulling control rods
out, dozens at a time.

541
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,561
Halfway out, three-quarters
of the way out.

542
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:54,401
Still, the power does not budge.

543
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:57,201
So, they begin pulling them
all the way out.

544
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,121
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor4.

545
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:05,441
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

546
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,841
Remember, control rods
are the brakes on this car.

547
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,521
Of 211 rods...

548
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,641
..only six now remain
in the reactor.

549
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,281
As for the fuel, it's gone cold,

550
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:22,401
so the negative temperature
coefficient

551
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,041
is no longer weighing down
the reactivity.

552
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:28,761
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

553
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:32,881
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

554
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:35,681
The control rods are out,

555
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:38,281
the emergency system
has been disconnected.

556
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:40,481
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

557
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,601
is water and xenon.

558
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:46,681
It's one in the morning,
the test is minutes away.

559
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:23,401
I'm sorry, this is all we can
get. It's 200 megawatts.

560
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:25,201
We've pulled
almost everything out.

561
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,201
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

562
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:29,081
But the test requires 700.

563
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:31,561
Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.
Switch on pump four.

564
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,001
- Wait a second.
- Stolyarchuk.

565
00:41:33,161 --> 00:41:35,041
We haven't enough steam,
the turbine is too slow

566
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:36,441
for the test to deliver valid...

567
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,841
- It's enough.
- And if we add more water...

568
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:42,281
I said it's enough. I know
what I'm doing. Stolyarchuk.

569
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,161
Main pump four connected.

570
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,601
We should warn Khodemchuk
the pipes are gonna be...

571
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,361
Never mind him. Kirschenbaum.

572
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:57,641
The steam in the separator drum
is too low: five atmospheres.

573
00:41:57,801 --> 00:42:00,601
All right, let's all help him.
Get it up as best you can.

574
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:07,521
- We should stop.
- Turn that fucking thing off.

575
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,881
You have 15 minutes.

576
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,361
<i>15 minutes.</i>

577
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,521
<i>They may as well
have had 15 days.</i>

578
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:19,921
The problem they were facing
was not solvable:

579
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:22,481
the power was too low,
the water was too high.

580
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,761
The test was already ruined. The
results would've been useless.

581
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,201
But Dyatlov didn't care.

582
00:42:27,361 --> 00:42:30,121
All he wanted to do
was report a completed test.

583
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:35,921
<i>1:22 am.
Less than two minutes remain.</i>

584
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:41,361
<i>Yuvchenko, a mechanical
engineer, is in his office.</i>

585
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,241
<i>Perevozchenko,
reactor section foreman,</i>

586
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,881
<i>is in the refuelling hall,</i>

587
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:52,281
<i>high above the 1,000-tonne
steel reactor cover.</i>

588
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:58,161
<i>Degtaryenko, Khodemchuk,
circulation operators,</i>

589
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:00,441
<i>are in the pump room.</i>

590
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:04,241
None of them have been told
about the test.

591
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:06,561
None of them know
what is about to happen.

592
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:10,761
<i>At 1:22 and 30 seconds</i>

593
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,681
<i>Toptunov sees a report from the
reactor's SKALA computer system.</i>

594
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:20,081
<i>Based on the absence
of sufficient control rods,</i>

595
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:23,441
<i>the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.</i>

596
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:29,961
Of course it's saying that.

597
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,241
It doesn't know
we're running a test.

598
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:34,361
All right, comrades.

599
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:38,441
Another few minutes,
it'll all be over.

600
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:40,401
Kirschenbaum,
when you're ready.

601
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:42,361
We did everything right.

602
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:46,721
Oscillograph on.

603
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:50,561
Closing No.8 throttle valve.

604
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:52,761
Generator rotor
beginning rundown.

605
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,881
<i>1:23 and four seconds.</i>

606
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:57,281
With every decision,

607
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:59,881
they have pulled this reactor
back like a slingshot,

608
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,841
further than anyone
has ever pulled.

609
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:04,241
Now the test begins.

610
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:07,441
The pumps are shut down
and they've let go.

611
00:44:10,241 --> 00:44:13,161
The pumps stop moving water
through the reactor.

612
00:44:13,321 --> 00:44:16,201
The uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

613
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:18,161
unchecked by control rods.

614
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,361
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

615
00:44:21,521 --> 00:44:24,321
In less than a second,
reactivity increases.

616
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:27,961
<i>Inside the core,
the remaining water</i>

617
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:29,601
<i>is quickly converting to steam.</i>

618
00:44:29,761 --> 00:44:31,561
<i>A void is being created.</i>

619
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:34,081
<i>There is no fresh water
to replace it.</i>

620
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:36,841
Steam increases reactivity,

621
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:38,561
increases heat,

622
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:40,361
increases steam,

623
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:42,321
increases reactivity.

624
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,041
The remaining xenon decays away.

625
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,561
The power is rising.

626
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,841
There's nothing left to stop it.

627
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:57,241
<i>1:23 and 35 seconds.</i>

628
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,241
We... We have a power surge.
Sasha!

629
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:08,561
What did you do?

630
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:12,081
1:23 and 40 seconds.

631
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,481
In every control room of every
nuclear reactor in the world,

632
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:25,201
there is a button
with one single purpose.

633
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:28,281
The SCRAM will instantly
shut down the reaction.

634
00:45:28,441 --> 00:45:32,361
In Soviet reactors,
that button is called AZ-5.

635
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:37,041
You press AZ-5, all of the
control rods insert at once

636
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,641
and the reaction is...
stopped dead.

637
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:43,561
But...

638
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:50,721
What are you waiting for,
Legasov?

639
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,281
Tell your lies.

640
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:54,601
Comrade Dyatlov, you will
not be warned again.

641
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:56,241
- Or what?
- For God's sake...

642
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:59,001
- Comrade Dyatlov, enough.
- Legasov's given it away.

643
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,161
Comrade Dyatlov.

644
00:46:00,321 --> 00:46:03,321
..there was no way to avoid what
was coming. He knows something.

645
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:05,761
- Comrade Dyatlov.
- She knows something!

646
00:46:05,921 --> 00:46:08,921
I know what you are, Valery
Alexeyevich. You're a liar.

647
00:46:09,081 --> 00:46:11,241
We've heard enough for today.

648
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:14,481
The defendants
will be remanded in custody.

649
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,961
- Court will...
- I-I haven't finished.

650
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,641
I still have
more evidence to give.

651
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,601
It's not necessary.
Your testimony is concluded.

652
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:26,201
- Your Honour.
- Court is now adjourned.

653
00:46:26,361 --> 00:46:28,881
- We'll resume tomorrow with...
- Let him finish!

654
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:32,841
Comrade Shcherbina.

655
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,641
Let him finish.

656
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,241
Dyatlov broke every rule
we have.

657
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,721
He pushed a reactor
to the brink of destruction.

658
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:16,041
He did these things,
believing there was a failsafe.

659
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:19,161
AZ-5: a simple button
to shut it all down.

660
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:23,721
But in the circumstances
he created, there wasn't.

661
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:26,921
The shutdown system
had a fatal flaw.

662
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:31,281
At 1:23:40,

663
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:33,961
Akimov engages AZ-5.

664
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:43,001
The fully-withdrawn control rods

665
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:45,161
begin moving back
into the reactor.

666
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:47,841
These rods are made of boron,
which reduces reactivity.

667
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:49,121
But not the tips.

668
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:54,321
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

669
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:55,881
Why?

670
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,841
Why?

671
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:06,241
For the same reason
our reactors do not have

672
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:08,041
containment buildings
around them,

673
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,721
like those in the West.

674
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:12,001
For the same reason we don't use

675
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:14,441
properly-enriched fuel
in our cores.

676
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,481
For the same reason
we are the only nation

677
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:20,561
that builds water-cooled
graphite-moderated reactors

678
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:23,521
with a positive void
coefficient.

679
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,521
It's cheaper.

680
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:35,121
The first part of the
rods that enter the core

681
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:36,641
are the graphite tips,

682
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:38,041
and when they do,

683
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:41,601
the reaction in the core, which
had been rising, skyrockets.

684
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:44,721
Every last molecule
of liquid water

685
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,601
instantly converts to steam,

686
00:48:46,761 --> 00:48:49,921
which expands and ruptures
a series of fuel rod channels.

687
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:53,481
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

688
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,441
The graphite tips
are fixed in position,

689
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,201
endlessly accelerating
the reaction.

690
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:02,961
Chernobyl Reactor 4
is now a nuclear bomb.

691
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:07,481
<i>1:23:42.
Perevozchenko looks down</i>

692
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,881
<i>on the enormous steel lid
of the reactor</i>

693
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,841
<i>and sees the impossible.</i>

694
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:13,721
<i>The control rod
and fuel channel caps,</i>

695
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:17,361
<i>which each weigh 350kg,
are jumping up and down.</i>

696
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,001
<i>He runs to warn
the control room.</i>

697
00:49:20,161 --> 00:49:23,321
<i>But there's nothing he can do
to stop what is coming.</i>

698
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:25,961
<i>1:23 and 44 seconds.</i>

699
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:29,161
<i>The steam blows
more fuel channels apart.</i>

700
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:31,441
<i>We do not know
how high the power went.</i>

701
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,241
<i>We only know the final reading.</i>

702
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:40,001
Reactor 4, designed to operate
at 3200 megawatts,

703
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:43,281
went beyond 33,000.

704
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:52,161
The pressure inside the core
can no longer be held back.

705
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:56,521
At long last, we have arrived:
1:23:45...

706
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,561
<i>Explosion.</i>

707
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:02,521
<i>In the instant the lid
is thrown off the reactor,</i>

708
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:03,761
<i>oxygen rushes in.</i>

709
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:07,561
<i>It combines with hydrogen
and superheated graphite.</i>

710
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:12,441
<i>The chain of disaster
is now complete.</i>

711
00:50:33,641 --> 00:50:35,601
Comrade Dyatlov!

712
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:42,041
Comrade Dyatlov!

713
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:56,201
No-one in the room that night
knew the shutdown button

714
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:58,561
could act as a detonator.

715
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:01,441
They didn't know it.

716
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:04,481
Because it was kept from them.

717
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,921
Comrade Legasov,
you are contradicting

718
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,281
your own testimony in Vienna.

719
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,001
My testimony in Vienna
was a lie.

720
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,721
I lied to the world.

721
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:18,881
I'm not the only one who kept
the secrets. There are many.

722
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:22,801
We were following orders.

723
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:24,961
From the KGB,
from the Central Committee.

724
00:51:25,121 --> 00:51:27,361
And right now, there are
16 reactors in the Soviet Union

725
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:29,841
with the same fatal flaw.

726
00:51:30,001 --> 00:51:31,601
Three of them are still running,

727
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:34,361
less than 20km away,
at Chernobyl!

728
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:36,841
Professor Legasov,
if you mean to suggest

729
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:39,601
the Soviet state is somehow
responsible for what happened,

730
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:42,401
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

731
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:44,881
I've already trod
on dangerous ground.

732
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,881
We're on dangerous ground
right now,

733
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,001
because of our secrets
and our lies!

734
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:51,801
They are practically
what define us.

735
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:55,601
When the truth offends, we...
we lie and lie,

736
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:57,841
until we can no longer remember
it is even there,

737
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:00,201
but it is still there.

738
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:06,761
Every lie we tell
incurs a debt to the truth.

739
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:11,561
Sooner or later,
that debt is paid.

740
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,161
That is how...

741
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:20,761
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

742
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,321
Lies.

743
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:27,481
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov.

744
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:30,881
Son of Alexei Legasov,

745
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:34,001
Head of Ideological Compliance,
Central Committee.

746
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:36,081
Do you know
what your father did there?

747
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:37,921
Yes.

748
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,321
As a student, you had
a leadership position

749
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:41,641
in Komsomol.

750
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:43,881
Communist Youth, correct?

751
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:46,961
- You already know...
- Answer the question.

752
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:48,321
Yes.

753
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,001
At the Kurchatov Institute,

754
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:54,641
you were
the Communist Party secretary.

755
00:54:54,801 --> 00:54:56,841
In that position,
you limited the promotion

756
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,001
of Jewish scientists.

757
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,801
Yes.

758
00:55:04,961 --> 00:55:07,681
To curry favour
with Kremlin officials.

759
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,841
You're one of us, Legasov.

760
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,241
I can do anything
I want with you.

761
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:22,721
But what I want the most
is for you to know that I know.

762
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:25,881
You're not brave.

763
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:28,681
You're not heroic.

764
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:32,841
You're just a dying man
who forgot himself.

765
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,801
I know who I am.

766
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:37,001
And I know what I've done.

767
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:42,201
In a just world, I'd be shot
for my lies, but not for this.

768
00:55:42,361 --> 00:55:44,561
Not for the truth.

769
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:46,641
Scientists...

770
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:50,161
and your idiot obsession
with reasons.

771
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:54,561
When the bullet hits your skull,
what will it matter why?

772
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:03,921
No-one's getting shot, Legasov.

773
00:56:05,681 --> 00:56:07,801
The whole world
saw you in Vienna.

774
00:56:07,961 --> 00:56:10,081
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

775
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,721
And for what?

776
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:15,081
Your testimony today will not
be accepted by the state.

777
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,841
It will not be disseminated
in the press.

778
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:20,441
It never happened.

779
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:25,921
No. You will live,
however long you have,

780
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,561
but not as a scientist.

781
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:29,881
Not any more.

782
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:34,281
You'll keep your title
and your office,

783
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:38,761
but no duties, no authority,
no friends.

784
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:41,161
No-one will talk to you.

785
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:43,361
No-one will listen to you.

786
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,161
Other men...

787
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:51,961
lesser men will receive credit
for the things you have done.

788
00:56:52,881 --> 00:56:54,841
Your legacy is now their legacy.

789
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:57,241
You will live long enough
to see that.

790
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,121
What role
did Shcherbina play in this?

791
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:04,361
None.

792
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,401
He didn't know
what I was gonna say.

793
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:11,121
What role did Khomyuk
play in this?

794
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:14,241
None.
She didn't know, either.

795
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,881
After all you've said
and done today,

796
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:24,041
it would be... curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

797
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:29,161
I would think a man
of your experience

798
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,481
would know a lie
when he hears one.

799
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:36,641
You will not meet or communicate

800
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:38,881
with either one of them
ever again.

801
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:41,281
You will not communicate
with anyone

802
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,441
about Chernobyl ever again.

803
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:46,721
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

804
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,561
that when you finally do die...

805
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:52,161
it will be exceedingly hard to
know that you ever lived at all.

806
00:57:56,801 --> 00:57:58,401
And if I refuse?

807
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:04,441
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

808
00:58:05,961 --> 00:58:09,801
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

809
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:11,761
Oh, that's perfect.

810
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,201
They should put that
on our money.

811
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:24,281
<i>To be a scientist
is to be naive.</i>

812
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,561
<i>We are so focused
on our search for truth,</i>

813
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:32,001
<i>we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.</i>

814
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:36,161
<i>But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,</i>

815
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,201
<i>whether we choose to or not.</i>

816
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:40,721
<i>The truth doesn't care about
our needs or wants.</i>

817
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,601
<i>It doesn't care about
our governments,</i>

818
00:59:42,761 --> 00:59:45,401
<i>our ideologies, our religions.</i>

819
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,721
<i>It will lie in wait
for all time.</i>

820
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:53,321
<i>And this, at last,
is the gift of Chernobyl.</i>

821
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,961
<i>Where I once would fear the cost
of truth, now I only ask:</i>

822
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:02,241
<i>What is the cost of lies?</i>
