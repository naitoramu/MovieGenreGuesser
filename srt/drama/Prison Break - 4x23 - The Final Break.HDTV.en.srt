1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,250
<i>You ready?</i>

2
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,882
Didn't think I'd be
this nervous.

3
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,766
Now or never.

4
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,645
Alright, papi,
let's do this.

5
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:41,325
He's over there.

6
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,394
You must be
Michael.

7
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:54,652
Your friend,
Fernando,

8
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,332
tells me you could
use my services today.

9
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,107
Very much so.

10
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:00,853
And I assume that's
the other half of your team?

11
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,598
You look beautiful.

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,357
Thank you.

13
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:22,072
And it's my understanding
you'd like to keep this simple?

14
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:26,075
We've never actually managed
to keep anything simple...

15
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:27,707
You could try.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,175
Well.
Let's begin then, shall we?

17
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:34,003
Family and friends,
we gather here...

18
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:38,902
to celebrate the union between
Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi.

19
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:25,051
- Sorry to break up the party.
- What the hell's going on?

20
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,250
We have
an arrest warrant.

21
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>- What?
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

22
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,195
We talked to
Agent Paul Kellerman in D.C.

23
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,243
<i>We've settled this
with the feds.</i>

24
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,986
We settled this with
the feds weeks ago!

25
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,197
Sir, back up!

26
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:35,745
- We were exonerated.
- Sir...

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,303
<i>- We were exonerated!
- Back up!</i>

28
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,218
<i>We're not here for you.
We're here for her.</i>

29
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,807
She didn't do anything.
She wasn't involved.

30
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,321
<i>Don't make this
escalate!</i>

31
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,633
Sara Tancredi,

32
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,242
you're under arrest for
the murder of Christina Hampton.

33
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:49,972
<i>What?!</i>

34
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,275
<i>She didn't kill
anyone!</i>

35
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,430
Funny. Surveillance camera
footage says different.

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,050
Michael.

37
00:02:58,574 --> 00:02:59,835
<i>- Please, right this way.
- Michael.</i>

38
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,144
<i>- Second car, please.
- Michael!</i>

39
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,082
<i>- Second car.
- What's going on?</i>

40
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:02,975
<i>Back up, please.</i>

41
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,734
S04E23:
The Old Ball And Chain

42
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:16,651
They're not gonna
let me see her.

43
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,280
Why did Kellerman send you
if you can't do anything?

44
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,446
They're trying
to break both of you.

45
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,726
Look, she has a constitutional right
to reasonable visitation.

46
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:28,320
I'll draw up an order to show cause
and get it before the judge immediately.

47
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,028
<i>While you're at it,</i>

48
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:30,813
- can you argue in self defence?
- How?

49
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,433
Anything that might help her
is out of frame.

50
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,911
Security camera only shows Sara
stepping up and firing at the victim.

51
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,967
- Pull the trigger, Michael.
- Drop... the gun!

52
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,708
<i>Misfire.</i>

53
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,012
- She worked for the Company.
- To you.

54
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,001
To a jury, she's Christina Hampton,
Technology Consultant.

55
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,904
And because she was so good
at hiding her true identity,

56
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,104
we can't
prove otherwise.

57
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:57,835
<i>Look,
you were all exonerated.</i>

58
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,895
It did not sit well
with law enforcement.

59
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,257
If they can make Sara
pay for it, they will.

60
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,108
How much time
is she looking at?

61
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,532
25 to life.

62
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,582
You.
Over here.

63
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:30,733
You.
Here.

64
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>You.</i>

65
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,295
Here.

66
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:40,903
This one's yours.

67
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,974
Am I supposed to be
in a different facility?

68
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:45,314
<i>I don't think so.</i>

69
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,973
I haven't been convicted
of anything yet.

70
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,030
I'm supposed to be in a jail.
This is prison.

71
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:50,750
Overcrowding
and budget cuts, fish.

72
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:54,206
This is the jail.
That's the prison.

73
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,241
<i>'Sup, homie?
You need some help?</i>

74
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,780
<i>You got everything
you need over there?</i>

75
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,200
<i>Why don't you go help
and make her bed?</i>

76
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:24,725
Don't let them spook you.
They just like to intimidate.

77
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:25,878
They are good at it.

78
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:27,400
Look.

79
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:31,014
This jail-prison
hybrid thing's B.S.

80
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,069
Come on.

81
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,906
The other one's
practically empty.

82
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,812
You can ride it out
to your court date there.

83
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,949
Thank you.

84
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:00,897
Here. This should be a little bit
more comfortable for you.

85
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:01,587
Okay.

86
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,575
What's going on?

87
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:11,982
<i>You know...</i>

88
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,601
At first,
I couldn't place your name.

89
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,152
Tancredi.
It sounded so familiar.

90
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,635
But then, Haggs here,
figured it out.

91
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:24,284
I remembered your pretty face
from the papers.

92
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,979
You're not
going anywhere, fish.

93
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,787
This is going
to happen.

94
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,007
Half a dozen guards

95
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:34,330
lost their jobs and pensions
at Fox River.

96
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,622
Another dozen
were put on probation,

97
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:36,809
after you decided

98
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,293
to leave
the door open

99
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,482
for your boyfriend
and his seven convict pals.

100
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,520
<i>And we...</i>

101
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,922
ain't gonna let anything
like that happen again.

102
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:49,417
Don't worry,

103
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,063
we won't hit
the baby basket.

104
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,098
<i>That's right.</i>

105
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,497
Looked like that welcome wagon
ran over your face.

106
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,517
It looks
that way, huh?

107
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:21,308
<i>Alright, well...</i>

108
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,903
<i>You need something,
you just ask for me.</i>

109
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,397
Everybody calls me
"Daddy".

110
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,998
Special delivery.

111
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,791
You know,
all we need is a little cash,

112
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,543
spread around
in places.

113
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,891
I told you.

114
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,656
The government's
exposing my assets.

115
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,267
You tellin' me you can't get
your hands on the cash?

116
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:12,132
Unless, that's the least
you could do.

117
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,290
Considering you was gonna kill me
not too long ago.

118
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,530
Goodbye, Theodore.

119
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,054
You ain't never been
incarcerated before,

120
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,171
and I never been
incarcerated here.

121
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:24,586
Therefore,

122
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,898
now let's just say
this handicapped connie

123
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,017
got the juicy hand back
in Fox River.

124
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:34,850
<i>Your pathetic existence here
could be ameliorated.</i>

125
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,420
<i>As can my life,</i>

126
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,409
all with a little
"Roberto de Niro".

127
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,623
One of our friends has been
apprehended by the authorities.

128
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,169
<i>Looks like we've got
a new neighbour.</i>

129
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,837
I'm never gonna get out
of this prison alive.

130
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:51,797
I know that.

131
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,074
I wanna bring my enemy
down with me.

132
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,841
I want her dead.

133
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:07,180
Either way, it's going
to require a capital.

134
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,017
A capital
you no longer have.

135
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,756
My rainy day plan.
Do you know where it is?

136
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,911
<i>Jonathan.</i>

137
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:15,312
I'd assume that that would be
used for your defense.

138
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,102
It's good money
after bad, Joe.

139
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,977
They're not gonna
let me out of here.

140
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,625
No matter how many shots,
it's that hard.

141
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,219
Get that.

142
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,290
To our friend, in the sister cells,
across the compound.

143
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,118
Excuse me.

144
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:15,988
<i>Bad move.</i>

145
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,700
Last time someone touched her,
they got a crack kneecap.

146
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,084
You're much braver
than I gave you credit for.

147
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,417
Either that,
or you're amazingly nice.

148
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,803
Do I look like
I wanna talk to you?

149
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,411
I just say,
a woman in your position

150
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,959
laid up
for some protection.

151
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,501
Join the prison gang?
I don't think so.

152
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,062
Not a gang.
No.

153
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,135
A family.

154
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,311
They don't call her "Daddy"
for nothin'.

155
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,310
That's her wife.

156
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,843
And those are
her kids.

157
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,427
- Are you okay?
- Stay the hell away from me.

158
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:19,814
I need
to go down the infirmary.

159
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:21,646
<i>Can't go down the infirmiary
without a release form.</i>

160
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,593
I'm having muscle contractions
on my throat.

161
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:24,732
And my jaws'
tightening up.

162
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,923
It's--It's just
could be indigestions,

163
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:27,842
I'm not poisoned.

164
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,887
No. That's the government cheese.
You'll get used to it.

165
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,977
If I don't get to the hospital
in the next 15 minutes,

166
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,408
I will die
and my baby will die.

167
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:35,204
Please.

168
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:37,214
<i>Boss.</i>

169
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,503
Why don't you let her
go see the doc?

170
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:45,597
Please.

171
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:48,765
This is Kaorla.

172
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:50,345
Inmate going
to the infirmary.

173
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,977
We were able to administer
the charcoal labrigintein.

174
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,740
You and your baby
are gonna be okay.

175
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:08,497
You know the strignein didn't get into
my meatloaf all by itself, right?

176
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,754
Well then, you need to talk
to the warden about it.

177
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,219
Then how about talking to me
about your face?

178
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,620
<i>You want to tell me
how that happened?</i>

179
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,799
I caught an elbow
playing basketball.

180
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,119
We should discuss your...
situation.

181
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:28,956
As I'm sure
you've ascertained

182
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,661
this isn't going to be
a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

183
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,534
Do I deliver in here?

184
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:33,121
No.

185
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,481
The day we induce,
we'll secure you in an ambulance.

186
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,060
We'll take you to St. Lucia
down the road.

187
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,516
We'll cordone off a room.

188
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,111
There'll be three armed guards
in there with me,

189
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:41,967
when you give birth.

190
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:43,839
Do I get
to see my baby?

191
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,520
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

192
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,550
I've seen this process
a dozen times.

193
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,866
<i>After the mothers come back here,
the depression's almost unbearable.</i>

194
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:56,952
<i>My advice,</i>

195
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,059
it's a lot
less messy,

196
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:01,048
if you'd just think of yourself
as a surrogate.

197
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,542
Yeah?

198
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,853
Michael,
it's Lou Phillips.

199
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:16,926
Listen, um...

200
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,721
Your wife had
an incident earlier today.

201
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:20,778
Someone tried
to poison her.

202
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,783
What are you
talking about?

203
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,288
Michael,
I need you to focus.

204
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:26,005
<i>Do you have any idea
who might have done this?</i>

205
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,499
Michael?

206
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:29,373
Michael?!

207
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,163
<i>Go ahead,
let him in.</i>

208
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:46,951
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me...

209
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,252
your name would be at the bottom,
somewhere below

210
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,837
Jesus Christ
and Scooby Doo.

211
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:55,558
- Someone tried to poison Sara today.
- Mercy--

212
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,102
Only you
would be depraved enough,

213
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,371
to think that killing an innocent woman
and her unborn child

214
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:04,248
would bring you some kind of peace
before your execution.

215
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:06,671
Sara is with child?

216
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:09,125
Congratulations!

217
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,632
This is like the 4th of July
and Christmas Day rolled into one.

218
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,735
I am asking you,

219
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,954
father to father,
to leave her alone.

220
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,921
You can kill me
if you want to kill me,

221
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,384
I'll trade my life
for hers.

222
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:23,772
But leave Sara alone.

223
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,061
Michael...

224
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:27,886
If you were killed,

225
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,162
your pain would last
a moment.

226
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:32,056
If Sara were killed,

227
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:35,184
your pain would last
the rest of your life.

228
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,026
Now that's got to be appealing
to whoever put out this hit.

229
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,277
But don't worry,
Michael.

230
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,264
If I find out anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

231
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:48,845
<i>Prison life
can be tough.</i>

232
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,134
If I remember correctly,

233
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:52,365
you have two missing toes
that can attest to that bag.

234
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,324
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

235
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,319
Please.

236
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,002
Please just approve the transfer
to another facility.

237
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,140
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody's gonna want one.

238
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,602
What about
segregrated housing?

239
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,594
Is there something
that I should know about

240
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:08,449
the structural integrity
of shoe?

241
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:10,798
I can see
where this is going.

242
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,084
I know who you are.

243
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,818
And I'm not going
to let you turn my prison

244
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:14,927
into the next
Fox River.

245
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:18,103
All I'm trying to do,
is keep my wife alive.

246
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,984
You do know
she's pregnant.

247
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,909
I don't care.

248
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,663
Here.

249
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:39,430
Thanks.

250
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,842
In case I haven't
made myself clear--

251
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:43,810
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

252
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,230
And you've made
yourself perfectly clear.

253
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:48,532
Thank you
for your time.

254
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:56,056
- What happened?
- The General wants Sara dead

255
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,812
and the warden's just
gonna let that happen.

256
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,252
We gotta lure in the case
if he's gonna get her out, right?

257
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:01,072
Which is
not enough time.

258
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:03,287
She stays in that prison,
someone's going to kill her.

259
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:05,900
I guess we don't have
a choice.

260
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,187
We're breaking her out.

261
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,806
<i>In my 16 years
in the Bureau,</i>

262
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,434
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

263
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,189
<i>Alexander Mahone,</i>

264
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,529
<i>is the smartest,</i>

265
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:31,907
bravest,

266
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,186
most honorable man,

267
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,836
I've ever had the pleasure
of serving with.

268
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:41,520
As one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended.

269
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:45,532
Because obviously, I am not as honoured
as this drive-addicted murderer.

270
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:49,251
Alex has been clean and sober
for four months.

271
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:52,009
And he's been completely
exonerated of all crimes

272
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,016
<i>associated with his involvement
with the Company.</i>

273
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,317
That doesn't include the shooting
and murder of one Oscar Shales

274
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:59,768
and burying his body
under his bird bath--

275
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,032
That is just an allegation.

276
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:02,750
Let's move on,
shall we?

277
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,549
All those in favor of
reinstating Alexander Mahone,

278
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,642
a Special Agent in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation--

279
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,439
Aye.

280
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,704
- All those oppose?
- Alright, alright, I've--

281
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:23,059
Thank you
for the invite, Richard.

282
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:27,405
It's always a pleasure.

283
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,420
You know, Alex.
This ruling can't be revisited.

284
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,297
If you're able to
sufficiently demonstrate,

285
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,968
just how committed you are
to a life of service.

286
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:42,158
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently,

287
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,627
and is currently being housed
at the Miami Dade State Penitentiary.

288
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:49,220
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

289
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:54,166
So this...
This is why you invite me in here.

290
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,663
<i>Well obviously, if Scofield were,
to be able to</i>

291
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,002
pull off this plot
of another breakout,

292
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:03,137
the public embarassment will be
immensed to the Bureau.

293
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:06,329
So... having someone to get us
credible information,

294
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,610
that would be worth
something to us.

295
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,453
Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami.
He would be your contact.

296
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:12,956
You're something else.

297
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,196
Now...

298
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,538
We both know...

299
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,083
how badly you want
that badge back.

300
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,132
<i>Give me a reason
to give it to you.</i>

301
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,901
What's your plan
after we break her out?

302
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:34,728
We're on the run
again?

303
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,820
First things first.
Let's get her out of there.

304
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:37,502
<i>Hey, papi.</i>

305
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,789
The fed that arrested Sara,
is outside, staking us out.

306
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,579
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

307
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,267
go back to Chicago,
go back to your family.

308
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,888
I'll understand.

309
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:50,234
Are you kidding me?

310
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,173
After all the crap we've been through,
I'm just going to leave you here

311
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:52,950
and Sara in there?

312
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:55,206
You shut up
and don't bring it up again.

313
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,223
- What's all that?
- Newspaper clippings--

314
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,981
Covering seven
different escape attempts,

315
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,572
from Miami Dade's
State Pen,

316
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,306
over the last 60 years.
None of them--

317
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,155
None of them
successful.

318
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,290
So we weigh them all,
and we learn what not to do.

319
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,754
Well, the prison officials
learned a lot.

320
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,466
They re-evaluated,
they retrofitted...

321
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,764
The prison's pratically
escape-proof.

322
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,104
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine--

323
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:21,200
I guess so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

324
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,916
Like down into the prison?
Like we parachute in.

325
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:25,165
Yeah.

326
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:26,561
Yeah.
You parachute in,

327
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,760
- you find her, and we get he rout.
- Are you kidding?

328
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,344
- I'm serious.
- That's suicide!

329
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:30,440
Hey, hey...

330
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,734
Newspapers clippings only
going to get us so far.

331
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:34,699
We need some more information
about the prison.

332
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,327
So let's do
some recon work.

333
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,960
Camera, electronic
tape measure, dry ice.

334
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:40,550
What's this?

335
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:41,927
It's a shopping list.

336
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:48,706
You need
to come with me, doc.

337
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:51,231
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy in a few minutes.

338
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,069
It'll wait.

339
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:54,659
In here.

340
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:57,892
Hold it.

341
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:08,925
I don't know
what you want,

342
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,637
but I promise you,
I will go down and fight it.

343
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:13,183
Damn baby,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

344
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,446
Hell, I ain't even gonna
touch you.

345
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:24,075
See, I run the motor pool
detail in here.

346
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:27,061
And I was thinkin' if you want
to get yourself a little fresh air,

347
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:29,810
and not have to worry about
getting stuck in the back,

348
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,494
then you could come in,
work with me...

349
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,075
You're the fed
from my wedding.

350
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,789
Yeah, you can call me
Agent Wheatley.

351
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,257
I could call you
a lot of things.

352
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,421
- Where you headed?
- Sea World.

353
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:33,302
<i>Sea World?</i>

354
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,454
There isn't one
in Miami.

355
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:35,162
My loss.

356
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,973
<i>No. What really be
your loss,</i>

357
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,073
<i>is getting
your wife killed,</i>

358
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,273
by doing something stupid.

359
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:41,866
- Are you threatening Sara?
- No, no. Not at all--

360
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,828
I'm just saying that if you were gonna
try and revoke her sentence.

361
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:46,279
Bullets fly, Michael.

362
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:48,380
And if she'd get hurt,
that'd be on you.

363
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,730
Funny hearing that
from the guy

364
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,307
who put her in prison
in the first place.

365
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,843
No, I didn't put her in prison.
State of Florida did.

366
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,549
It's just my job to make sure
that she stays there.

367
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:58,143
So, uh...

368
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,203
Where's all
your little buddies?

369
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,585
Alright.
Drop in some more dry ice.

370
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:26,665
Fence line is four feet...
from the road.

371
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,838
And 32 feet...
from the east camera.

372
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:38,683
Hurry up.
They're gonna see the laser.

373
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,601
I'm going as fast
as I can, papi.

374
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,270
- He followed you?
- Yeah, but he's gone now.

375
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:48,989
You guys almost done?

376
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:51,199
Almost.

377
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:52,104
<i>Great.</i>

378
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,035
I'll meet you back
at the loft.

379
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,259
Well, you just
a natural.

380
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,164
I bet you was
a hell of a surgeon.

381
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,989
<i>Handing out
condoms to cons</i>

382
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:24,389
were makin'
no damn surgeon!

383
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,552
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

384
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,120
You ain't even ask me
if she can come...

385
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:28,589
One day, for real!

386
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:31,070
Can we go one day
without your mouth? One!

387
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:36,369
Let it be today.

388
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:43,842
I'm sorry.

389
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:45,821
You got to forgive
my old lady, she's...

390
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,645
You just a little bit
easy on eyes, you know?

391
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,564
She's just
the jealous type.

392
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,365
Crazy type
is more like it.

393
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:57,763
What? You wanna
watch your tone, Agatha.

394
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:58,663
Sorry.

395
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,244
Or you want me
take off my belt?

396
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,015
<i>Sorry.</i>

397
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:06,846
Kid.

398
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,807
It's rough.
It's hard running a family.

399
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,724
It's important though that, uh--
That you have one--

400
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,663
I have a family.
I have a husband.

401
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,225
Oh, you've got a husband?
Is he here?

402
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,559
They let him bring you in here,
with you, when you came?

403
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:28,426
No.

404
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,152
Yeah,
I had a husband too.

405
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:36,146
18 years
is a long time to wait.

406
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,062
So, you know.
If this ain't for you,

407
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:43,961
that's cool.

408
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:50,553
Then you pick up
that nasty oil,

409
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:52,735
take it out and put it
in the repository.

410
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,053
Okay.

411
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:18,277
We gotta go, bro.

412
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,448
- Get your hands off me.
- When I'm good and ready.

413
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,290
What's Burrows doing
by the fence?

414
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,610
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

415
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,731
Nobody here to help you,
but yourself.

416
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,505
Are you going
to answer me?

417
00:25:58,361 --> 00:25:59,361
You tried to kill me.

418
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,375
Line it up, cons.

419
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:02,697
<i>Go back inside.</i>

420
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,696
You, get back to your detail.
Now!

421
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,684
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

422
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:29,128
What he's paying
his people

423
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,425
to dust that Tancredi
chicken bitch pop...

424
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,053
My woman are good
for a cut rate.

425
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,385
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

426
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:39,950
Tell him, uh...

427
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,789
He's offering a 100 grand,
my girl will take 30.

428
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:45,731
<i>No, 40.</i>

429
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:46,956
40.

430
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:49,200
Perfect.

431
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,102
I'll tell him.

432
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:58,887
Hey, five star.

433
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,952
So you have no cash,
whatsoever...

434
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:08,151
I'm sorry.

435
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,684
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of that broken record.

436
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:17,601
Got it.

437
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:21,569
I won't ask again.

438
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,920
<i>Whose act is stupid
as you look, huh?</i>

439
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,796
Oh, to what do
we owe the honor?

440
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:36,878
I've been thinking...

441
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,631
<i>Well, no need
to be uh, shy.</i>

442
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:40,964
Just spit it out.

443
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,666
I've changed my mind.

444
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,036
No, well maybe,
Daddy changed her mind.

445
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,226
Maybe she don't
want you here anymore.

446
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,573
<i>Sport's right.</i>

447
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,934
I recently have rolled up
my welcome mat.

448
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:54,557
Peace.

449
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,752
- Please.
- Please, what?

450
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,293
Please, may I be
a part of your family?

451
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:12,840
Take a walk.

452
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:15,670
Take a walk!

453
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:24,128
I would love that. I would--
Sit down. I really would.

454
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:29,981
You see, its not that easy.
It's just saying "I do".

455
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,384
See, in order
to making a commitment...

456
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,987
to a family...

457
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:47,401
It's something
you gotta prove.

458
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:49,563
That's right,
we all did it.

459
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,375
It's a commitment...
to the family code.

460
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,786
It's a code
you gotta wear.

461
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,002
Alex!

462
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:29,316
- What's up?
- What--

463
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,310
How you doing,
man?

464
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,320
What's going on?

465
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,588
We gotta talk.

466
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:36,887
Alright.

467
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:38,661
They're watching you.

468
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,917
- We know. We gotta a fed on us.
- No. Not just one.

469
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,543
The whole department.

470
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:46,224
Sounds a lot like
inside information, Alex.

471
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,557
What you do?
Make a deal with the feds?

472
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:51,983
They offered me
my old job back,

473
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,410
if I came down here
to spy on you.

474
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:56,770
Now the fed you're talking about,
his name is Wheatley.

475
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:57,801
He's running point.

476
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:58,939
So now we know.

477
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,602
So if you really
gonna do this,

478
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:03,046
you gotta
do it right.

479
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,374
And I'll help you
if you need me.

480
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:09,807
What else do you get?

481
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:12,895
Sara was working the motor pool
today at 4 o'clock.

482
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,615
Motor pool is here.

483
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,988
This hold by two security cameras,
along the perimeter of the prison.

484
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,389
What about
secondary entrances?

485
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:22,180
No loading dock,
no personnel entrance--

486
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:23,006
Fences?

487
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,845
15 feet high,
covered in rave wires.

488
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,682
<i>- Electrified?
- No. Why?</i>

489
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,788
If Sara can get herself back
to motor pool,

490
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,326
I think we can find
a way inside.

491
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,816
With all the different retrofits
over the years,

492
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:36,122
the fence line
is widened.

493
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,767
But security cameras remain exactly
where they've always been.

494
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:40,759
They've never accounted
for the difference.

495
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:43,921
- There's a blindspot.
- Yeah. Right here.

496
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,473
If Sara can get back to that spot,
we can breach the fence.

497
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,471
<i>It's risky, Michael.</i>

498
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,412
That's all we've got.

499
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,860
How much time to tell Sara
where we going to meet her?

500
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:52,455
How?

501
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,500
We get no visitations,
no phone calls.

502
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:04,625
It's clean.
Take it to Tancredi.

503
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,480
<i>Remember when I taught you
about flowers?</i>

504
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,296
<i>I wish I was
with you now.</i>

505
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,685
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

506
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,291
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

507
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,658
<i>Tomorrow. PM.
Seven. Oil dump.</i>

508
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,122
Sure looks like
you've been busy.

509
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,776
Do you have a warrant,
Agent Wheatley?

510
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:22,839
A warrant?
No, I don't need one.

511
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,990
My testimony would be
that your brother let me in.

512
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:27,985
Once inside,
saw all this evidence,

513
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:29,458
<i>right in plain sight.</i>

514
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,824
<i>What judge is gonna take
your word over mine?</i>

515
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:32,636
What evidence?

516
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:34,958
Those pictures were taken
from public property.

517
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,796
That prison, was paid for
by the taxpayers.

518
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:39,176
So all you have
evidence of,

519
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:41,808
is an exonerated citizen,
standing on a public road,

520
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,428
taking pictures
of a public building.

521
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:45,997
Last I checked,
it's not a crime.

522
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:48,138
What if I said that
I could get you on attempt,

523
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,309
just for having
all this stuff?

524
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,512
What if I told you that all this
was peace offering?

525
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,969
The warden won't let me
see my wife.

526
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,895
So I figured, if I found
a few lapses in the security,

527
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:00,085
pointed them out
as a gesture of good faith,

528
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:01,763
she might change
her mind?

529
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:02,834
Is that so?

530
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,403
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

531
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,806
No.
Looks airtight.

532
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:09,876
Well thank goodness
for that.

533
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,101
<i>You guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?</i>

534
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,633
You'll be
the first to know.

535
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:34,019
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done.

536
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:35,201
No matter what.

537
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:37,036
I got paid well
for it.

538
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:40,497
Now I'm broke.
But I still need things.

539
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:43,286
- Like what?
- A favor.

540
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:45,124
I don't do
favors for cons.

541
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,418
Really? It's not what it says
on the bathroom wall.

542
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:52,949
As I understand, you'd do favors
for those who reciprocate.

543
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:58,344
Is that true?

544
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,385
This is bullshit, Boss!

545
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:10,499
<i>I'm a veteran
around here.</i>

546
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,562
<i>Ain't no reason
to toss me!</i>

547
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:16,060
<i>You--</i>

548
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:16,979
Hey!

549
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:18,409
You low leaf!

550
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,480
Looky, looky here.

551
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,312
No!
That brown ain't mine, boss.

552
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:26,079
<i>You know this!</i>

553
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,346
I don't do no drugs!

554
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:29,096
Who put that
in here?!

555
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:32,104
You... ugh!

556
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,051
Get your hands off me.
I know where the hole is.

557
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,751
What y'all looking at?

558
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:37,603
I do no drugs!

559
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:39,699
Somebody is going
down there!

560
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,956
I love you too.

561
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,124
Sofia's making arrangements
in Central America.

562
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:47,259
Once we break Sara,
we're on the boat, we're gone.

563
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,056
- Hey.
- It's Lou.

564
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,481
Just got the decision
from the court.

565
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,120
They're ordering the warden
to allow a supervised visitation.

566
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,731
- Where are you going?
- They're letting me see Sara.

567
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,156
<i>Pera, pera, pera, pera--</i>

568
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:03,727
If they're going to be listening
to every word you say,

569
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:05,055
you gotta be careful
about this.

570
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:07,231
If she understood my letters,
she'll find a way to tell me.

571
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:10,619
How? She's going to blink
the Morse code?

572
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,239
<i>Attention, inmates...</i>

573
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,282
<i>Visiting hours will be over
in five minutes.</i>

574
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,520
Oh my God!

575
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:39,512
Oh my God!
Who did this to you?

576
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:41,885
I'm okay.
Baby's okay.

577
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,748
Sara,
I'm so sorry.

578
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,188
You're in here
because of me.

579
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,885
I'm sorry.
This is hard.

580
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:56,161
<i>- I miss you so much
- No touching!</i>

581
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,657
<i>I miss you too.</i>

582
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,842
You just have
to hang in there, okay?

583
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:09,206
I'm trying.
But my protection's gone.

584
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,725
- Did you get my letter?
- I did.

585
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:18,497
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I want to say.

586
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:22,834
But I hope you understood...
what I meant to tell you.

587
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:24,796
I did.

588
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:29,129
Is he getting cute?

589
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:33,850
You were there for me.
And I will be there for you.

590
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,684
- Okay.
- Alright, that's it.

591
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,084
Time's up.

592
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,113
See you soon.

593
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:50,628
Bye.

594
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:11,167
Michael.

595
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:16,466
<i>I was thinking a lot.</i>

596
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,411
About the photos and the mock-up
that you showed me at the loft.

597
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,131
And I ran a few tests.

598
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,637
Lo and behold,
I've found a blindspot.

599
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:26,651
Right along the fence line over here,
due to our retrofit.

600
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,893
You didn't know
about this, did you?

601
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,656
No, no,
of course not.

602
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:32,757
Because you would've
told me or

603
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,316
<i>the warden about it
if you did, right?</i>

604
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,913
Well, it's a good thing
I found this when I did,

605
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,669
before anyone tried
to escape.

606
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,799
Well if we can't go
through the fence,

607
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,382
then that leaves
under or over.

608
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,400
Look, how's she gonna climb
that fence without being seen, huh?

609
00:37:57,712 --> 00:37:59,419
I'm guessing
there's no telephone wire

610
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:00,557
for her
to climb across.

611
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:03,449
- Then she's gotta go under.
- Alright, let's get some shovels--

612
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,822
What was that you were saying
about parachutes?

613
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:06,747
Parachutes--

614
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,519
Guys, come on.

615
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:10,787
You can't be--
Parachutes?

616
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:11,835
<i>Couple of thoughts
on that.</i>

617
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:12,856
<i>A:
We don't have a plane,</i>

618
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:13,978
B:
We don't have a pilot.

619
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,102
Have you ever worn
a parachute?

620
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,327
Don't worry.
I think I've got a plan.

621
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,373
But we're gonna need some help
from an old friend.

622
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:22,725
Who?

623
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,845
- You want a favor from me.
- Just hear me out.

624
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:28,529
Of course.
I mean...

625
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,043
When you and Michael send me
back to that prison,

626
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:33,303
you did give me
a piece of chewing gum.

627
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:34,542
I mean what kind of man
would I be

628
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,967
if I didn't
quit your pro-quote.

629
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:36,975
Look,

630
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,663
all you gotta do is sound off
the fire alarm, in here,

631
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,565
tomorrow night
at 7:30.

632
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:44,033
That's it.

633
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,849
You're breaking her out.

634
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,579
Krantz has put
a hit on her.

635
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,738
That's our one shot,

636
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,357
of keeping her alive.

637
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,633
Well you're on a pivoted
kind of damn, Lincoln.

638
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,642
We'll put five grand on your cake
once this whole thing jumps off.

639
00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:02,580
The love of Michael's life
is only worth $5,000?

640
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:03,842
That's the best
we can do.

641
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:06,635
- I need six figures.
- That's all we got.

642
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,639
Well,
like a day for you,

643
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:12,098
I know somebody who does...
the General's man.

644
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:16,971
He's got to pay out
for Sara's hit.

645
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:21,150
You wire that money
to me by 7 PM tomorrow,

646
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:22,443
and we're in business.

647
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,483
What's his name?

648
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:25,800
It's your brother to you
that agony is.

649
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,020
Come on, you gotta give me
more than that.

650
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,373
Tomorrow. 7 PM.
Go on, fetch.

651
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,535
You should have seen
the look on Michael's face.

652
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,155
When he saw me fixing that fence
and installing that camera.

653
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:49,935
You did a great job.

654
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,113
Job's over now.

655
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:58,147
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger,

656
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,025
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

657
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,982
Your job will be over until
you give us enough evidence

658
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:05,753
to put him back
behind bars.

659
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,230
So what's the latest?

660
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,270
There's nothing concrete.

661
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,241
But I'll let you know
when I get something.

662
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:15,262
Alright.
Good man.

663
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:37,679
<i>I warned you.</i>

664
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:41,799
Tough going alone.

665
00:40:42,466 --> 00:40:45,336
I know he's breaking you out.
I'm coming with you.

666
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:52,413
Relax.

667
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,178
Krantz sent me
to kill you,

668
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:56,709
but after what he's put me through,
I'm done taking orders from him.

669
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:58,023
You're sitting next to me
at the mess

670
00:40:58,058 --> 00:40:58,626
when I was poisoned.

671
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,364
You'd think you would've
lasted this long

672
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:01,252
if I wanted you dead?

673
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:03,539
I want you dead.
You're still alive.

674
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:05,788
Do you think it's hard to stay alive
when you know who's coming after you?

675
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,289
There's 200 women
in this prison.

676
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,078
Could you even get
to Gen Pop?

677
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:17,392
I'm coming with you.

678
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,621
Or nobody's going.

679
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,690
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.

680
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,509
Because that means
you're safe.

681
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:04,940
How does he think
he's gonna do this, bro?

682
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,503
He's going
to jump out of a plane.

683
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,352
I know he's gonna jump.
The question is, can he land?

684
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,867
Not without getting caught.

685
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,444
And how is he going
to get out of the cell block,

686
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,334
even if T-Bag--

687
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,632
It's a big "if".
Trusting T-Bag is... crazy.

688
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,739
Michael, we, uh...
We really have to re-think this.

689
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:22,217
I have.
And there's no other way.

690
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,485
Okay.

691
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,891
I'm going to drop down
into this outer area here.

692
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,462
And I'll cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

693
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:30,872
They're going to be
right on your ass.

694
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:33,152
I can hide behind this building,
wait for a window.

695
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:34,688
Then I'll make my way
over here.

696
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,131
That's the chapel.
Well hopefully, uh...

697
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:38,753
Sara will be waiting.

698
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:39,665
Why the chapel?

699
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:40,914
During the riot in '88,

700
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,901
prison employees escaped through
the administration building.

701
00:42:43,356 --> 00:42:45,455
They wound up here,
outside the fence.

702
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,639
The administration building,
is connected to the chapel.

703
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:50,655
Which means that
somewhere in that compound,

704
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,273
there is
a subterranean exit.

705
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:54,073
If we can get
through it,

706
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:56,337
you can meet us there.

707
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,919
How's Sara gonna get
to the chapel?

708
00:42:58,718 --> 00:42:59,644
She'll have
to find a way.

709
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:02,512
Look, we're doing this
at 7 PM tonight,

710
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:03,347
just like we've planned.

711
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:05,410
- Where have you been?
- What did I miss?

712
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,826
I need you to find a plane
and a pilot.

713
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,024
I need you two,
to take care of T-Bag.

714
00:43:10,148 --> 00:43:13,281
Find out exactly who has this money,
and where they're keeping it.

715
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:16,204
- And then we have to get it.
- By 7 PM tonight.

716
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,771
Or Sara's going
to die in there.

717
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:23,254
Is everybody onboard?

718
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,115
Okay.

719
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:31,673
Tell me, you've completed
your assignment.

720
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,437
Well, I got the cash.

721
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:36,484
But there'll may be some delay
in final delivery.

722
00:43:36,898 --> 00:43:39,807
The woman we hired is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

723
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:42,290
Then hire somebody else.
Call it open season.

724
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,426
<i>Put a bounty on her head.
I don't care how you do it.</i>

725
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,107
<i>I want Sara Tancredi</i>

726
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:47,515
dead by the end
of the day.

727
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,286
<i>Open cell!
One hour!</i>

728
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,105
Yo, we about to play cards.
Do you want in?

729
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,340
I'm okay.
Thanks.

730
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:08,875
You should.

731
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:11,736
With Daddy gone,
you're gonna need your backup.

732
00:44:14,515 --> 00:44:15,510
Hell, we all did.

733
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,386
I've got, uh...
a pre-natal thing.

734
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,123
It's cool.

735
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:22,195
Thanks.

736
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,551
Not too smart though, for a girl
with a bounty on her head.

737
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:28,699
Aren't you heard?

738
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:32,928
Tancredi,
you have a visitor.

739
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,616
Say hello to your husband
for me.

740
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:50,969
What's wrong?

741
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:54,311
Look, um...

742
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,232
I know you don't have
any control

743
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:58,784
over what's happened here,
but uh...

744
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:02,127
Things aren't working out.

745
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:05,528
Okay.

746
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:08,216
I'm trying
to find a way to...

747
00:45:08,236 --> 00:45:10,836
To do... this.

748
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:14,211
But from where
we're standing right now,

749
00:45:14,246 --> 00:45:15,190
there's only
one option.

750
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:19,015
Do you need more time...
to think?

751
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,120
<i>No. No, it's not
about that.</i>

752
00:45:21,826 --> 00:45:22,923
<i>I've made up
my mind.</i>

753
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,973
'Cause there's nothing
you could do about it.

754
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:30,432
Except...
pray for us tonight.

755
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:32,568
Pray for us?

756
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,015
You can pray for us
to be together.

757
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,586
Maybe
I'll do the same.

758
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,961
How can I rob someone
if I've no clue who he is?

759
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,047
The logbook outside says that
Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

760
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,426
A Joe Daniels.

761
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:53,293
Well if he was in
the power deduction, I'd say,

762
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:54,758
Daniels
is your bagman.

763
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,422
You know how many Daniels
live in Miami?

764
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:57,743
Thousands.
I need more.

765
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:59,303
Well you better
get crackin',

766
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:01,465
'cause if I ain't get
that money by 7 o'clock,

767
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,797
you ain't got your fire,
you ain't got your fire alarm.

768
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:05,980
And that means Pretty
ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

769
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,905
Listen, my friend,
you're in no position

770
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:08,865
to makin' demands...

771
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:09,868
Okay, shh--

772
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:13,219
I ain't talking about
backing out the deal.

773
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:16,138
I put my ear on the ground
and come up with some details.

774
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:17,270
Good.

775
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:19,527
And now, fetch.

776
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,183
We got a pilot.

777
00:46:28,977 --> 00:46:30,543
There's a guy
I'd busted 20 years ago,

778
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:31,876
running drugs
across the Gulf.

779
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:34,078
<i>Went legit.
Runs a charter business now.</i>

780
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,002
He must've jumped
out of a few planes, huh?

781
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:36,971
Yes, several.

782
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:38,404
Some for sport.

783
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:39,577
<i>Some necessity.</i>

784
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:40,852
It's a big difference,
Michael.

785
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:44,683
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

786
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:47,124
Don't worry.
I can go alone.

787
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:50,461
- What do you got?
- It's a test.

788
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,020
See, the prison was built
in the mid-80's,

789
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,379
so that exit in
the administration building

790
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:58,140
is probably protected
by an electronic code of lock,

791
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,201
modified by
a security card.

792
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:02,413
Those locks don't have
power protection,

793
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,226
which means
you can override them.

794
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:06,149
Then you can't just
go to the building,

795
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,320
shut it,
or blow it out?

796
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,198
No.

797
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:12,086
1200 volt power surge will just
set off the other alarms.

798
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,344
Not to mention
that it'll kill you.

799
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,807
That's why we have
to find another way.

800
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:20,964
Yeah.

801
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:37,102
Yeah.

802
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:39,015
Talk to me, Mahone.
What have you got?

803
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,081
Nothing yet.

804
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:41,898
<i>I don't need updates
on the hour.</i>

805
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,074
I need evidence, intent.
It's not crap.

806
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:46,469
<i>Call me when he's in the
process of committing a crime.</i>

807
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:46,791
Yeah.

808
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:47,846
<i>I'm not going
to let him walk away</i>

809
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:49,091
from me
like he did from you.

810
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,224
<i>It's going down if I've got
to shoot him in the back.</i>

811
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:14,809
Sorry.

812
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,224
Time for you
to get paid now, bitch.

813
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:11,899
Are we friends now?

814
00:49:12,023 --> 00:49:14,415
Get out of the way!
What happened here?!

815
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,224
I didn't see anything, sir.

816
00:49:15,905 --> 00:49:16,845
<i>- Move!
- Me neither.</i>

817
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:29,188
Bad news.

818
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:33,070
Agatha Warren
is dead.

819
00:49:40,202 --> 00:49:43,049
- Who did that?
- No one's talking.

820
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,614
But I hear it says fish.
Tancredi and Morgan.

821
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:49,553
No!

822
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:52,879
No!

823
00:49:54,483 --> 00:49:55,116
There he is.

824
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:58,523
If you don't like this guy,
we can still find someone else.

825
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:00,609
Good to see you, Sni.

826
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:03,476
What you get into here,
Mahone?

827
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:06,279
Jumping at 1500 feet
ain't going to be easy.

828
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:07,841
You've gone back
on your word already?

829
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,733
Let's not forget who's doing
who a favor here.

830
00:50:09,768 --> 00:50:10,346
Favor?

831
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,634
Favor that I bust
your old lady for traficking.

832
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:13,587
No, I did not.

833
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:18,449
If anyone asks,
I was flying tourists to the Keys,

834
00:50:18,522 --> 00:50:20,605
and it's not my fault
they jumped.

835
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,683
Sounds good to me.

836
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:31,428
If you don't like this guy,
we'd take a day.

837
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,858
- We come up with a new plan.
- No, there's no time, Alex.

838
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:38,269
- It's not just Sara's life at risk.
- I understand that.

839
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:40,144
I know you do.

840
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:42,237
That's why I also know
I can ask for your help.

841
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,586
- Yeah. What do you need?
- If I don't make it...

842
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:49,098
I want you to make sure
Sara and my brother

843
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,189
get out of
the country alive.

844
00:50:50,523 --> 00:50:52,196
I need to know
they're gonna be okay.

845
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:55,167
And I'm gonna trust
that you'll do everything

846
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:56,433
you can
to make that happen.

847
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:02,868
Take this.

848
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:10,972
I trust you, Alex.

849
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,338
Remember that.

850
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,055
Special delivery.

851
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:48,816
- What is it?
- I don't exactly know.

852
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:51,259
It came via messenger from uh...
the lady side.

853
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:55,941
"My man on the outside needs to know
who to call for the birthday present."

854
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:57,319
Whose birthday is it?

855
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,662
Well, just see to it that it gets back
to the same place.

856
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:08,520
Will do.

857
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,003
So this is
Joe Daniels' number, right?

858
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:16,239
<i>That's it.</i>

859
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:17,424
<i>Is that
enough information,</i>

860
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:19,135
or you need
a social security number too?

861
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:20,642
<i>- That'll do.
- Remember--</i>

862
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:23,729
I want that money wired
to the account number specified.

863
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,833
No wire, no fire.

864
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:26,208
You boys
do me wrong,

865
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,935
I have no qualms at all about
singing it loud and clear,

866
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,527
you understand?

867
00:52:28,614 --> 00:52:29,875
You know what?
Just be ready.

868
00:52:34,758 --> 00:52:35,719
That was Sofia.

869
00:52:36,004 --> 00:52:37,583
She'll meet you
in the San Andreas Harbor

870
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:38,668
in Dominican Republic
and then

871
00:52:38,712 --> 00:52:40,645
- you guys can fly to Costa Rica.
- Cool.

872
00:52:41,246 --> 00:52:42,228
I know
where Daniels is.

873
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,677
And after
we rob him,

874
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:45,680
I'll take the money
to Quik Green and, uh...

875
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,904
wire to the bank.

876
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:49,234
You're gonna meet us
at the airstrip, right?

877
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,231
Might give
a shot now.

878
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,342
Okay.
This is it.

879
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:54,092
<i>We're ready.</i>

880
00:52:57,443 --> 00:52:58,474
Thanks, buddy.

881
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:01,654
For everything.

882
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:03,768
Good luck, papi.

883
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:05,237
See you
on the other side.

884
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:12,370
Nobody's talking, huh?
Girl's dead. No one's said any?

885
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:23,089
I made it
in the woodshop.

886
00:53:23,824 --> 00:53:25,040
Want to give
my daughter Emily

887
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,619
a birthday gift
on her actual birthday.

888
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,825
So I need
to get out of here.

889
00:53:29,826 --> 00:53:30,440
<i>It's funny.</i>

890
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:35,303
- You're never sentimental.
- Oh, I'm not. It's just for her.

891
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,227
We need to get
to the chapel.

892
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,056
We?

893
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:49,457
There's no way out of here,
right now.

894
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:50,234
I'm gonna need you.

895
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:08,163
Yeah?

896
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,039
Mr. Daniels,
American Paint Company,

897
00:54:10,076 --> 00:54:10,815
<i>here for the job.</i>

898
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:14,574
Well, this is Mr. Daniels,
but I didn't order any painters.

899
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,698
<i>It's Wednesday, sir.
I believe you did.</i>

900
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:22,354
Hold it right there.
I'm calling the police.

901
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:39,169
Get out!

902
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:46,373
<i>This is it.</i>

903
00:54:48,405 --> 00:54:50,441
I'll be right back.
Gotta get that parachute.

904
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:07,431
Michael!

905
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:10,764
Come here.

906
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,404
There's
a better way.

907
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:20,817
<i>Mess!</i>

908
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,149
Mess,
half hour.

909
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,333
<i>Little faster.
We don't have all day.</i>

910
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,158
<i>Let's go!</i>

911
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:38,695
Got any ideas?

912
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,333
Yeah. Keep your head down
and follow me.

913
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:42,186
I'll think
of something.

914
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,475
You better think of something fast,
'cause we have company.

915
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:07,076
I hope you're ready
for a fight, princess.

916
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:08,490
This one's
to the death.

917
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:15,063
Do you think
you can overpower her?

918
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,883
Yeah. I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

919
00:56:25,611 --> 00:56:26,516
Just be ready.

920
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:37,511
- Hello?
- It's me.

921
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:40,284
I got the message
about the birthday present?

922
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,359
Was the gift earned?

923
00:56:42,714 --> 00:56:43,903
What in the hell
are you talking about?

924
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:46,643
- The birthday present.
- Birthday present?

925
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:48,203
Two guys showed up
at my house,

926
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,103
they took the money
and they

927
00:56:49,103 --> 00:56:50,169
<i>beat the crap
out of me.</i>

928
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:02,361
Howdy, General.

929
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,223
I just thought of let you know
how I came in with some green.

930
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:12,651
My personal preference is
two Zegna bars and a copy of the Times.

931
00:57:13,953 --> 00:57:15,508
So I see you
in the AEM?

932
00:57:16,463 --> 00:57:19,777
You worthless son of a whore.
Go to hell!

933
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:21,627
Careful
I don't get there first.

934
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:25,246
Lest I become
king of that prison, too.

935
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,469
<i>Alright, from takeoff,
the prison's gonna come up</i>

936
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:36,196
real fast.

937
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:38,660
So whatever you gotta do
to get ready, do it now.

938
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:39,598
You got it.

939
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:42,663
We've got the money.

940
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:45,316
Sucre's just dropped me off
on the way to wire it.

941
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,350
Good.
That means T-Bag's set.

942
00:57:48,058 --> 00:57:49,728
I'm goin' to see how long
it's gonna take and we get going.

943
00:57:53,313 --> 00:57:54,383
You sure that thing's
gonna hold you up?

944
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:55,321
Yeah,
it'll be fine.

945
00:57:56,481 --> 00:57:57,110
What about you?

946
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,222
This is not my first time
inside a prison.

947
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:03,381
But hopefully...
will be my last.

948
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:15,203
Think about all the amazing stories
you're gonna be able to tell your kid.

949
00:58:19,314 --> 00:58:21,592
You're gonna be the type of father
our dad never was.

950
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,739
Someone
to look up to.

951
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:27,290
Take care, Michael.

952
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:34,624
<i>Unless you've got details,
I'm hanging up.</i>

953
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,756
And you can forget about
getting your badge back.

954
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:39,052
He's got a plane.
He's got a parachute into the yard.

955
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:40,469
- What?
- Yeah, I swear to God,

956
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:41,271
he's gonna be over

957
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,721
<i>prison airspace
at 7 o'clock.</i>

958
00:58:49,449 --> 00:58:52,176
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs in the yard.

959
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:54,161
And be ready to turn off
all exterior lights.

960
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:56,235
Scofield won't see what's coming
until it's too late.

961
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:58,726
And bring me
Sara Tancredi.

962
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:06,655
Wait, wait.

963
00:59:07,204 --> 00:59:08,670
What do you think happened
with Agatha,

964
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:09,606
it's not what happened.

965
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,320
I need to make this
right with you, okay?

966
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:13,015
Go ahead.

967
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:15,633
I was hoping
I'd see you here.

968
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,581
You know I still owe you
one big juicy favor.

969
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:21,325
Later, blue eyes.

970
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,039
I swear to God
she wanted to kill me

971
00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:24,610
and I was just
defending myself.

972
00:59:25,525 --> 00:59:27,311
<i>- You remember that?
- Yes, I do.</i>

973
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:28,766
My momma
gave me that.

974
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:32,977
Told me I was going to give it
to one of my kids one day.

975
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:37,494
Not only did I get knocked up,
but the girl in the family...

976
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:42,394
And I practically raised Agatha
and she was no killer.

977
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:45,931
Now I can say
that much for myself.

978
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,838
You didn't know
what I had in mind yet.

979
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,245
Okay, listen, you're right.
Agatha isn't a killer.

980
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:56,778
She was just a-- real bitch
with a bit of more than she need to.

981
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:01,530
Skittles.

982
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:03,595
Okay.

983
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:05,080
We cool.
We cool.

984
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:08,000
We cool, we--
whoa, whoa, whoa.

985
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,768
<i>Kaorla. She wants you
to bring Tancredi to her office.</i>

986
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,149
A'ight? Okay.

987
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:41,598
Son of a bitch!

988
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:44,865
They'll be coming
right through here, okay?

989
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:49,543
Federal agent Todd Wheatley.
I need to get inside right now.

990
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:50,983
Emergency team
takes priority, sir.

991
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:52,690
I'm the leader of
the emergency team.

992
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:53,497
Now let me inside.

993
01:00:53,509 --> 01:00:55,757
- Sorry. Strict orders.
- Go talk to your supervisor.

994
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:56,590
Come on!

995
01:00:57,608 --> 01:00:59,684
<i>No weapons!
Let the suburban through.</i>

996
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,676
The plane should be overhead
any minute.

997
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:13,167
Hey, fellas!
Kill the lights.

998
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:25,469
As soon as he hits the ground,
I just want one of you to start firing.

999
01:01:30,706 --> 01:01:31,704
Standby.

1000
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:38,040
We're standing by.

1001
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:41,754
Easy now.
Hold your fire.

1002
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:45,752
Standby!

1003
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,789
Now!

1004
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,238
Where the hell's
Scofield?

1005
01:02:28,029 --> 01:02:29,666
Emergency team
takes priority, sir.

1006
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,533
I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside right now.

1007
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:34,827
<i>I've strict orders.
No one gets inside at this point, sir.</i>

1008
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:36,704
<i>I don't care what your orders are.
Go talk to your supervisor.</i>

1009
01:02:58,476 --> 01:03:00,353
<i>Why isn't Tancredi
in front of me right now?</i>

1010
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:02,598
We've just got
the situation under control.

1011
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:03,606
We're looking for her
right now.

1012
01:03:04,775 --> 01:03:05,775
Oh my God!

1013
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:08,906
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. It was Morgan.

1014
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,922
Check the kitchen.
They might be in the kitchen.

1015
01:03:47,442 --> 01:03:48,783
I'm not gonna make it
on my own.

1016
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:54,546
Either leave me with tools here
or make up your damn mind.

1017
01:04:13,135 --> 01:04:14,259
Are you gonna be able
to make it?

1018
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:16,265
Yeah.

1019
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:17,843
Okay.
It's now.

1020
01:04:28,409 --> 01:04:29,187
Alright, hold up.

1021
01:04:39,853 --> 01:04:40,954
Nah,
I think we're good.

1022
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:05,104
<i>Don't move!</i>

1023
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:16,044
- Stand on the dark, now!
- Please, I just...

1024
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,309
On the ground!

1025
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:26,875
You're here alone?

1026
01:05:28,585 --> 01:05:30,835
Damn it, con. When I ask you
a question, you answer.

1027
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,633
Is there
anyone else here?

1028
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,342
Yes.

1029
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:36,721
<i>Who?</i>

1030
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,225
- God.
- Excuse me?

1031
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,652
He's always here.

1032
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:48,397
I was worried about my little girl
on the outside.

1033
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:51,019
<i>So I came to pray.</i>

1034
01:05:52,138 --> 01:05:53,891
See if someone would
watch over her.

1035
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:00,410
Go check it out.

1036
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:24,142
<i>The stove mess is open.
Need support right now!</i>

1037
01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:25,770
<i>I've got to get
these animals locked down!</i>

1038
01:06:26,061 --> 01:06:27,061
We better head
over there.

1039
01:06:34,052 --> 01:06:34,986
<i>I hope that daughter
of yours</i>

1040
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:37,864
- is hell a lot smarter than you.
- So do I.

1041
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:53,932
Hey.

1042
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,666
Are you ready
to go?

1043
01:07:04,832 --> 01:07:07,076
<i>Nobody gets in or out
of this prison.</i>

1044
01:07:07,118 --> 01:07:09,071
I don't care if it's the President
having to take a piss,

1045
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,425
you tell him
to turn the hell around.

1046
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:11,731
Get a team.

1047
01:07:11,814 --> 01:07:14,807
I want every inch of that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

1048
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:15,929
Yes, sir.

1049
01:07:20,293 --> 01:07:22,075
Michael said this is where
they're gonna come out.

1050
01:07:24,948 --> 01:07:26,693
You think Sucre
made the drop on time?

1051
01:07:28,065 --> 01:07:29,062
I don't know.

1052
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:40,367
No, no, no.

1053
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,813
<i>Please enter
your account number.</i>

1054
01:07:49,884 --> 01:07:51,837
9248.

1055
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:58,068
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

1056
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:01,378
<i>If you would like
to access another account--</i>

1057
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:03,682
9248, pow!

1058
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,709
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

1059
01:08:11,247 --> 01:08:12,833
What the hell you thinking
you're doing, fish?

1060
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:13,652
We're in lockdown.

1061
01:08:14,031 --> 01:08:14,759
What for?

1062
01:08:15,145 --> 01:08:16,833
Something's going on in bitch block.
I don't know.

1063
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,853
What's it worth to you
to find out?

1064
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:27,955
We're going to get
through here?

1065
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,237
On the other side is
a kind of an escape hatch

1066
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,196
for the administrators.

1067
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:32,526
In case of a riot.

1068
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,621
If this is the same system
they have in Fox River,

1069
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:37,891
that door can only be open remotely
from the Central Control.

1070
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:39,291
That's why we've gone
and ask for help.

1071
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,877
T-Bag.

1072
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:46,241
Tell them
what you told me.

1073
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:50,018
Michael Scofield is about
to stage a prison break.

1074
01:08:51,936 --> 01:08:54,158
<i>And I know exactly
how he's gonna do it.</i>

1075
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,959
Exactly what did
Scofield asked you to do?

1076
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:01,083
Just light a fire
in my cell.

1077
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:02,003
And the rest...

1078
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,868
The rest will just
take care of itself.

1079
01:09:04,985 --> 01:09:05,877
A fire alarm.

1080
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:07,604
If that goes off,
what's your protocol?

1081
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:09,453
State law, mandatory evac.

1082
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:10,551
Hell,
he won't go break,

1083
01:09:10,592 --> 01:09:12,134
I was goin' to get you
to escort her out.

1084
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,672
- Shut up!
- Get him outta here.

1085
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:18,161
Alright, the evacuation's only
going to get him out in the yard.

1086
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:19,445
Whatever he's up to,

1087
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:21,651
he needs noise
and he needs chaos.

1088
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:24,768
Deactivate the smoke detection system,
the fire alarm,

1089
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:26,057
and while you're at it,
kill the horn.

1090
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,257
If anybody so much as bends
a blade of grass in this place,

1091
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:30,837
I want him to be able
to hear it.

1092
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,939
- What are we waiting for?
- We made a deal.

1093
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:44,310
With the right price,
T-Bag will set off the fire alarms.

1094
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:56,771
That's what
we're waiting for.

1095
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:11,067
- Michael, there's a--
- It's okay.

1096
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,594
See, there's only one thing
you can count on

1097
01:10:13,629 --> 01:10:14,894
when you're dealing
with T-Bag.

1098
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:16,429
He's a rat.

1099
01:10:20,253 --> 01:10:20,751
Anything?

1100
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,746
So far, just a female inmate
loose in the yard.

1101
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:24,949
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen.

1102
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:26,571
- Over by the chapel.
- Alright.

1103
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:36,752
Alright.

1104
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,282
Great.
Let's go.

1105
01:10:48,847 --> 01:10:50,437
Okay,
down there.

1106
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:07,160
Okay.

1107
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:11,474
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

1108
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,243
On the other end
of that is Linc,

1109
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:14,032
and after that,

1110
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,233
there's a boat mounted
for white sands and blue water.

1111
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:22,718
A power surge to the system,
will override the reader,

1112
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,298
for just a few seconds.

1113
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,044
Just long enough for you
to open that, so get ready.

1114
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,764
3, 2, 1.

1115
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:37,515
One more time.

1116
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:40,757
3, 2, 1.

1117
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:50,046
I was afraid
this might happen.

1118
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:52,378
It's okay.
It's alright.

1119
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:52,925
We're going
to keep moving

1120
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,057
and we're gonna find
another way out of here.

1121
01:11:56,634 --> 01:11:57,797
I know
what I have to do.

1122
01:12:13,922 --> 01:12:15,652
I need units to the chapel.
Now!

1123
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,620
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

1124
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:29,948
They should've been here
by now.

1125
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:36,822
The battery wasn't generating
enough power.

1126
01:12:37,335 --> 01:12:39,054
We have to blow the system
for the whole building.

1127
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,397
Okay.
What do you want to try?

1128
01:12:47,752 --> 01:12:48,830
This is
the main fuse.

1129
01:12:48,914 --> 01:12:49,744
If I yanked that,

1130
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,067
everything will go dark
for a second.

1131
01:12:53,105 --> 01:12:54,803
I reconnect
these two cables...

1132
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,584
If I reconnect
these two cables,

1133
01:12:59,081 --> 01:12:59,870
there'll be
a lot of noise,

1134
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:02,443
every light bulb in this place
is going to blow.

1135
01:13:02,484 --> 01:13:04,309
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

1136
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:06,468
And I want you
to start running.

1137
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:09,188
Okay.
What about you?

1138
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,261
Michael?

1139
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:18,710
Sara...

1140
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:22,279
Someone has
to stay here,

1141
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,645
and someone has
to open the hatch.

1142
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:27,227
And that someone's
gotta be you.

1143
01:13:27,549 --> 01:13:29,727
Okay. So I'll leave it
open for you.

1144
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:31,451
You don't understand.

1145
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:33,743
This is the only way.

1146
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:41,950
I'm not leaving unless
you're coming with me.

1147
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:45,976
But I am coming
with you.

1148
01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:54,441
I love you.

1149
01:13:55,852 --> 01:13:57,096
God,
I love you too.

1150
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:03,268
Go!

1151
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:06,972
Go, Sara.
Go.

1152
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,674
Downstairs.

1153
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:30,470
Where's Michael?

1154
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:35,939
Sara, where is he?
Where's Michael?

1155
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:37,650
Where is he?

1156
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:53,087
He's not coming back.

1157
01:15:59,603 --> 01:16:00,599
He's not coming back.

1158
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:02,625
What do you mean,
he's not coming back?

1159
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,458
What do you mean
by that?

1160
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,055
He's not coming back.

1161
01:16:15,456 --> 01:16:16,353
<i>He'll be here.</i>

1162
01:16:19,647 --> 01:16:20,643
He's gone,
Lincoln.

1163
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:29,867
Linc,
we gotta go.

1164
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:33,964
We gotta go.

1165
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:53,967
<i>We gotta go.</i>

1166
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:28,235
<i>Hey,
I'll be over there in a minute.</i>

1167
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:35,093
Why am I being punished?!
I'm the guy through the window!

1168
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,412
You aided and abetted an escape,
Mr. Bagwell.

1169
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,208
And as far as
the authorities are concerned,

1170
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:40,155
you're an accomplice.

1171
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:43,144
Scofield!

1172
01:17:45,053 --> 01:17:46,418
Scofield!

1173
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:53,061
Scofield!

1174
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:17,653
Michael asked me to give you this,
if he didn't make it out.

1175
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:21,033
He said it would help you understand
why he did what he did.

1176
01:18:25,762 --> 01:18:27,299
It's his bloodwork.

1177
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:55,140
This is
the General's money.

1178
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:57,801
I was supposed
to wire it down

1179
01:18:57,837 --> 01:18:59,810
to Costa Rica for you
to pick up but uh...

1180
01:19:01,412 --> 01:19:02,574
I ran into
some trouble.

1181
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,686
I'm sorry.

1182
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:10,118
You take care
of that baby, okay?

1183
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,492
You take care yours.

1184
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:40,844
This is for you.

1185
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,364
He never said
anything to me.

1186
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:47,393
Why didn't he
just tell me?

1187
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:50,834
'Cause he knew you'll try
to stop him.

1188
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:53,285
He knew you'd do anything
to protect your family.

1189
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:54,946
But I didn't.

1190
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,623
<i>Well...</i>

1191
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:04,864
You will soon.

1192
01:20:08,624 --> 01:20:09,720
Take it easy.

1193
01:20:18,974 --> 01:20:19,624
Sara.

1194
01:20:22,294 --> 01:20:23,291
Thank you.

1195
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:26,900
Yeah.

1196
01:21:06,034 --> 01:21:07,779
<i>Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.</i>

1197
01:21:08,524 --> 01:21:09,727
<i>Because that means
you're safe.</i>

1198
01:21:13,545 --> 01:21:14,749
<i>And that's
all I ever wanted.</i>

1199
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,375
<i>I wish I could...
be there with you.</i>

1200
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,343
<i>But as you probably
know now,</i>

1201
01:21:24,003 --> 01:21:26,244
<i>I wouldn't have much
time anyway, so...</i>

1202
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:29,646
<i>I made my choice,
and--</i>

1203
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:32,344
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

1204
01:21:35,664 --> 01:21:38,192
<i>Anyway,
not too long from now,</i>

1205
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,105
<i>there's going to be another
little Scofield running around.</i>

1206
01:21:41,392 --> 01:21:42,139
<i>And Linc,</i>

1207
01:21:42,927 --> 01:21:44,296
<i>I want you
to promise me,</i>

1208
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:45,736
<i>no matter what,</i>

1209
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:48,612
<i>they're going to grow up knowing
their uncle is never far away.</i>

1210
01:21:51,303 --> 01:21:51,849
<i>And Sara,</i>

1211
01:21:52,938 --> 01:21:54,023
<i>I want you
to promise me</i>

1212
01:21:54,058 --> 01:21:55,211
<i>that you're gonna keep
an eye on Linc.</i>

1213
01:21:56,332 --> 01:21:57,394
<i>As you may
have noticed,</i>

1214
01:21:57,429 --> 01:21:58,669
<i>he has the tendency
to get in trouble.</i>

1215
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:07,162
<i>You know we spend
so much of our lives,</i>

1216
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,079
<i>not saying the things
we want to say.</i>

1217
01:22:11,023 --> 01:22:12,309
<i>The things
we should say.</i>

1218
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:16,376
<i>We speak in code,
we send little messages.</i>

1219
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,159
<i>Origami.</i>

1220
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:22,227
<i>So now,
plainly, simply,</i>

1221
01:22:24,177 --> 01:22:25,754
<i>I want to say that
I love you both.</i>

1222
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:30,277
<i>Very much.</i>

1223
01:22:32,808 --> 01:22:34,431
<i>And I want you
to promise me,</i>

1224
01:22:35,714 --> 01:22:37,332
<i>that you're gonna
tell my child,</i>

1225
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:43,308
<i>that you're gonna tell my child
how much they're loved every day.</i>

1226
01:22:44,512 --> 01:22:46,379
<i>and remind them
how lucky they are...</i>

1227
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,661
<i>To be free.</i>

1228
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,359
<i>Because we are.</i>

1229
01:22:53,227 --> 01:22:54,513
<i>We're free now.</i>

1230
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,086
<i>Finally.</i>

1231
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,696
<i>We're free.</i>

1232
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,250
<i>You ready?</i>

1233
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,882
Didn't think I'd be
this nervous.

1234
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,766
Now or never.

1235
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,645
Alright, papi,
let's do this.

1236
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:41,325
He's over there.

1237
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,394
You must be
Michael.

1238
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:54,652
Your friend,
Fernando,

1239
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,332
tells me you could
use my services today.

1240
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,107
Very much so.

1241
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:00,853
And I assume that's
the other half of your team?

1242
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,598
You look beautiful.

1243
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,357
Thank you.

1244
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:22,072
And it's my understanding
you'd like to keep this simple?

1245
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:26,075
We've never actually managed
to keep anything simple...

1246
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:27,707
You could try.

1247
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,175
Well.
Let's begin then, shall we?

1248
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:34,003
Family and friends,
we gather here...

1249
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:38,902
to celebrate the union between
Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi.

1250
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:25,051
- Sorry to break up the party.
- What the hell's going on?

1251
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,250
We have
an arrest warrant.

1252
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>- What?
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

1253
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,195
We talked to
Agent Paul Kellerman in D.C.

1254
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,243
<i>We've settled this
with the feds.</i>

1255
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,986
We settled this with
the feds weeks ago!

1256
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,197
Sir, back up!

1257
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:35,745
- We were exonerated.
- Sir...

1258
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,303
<i>- We were exonerated!
- Back up!</i>

1259
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,218
<i>We're not here for you.
We're here for her.</i>

1260
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,807
She didn't do anything.
She wasn't involved.

1261
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,321
<i>Don't make this
escalate!</i>

1262
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,633
Sara Tancredi,

1263
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,242
you're under arrest for
the murder of Christina Hampton.

1264
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:49,972
<i>What?!</i>

1265
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,275
<i>She didn't kill
anyone!</i>

1266
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:54,430
Funny. Surveillance camera
footage says different.

1267
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,050
Michael.

1268
00:02:58,574 --> 00:02:59,835
<i>- Please, right this way.
- Michael.</i>

1269
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,144
<i>- Second car, please.
- Michael!</i>

1270
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,082
<i>- Second car.
- What's going on?</i>

1271
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:02,975
<i>Back up, please.</i>

1272
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:11,734
S04E23:
The Old Ball And Chain

1273
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:16,651
They're not gonna
let me see her.

1274
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:19,280
Why did Kellerman send you
if you can't do anything?

1275
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,446
They're trying
to break both of you.

1276
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,726
Look, she has a constitutional right
to reasonable visitation.

1277
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:28,320
I'll draw up an order to show cause
and get it before the judge immediately.

1278
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,028
<i>While you're at it,</i>

1279
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:30,813
- can you argue in self defence?
- How?

1280
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,433
Anything that might help her
is out of frame.

1281
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,911
Security camera only shows Sara
stepping up and firing at the victim.

1282
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,967
- Pull the trigger, Michael.
- Drop... the gun!

1283
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,708
<i>Misfire.</i>

1284
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,012
- She worked for the Company.
- To you.

1285
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,001
To a jury, she's Christina Hampton,
Technology Consultant.

1286
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,904
And because she was so good
at hiding her true identity,

1287
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:55,104
we can't
prove otherwise.

1288
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:57,835
<i>Look,
you were all exonerated.</i>

1289
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,895
It did not sit well
with law enforcement.

1290
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,257
If they can make Sara
pay for it, they will.

1291
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,108
How much time
is she looking at?

1292
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,532
25 to life.

1293
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,582
You.
Over here.

1294
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:30,733
You.
Here.

1295
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>You.</i>

1296
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:35,295
Here.

1297
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:40,903
This one's yours.

1298
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,974
Am I supposed to be
in a different facility?

1299
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:45,314
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1300
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,973
I haven't been convicted
of anything yet.

1301
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,030
I'm supposed to be in a jail.
This is prison.

1302
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:50,750
Overcrowding
and budget cuts, fish.

1303
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:54,206
This is the jail.
That's the prison.

1304
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,241
<i>'Sup, homie?
You need some help?</i>

1305
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,780
<i>You got everything
you need over there?</i>

1306
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,200
<i>Why don't you go help
and make her bed?</i>

1307
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:24,725
Don't let them spook you.
They just like to intimidate.

1308
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:25,878
They are good at it.

1309
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:27,400
Look.

1310
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:31,014
This jail-prison
hybrid thing's B.S.

1311
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,069
Come on.

1312
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,906
The other one's
practically empty.

1313
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,812
You can ride it out
to your court date there.

1314
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,949
Thank you.

1315
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:00,897
Here. This should be a little bit
more comfortable for you.

1316
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:01,587
Okay.

1317
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,575
What's going on?

1318
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:11,982
<i>You know...</i>

1319
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,601
At first,
I couldn't place your name.

1320
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,152
Tancredi.
It sounded so familiar.

1321
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,635
But then, Haggs here,
figured it out.

1322
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:24,284
I remembered your pretty face
from the papers.

1323
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,979
You're not
going anywhere, fish.

1324
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:30,787
This is going
to happen.

1325
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,007
Half a dozen guards

1326
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:34,330
lost their jobs and pensions
at Fox River.

1327
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,622
Another dozen
were put on probation,

1328
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:36,809
after you decided

1329
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,293
to leave
the door open

1330
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,482
for your boyfriend
and his seven convict pals.

1331
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,520
<i>And we...</i>

1332
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,922
ain't gonna let anything
like that happen again.

1333
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:49,417
Don't worry,

1334
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,063
we won't hit
the baby basket.

1335
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,098
<i>That's right.</i>

1336
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:12,497
Looked like that welcome wagon
ran over your face.

1337
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,517
It looks
that way, huh?

1338
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:21,308
<i>Alright, well...</i>

1339
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,903
<i>You need something,
you just ask for me.</i>

1340
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,397
Everybody calls me
"Daddy".

1341
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,998
Special delivery.

1342
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,791
You know,
all we need is a little cash,

1343
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,543
spread around
in places.

1344
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,891
I told you.

1345
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,656
The government's
exposing my assets.

1346
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,267
You tellin' me you can't get
your hands on the cash?

1347
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:12,132
Unless, that's the least
you could do.

1348
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:14,290
Considering you was gonna kill me
not too long ago.

1349
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,530
Goodbye, Theodore.

1350
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,054
You ain't never been
incarcerated before,

1351
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,171
and I never been
incarcerated here.

1352
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:24,586
Therefore,

1353
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,898
now let's just say
this handicapped connie

1354
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,017
got the juicy hand back
in Fox River.

1355
00:08:30,936 --> 00:08:34,850
<i>Your pathetic existence here
could be ameliorated.</i>

1356
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,420
<i>As can my life,</i>

1357
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,409
all with a little
"Roberto de Niro".

1358
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,623
One of our friends has been
apprehended by the authorities.

1359
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:47,169
<i>Looks like we've got
a new neighbour.</i>

1360
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,837
I'm never gonna get out
of this prison alive.

1361
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:51,797
I know that.

1362
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,074
I wanna bring my enemy
down with me.

1363
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,841
I want her dead.

1364
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:07,180
Either way, it's going
to require a capital.

1365
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,017
A capital
you no longer have.

1366
00:09:09,051 --> 00:09:11,756
My rainy day plan.
Do you know where it is?

1367
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,911
<i>Jonathan.</i>

1368
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:15,312
I'd assume that that would be
used for your defense.

1369
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,102
It's good money
after bad, Joe.

1370
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,977
They're not gonna
let me out of here.

1371
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,625
No matter how many shots,
it's that hard.

1372
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,219
Get that.

1373
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,290
To our friend, in the sister cells,
across the compound.

1374
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,118
Excuse me.

1375
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:15,988
<i>Bad move.</i>

1376
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,700
Last time someone touched her,
they got a crack kneecap.

1377
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,084
You're much braver
than I gave you credit for.

1378
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:46,417
Either that,
or you're amazingly nice.

1379
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,803
Do I look like
I wanna talk to you?

1380
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,411
I just say,
a woman in your position

1381
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,959
laid up
for some protection.

1382
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,501
Join the prison gang?
I don't think so.

1383
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,062
Not a gang.
No.

1384
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,135
A family.

1385
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,311
They don't call her "Daddy"
for nothin'.

1386
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:05,310
That's her wife.

1387
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,843
And those are
her kids.

1388
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,427
- Are you okay?
- Stay the hell away from me.

1389
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:19,814
I need
to go down the infirmary.

1390
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:21,646
<i>Can't go down the infirmiary
without a release form.</i>

1391
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,593
I'm having muscle contractions
on my throat.

1392
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:24,732
And my jaws'
tightening up.

1393
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,923
It's--It's just
could be indigestions,

1394
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:27,842
I'm not poisoned.

1395
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:29,887
No. That's the government cheese.
You'll get used to it.

1396
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,977
If I don't get to the hospital
in the next 15 minutes,

1397
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:34,408
I will die
and my baby will die.

1398
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:35,204
Please.

1399
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:37,214
<i>Boss.</i>

1400
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,503
Why don't you let her
go see the doc?

1401
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:45,597
Please.

1402
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:48,765
This is Kaorla.

1403
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:50,345
Inmate going
to the infirmary.

1404
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:00,977
We were able to administer
the charcoal labrigintein.

1405
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,740
You and your baby
are gonna be okay.

1406
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:08,497
You know the strignein didn't get into
my meatloaf all by itself, right?

1407
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,754
Well then, you need to talk
to the warden about it.

1408
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,219
Then how about talking to me
about your face?

1409
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,620
<i>You want to tell me
how that happened?</i>

1410
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,799
I caught an elbow
playing basketball.

1411
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:27,119
We should discuss your...
situation.

1412
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:28,956
As I'm sure
you've ascertained

1413
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,661
this isn't going to be
a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.

1414
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:32,534
Do I deliver in here?

1415
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:33,121
No.

1416
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,481
The day we induce,
we'll secure you in an ambulance.

1417
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,060
We'll take you to St. Lucia
down the road.

1418
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,516
We'll cordone off a room.

1419
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,111
There'll be three armed guards
in there with me,

1420
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:41,967
when you give birth.

1421
00:12:42,407 --> 00:12:43,839
Do I get
to see my baby?

1422
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,520
You'll have 30 minutes
before we take it away.

1423
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,550
I've seen this process
a dozen times.

1424
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,866
<i>After the mothers come back here,
the depression's almost unbearable.</i>

1425
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:56,952
<i>My advice,</i>

1426
00:12:57,872 --> 00:12:59,059
it's a lot
less messy,

1427
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:01,048
if you'd just think of yourself
as a surrogate.

1428
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,542
Yeah?

1429
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:15,853
Michael,
it's Lou Phillips.

1430
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:16,926
Listen, um...

1431
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,721
Your wife had
an incident earlier today.

1432
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:20,778
Someone tried
to poison her.

1433
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,783
What are you
talking about?

1434
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,288
Michael,
I need you to focus.

1435
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:26,005
<i>Do you have any idea
who might have done this?</i>

1436
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,499
Michael?

1437
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:29,373
Michael?!

1438
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,163
<i>Go ahead,
let him in.</i>

1439
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:46,951
If I had a list of all the people
who might come to visit me...

1440
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,252
your name would be at the bottom,
somewhere below

1441
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:51,837
Jesus Christ
and Scooby Doo.

1442
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:55,558
- Someone tried to poison Sara today.
- Mercy--

1443
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,102
Only you
would be depraved enough,

1444
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,371
to think that killing an innocent woman
and her unborn child

1445
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:04,248
would bring you some kind of peace
before your execution.

1446
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:06,671
Sara is with child?

1447
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:09,125
Congratulations!

1448
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:12,632
This is like the 4th of July
and Christmas Day rolled into one.

1449
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,735
I am asking you,

1450
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:16,954
father to father,
to leave her alone.

1451
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,921
You can kill me
if you want to kill me,

1452
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,384
I'll trade my life
for hers.

1453
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:23,772
But leave Sara alone.

1454
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,061
Michael...

1455
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:27,886
If you were killed,

1456
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:30,162
your pain would last
a moment.

1457
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:32,056
If Sara were killed,

1458
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:35,184
your pain would last
the rest of your life.

1459
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,026
Now that's got to be appealing
to whoever put out this hit.

1460
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,277
But don't worry,
Michael.

1461
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,264
If I find out anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

1462
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:48,845
<i>Prison life
can be tough.</i>

1463
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,134
If I remember correctly,

1464
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:52,365
you have two missing toes
that can attest to that bag.

1465
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,324
I don't think you understand.
She's not safe here!

1466
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,319
Please.

1467
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:01,002
Please just approve the transfer
to another facility.

1468
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,140
If I grant her a transfer,
everybody's gonna want one.

1469
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,602
What about
segregrated housing?

1470
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,594
Is there something
that I should know about

1471
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:08,449
the structural integrity
of shoe?

1472
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:10,798
I can see
where this is going.

1473
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,084
I know who you are.

1474
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,818
And I'm not going
to let you turn my prison

1475
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:14,927
into the next
Fox River.

1476
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:18,103
All I'm trying to do,
is keep my wife alive.

1477
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,984
You do know
she's pregnant.

1478
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,909
I don't care.

1479
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,663
Here.

1480
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:39,430
Thanks.

1481
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,842
In case I haven't
made myself clear--

1482
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:43,810
Sara Tancredi is not getting
any preferential treatment.

1483
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,230
And you've made
yourself perfectly clear.

1484
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:48,532
Thank you
for your time.

1485
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:56,056
- What happened?
- The General wants Sara dead

1486
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,812
and the warden's just
gonna let that happen.

1487
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,252
We gotta lure in the case
if he's gonna get her out, right?

1488
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:01,072
Which is
not enough time.

1489
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:03,287
She stays in that prison,
someone's going to kill her.

1490
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:05,900
I guess we don't have
a choice.

1491
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,187
We're breaking her out.

1492
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,806
<i>In my 16 years
in the Bureau,</i>

1493
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:25,434
I've worked cases under
43 different agents.

1494
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,189
<i>Alexander Mahone,</i>

1495
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,529
<i>is the smartest,</i>

1496
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:31,907
bravest,

1497
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,186
most honorable man,

1498
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,836
I've ever had the pleasure
of serving with.

1499
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:41,520
As one of those 43 agents,
I can't help but feel a bit offended.

1500
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:45,532
Because obviously, I am not as honoured
as this drive-addicted murderer.

1501
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:49,251
Alex has been clean and sober
for four months.

1502
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:52,009
And he's been completely
exonerated of all crimes

1503
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,016
<i>associated with his involvement
with the Company.</i>

1504
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,317
That doesn't include the shooting
and murder of one Oscar Shales

1505
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:59,768
and burying his body
under his bird bath--

1506
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,032
That is just an allegation.

1507
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:02,750
Let's move on,
shall we?

1508
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,549
All those in favor of
reinstating Alexander Mahone,

1509
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,642
a Special Agent in the Federal
Bureau of Investigation--

1510
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,439
Aye.

1511
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,704
- All those oppose?
- Alright, alright, I've--

1512
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:23,059
Thank you
for the invite, Richard.

1513
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:27,405
It's always a pleasure.

1514
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,420
You know, Alex.
This ruling can't be revisited.

1515
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,297
If you're able to
sufficiently demonstrate,

1516
00:17:35,332 --> 00:17:37,968
just how committed you are
to a life of service.

1517
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:42,158
Now, as you may know,
Sara Tancredi was arrested recently,

1518
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,627
and is currently being housed
at the Miami Dade State Penitentiary.

1519
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:49,220
We have concerns that Michael Scofield
may have other plans for her.

1520
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:54,166
So this...
This is why you invite me in here.

1521
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,663
<i>Well obviously, if Scofield were,
to be able to</i>

1522
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,002
pull off this plot
of another breakout,

1523
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:03,137
the public embarassment will be
immensed to the Bureau.

1524
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:06,329
So... having someone to get us
credible information,

1525
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:08,610
that would be worth
something to us.

1526
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,453
Agent Wheatley is set up in Miami.
He would be your contact.

1527
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:12,956
You're something else.

1528
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:23,196
Now...

1529
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,538
We both know...

1530
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:27,083
how badly you want
that badge back.

1531
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,132
<i>Give me a reason
to give it to you.</i>

1532
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,901
What's your plan
after we break her out?

1533
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:34,728
We're on the run
again?

1534
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,820
First things first.
Let's get her out of there.

1535
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:37,502
<i>Hey, papi.</i>

1536
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:40,789
The fed that arrested Sara,
is outside, staking us out.

1537
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,579
Look, if you're worried about
getting into trouble again,

1538
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,267
go back to Chicago,
go back to your family.

1539
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,888
I'll understand.

1540
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:50,234
Are you kidding me?

1541
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,173
After all the crap we've been through,
I'm just going to leave you here

1542
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:52,950
and Sara in there?

1543
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:55,206
You shut up
and don't bring it up again.

1544
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,223
- What's all that?
- Newspaper clippings--

1545
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,981
Covering seven
different escape attempts,

1546
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,572
from Miami Dade's
State Pen,

1547
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,306
over the last 60 years.
None of them--

1548
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,155
None of them
successful.

1549
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,290
So we weigh them all,
and we learn what not to do.

1550
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,754
Well, the prison officials
learned a lot.

1551
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,466
They re-evaluated,
they retrofitted...

1552
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,764
The prison's pratically
escape-proof.

1553
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,104
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine--

1554
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:21,200
I guess so if we can't go through,
what if we go down?

1555
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,916
Like down into the prison?
Like we parachute in.

1556
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:25,165
Yeah.

1557
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:26,561
Yeah.
You parachute in,

1558
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,760
- you find her, and we get he rout.
- Are you kidding?

1559
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,344
- I'm serious.
- That's suicide!

1560
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:30,440
Hey, hey...

1561
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,734
Newspapers clippings only
going to get us so far.

1562
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:34,699
We need some more information
about the prison.

1563
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,327
So let's do
some recon work.

1564
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,960
Camera, electronic
tape measure, dry ice.

1565
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:40,550
What's this?

1566
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:41,927
It's a shopping list.

1567
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:48,706
You need
to come with me, doc.

1568
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:51,231
I have a doctor's appointment
for my pregnancy in a few minutes.

1569
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,069
It'll wait.

1570
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:54,659
In here.

1571
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:57,892
Hold it.

1572
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:08,925
I don't know
what you want,

1573
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,637
but I promise you,
I will go down and fight it.

1574
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:13,183
Damn baby,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

1575
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,446
Hell, I ain't even gonna
touch you.

1576
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:24,075
See, I run the motor pool
detail in here.

1577
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:27,061
And I was thinkin' if you want
to get yourself a little fresh air,

1578
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:29,810
and not have to worry about
getting stuck in the back,

1579
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,494
then you could come in,
work with me...

1580
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:28,075
You're the fed
from my wedding.

1581
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:29,789
Yeah, you can call me
Agent Wheatley.

1582
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,257
I could call you
a lot of things.

1583
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,421
- Where you headed?
- Sea World.

1584
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:33,302
<i>Sea World?</i>

1585
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,454
There isn't one
in Miami.

1586
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:35,162
My loss.

1587
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,973
<i>No. What really be
your loss,</i>

1588
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:38,073
<i>is getting
your wife killed,</i>

1589
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,273
by doing something stupid.

1590
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:41,866
- Are you threatening Sara?
- No, no. Not at all--

1591
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,828
I'm just saying that if you were gonna
try and revoke her sentence.

1592
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:46,279
Bullets fly, Michael.

1593
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:48,380
And if she'd get hurt,
that'd be on you.

1594
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:49,730
Funny hearing that
from the guy

1595
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,307
who put her in prison
in the first place.

1596
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,843
No, I didn't put her in prison.
State of Florida did.

1597
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,549
It's just my job to make sure
that she stays there.

1598
00:21:57,203 --> 00:21:58,143
So, uh...

1599
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,203
Where's all
your little buddies?

1600
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,585
Alright.
Drop in some more dry ice.

1601
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:26,665
Fence line is four feet...
from the road.

1602
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:36,838
And 32 feet...
from the east camera.

1603
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:38,683
Hurry up.
They're gonna see the laser.

1604
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,601
I'm going as fast
as I can, papi.

1605
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,270
- He followed you?
- Yeah, but he's gone now.

1606
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:48,989
You guys almost done?

1607
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:51,199
Almost.

1608
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:52,104
<i>Great.</i>

1609
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:54,035
I'll meet you back
at the loft.

1610
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:15,259
Well, you just
a natural.

1611
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,164
I bet you was
a hell of a surgeon.

1612
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,989
<i>Handing out
condoms to cons</i>

1613
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:24,389
were makin'
no damn surgeon!

1614
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,552
What in the hell
is the matter with you?

1615
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,120
You ain't even ask me
if she can come...

1616
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:28,589
One day, for real!

1617
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:31,070
Can we go one day
without your mouth? One!

1618
00:23:35,387 --> 00:23:36,369
Let it be today.

1619
00:23:42,995 --> 00:23:43,842
I'm sorry.

1620
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:45,821
You got to forgive
my old lady, she's...

1621
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,645
You just a little bit
easy on eyes, you know?

1622
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,564
She's just
the jealous type.

1623
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,365
Crazy type
is more like it.

1624
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:57,763
What? You wanna
watch your tone, Agatha.

1625
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:58,663
Sorry.

1626
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,244
Or you want me
take off my belt?

1627
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:02,015
<i>Sorry.</i>

1628
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:06,846
Kid.

1629
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,807
It's rough.
It's hard running a family.

1630
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,724
It's important though that, uh--
That you have one--

1631
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,663
I have a family.
I have a husband.

1632
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,225
Oh, you've got a husband?
Is he here?

1633
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,559
They let him bring you in here,
with you, when you came?

1634
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:28,426
No.

1635
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,152
Yeah,
I had a husband too.

1636
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:36,146
18 years
is a long time to wait.

1637
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,062
So, you know.
If this ain't for you,

1638
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:43,961
that's cool.

1639
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:50,553
Then you pick up
that nasty oil,

1640
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:52,735
take it out and put it
in the repository.

1641
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,053
Okay.

1642
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:18,277
We gotta go, bro.

1643
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,448
- Get your hands off me.
- When I'm good and ready.

1644
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,290
What's Burrows doing
by the fence?

1645
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:41,610
Please don't make me
ask you again, Sara.

1646
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,731
Nobody here to help you,
but yourself.

1647
00:25:56,237 --> 00:25:57,505
Are you going
to answer me?

1648
00:25:58,361 --> 00:25:59,361
You tried to kill me.

1649
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,375
Line it up, cons.

1650
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:02,697
<i>Go back inside.</i>

1651
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:05,696
You, get back to your detail.
Now!

1652
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,684
I want you to pass along
an offer to your boy.

1653
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:29,128
What he's paying
his people

1654
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,425
to dust that Tancredi
chicken bitch pop...

1655
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,053
My woman are good
for a cut rate.

1656
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:38,385
Just what kind of discount
are you proposing here?

1657
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:39,950
Tell him, uh...

1658
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,789
He's offering a 100 grand,
my girl will take 30.

1659
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:45,731
<i>No, 40.</i>

1660
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:46,956
40.

1661
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:49,200
Perfect.

1662
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,102
I'll tell him.

1663
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:58,887
Hey, five star.

1664
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,952
So you have no cash,
whatsoever...

1665
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:08,151
I'm sorry.

1666
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,684
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of that broken record.

1667
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:17,601
Got it.

1668
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:21,569
I won't ask again.

1669
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,920
<i>Whose act is stupid
as you look, huh?</i>

1670
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:34,796
Oh, to what do
we owe the honor?

1671
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:36,878
I've been thinking...

1672
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,631
<i>Well, no need
to be uh, shy.</i>

1673
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:40,964
Just spit it out.

1674
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:43,666
I've changed my mind.

1675
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,036
No, well maybe,
Daddy changed her mind.

1676
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,226
Maybe she don't
want you here anymore.

1677
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,573
<i>Sport's right.</i>

1678
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:52,934
I recently have rolled up
my welcome mat.

1679
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:54,557
Peace.

1680
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,752
- Please.
- Please, what?

1681
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,293
Please, may I be
a part of your family?

1682
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:12,840
Take a walk.

1683
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:15,670
Take a walk!

1684
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:24,128
I would love that. I would--
Sit down. I really would.

1685
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:29,981
You see, its not that easy.
It's just saying "I do".

1686
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,384
See, in order
to making a commitment...

1687
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,987
to a family...

1688
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:47,401
It's something
you gotta prove.

1689
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:49,563
That's right,
we all did it.

1690
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,375
It's a commitment...
to the family code.

1691
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,786
It's a code
you gotta wear.

1692
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,002
Alex!

1693
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:29,316
- What's up?
- What--

1694
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,310
How you doing,
man?

1695
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,320
What's going on?

1696
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,588
We gotta talk.

1697
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:36,887
Alright.

1698
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:38,661
They're watching you.

1699
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,917
- We know. We gotta a fed on us.
- No. Not just one.

1700
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,543
The whole department.

1701
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:46,224
Sounds a lot like
inside information, Alex.

1702
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,557
What you do?
Make a deal with the feds?

1703
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:51,983
They offered me
my old job back,

1704
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,410
if I came down here
to spy on you.

1705
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:56,770
Now the fed you're talking about,
his name is Wheatley.

1706
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:57,801
He's running point.

1707
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:58,939
So now we know.

1708
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:00,602
So if you really
gonna do this,

1709
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:03,046
you gotta
do it right.

1710
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:05,374
And I'll help you
if you need me.

1711
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:09,807
What else do you get?

1712
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:12,895
Sara was working the motor pool
today at 4 o'clock.

1713
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,615
Motor pool is here.

1714
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,988
This hold by two security cameras,
along the perimeter of the prison.

1715
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,389
What about
secondary entrances?

1716
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:22,180
No loading dock,
no personnel entrance--

1717
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:23,006
Fences?

1718
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,845
15 feet high,
covered in rave wires.

1719
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,682
<i>- Electrified?
- No. Why?</i>

1720
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,788
If Sara can get herself back
to motor pool,

1721
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,326
I think we can find
a way inside.

1722
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:34,816
With all the different retrofits
over the years,

1723
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:36,122
the fence line
is widened.

1724
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:38,767
But security cameras remain exactly
where they've always been.

1725
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:40,759
They've never accounted
for the difference.

1726
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:43,921
- There's a blindspot.
- Yeah. Right here.

1727
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,473
If Sara can get back to that spot,
we can breach the fence.

1728
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,471
<i>It's risky, Michael.</i>

1729
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,412
That's all we've got.

1730
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,860
How much time to tell Sara
where we going to meet her?

1731
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:52,455
How?

1732
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,500
We get no visitations,
no phone calls.

1733
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:04,625
It's clean.
Take it to Tancredi.

1734
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,480
<i>Remember when I taught you
about flowers?</i>

1735
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:29,296
<i>I wish I was
with you now.</i>

1736
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,685
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

1737
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,291
<i>To see you holding one
in your hand.</i>

1738
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,658
<i>Tomorrow. PM.
Seven. Oil dump.</i>

1739
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,122
Sure looks like
you've been busy.

1740
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:20,776
Do you have a warrant,
Agent Wheatley?

1741
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:22,839
A warrant?
No, I don't need one.

1742
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,990
My testimony would be
that your brother let me in.

1743
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:27,985
Once inside,
saw all this evidence,

1744
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:29,458
<i>right in plain sight.</i>

1745
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,824
<i>What judge is gonna take
your word over mine?</i>

1746
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:32,636
What evidence?

1747
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:34,958
Those pictures were taken
from public property.

1748
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,796
That prison, was paid for
by the taxpayers.

1749
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:39,176
So all you have
evidence of,

1750
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:41,808
is an exonerated citizen,
standing on a public road,

1751
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,428
taking pictures
of a public building.

1752
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:45,997
Last I checked,
it's not a crime.

1753
00:32:46,483 --> 00:32:48,138
What if I said that
I could get you on attempt,

1754
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,309
just for having
all this stuff?

1755
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,512
What if I told you that all this
was peace offering?

1756
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,969
The warden won't let me
see my wife.

1757
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:57,895
So I figured, if I found
a few lapses in the security,

1758
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:00,085
pointed them out
as a gesture of good faith,

1759
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:01,763
she might change
her mind?

1760
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:02,834
Is that so?

1761
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,403
<i>Find anything yet?</i>

1762
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,806
No.
Looks airtight.

1763
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:09,876
Well thank goodness
for that.

1764
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,101
<i>You guys will let me know
if anything comes up, right?</i>

1765
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,633
You'll be
the first to know.

1766
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:34,019
On the outside, I was known
for getting the job done.

1767
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:35,201
No matter what.

1768
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:37,036
I got paid well
for it.

1769
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:40,497
Now I'm broke.
But I still need things.

1770
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:43,286
- Like what?
- A favor.

1771
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:45,124
I don't do
favors for cons.

1772
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:48,418
Really? It's not what it says
on the bathroom wall.

1773
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:52,949
As I understand, you'd do favors
for those who reciprocate.

1774
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:58,344
Is that true?

1775
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,385
This is bullshit, Boss!

1776
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:10,499
<i>I'm a veteran
around here.</i>

1777
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,562
<i>Ain't no reason
to toss me!</i>

1778
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:16,060
<i>You--</i>

1779
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:16,979
Hey!

1780
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:18,409
You low leaf!

1781
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,480
Looky, looky here.

1782
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,312
No!
That brown ain't mine, boss.

1783
00:34:25,347 --> 00:34:26,079
<i>You know this!</i>

1784
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,346
I don't do no drugs!

1785
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:29,096
Who put that
in here?!

1786
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:32,104
You... ugh!

1787
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,051
Get your hands off me.
I know where the hole is.

1788
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,751
What y'all looking at?

1789
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:37,603
I do no drugs!

1790
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:39,699
Somebody is going
down there!

1791
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,956
I love you too.

1792
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,124
Sofia's making arrangements
in Central America.

1793
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:47,259
Once we break Sara,
we're on the boat, we're gone.

1794
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,056
- Hey.
- It's Lou.

1795
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,481
Just got the decision
from the court.

1796
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,120
They're ordering the warden
to allow a supervised visitation.

1797
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,731
- Where are you going?
- They're letting me see Sara.

1798
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,156
<i>Pera, pera, pera, pera--</i>

1799
00:35:02,204 --> 00:35:03,727
If they're going to be listening
to every word you say,

1800
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:05,055
you gotta be careful
about this.

1801
00:35:05,095 --> 00:35:07,231
If she understood my letters,
she'll find a way to tell me.

1802
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:10,619
How? She's going to blink
the Morse code?

1803
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,239
<i>Attention, inmates...</i>

1804
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,282
<i>Visiting hours will be over
in five minutes.</i>

1805
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,520
Oh my God!

1806
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:39,512
Oh my God!
Who did this to you?

1807
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:41,885
I'm okay.
Baby's okay.

1808
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,748
Sara,
I'm so sorry.

1809
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,188
You're in here
because of me.

1810
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,885
I'm sorry.
This is hard.

1811
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:56,161
<i>- I miss you so much
- No touching!</i>

1812
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,657
<i>I miss you too.</i>

1813
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,842
You just have
to hang in there, okay?

1814
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:09,206
I'm trying.
But my protection's gone.

1815
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,725
- Did you get my letter?
- I did.

1816
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:18,497
I know sometimes it's hard for me
to express what I want to say.

1817
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:22,834
But I hope you understood...
what I meant to tell you.

1818
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:24,796
I did.

1819
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:29,129
Is he getting cute?

1820
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:33,850
You were there for me.
And I will be there for you.

1821
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,684
- Okay.
- Alright, that's it.

1822
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,084
Time's up.

1823
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,113
See you soon.

1824
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:50,628
Bye.

1825
00:37:10,168 --> 00:37:11,167
Michael.

1826
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:16,466
<i>I was thinking a lot.</i>

1827
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,411
About the photos and the mock-up
that you showed me at the loft.

1828
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:21,131
And I ran a few tests.

1829
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,637
Lo and behold,
I've found a blindspot.

1830
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:26,651
Right along the fence line over here,
due to our retrofit.

1831
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,893
You didn't know
about this, did you?

1832
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,656
No, no,
of course not.

1833
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:32,757
Because you would've
told me or

1834
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,316
<i>the warden about it
if you did, right?</i>

1835
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,913
Well, it's a good thing
I found this when I did,

1836
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,669
before anyone tried
to escape.

1837
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,799
Well if we can't go
through the fence,

1838
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,382
then that leaves
under or over.

1839
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:57,400
Look, how's she gonna climb
that fence without being seen, huh?

1840
00:37:57,712 --> 00:37:59,419
I'm guessing
there's no telephone wire

1841
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:00,557
for her
to climb across.

1842
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:03,449
- Then she's gotta go under.
- Alright, let's get some shovels--

1843
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,822
What was that you were saying
about parachutes?

1844
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:06,747
Parachutes--

1845
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,519
Guys, come on.

1846
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:10,787
You can't be--
Parachutes?

1847
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:11,835
<i>Couple of thoughts
on that.</i>

1848
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:12,856
<i>A:
We don't have a plane,</i>

1849
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:13,978
B:
We don't have a pilot.

1850
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:16,102
Have you ever worn
a parachute?

1851
00:38:16,137 --> 00:38:18,327
Don't worry.
I think I've got a plan.

1852
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,373
But we're gonna need some help
from an old friend.

1853
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:22,725
Who?

1854
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,845
- You want a favor from me.
- Just hear me out.

1855
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:28,529
Of course.
I mean...

1856
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:31,043
When you and Michael send me
back to that prison,

1857
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:33,303
you did give me
a piece of chewing gum.

1858
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:34,542
I mean what kind of man
would I be

1859
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,967
if I didn't
quit your pro-quote.

1860
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:36,975
Look,

1861
00:38:37,395 --> 00:38:39,663
all you gotta do is sound off
the fire alarm, in here,

1862
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,565
tomorrow night
at 7:30.

1863
00:38:43,025 --> 00:38:44,033
That's it.

1864
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,849
You're breaking her out.

1865
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,579
Krantz has put
a hit on her.

1866
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:49,738
That's our one shot,

1867
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:52,357
of keeping her alive.

1868
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,633
Well you're on a pivoted
kind of damn, Lincoln.

1869
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,642
We'll put five grand on your cake
once this whole thing jumps off.

1870
00:38:59,157 --> 00:39:02,580
The love of Michael's life
is only worth $5,000?

1871
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:03,842
That's the best
we can do.

1872
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:06,635
- I need six figures.
- That's all we got.

1873
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,639
Well,
like a day for you,

1874
00:39:08,686 --> 00:39:12,098
I know somebody who does...
the General's man.

1875
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:16,971
He's got to pay out
for Sara's hit.

1876
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:21,150
You wire that money
to me by 7 PM tomorrow,

1877
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:22,443
and we're in business.

1878
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,483
What's his name?

1879
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:25,800
It's your brother to you
that agony is.

1880
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:27,020
Come on, you gotta give me
more than that.

1881
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,373
Tomorrow. 7 PM.
Go on, fetch.

1882
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,535
You should have seen
the look on Michael's face.

1883
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,155
When he saw me fixing that fence
and installing that camera.

1884
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:49,935
You did a great job.

1885
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,113
Job's over now.

1886
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:58,147
If Michael has this misguided belief
that Sara's life is in danger,

1887
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,025
he's gonna find a way back
into that prison.

1888
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,982
Your job will be over until
you give us enough evidence

1889
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:05,753
to put him back
behind bars.

1890
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,230
So what's the latest?

1891
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,270
There's nothing concrete.

1892
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,241
But I'll let you know
when I get something.

1893
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:15,262
Alright.
Good man.

1894
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:37,679
<i>I warned you.</i>

1895
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:41,799
Tough going alone.

1896
00:40:42,466 --> 00:40:45,336
I know he's breaking you out.
I'm coming with you.

1897
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:52,413
Relax.

1898
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,178
Krantz sent me
to kill you,

1899
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:56,709
but after what he's put me through,
I'm done taking orders from him.

1900
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:58,023
You're sitting next to me
at the mess

1901
00:40:58,058 --> 00:40:58,626
when I was poisoned.

1902
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,364
You'd think you would've
lasted this long

1903
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:01,252
if I wanted you dead?

1904
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:03,539
I want you dead.
You're still alive.

1905
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:05,788
Do you think it's hard to stay alive
when you know who's coming after you?

1906
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:08,289
There's 200 women
in this prison.

1907
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:11,078
Could you even get
to Gen Pop?

1908
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:17,392
I'm coming with you.

1909
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,621
Or nobody's going.

1910
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,690
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.

1911
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,509
Because that means
you're safe.

1912
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:04,940
How does he think
he's gonna do this, bro?

1913
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,503
He's going
to jump out of a plane.

1914
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,352
I know he's gonna jump.
The question is, can he land?

1915
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:09,867
Not without getting caught.

1916
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,444
And how is he going
to get out of the cell block,

1917
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,334
even if T-Bag--

1918
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,632
It's a big "if".
Trusting T-Bag is... crazy.

1919
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,739
Michael, we, uh...
We really have to re-think this.

1920
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:22,217
I have.
And there's no other way.

1921
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,485
Okay.

1922
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,891
I'm going to drop down
into this outer area here.

1923
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,462
And I'll cut the parachute off
before anyone can reach me.

1924
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:30,872
They're going to be
right on your ass.

1925
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:33,152
I can hide behind this building,
wait for a window.

1926
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:34,688
Then I'll make my way
over here.

1927
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,131
That's the chapel.
Well hopefully, uh...

1928
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:38,753
Sara will be waiting.

1929
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:39,665
Why the chapel?

1930
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:40,914
During the riot in '88,

1931
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,901
prison employees escaped through
the administration building.

1932
00:42:43,356 --> 00:42:45,455
They wound up here,
outside the fence.

1933
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,639
The administration building,
is connected to the chapel.

1934
00:42:48,673 --> 00:42:50,655
Which means that
somewhere in that compound,

1935
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,273
there is
a subterranean exit.

1936
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:54,073
If we can get
through it,

1937
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:56,337
you can meet us there.

1938
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:57,919
How's Sara gonna get
to the chapel?

1939
00:42:58,718 --> 00:42:59,644
She'll have
to find a way.

1940
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:02,512
Look, we're doing this
at 7 PM tonight,

1941
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:03,347
just like we've planned.

1942
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:05,410
- Where have you been?
- What did I miss?

1943
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,826
I need you to find a plane
and a pilot.

1944
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,024
I need you two,
to take care of T-Bag.

1945
00:43:10,148 --> 00:43:13,281
Find out exactly who has this money,
and where they're keeping it.

1946
00:43:13,673 --> 00:43:16,204
- And then we have to get it.
- By 7 PM tonight.

1947
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,771
Or Sara's going
to die in there.

1948
00:43:22,177 --> 00:43:23,254
Is everybody onboard?

1949
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,115
Okay.

1950
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:31,673
Tell me, you've completed
your assignment.

1951
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,437
Well, I got the cash.

1952
00:43:34,472 --> 00:43:36,484
But there'll may be some delay
in final delivery.

1953
00:43:36,898 --> 00:43:39,807
The woman we hired is having trouble
getting near Sara Tancredi.

1954
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:42,290
Then hire somebody else.
Call it open season.

1955
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,426
<i>Put a bounty on her head.
I don't care how you do it.</i>

1956
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,107
<i>I want Sara Tancredi</i>

1957
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:47,515
dead by the end
of the day.

1958
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:52,286
<i>Open cell!
One hour!</i>

1959
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:04,105
Yo, we about to play cards.
Do you want in?

1960
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,340
I'm okay.
Thanks.

1961
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:08,875
You should.

1962
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:11,736
With Daddy gone,
you're gonna need your backup.

1963
00:44:14,515 --> 00:44:15,510
Hell, we all did.

1964
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,386
I've got, uh...
a pre-natal thing.

1965
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,123
It's cool.

1966
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:22,195
Thanks.

1967
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,551
Not too smart though, for a girl
with a bounty on her head.

1968
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:28,699
Aren't you heard?

1969
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:32,928
Tancredi,
you have a visitor.

1970
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:37,616
Say hello to your husband
for me.

1971
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:50,969
What's wrong?

1972
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:54,311
Look, um...

1973
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,232
I know you don't have
any control

1974
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:58,784
over what's happened here,
but uh...

1975
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:02,127
Things aren't working out.

1976
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:05,528
Okay.

1977
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:08,216
I'm trying
to find a way to...

1978
00:45:08,236 --> 00:45:10,836
To do... this.

1979
00:45:12,702 --> 00:45:14,211
But from where
we're standing right now,

1980
00:45:14,246 --> 00:45:15,190
there's only
one option.

1981
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:19,015
Do you need more time...
to think?

1982
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,120
<i>No. No, it's not
about that.</i>

1983
00:45:21,826 --> 00:45:22,923
<i>I've made up
my mind.</i>

1984
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,973
'Cause there's nothing
you could do about it.

1985
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:30,432
Except...
pray for us tonight.

1986
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:32,568
Pray for us?

1987
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,015
You can pray for us
to be together.

1988
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,586
Maybe
I'll do the same.

1989
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,961
How can I rob someone
if I've no clue who he is?

1990
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,047
The logbook outside says that
Krantz had one visitor yesterday.

1991
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,426
A Joe Daniels.

1992
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:53,293
Well if he was in
the power deduction, I'd say,

1993
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:54,758
Daniels
is your bagman.

1994
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,422
You know how many Daniels
live in Miami?

1995
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:57,743
Thousands.
I need more.

1996
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:59,303
Well you better
get crackin',

1997
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:01,465
'cause if I ain't get
that money by 7 o'clock,

1998
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,797
you ain't got your fire,
you ain't got your fire alarm.

1999
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:05,980
And that means Pretty
ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.

2000
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,905
Listen, my friend,
you're in no position

2001
00:46:07,941 --> 00:46:08,865
to makin' demands...

2002
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:09,868
Okay, shh--

2003
00:46:10,872 --> 00:46:13,219
I ain't talking about
backing out the deal.

2004
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:16,138
I put my ear on the ground
and come up with some details.

2005
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:17,270
Good.

2006
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:19,527
And now, fetch.

2007
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,183
We got a pilot.

2008
00:46:28,977 --> 00:46:30,543
There's a guy
I'd busted 20 years ago,

2009
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:31,876
running drugs
across the Gulf.

2010
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:34,078
<i>Went legit.
Runs a charter business now.</i>

2011
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,002
He must've jumped
out of a few planes, huh?

2012
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:36,971
Yes, several.

2013
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:38,404
Some for sport.

2014
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:39,577
<i>Some necessity.</i>

2015
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:40,852
It's a big difference,
Michael.

2016
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:44,683
It's not easy hitting the X,
especially at night.

2017
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:47,124
Don't worry.
I can go alone.

2018
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:50,461
- What do you got?
- It's a test.

2019
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:53,020
See, the prison was built
in the mid-80's,

2020
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,379
so that exit in
the administration building

2021
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:58,140
is probably protected
by an electronic code of lock,

2022
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,201
modified by
a security card.

2023
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:02,413
Those locks don't have
power protection,

2024
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,226
which means
you can override them.

2025
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:06,149
Then you can't just
go to the building,

2026
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,320
shut it,
or blow it out?

2027
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,198
No.

2028
00:47:08,365 --> 00:47:12,086
1200 volt power surge will just
set off the other alarms.

2029
00:47:12,923 --> 00:47:14,344
Not to mention
that it'll kill you.

2030
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,807
That's why we have
to find another way.

2031
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:20,964
Yeah.

2032
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:37,102
Yeah.

2033
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:39,015
Talk to me, Mahone.
What have you got?

2034
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,081
Nothing yet.

2035
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:41,898
<i>I don't need updates
on the hour.</i>

2036
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,074
I need evidence, intent.
It's not crap.

2037
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:46,469
<i>Call me when he's in the
process of committing a crime.</i>

2038
00:47:46,504 --> 00:47:46,791
Yeah.

2039
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:47,846
<i>I'm not going
to let him walk away</i>

2040
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:49,091
from me
like he did from you.

2041
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,224
<i>It's going down if I've got
to shoot him in the back.</i>

2042
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:14,809
Sorry.

2043
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,224
Time for you
to get paid now, bitch.

2044
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:11,899
Are we friends now?

2045
00:49:12,023 --> 00:49:14,415
Get out of the way!
What happened here?!

2046
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,224
I didn't see anything, sir.

2047
00:49:15,905 --> 00:49:16,845
<i>- Move!
- Me neither.</i>

2048
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:29,188
Bad news.

2049
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:33,070
Agatha Warren
is dead.

2050
00:49:40,202 --> 00:49:43,049
- Who did that?
- No one's talking.

2051
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,614
But I hear it says fish.
Tancredi and Morgan.

2052
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:49,553
No!

2053
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:52,879
No!

2054
00:49:54,483 --> 00:49:55,116
There he is.

2055
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:58,523
If you don't like this guy,
we can still find someone else.

2056
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:00,609
Good to see you, Sni.

2057
00:50:01,889 --> 00:50:03,476
What you get into here,
Mahone?

2058
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:06,279
Jumping at 1500 feet
ain't going to be easy.

2059
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:07,841
You've gone back
on your word already?

2060
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,733
Let's not forget who's doing
who a favor here.

2061
00:50:09,768 --> 00:50:10,346
Favor?

2062
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,634
Favor that I bust
your old lady for traficking.

2063
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:13,587
No, I did not.

2064
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:18,449
If anyone asks,
I was flying tourists to the Keys,

2065
00:50:18,522 --> 00:50:20,605
and it's not my fault
they jumped.

2066
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,683
Sounds good to me.

2067
00:50:29,452 --> 00:50:31,428
If you don't like this guy,
we'd take a day.

2068
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,858
- We come up with a new plan.
- No, there's no time, Alex.

2069
00:50:35,146 --> 00:50:38,269
- It's not just Sara's life at risk.
- I understand that.

2070
00:50:39,332 --> 00:50:40,144
I know you do.

2071
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:42,237
That's why I also know
I can ask for your help.

2072
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,586
- Yeah. What do you need?
- If I don't make it...

2073
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:49,098
I want you to make sure
Sara and my brother

2074
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,189
get out of
the country alive.

2075
00:50:50,523 --> 00:50:52,196
I need to know
they're gonna be okay.

2076
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:55,167
And I'm gonna trust
that you'll do everything

2077
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:56,433
you can
to make that happen.

2078
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:02,868
Take this.

2079
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:10,972
I trust you, Alex.

2080
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,338
Remember that.

2081
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,055
Special delivery.

2082
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:48,816
- What is it?
- I don't exactly know.

2083
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:51,259
It came via messenger from uh...
the lady side.

2084
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:55,941
"My man on the outside needs to know
who to call for the birthday present."

2085
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:57,319
Whose birthday is it?

2086
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,662
Well, just see to it that it gets back
to the same place.

2087
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:08,520
Will do.

2088
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,003
So this is
Joe Daniels' number, right?

2089
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:16,239
<i>That's it.</i>

2090
00:52:16,274 --> 00:52:17,424
<i>Is that
enough information,</i>

2091
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:19,135
or you need
a social security number too?

2092
00:52:19,171 --> 00:52:20,642
<i>- That'll do.
- Remember--</i>

2093
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:23,729
I want that money wired
to the account number specified.

2094
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,833
No wire, no fire.

2095
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:26,208
You boys
do me wrong,

2096
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,935
I have no qualms at all about
singing it loud and clear,

2097
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,527
you understand?

2098
00:52:28,614 --> 00:52:29,875
You know what?
Just be ready.

2099
00:52:34,758 --> 00:52:35,719
That was Sofia.

2100
00:52:36,004 --> 00:52:37,583
She'll meet you
in the San Andreas Harbor

2101
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:38,668
in Dominican Republic
and then

2102
00:52:38,712 --> 00:52:40,645
- you guys can fly to Costa Rica.
- Cool.

2103
00:52:41,246 --> 00:52:42,228
I know
where Daniels is.

2104
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,677
And after
we rob him,

2105
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:45,680
I'll take the money
to Quik Green and, uh...

2106
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,904
wire to the bank.

2107
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:49,234
You're gonna meet us
at the airstrip, right?

2108
00:52:49,269 --> 00:52:50,231
Might give
a shot now.

2109
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,342
Okay.
This is it.

2110
00:52:53,061 --> 00:52:54,092
<i>We're ready.</i>

2111
00:52:57,443 --> 00:52:58,474
Thanks, buddy.

2112
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:01,654
For everything.

2113
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:03,768
Good luck, papi.

2114
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:05,237
See you
on the other side.

2115
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:12,370
Nobody's talking, huh?
Girl's dead. No one's said any?

2116
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:23,089
I made it
in the woodshop.

2117
00:53:23,824 --> 00:53:25,040
Want to give
my daughter Emily

2118
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,619
a birthday gift
on her actual birthday.

2119
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,825
So I need
to get out of here.

2120
00:53:29,826 --> 00:53:30,440
<i>It's funny.</i>

2121
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:35,303
- You're never sentimental.
- Oh, I'm not. It's just for her.

2122
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,227
We need to get
to the chapel.

2123
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,056
We?

2124
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:49,457
There's no way out of here,
right now.

2125
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:50,234
I'm gonna need you.

2126
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:08,163
Yeah?

2127
00:54:08,163 --> 00:54:10,039
Mr. Daniels,
American Paint Company,

2128
00:54:10,076 --> 00:54:10,815
<i>here for the job.</i>

2129
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:14,574
Well, this is Mr. Daniels,
but I didn't order any painters.

2130
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,698
<i>It's Wednesday, sir.
I believe you did.</i>

2131
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:22,354
Hold it right there.
I'm calling the police.

2132
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:39,169
Get out!

2133
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:46,373
<i>This is it.</i>

2134
00:54:48,405 --> 00:54:50,441
I'll be right back.
Gotta get that parachute.

2135
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:07,431
Michael!

2136
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:10,764
Come here.

2137
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,404
There's
a better way.

2138
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:20,817
<i>Mess!</i>

2139
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,149
Mess,
half hour.

2140
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,333
<i>Little faster.
We don't have all day.</i>

2141
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,158
<i>Let's go!</i>

2142
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:38,695
Got any ideas?

2143
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:41,333
Yeah. Keep your head down
and follow me.

2144
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:42,186
I'll think
of something.

2145
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,475
You better think of something fast,
'cause we have company.

2146
00:56:05,247 --> 00:56:07,076
I hope you're ready
for a fight, princess.

2147
00:56:07,533 --> 00:56:08,490
This one's
to the death.

2148
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:15,063
Do you think
you can overpower her?

2149
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,883
Yeah. I don't think it's her
you have to worry about.

2150
00:56:25,611 --> 00:56:26,516
Just be ready.

2151
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:37,511
- Hello?
- It's me.

2152
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:40,284
I got the message
about the birthday present?

2153
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,359
Was the gift earned?

2154
00:56:42,714 --> 00:56:43,903
What in the hell
are you talking about?

2155
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:46,643
- The birthday present.
- Birthday present?

2156
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:48,203
Two guys showed up
at my house,

2157
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,103
they took the money
and they

2158
00:56:49,103 --> 00:56:50,169
<i>beat the crap
out of me.</i>

2159
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:02,361
Howdy, General.

2160
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:06,223
I just thought of let you know
how I came in with some green.

2161
00:57:08,432 --> 00:57:12,651
My personal preference is
two Zegna bars and a copy of the Times.

2162
00:57:13,953 --> 00:57:15,508
So I see you
in the AEM?

2163
00:57:16,463 --> 00:57:19,777
You worthless son of a whore.
Go to hell!

2164
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:21,627
Careful
I don't get there first.

2165
00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:25,246
Lest I become
king of that prison, too.

2166
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,469
<i>Alright, from takeoff,
the prison's gonna come up</i>

2167
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:36,196
real fast.

2168
00:57:36,426 --> 00:57:38,660
So whatever you gotta do
to get ready, do it now.

2169
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:39,598
You got it.

2170
00:57:41,788 --> 00:57:42,663
We've got the money.

2171
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:45,316
Sucre's just dropped me off
on the way to wire it.

2172
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,350
Good.
That means T-Bag's set.

2173
00:57:48,058 --> 00:57:49,728
I'm goin' to see how long
it's gonna take and we get going.

2174
00:57:53,313 --> 00:57:54,383
You sure that thing's
gonna hold you up?

2175
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:55,321
Yeah,
it'll be fine.

2176
00:57:56,481 --> 00:57:57,110
What about you?

2177
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,222
This is not my first time
inside a prison.

2178
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:03,381
But hopefully...
will be my last.

2179
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:15,203
Think about all the amazing stories
you're gonna be able to tell your kid.

2180
00:58:19,314 --> 00:58:21,592
You're gonna be the type of father
our dad never was.

2181
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,739
Someone
to look up to.

2182
00:58:26,376 --> 00:58:27,290
Take care, Michael.

2183
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:34,624
<i>Unless you've got details,
I'm hanging up.</i>

2184
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,756
And you can forget about
getting your badge back.

2185
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:39,052
He's got a plane.
He's got a parachute into the yard.

2186
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:40,469
- What?
- Yeah, I swear to God,

2187
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:41,271
he's gonna be over

2188
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,721
<i>prison airspace
at 7 o'clock.</i>

2189
00:58:49,449 --> 00:58:52,176
Call in reinforcements.
I want 20 armed COs in the yard.

2190
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:54,161
And be ready to turn off
all exterior lights.

2191
00:58:54,188 --> 00:58:56,235
Scofield won't see what's coming
until it's too late.

2192
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:58,726
And bring me
Sara Tancredi.

2193
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:06,655
Wait, wait.

2194
00:59:07,204 --> 00:59:08,670
What do you think happened
with Agatha,

2195
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:09,606
it's not what happened.

2196
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,320
I need to make this
right with you, okay?

2197
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:13,015
Go ahead.

2198
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:15,633
I was hoping
I'd see you here.

2199
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,581
You know I still owe you
one big juicy favor.

2200
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:21,325
Later, blue eyes.

2201
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,039
I swear to God
she wanted to kill me

2202
00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:24,610
and I was just
defending myself.

2203
00:59:25,525 --> 00:59:27,311
<i>- You remember that?
- Yes, I do.</i>

2204
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:28,766
My momma
gave me that.

2205
00:59:30,844 --> 00:59:32,977
Told me I was going to give it
to one of my kids one day.

2206
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:37,494
Not only did I get knocked up,
but the girl in the family...

2207
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:42,394
And I practically raised Agatha
and she was no killer.

2208
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:45,931
Now I can say
that much for myself.

2209
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,838
You didn't know
what I had in mind yet.

2210
00:59:51,151 --> 00:59:53,245
Okay, listen, you're right.
Agatha isn't a killer.

2211
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:56,778
She was just a-- real bitch
with a bit of more than she need to.

2212
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:01,530
Skittles.

2213
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:03,595
Okay.

2214
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:05,080
We cool.
We cool.

2215
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:08,000
We cool, we--
whoa, whoa, whoa.

2216
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,768
<i>Kaorla. She wants you
to bring Tancredi to her office.</i>

2217
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:15,149
A'ight? Okay.

2218
01:00:40,526 --> 01:00:41,598
Son of a bitch!

2219
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:44,865
They'll be coming
right through here, okay?

2220
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:49,543
Federal agent Todd Wheatley.
I need to get inside right now.

2221
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:50,983
Emergency team
takes priority, sir.

2222
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:52,690
I'm the leader of
the emergency team.

2223
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:53,497
Now let me inside.

2224
01:00:53,509 --> 01:00:55,757
- Sorry. Strict orders.
- Go talk to your supervisor.

2225
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:56,590
Come on!

2226
01:00:57,608 --> 01:00:59,684
<i>No weapons!
Let the suburban through.</i>

2227
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,676
The plane should be overhead
any minute.

2228
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:13,167
Hey, fellas!
Kill the lights.

2229
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:25,469
As soon as he hits the ground,
I just want one of you to start firing.

2230
01:01:30,706 --> 01:01:31,704
Standby.

2231
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:38,040
We're standing by.

2232
01:01:40,266 --> 01:01:41,754
Easy now.
Hold your fire.

2233
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:45,752
Standby!

2234
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,789
Now!

2235
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,238
Where the hell's
Scofield?

2236
01:02:28,029 --> 01:02:29,666
Emergency team
takes priority, sir.

2237
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,533
I'm the leader of the emergency team.
Now let me inside right now.

2238
01:02:32,575 --> 01:02:34,827
<i>I've strict orders.
No one gets inside at this point, sir.</i>

2239
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:36,704
<i>I don't care what your orders are.
Go talk to your supervisor.</i>

2240
01:02:58,476 --> 01:03:00,353
<i>Why isn't Tancredi
in front of me right now?</i>

2241
01:03:00,388 --> 01:03:02,598
We've just got
the situation under control.

2242
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:03,606
We're looking for her
right now.

2243
01:03:04,775 --> 01:03:05,775
Oh my God!

2244
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:08,906
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. It was Morgan.

2245
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,922
Check the kitchen.
They might be in the kitchen.

2246
01:03:47,442 --> 01:03:48,783
I'm not gonna make it
on my own.

2247
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:54,546
Either leave me with tools here
or make up your damn mind.

2248
01:04:13,135 --> 01:04:14,259
Are you gonna be able
to make it?

2249
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:16,265
Yeah.

2250
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:17,843
Okay.
It's now.

2251
01:04:28,409 --> 01:04:29,187
Alright, hold up.

2252
01:04:39,853 --> 01:04:40,954
Nah,
I think we're good.

2253
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:05,104
<i>Don't move!</i>

2254
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:16,044
- Stand on the dark, now!
- Please, I just...

2255
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,309
On the ground!

2256
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:26,875
You're here alone?

2257
01:05:28,585 --> 01:05:30,835
Damn it, con. When I ask you
a question, you answer.

2258
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,633
Is there
anyone else here?

2259
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,342
Yes.

2260
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:36,721
<i>Who?</i>

2261
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,225
- God.
- Excuse me?

2262
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,652
He's always here.

2263
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:48,397
I was worried about my little girl
on the outside.

2264
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:51,019
<i>So I came to pray.</i>

2265
01:05:52,138 --> 01:05:53,891
See if someone would
watch over her.

2266
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:00,410
Go check it out.

2267
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:24,142
<i>The stove mess is open.
Need support right now!</i>

2268
01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:25,770
<i>I've got to get
these animals locked down!</i>

2269
01:06:26,061 --> 01:06:27,061
We better head
over there.

2270
01:06:34,052 --> 01:06:34,986
<i>I hope that daughter
of yours</i>

2271
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:37,864
- is hell a lot smarter than you.
- So do I.

2272
01:06:53,432 --> 01:06:53,932
Hey.

2273
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,666
Are you ready
to go?

2274
01:07:04,832 --> 01:07:07,076
<i>Nobody gets in or out
of this prison.</i>

2275
01:07:07,118 --> 01:07:09,071
I don't care if it's the President
having to take a piss,

2276
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,425
you tell him
to turn the hell around.

2277
01:07:10,734 --> 01:07:11,731
Get a team.

2278
01:07:11,814 --> 01:07:14,807
I want every inch of that fence line
checked for points of compromise.

2279
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:15,929
Yes, sir.

2280
01:07:20,293 --> 01:07:22,075
Michael said this is where
they're gonna come out.

2281
01:07:24,948 --> 01:07:26,693
You think Sucre
made the drop on time?

2282
01:07:28,065 --> 01:07:29,062
I don't know.

2283
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:40,367
No, no, no.

2284
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,813
<i>Please enter
your account number.</i>

2285
01:07:49,884 --> 01:07:51,837
9248.

2286
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:58,068
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

2287
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:01,378
<i>If you would like
to access another account--</i>

2288
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:03,682
9248, pow!

2289
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,709
<i>Your account balance is
zero dollars and zero cents.</i>

2290
01:08:11,247 --> 01:08:12,833
What the hell you thinking
you're doing, fish?

2291
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:13,652
We're in lockdown.

2292
01:08:14,031 --> 01:08:14,759
What for?

2293
01:08:15,145 --> 01:08:16,833
Something's going on in bitch block.
I don't know.

2294
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,853
What's it worth to you
to find out?

2295
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:27,955
We're going to get
through here?

2296
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,237
On the other side is
a kind of an escape hatch

2297
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,196
for the administrators.

2298
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:32,526
In case of a riot.

2299
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,621
If this is the same system
they have in Fox River,

2300
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:37,891
that door can only be open remotely
from the Central Control.

2301
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:39,291
That's why we've gone
and ask for help.

2302
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,877
T-Bag.

2303
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:46,241
Tell them
what you told me.

2304
01:08:47,571 --> 01:08:50,018
Michael Scofield is about
to stage a prison break.

2305
01:08:51,936 --> 01:08:54,158
<i>And I know exactly
how he's gonna do it.</i>

2306
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,959
Exactly what did
Scofield asked you to do?

2307
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:01,083
Just light a fire
in my cell.

2308
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:02,003
And the rest...

2309
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,868
The rest will just
take care of itself.

2310
01:09:04,985 --> 01:09:05,877
A fire alarm.

2311
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:07,604
If that goes off,
what's your protocol?

2312
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:09,453
State law, mandatory evac.

2313
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:10,551
Hell,
he won't go break,

2314
01:09:10,592 --> 01:09:12,134
I was goin' to get you
to escort her out.

2315
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,672
- Shut up!
- Get him outta here.

2316
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:18,161
Alright, the evacuation's only
going to get him out in the yard.

2317
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:19,445
Whatever he's up to,

2318
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:21,651
he needs noise
and he needs chaos.

2319
01:09:22,524 --> 01:09:24,768
Deactivate the smoke detection system,
the fire alarm,

2320
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:26,057
and while you're at it,
kill the horn.

2321
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,257
If anybody so much as bends
a blade of grass in this place,

2322
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:30,837
I want him to be able
to hear it.

2323
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,939
- What are we waiting for?
- We made a deal.

2324
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:44,310
With the right price,
T-Bag will set off the fire alarms.

2325
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:56,771
That's what
we're waiting for.

2326
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:11,067
- Michael, there's a--
- It's okay.

2327
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,594
See, there's only one thing
you can count on

2328
01:10:13,629 --> 01:10:14,894
when you're dealing
with T-Bag.

2329
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:16,429
He's a rat.

2330
01:10:20,253 --> 01:10:20,751
Anything?

2331
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,746
So far, just a female inmate
loose in the yard.

2332
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:24,949
- Tancredi?
- No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen.

2333
01:10:25,282 --> 01:10:26,571
- Over by the chapel.
- Alright.

2334
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:36,752
Alright.

2335
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,282
Great.
Let's go.

2336
01:10:48,847 --> 01:10:50,437
Okay,
down there.

2337
01:11:06,386 --> 01:11:07,160
Okay.

2338
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:11,474
Beyond this door should be
a hundred yards of tunnel.

2339
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,243
On the other end
of that is Linc,

2340
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:14,032
and after that,

2341
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,233
there's a boat mounted
for white sands and blue water.

2342
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:22,718
A power surge to the system,
will override the reader,

2343
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,298
for just a few seconds.

2344
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,044
Just long enough for you
to open that, so get ready.

2345
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,764
3, 2, 1.

2346
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:37,515
One more time.

2347
01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:40,757
3, 2, 1.

2348
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:50,046
I was afraid
this might happen.

2349
01:11:50,565 --> 01:11:52,378
It's okay.
It's alright.

2350
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:52,925
We're going
to keep moving

2351
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,057
and we're gonna find
another way out of here.

2352
01:11:56,634 --> 01:11:57,797
I know
what I have to do.

2353
01:12:13,922 --> 01:12:15,652
I need units to the chapel.
Now!

2354
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,620
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

2355
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:29,948
They should've been here
by now.

2356
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:36,822
The battery wasn't generating
enough power.

2357
01:12:37,335 --> 01:12:39,054
We have to blow the system
for the whole building.

2358
01:12:43,809 --> 01:12:45,397
Okay.
What do you want to try?

2359
01:12:47,752 --> 01:12:48,830
This is
the main fuse.

2360
01:12:48,914 --> 01:12:49,744
If I yanked that,

2361
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:52,067
everything will go dark
for a second.

2362
01:12:53,105 --> 01:12:54,803
I reconnect
these two cables...

2363
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,584
If I reconnect
these two cables,

2364
01:12:59,081 --> 01:12:59,870
there'll be
a lot of noise,

2365
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:02,443
every light bulb in this place
is going to blow.

2366
01:13:02,484 --> 01:13:04,309
As soon as that happens,
you need to open that hatch.

2367
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:06,468
And I want you
to start running.

2368
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:09,188
Okay.
What about you?

2369
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,261
Michael?

2370
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:18,710
Sara...

2371
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:22,279
Someone has
to stay here,

2372
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,645
and someone has
to open the hatch.

2373
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:27,227
And that someone's
gotta be you.

2374
01:13:27,549 --> 01:13:29,727
Okay. So I'll leave it
open for you.

2375
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:31,451
You don't understand.

2376
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:33,743
This is the only way.

2377
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:41,950
I'm not leaving unless
you're coming with me.

2378
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:45,976
But I am coming
with you.

2379
01:13:53,445 --> 01:13:54,441
I love you.

2380
01:13:55,852 --> 01:13:57,096
God,
I love you too.

2381
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:03,268
Go!

2382
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:06,972
Go, Sara.
Go.

2383
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:10,674
Downstairs.

2384
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:30,470
Where's Michael?

2385
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:35,939
Sara, where is he?
Where's Michael?

2386
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:37,650
Where is he?

2387
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:53,087
He's not coming back.

2388
01:15:59,603 --> 01:16:00,599
He's not coming back.

2389
01:16:01,096 --> 01:16:02,625
What do you mean,
he's not coming back?

2390
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,458
What do you mean
by that?

2391
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,055
He's not coming back.

2392
01:16:15,456 --> 01:16:16,353
<i>He'll be here.</i>

2393
01:16:19,647 --> 01:16:20,643
He's gone,
Lincoln.

2394
01:16:28,735 --> 01:16:29,867
Linc,
we gotta go.

2395
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:33,964
We gotta go.

2396
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:53,967
<i>We gotta go.</i>

2397
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:28,235
<i>Hey,
I'll be over there in a minute.</i>

2398
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:35,093
Why am I being punished?!
I'm the guy through the window!

2399
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:37,412
You aided and abetted an escape,
Mr. Bagwell.

2400
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,208
And as far as
the authorities are concerned,

2401
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:40,155
you're an accomplice.

2402
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:43,144
Scofield!

2403
01:17:45,053 --> 01:17:46,418
Scofield!

2404
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:53,061
Scofield!

2405
01:18:15,554 --> 01:18:17,653
Michael asked me to give you this,
if he didn't make it out.

2406
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:21,033
He said it would help you understand
why he did what he did.

2407
01:18:25,762 --> 01:18:27,299
It's his bloodwork.

2408
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:55,140
This is
the General's money.

2409
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:57,801
I was supposed
to wire it down

2410
01:18:57,837 --> 01:18:59,810
to Costa Rica for you
to pick up but uh...

2411
01:19:01,412 --> 01:19:02,574
I ran into
some trouble.

2412
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,686
I'm sorry.

2413
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:10,118
You take care
of that baby, okay?

2414
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:12,492
You take care yours.

2415
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:40,844
This is for you.

2416
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,364
He never said
anything to me.

2417
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:47,393
Why didn't he
just tell me?

2418
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:50,834
'Cause he knew you'll try
to stop him.

2419
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:53,285
He knew you'd do anything
to protect your family.

2420
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:54,946
But I didn't.

2421
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,623
<i>Well...</i>

2422
01:20:03,869 --> 01:20:04,864
You will soon.

2423
01:20:08,624 --> 01:20:09,720
Take it easy.

2424
01:20:18,974 --> 01:20:19,624
Sara.

2425
01:20:22,294 --> 01:20:23,291
Thank you.

2426
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:26,900
Yeah.

2427
01:21:06,034 --> 01:21:07,779
<i>Well, if you're watching this,
I'm glad.</i>

2428
01:21:08,524 --> 01:21:09,727
<i>Because that means
you're safe.</i>

2429
01:21:13,545 --> 01:21:14,749
<i>And that's
all I ever wanted.</i>

2430
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,375
<i>I wish I could...
be there with you.</i>

2431
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,343
<i>But as you probably
know now,</i>

2432
01:21:24,003 --> 01:21:26,244
<i>I wouldn't have much
time anyway, so...</i>

2433
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:29,646
<i>I made my choice,
and--</i>

2434
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:32,344
<i>I don't regret it.</i>

2435
01:21:35,664 --> 01:21:38,192
<i>Anyway,
not too long from now,</i>

2436
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,105
<i>there's going to be another
little Scofield running around.</i>

2437
01:21:41,392 --> 01:21:42,139
<i>And Linc,</i>

2438
01:21:42,927 --> 01:21:44,296
<i>I want you
to promise me,</i>

2439
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:45,736
<i>no matter what,</i>

2440
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:48,612
<i>they're going to grow up knowing
their uncle is never far away.</i>

2441
01:21:51,303 --> 01:21:51,849
<i>And Sara,</i>

2442
01:21:52,938 --> 01:21:54,023
<i>I want you
to promise me</i>

2443
01:21:54,058 --> 01:21:55,211
<i>that you're gonna keep
an eye on Linc.</i>

2444
01:21:56,332 --> 01:21:57,394
<i>As you may
have noticed,</i>

2445
01:21:57,429 --> 01:21:58,669
<i>he has the tendency
to get in trouble.</i>

2446
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:07,162
<i>You know we spend
so much of our lives,</i>

2447
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,079
<i>not saying the things
we want to say.</i>

2448
01:22:11,023 --> 01:22:12,309
<i>The things
we should say.</i>

2449
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:16,376
<i>We speak in code,
we send little messages.</i>

2450
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,159
<i>Origami.</i>

2451
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:22,227
<i>So now,
plainly, simply,</i>

2452
01:22:24,177 --> 01:22:25,754
<i>I want to say that
I love you both.</i>

2453
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:30,277
<i>Very much.</i>

2454
01:22:32,808 --> 01:22:34,431
<i>And I want you
to promise me,</i>

2455
01:22:35,714 --> 01:22:37,332
<i>that you're gonna
tell my child,</i>

2456
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:43,308
<i>that you're gonna tell my child
how much they're loved every day.</i>

2457
01:22:44,512 --> 01:22:46,379
<i>and remind them
how lucky they are...</i>

2458
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:48,661
<i>To be free.</i>

2459
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,359
<i>Because we are.</i>

2460
01:22:53,227 --> 01:22:54,513
<i>We're free now.</i>

2461
01:22:56,007 --> 01:22:57,086
<i>Finally.</i>

2462
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,696
<i>We're free.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
