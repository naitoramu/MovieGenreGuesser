1
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,897
Félix Gallardo came to my ranch

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,776
sometime back with Don Neto.

3
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,572
That'd be Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo?

4
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,865
Yeah.

5
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,159
Always liked Neto.

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,869
Smart.

7
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,040
Not smart enough, I guess.

8
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,919
Félix was talking about weed.

9
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,880
Building something.

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,632
Full of the same old shit.

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,803
And then what happened?

12
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:58,183
Félix gets in with these motherfuckers
in Colombia, Mexico City.

13
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,478
That's a new kind of shit.

14
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,023
They're the ones fucking everything up.

15
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,527
And you can give me their names?

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,571
Oh, yeah.

17
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,162
Pablo, my newspaper will print it.

18
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,289
The Sun-Times has a
good history with that.

19
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,459
But you're making some
serious accusations here.

20
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,961
Dangerous accusations.

21
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,797
Why are you doing this?

22
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,091
These assholes...

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,591
Félix,

24
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,763
his Mexico City friends,

25
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,181
are desperate.

26
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,060
The whole thing is shaky.

27
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,772
One kick in the right spot...

28
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,862
As long as you're sure.

29
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,952
Next question.

30
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,250
What do you have on the Palma thing?

31
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,763
You were right. Clavel tipped him.

32
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,432
Turns out he was fucking the wife.

33
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,853
You see this fucking Acosta article?

34
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,731
We need to find him now.

35
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:55,610
Acosta's pissed off a lot
of people. We'll get him.

36
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,612
Yeah, but when?

37
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:01,783
You have any idea what
this could do to us?

38
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,244
We lose the election,
we lose protection.

39
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,081
Americans back at my throat.

40
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,708
These people looking for him,
they'll find him.

41
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,168
They'd better.

42
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,883
FAMOUS MEXICAN NARCO TELLS
EVERYTHING TO U.S. PRESS

43
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,316
Mimi?

44
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,902
Are you there?

45
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,806
Mimi?

46
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,141
Wake the fuck up.

47
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,800
Every time I use someone else's shitter,

48
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,220
they're out of fucking paper.

49
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,273
Look who's up. Special Agent Breslin.

50
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,443
You always start your day with
a little B and E, Breslin?

51
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,569
The window was open.

52
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,780
Thought I'd take a look around.

53
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,198
Who the fuck are you guys?

54
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,408
This thing real, Sacksy?

55
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,993
Shit feels like tin.

56
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,829
It's DEA.
One step up from park ranger.

57
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,209
FBI.

58
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,710
Out of Houston.

59
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,463
How's that "War on Drugs" coming, sport?

60
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,173
You boys about to declare victory?

61
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,300
Yeah. Any day now.

62
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,761
The fuck are you doing here?

63
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,070
I'm looking for the girl who lives here.

64
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,223
What about?

65
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,393
Known associate sort of thing.

66
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,937
Hoping she'll steer you to Pablo Acosta?

67
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,606
You guys are onto him?

68
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,526
What, are you working a US warrant?

69
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,111
Never mind what we're working.

70
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,573
What does FBI want with Acosta?

71
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,867
I mean, shouldn't you guys be...

72
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,412
bagging some rich asshole
for miscounting his money?

73
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,623
Well, let's just say...

74
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,253
we got a call from some decision-makers.

75
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,340
Asked us to set up a
joint-op with the MexFeds.

76
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,633
But we make the calls.

77
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,010
See, we've got the kind of
say-so you low-rent powder cops

78
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,262
only dream about down there.

79
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
Check this out.

80
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,226
You know they got dogs at the
airport that can do your job now?

81
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,187
That don't bother you?

82
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,649
No. They're smart dogs.

83
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,654
Well, it's been a real pleasure here,
boys, but I gotta get going.

84
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,950
Sit down.

85
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,704
Sit the fuck down.

86
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,963
Now, you don't play along,
we turn gears in DC,

87
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,467
and you end up chained to
a fucking desk in Tulsa.

88
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,641
Look, I ain't got shit.

89
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,728
I got tipped off that
Acosta was looking to turn.

90
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,814
I thought maybe his girl
would help me find him.

91
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,902
Now I got nothing.
My play's fucked, so...

92
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,613
You guys want him? Take him.

93
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,920
Plenty of other dirtbags out there
in the world for me to go after.

94
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,912
Special agent's starting
to catch on, Sacksy.

95
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,288
Making the right noises.

96
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,916
So am I free to go?

97
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,420
Acosta...

98
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,464
or his girl...

99
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,257
reach out to you...

100
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,929
You'll be my first call.

101
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,933
Attaboy.

102
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,810
Well, good luck with him.

103
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,105
He's a fucking wild one.

104
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,733
- Harder they come...
- The harder we come.

105
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,611
That's disgusting.

106
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
A huge turnout is expected

107
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,115
for today's presidential election,

108
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,327
as polling stations across the
country prepare to open...

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,790
Good morning, Félix.

110
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,791
Hello.

111
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,628
Leave us. Five minutes.

112
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,255
This is my office.

113
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,540
Our friends want to make
sure today goes smoothly,

114
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,111
so I'm going to observe.

115
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,989
I understand.

116
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm not sure you do.

117
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,951
They saw this interview, Pablo Acosta.

118
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,745
- One of your...
- It's being handled.

119
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,123
Traffickers giving interviews.

120
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,543
Another article like that, doesn't
matter what you pull off today.

121
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,508
There it is.

122
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,094
It's just what you asked for.

123
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,513
You can call it anti-SNIPE.

124
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:02,393
A duplicate version of SNIPE that
displays false election results.

125
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,271
Each version has its own password.

126
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,733
Enter one...

127
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,657
get fake results, where
we seem to be winning.

128
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,619
But enter the other one...

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,084
get the real results.

130
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,004
Chapo.

131
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,549
You need to get Lupita some money.

132
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,927
Tell her to take the kids and lay low.

133
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,268
And that I love her.

134
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,896
I'll take care of it, don't worry.

135
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,483
I want to put a bullet
in those sons of bitches

136
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,234
for what they did to you and Cochi.

137
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,820
Chapito, listen to me.

138
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,781
This shit with Félix...

139
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,742
it's all good for us.

140
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,495
We just have to wait it out.

141
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,706
When the time comes,

142
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,420
we'll have to get in line to
put a bullet in his head.

143
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,217
Polls are now open nationwide.

144
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,762
We'll be reporting throughout
the day on the numbers.

145
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,848
At 6 p.m. local time...

146
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,684
Think it's too early for a drink?

147
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,858
Hello?

148
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,318
You sound tired, Félix.

149
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,781
What can I do for you, Pacho?

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,825
Hold on a second.

151
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,452
Pacho?

152
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,669
The reason I'm calling
is your load is ready.

153
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,962
My what?

154
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,880
Hold on...

155
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,174
The coke?

156
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,344
You didn't plan on asking
for the 70 tons, did you?

157
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,433
Of course, I just didn't think
you'd get it together so fast.

158
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,727
But you said you needed the money,

159
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,021
so I got it done.

160
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,360
Consider it a personal favor.

161
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,488
It's not a problem, is it?

162
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,952
No, of course not. Don't worry.

163
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,162
Good.

164
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,207
I'd hate to see you step
in your own bullshit.

165
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,336
Félix...

166
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,132
you do know what happens
if you fuck this up?

167
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,514
- Hello?
- It's me.

168
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,309
How many times have
I told you not to call?

169
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,894
Wait! Don't hang up.

170
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,146
This affects you and the kids.

171
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,815
Go ahead, I'm listening.

172
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,486
I asked the Colombians for more product.

173
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,488
Seventy tons.

174
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,407
- Seventy?
- Yeah.

175
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,911
You can imagine what would
happen if I can't get it through.

176
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,280
And I need the government to do it,

177
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,880
which only happens if I win tonight.

178
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,253
Win the election, Miguel?

179
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,422
Yeah.

180
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,176
You understand?

181
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,387
'Cause if this falls apart,
they'll come after everything.

182
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,889
Everyone.

183
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,308
You understand?

184
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,186
You don't have to explain.

185
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,729
Good.

186
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,695
You can't keep doing this,
Miguel Ángel,

187
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,031
making promises you can't keep.

188
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,994
I'm working on it.

189
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,248
Good luck, Miguel.

190
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,273
Acosta could be holed up on either side.

191
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,209
We're guessing they're
trying to pin him down here,

192
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,712
let the MexFeds do the dirty work.

193
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,216
Well, they're definitely not
looking to put him in cuffs.

194
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,593
But maybe that'll give me a play.

195
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,595
You know, I could offer protection.

196
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,556
As long as we take down Acosta.

197
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,187
We were so goddamn close.

198
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,648
- What else you got?
- Just the girl.

199
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,733
Who knows where the fuck she is?

200
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,045
Thank you.

201
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,586
Your dessert, my sweet.

202
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,511
Look who's here.

203
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,307
My little desert flower.

204
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,271
You look terrible.

205
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,276
How'd you find me?

206
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,488
The article.

207
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,242
You said you were in a safe place.

208
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,703
I know you love it here.

209
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,374
Smart.

210
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,710
Or you said too much.

211
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,132
It's fine, don't worry.

212
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
It's insane, Pablo.

213
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,014
You lit their house on fire.

214
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,267
What'd you expect was gonna happen?

215
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,271
Talk to me.

216
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,526
What are you doing here?

217
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,613
Besides smoking that shit
till your brain's fried?

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,536
That why you left me?

219
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,503
Come.

220
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,464
Come.

221
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,639
Take a walk with me.

222
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,114
Amado!

223
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,285
Call for you.

224
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,830
From who?

225
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,457
It's the boss.

226
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,376
Yeah?

227
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,587
I just got a call from Pacho.

228
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,505
The load is ready now.

229
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,008
I agreed to pick it up Friday.

230
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,678
Friday? Boss, there's
no way we'll be ready.

231
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:39,641
Figure it out. Because if you don't,
we're both dead, you understand?

232
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,196
What is that, Pablo?
Buried treasure?

233
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,363
No.

234
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,282
Better.

235
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,833
Cold as the river.

236
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:15,969
This where you took all the girls
when you were a little shit?

237
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,725
How old do you think this beer is?

238
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,280
So you left me so you could
talk with this reporter?

239
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,033
No.

240
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,414
Not the only reason.

241
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,002
You've seen what they're capable of.

242
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,130
I didn't want anyone coming after you.

243
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,551
But I was always gonna find
you after it was done.

244
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,016
I promise.

245
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,566
Okay.
But no more bullshit, Pablo.

246
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,240
Next time, you tell me everything,

247
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,201
or I'll drown you with your
sack of old fucking beers.

248
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,747
That's my girl.

249
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,339
What happened to the deal with the DEA?

250
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,009
This interview will be better.

251
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,095
Everyone believes the American press.

252
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:47,019
But, Pablo, you didn't say
anything they can't deny.

253
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,271
'Cause it's the first article, baby.

254
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,356
There's a whole series.

255
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,233
They're gonna put them out one by one.

256
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,030
Each with more dirt than the last.

257
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,116
Gonna pick those sons of bitches apart

258
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,868
till there's nothing left.

259
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,955
See those bluffs?

260
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,377
Only one road through them,
and I got eyes on it all the time.

261
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,797
They gotta cross the Rio
Grande to get to me.

262
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,299
Boss.

263
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,470
These are my people, Mimi.

264
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,764
This is my fucking fortress.

265
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,141
I know Félix is going to come
after me at some point.

266
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,603
I can wait here, long as it takes,

267
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:35,025
watching those articles go off like
fucking bombs. Boom, boom, boom.

268
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,111
Blow his shit up.

269
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,577
Well, I guess it ain't
any crazier than usual.

270
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,504
Everything okay?

271
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,549
The first results are
starting to come in.

272
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,269
How do you run a clean
election in a country

273
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,273
that's been defined by corruption?

274
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,899
Transparency.

275
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,340
In 1988, the Mexican election

276
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,862
was gonna be unlike any
that had preceded it.

277
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,285
Election monitors were placed
at each polling station

278
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,371
and logged all the votes on a
single document called an acta

279
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,789
or tally sheet.

280
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,543
That way they could quickly call
in the numbers to the mainframe.

281
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,297
The computer tabulated them
and sent the results upstairs

282
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,464
to the observation room,

283
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,800
where the results
terminal displayed them

284
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,135
for the reporters and
opposition parties.

285
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,348
The most important among them for
the FDN, working for Cárdenas,

286
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,184
former congressman Francisco Ovando.

287
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,560
Now every political party and journalist

288
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,147
would have the results in real time.

289
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,859
Because the vote was closely
monitored, it felt aboveboard,

290
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,111
a new era of transparency.

291
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,904
See all this glistening new tech?

292
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,573
It has to be fair.

293
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,701
Or at least that's what they
wanted everyone to think.

294
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,425
How's he seem to you?

295
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,179
Little tweaked, but okay.

296
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,767
He's ready.

297
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,646
For what?

298
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,484
Whatever comes.

299
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,284
Sal, tell me you got something.

300
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,578
It's me, Walt.

301
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,580
Mimi.

302
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,500
You got that deal you promised Pablo?

303
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,742
I got it right here.

304
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,754
Do you know where he is?

305
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,509
Listen, Mimi, I'm not the
only one looking for him,

306
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,427
but I'm the only one
that can keep him alive.

307
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:12,974
Santa Elena.

308
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,477
You gotta come from the American side.

309
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,490
Show me.

310
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,670
PRI's getting killed in Mexico City.

311
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,300
Switch it over.

312
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,977
You're doing better than
I thought in Mexico City.

313
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,481
Still a ways to go, Francisco.

314
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,605
These poor assholes had no idea

315
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,193
they were looking at fake results.

316
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,480
And then, now this is important,

317
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,698
they were sending that
bullshit out into the world.

318
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,701
We're getting word now

319
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,452
on results from the new SNIPE system.

320
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,518
Because people are watching
these news reports

321
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,830
all over the country.

322
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,416
PRI is seeing a huge
surge in Mexico City.

323
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,083
And soon as they see
the PRI's winning again,

324
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,712
what do you think they'll do?

325
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,798
Say, fuck it. I don't need to vote.

326
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,343
It's a done deal.
PRI's gonna win yet again.

327
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,012
It's called voter suppression.

328
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,307
Something we have a little
experience with up north.

329
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,143
Make it easier for those
whose vote you can count on.

330
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,896
Make it harder for those you can't.

331
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,649
That's how you rig an election
without leaving a lick of evidence.

332
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,487
Internal party polling confirms

333
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,656
that voting outside Mexico City is down.

334
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,535
It's working.

335
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,955
At 8:00 p.m., we'll have
de la Madrid go on TV

336
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,626
to call the election in... favor.

337
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,669
Good.

338
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:11,635
Once he's in office,
I expect to be his first call.

339
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,142
What do you have for me?

340
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,937
I've got news from our
friends in Juárez.

341
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,481
What is it?

342
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,215
Even with swollen feet,
the man can still dance.

343
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,219
Remember the day we met?

344
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,428
Yes.

345
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,098
Party just like this.

346
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,309
Only white girl for miles.

347
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,270
Everyone looking at me strange.

348
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,106
Not how I was looking at you.

349
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,358
I saw you with different eyes.

350
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,548
Hurry up.
We don't have all fucking day.

351
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,133
One hundred pallets?

352
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,301
It's set.

353
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,637
Boss? Can you come have
a look at number four?

354
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,514
There's something with the electrical.

355
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,583
Can't I drink my fucking
coffee in peace?

356
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,364
Calm down.

357
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:03,955
Let me see them.

358
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,379
Scroll down.

359
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,241
What the hell was that?

360
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,951
That what?

361
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,163
There were different
results on the screen.

362
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,458
- What are you talking about, Francisco?
- Those look like passwords!

363
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,503
Please don't touch my workstation.

364
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,838
I was making adjustments to
the software, they're code.

365
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,510
Right, they're code. Then enter them.
Let's see what happens.

366
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,178
Go on. Do it!

367
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,678
- What's going on?
- Don't yell at me!

368
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,681
What's going on?

369
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,322
There were different results on the
screen. That's what's going on!

370
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,478
They're trying to screw us again!

371
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,233
- Stop! Stop right there!
- No, I'm looking for Mimi.

372
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,695
It's okay.
He's a friend of Pablo's. Hi.

373
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,988
Hey, we need to get
Pablo out of here now.

374
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,366
What is it? What...?

375
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,929
You got someone else looking for him?

376
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,161
FBI, joint-op with MexFeds.

377
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,663
They're not fucking around.

378
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,046
Shut it down!

379
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,718
Turn it off, goddamn it!

380
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,636
It can't just be shut down.

381
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,265
Show everyone what
you're doing. Let's go.

382
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,738
I don't know what you're talking about.

383
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,227
- Oh, you don't?
- We have to find the Minister.

384
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,687
Let me enter them.

385
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,106
This is government property.
You do not come near it!

386
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,733
Hold on a second.

387
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,240
Wait! What happened?

388
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,992
What just happened?

389
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,953
- What did you do?
- The screens shut off.

390
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,712
Fucking piece of shit!

391
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,925
We strip it down, find the
short, go cable by cable.

392
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,887
There's four kilometers of
cables on this plane, boss.

393
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,514
You want to take a break or something?

394
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,682
- No, boss.
- No?

395
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,225
- No.
- You want to tell Félix

396
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,771
his coke isn't coming because
we couldn't fix a goddamn wire?

397
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,941
- No, boss.
- All right, then. Get started.

398
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,193
Yes, boss.

399
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,785
Those sons of bitches have been
pulling this shit for too long!

400
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,578
You don't know what
you're talking about!

401
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,164
You're the one manipulating
the computers!

402
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,167
Gentlemen. Quiet, please.

403
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,711
Thank you.

404
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,160
I've been down to the mainframe.

405
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,740
It seems we've had a technical problem.

406
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,760
Our system crashed.

407
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,262
Mr. Secretary, what does that mean?

408
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,016
Moreño, please explain.

409
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,393
Explain.

410
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,353
Go on.

411
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:25,615
The code we are utilizing
is a complex system

412
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,867
with a lot of data.

413
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,331
And it overwhelmed the mainframe.

414
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,458
He's covering!

415
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,711
He doesn't want us to see what
he was doing with the passwords.

416
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,296
It's bullshit!

417
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,049
Francisco, I'm going to ask you

418
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,426
to please not use that
kind of language here.

419
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,055
It's a technical issue,
and it's out of our hands.

420
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,057
Now if you'll excuse me.

421
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,434
It's a lie. You know it's a lie!

422
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,895
Maybe it's like the Apple III.

423
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,065
Apple III, my ass!
It's not fucking true!

424
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,466
Shit.

425
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,219
It's the federal police.

426
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,307
Hello, you sons of bitches!

427
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,684
How long you been waiting to say that?

428
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,362
All right, only the ones
with guns, Wheels!

429
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,196
You are good to return fire.

430
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,544
Run!

431
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,879
Everybody grab one!

432
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,304
Hurry!

433
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,643
Hurry!

434
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,188
Let's go!

435
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,843
Convoy's en route.
Meet them at the square.

436
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,864
Copy that.

437
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,791
- Where's Acosta?
- I don't know!

438
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,711
Hell, yeah!
Keep that fat boy rolling!

439
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,858
It's right there, Walt!
Just a hundred yards more!

440
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,869
- Hold on!
- Come on!

441
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,194
Wait. Wait.

442
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,404
Pablo Acosta!

443
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,407
Acosta!

444
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,164
All right. Come on, let's go.

445
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,844
Gonna take a lot to get Acosta, fuckers!

446
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,852
Chopper Two.
We've got eyes on Acosta!

447
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,311
He's on the north end of town.

448
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,398
Meet at the rallying point.
We're gonna surround him.

449
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,018
We are receiving reports

450
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,152
of irregularities with the SNIPE system.

451
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,595
Questions have arisen regarding
the validity of the results.

452
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,260
It's all fucked.

453
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,451
This is just going to drive
them all back to the polls.

454
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,538
Can't we restart it?

455
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,749
So they can see what we were doing?

456
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,711
- There's something...
- The computer's done, Félix.

457
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,795
It's over!

458
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,508
So are you.

459
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,691
It's right up there.
That's Pablo's house.

460
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,524
- Look, we're not gonna make it.
- I'm going.

461
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,154
No, Mimi. You can't.

462
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,616
Come here. Come here.

463
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,700
Run!

464
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,180
Look, I gotta get you out of here.

465
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,750
No, I'm not leaving him here, Walt.

466
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,788
Mimi.

467
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,832
Just give me some time
to figure something out.

468
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,126
- Okay? Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm not going!

469
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,547
Go with them down to the church,
and I'll come find you. All right?

470
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,884
- I'm not going, Walt.
- Look at me. Look at me.

471
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,803
Trust me.

472
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,638
Okay?

473
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,190
Take your positions!
Establish the perimeter!

474
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,983
To the left!

475
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,318
Come on!

476
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,906
Hey, look who's here.

477
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,534
Just Say No.

478
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,494
A day late and a peso short.

479
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,662
Guys, listen.

480
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,458
Instead of doubling down
on civilian casualties,

481
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,898
how about I go in there and talk to him?

482
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,790
See if I can end this thing peacefully.

483
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,418
What movie you've been watching, sport?

484
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,302
See all that metal we
took from these beaners?

485
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,965
Señor Acosta's not
going anywhere peacefully.

486
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,260
Fuck off back to whatever
bullshit buy-bust you were on.

487
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,470
Leave him to the FBI.

488
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,223
Hey, are you sure you
haven't seen my hat?

489
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,892
I don't know where your
fucking hat is at, Sacks.

490
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,771
Here's your fucking hat.

491
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,948
Hold your positions!

492
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,431
Knew these clowns couldn't be in charge.

493
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,412
They sure like to pretend they are.

494
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,081
Typical gringos.

495
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,710
Not here, Walt.

496
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,799
What do you want?

497
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,468
A fucking heads-up would've been nice.

498
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,512
I should give you a heads-up
after you lied to me?

499
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,055
I couldn't tell you at the time.

500
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,892
Oh, yeah? And when exactly did
you plan on coming clean?

501
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,811
After you got Acosta out and Félix
came asking why I didn't stop it?

502
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,198
Because I would've been dead by then.

503
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,015
You lie to me, you get
me fucking killed.

504
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,567
I screwed up.
But shit's changed now.

505
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,943
All right, you got cover.

506
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,862
The FBI, the gringos.

507
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,532
Your boys in Mexico City, they
opened the door, they invited us in.

508
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,016
All you have to say is these two
dipshits opened their mouth,

509
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,745
and someone in FBI tipped DEA.

510
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,747
Okay, I showed up,
I fucked everything up,

511
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,541
I got him across the border,
he disappears up north.

512
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,043
No skin off your back.

513
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,129
You want to take down Félix?
This is it.

514
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,507
All right?

515
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,511
Give me five minutes in
there, and I swear to you

516
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,844
I can get him to take this deal.

517
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,059
I take Acosta off the table,
I get more pull with Félix.

518
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,142
We go back to what we were
doing with better intel.

519
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,230
- No. Bullshit!
- That's how Félix goes down.

520
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,190
You listen to me, Walt.

521
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:19,070
Pablo Acosta is gonna die.

522
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,072
Do you hear me?

523
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,035
That's what you wanted.

524
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,849
What the fuck is this?

525
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,186
It's a tracking device.

526
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,792
It's hard...

527
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,962
trying to impress these people.

528
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:25,678
I'm just a poor girl from Durango
in a thousand-dollar dress.

529
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,683
You're an ex-cop who
became a drug dealer.

530
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:35,479
Like we know shit about
computers or elections.

531
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,028
So busy pretending,
we forgot who we were.

532
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,491
Anyway, I was rooting for you.

533
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,929
We still have time.
We just need to change them.

534
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,973
There's not enough time
to change ballots, Félix.

535
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,517
No, not the ballots.
We need to change these...

536
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,437
the tally sheets.

537
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,022
There are thousands of precincts.

538
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,149
How the hell are you going
to get to them all?

539
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,195
Boss wants a word.

540
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,412
Miguel Ángel.

541
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,039
What's up, my friend?

542
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,083
Where have you been?

543
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,834
Can we talk?

544
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,713
Chapo, look...

545
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,467
I know what happened with
Palma was unfortunate.

546
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,677
But we need to move past it.

547
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,017
We're more than a Federation, Chapo.

548
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,730
Sometimes we fight, have our
differences, but in the end...

549
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,608
we're still family.

550
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,691
Family?

551
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,196
Is that why you had Cochiloco killed?

552
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,200
He gave me no choice, you know that.

553
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,411
Fuck that, that's bullshit!

554
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,911
Look...

555
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,915
I understand you're angry, but...

556
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,169
if our people don't win this
election, we all go down.

557
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,840
The Federation's over.

558
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,800
I need your help right now.

559
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,928
Well, if you want us
to still be family,

560
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,471
as you say,

561
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,474
let Héctor Palma come back.

562
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,147
No questions asked.

563
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,819
Okay, Chapo.

564
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,363
Okay.

565
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,783
You do this for me, I'll consider it.

566
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,494
What do you need?

567
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,081
Yes.

568
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,380
And what's in it for my family?

569
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,756
What's in it for...?

570
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,594
Look, Benjamín...

571
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,138
we can't continue this way.

572
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,158
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

573
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,769
I need plaza bosses...

574
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,023
who I can turn to for advice.

575
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,443
People I know I can trust and trust me.

576
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,317
That means, going forward,

577
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,398
I'll be giving you the kind of say

578
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,490
in our business you've always wanted.

579
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,702
We're gonna need a lot more cocaine.

580
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,371
And we're never sharing the
plaza again with anyone.

581
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,499
Deal.

582
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,168
What do you need me to do?

583
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,298
Pablo Acosta!

584
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,926
This is Commander Guillermo Calderoni

585
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,178
of the Federal Judicial Police.

586
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,389
You're surrounded on all sides.

587
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,850
Come out with your hands in the air!

588
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,436
Go fuck your mother, Calderoni!

589
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,980
You want me, come in and get me!

590
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,203
Stop! Cease fire!

591
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,706
Get the gasoline.

592
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,382
Walt Breslin! DEA! I'm going in!

593
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,592
No, no, no, no, no. No!
Hold your fire!

594
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,925
What the fuck is he doing?

595
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,345
It's a DEA agent.

596
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,597
Acosta, Walt Breslin!

597
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,260
Stand the fuck down, Breslin!

598
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,768
Pablo, it's Walt! I'm coming in!

599
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,075
That took some fucking balls.

600
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,370
Hey, it's okay.

601
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,331
They won't shoot with the gringo inside.

602
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,791
Get two glasses.

603
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,554
Whatever you got to say
must be important.

604
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,026
I went to the US attorney in Houston.

605
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,777
Full immunity.

606
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,740
Witness protection with the highest
reimbursement we've ever offered.

607
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,784
Guarantee for Mimi's protection.

608
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,706
Gonna throw in a couple cartons
of Mexican Marlboros every month.

609
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,046
You sign these papers,

610
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,007
I walk you out that door.

611
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,425
We cross the river.

612
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,092
We get in my car.

613
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,929
And you and Mimi start
a new life in the US.

614
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,849
And this night was one
big bad fucking dream.

615
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,900
They're going to shoot me the
second I walk out that door.

616
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,568
Not with me standing in front of you.

617
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,031
In Mexico, these assholes are in charge.

618
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:22,826
Once we get you across that river,
you're in my custody. You're safe.

619
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,621
You'd do that? Stand in front of me?

620
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,123
I walked in here, didn't I?

621
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,959
Mimi told me your plan.

622
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,258
She okay?

623
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,052
Yeah. She's safe.

624
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,012
At the church.

625
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,183
She's waiting for you.

626
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,640
I imagine still trying to figure out

627
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,980
how much of what you
told her is bullshit.

628
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,982
And so am I.

629
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,113
I spoke with the reporter Poppa.

630
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,156
There's no more articles coming.

631
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,283
You've said all you were gonna say.

632
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,578
I'm not a fucking snitch.

633
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,832
I figured that's why
I never heard from you.

634
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,474
It's also why I didn't just risk
my life trying to get you to sign

635
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,670
some fucking plea deal.

636
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,674
The reporter also told me

637
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,509
about that roof you built
on the school here.

638
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,219
The little girl whose eye
surgery you paid for.

639
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,263
All your good deeds, man.

640
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,557
You're not a bad guy.

641
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,102
What's it matter now?

642
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,484
Mimi's pregnant, Pablo.

643
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,911
I swore up and down I wouldn't tell you.

644
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,788
But you deserve to know.

645
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,003
The world's a fucked up place, man.

646
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,757
Code or no code.

647
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,675
But I'm telling you,
you going out there and dying,

648
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,039
that ain't gonna change anything.

649
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,807
And yes, I want you to talk.

650
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,186
But it's not about that anymore, man.

651
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,189
You sign those papers,

652
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,983
you can still be with
your girl and your kid.

653
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,280
Pablo.

654
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,699
Do it for your fucking kid, man.

655
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,292
Don't shoot! Coming out!

656
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,044
Keep your guns up!

657
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,033
That's far enough.

658
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,768
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Walt?

659
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,899
I told you, I'm getting
him across the river.

660
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,526
You are on Mexican soil.

661
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,444
You stand down.

662
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,404
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?

663
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,663
Add a zero right there, please.

664
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,709
Get out!

665
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,010
Add a zero to PRI.

666
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,314
Go on.

667
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,066
Shoot me.

668
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,987
Get to the river, Pablo, and we're good.

669
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,365
Let's go.

670
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,452
Cover him!

671
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,126
Maintain your positions!

672
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,755
So what?

673
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,014
Pablo, what are you doing?

674
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,228
Tell her I'm sorry.

675
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,063
What? No.

676
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,231
What? No.

677
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,150
Get down, Walt.

678
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,235
Pablo, no.

679
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,905
- Get down. Now!
- No.

680
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,462
You got one thing right, Breslin.

681
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,589
Guy was hard as they come.

682
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,217
Ran like a fucking bull.

683
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,114
What the hell did you
think would happen?

684
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,076
You'd get him out with
30 cops standing around?

685
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,203
I got pretty fucking close, didn't I?

686
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,790
Like it would matter.
They would never let him talk.

687
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,668
You know all that shit you said
about what Félix did to you?

688
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,881
You're more interested in protecting
those assholes in Mexico City.

689
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,177
You really think it's that simple, huh?

690
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,934
You, Camarena, and these FBI idiots,
you're all the fucking same.

691
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,352
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

692
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,367
You think you can come
down here and fix it

693
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,197
'cause you got balls and
some fancy paperwork,

694
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,234
but you have no clue
what you're up against.

695
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,946
Why you're always getting people killed.

696
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,823
That a threat?

697
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,783
It's a warning.

698
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,704
Just take a look at how your
little plan went down here, Walt.

699
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,208
You should quit while you're ahead.

700
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,502
Yeah, well, I got a couple days off.

701
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,464
Maybe I'll head back up to
Houston and do some fishing.

702
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,217
You're a smart man.

703
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,470
Maybe you'll catch more there
than you ever will here.

704
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,975
Goodbye, Walt.

705
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,147
Acosta's dead.

706
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,233
Happened about a half hour ago.

707
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,902
Thought you'd want to know.

708
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,338
They put Pablo's body on ice...

709
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,760
flew him in the chopper
back to the church...

710
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,639
where the townspeople
honored him one last time...

711
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,602
and then carried him to
a cemetery on the hill

712
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,771
where a thousand more
people were waiting.

713
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,399
At about the same time,

714
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,930
Mexico's most corrupt and
controversial election

715
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,112
was coming to an end.

716
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,990
What they did was so goddamn brazen.

717
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,740
Adding a fucking zero
to the tally sheets

718
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,368
gave them thousands of extra votes

719
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,661
with a stroke of a pen.

720
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,122
Immediately, there were
protests and hearings.

721
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,458
Years later, even former
President de la Madrid

722
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,668
would admit that there had been fraud.

723
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,240
But then it was impossible to prove

724
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,089
because they had burned all the ballots.

725
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,175
And the one man who could've
done something about it...

726
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,760
wound up dead.

727
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:41,056
So the fraud hadn't gone away...
just changed its stripes.

728
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,601
Less predictable, more evil.

729
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,522
Because history's got a way of
finding just the right assholes

730
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,190
to shake things up.

731
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,234
Well done, Félix.

732
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,557
Guys who can take a robbery
designed to go down

733
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,737
under the cover of darkness

734
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,116
and pull it off in broad
fucking daylight.

735
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,217
There weren't no more
articles, were there?

736
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,763
No.

737
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,088
How far along?

738
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,093
Ten weeks.

739
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,722
It's gonna be a boy.

740
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,531
PRI WINS

741
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,706
Looks like we don't
have to go into hiding.

742
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,085
Hiding? We won.

743
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,256
Join me.

744
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,883
I'll buy you a coffee.

745
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,184
Listen, no more delusions of grandeur.

746
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,563
I deal with what's in front of me.

747
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,106
And what's that?

748
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:00,195
Well, keeping my organization healthy.

749
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,281
My people happy.

750
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,535
You.

751
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,455
The kids.

752
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,293
I'll believe it when I see it.

753
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,134
Fair enough.

754
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,807
In the meantime,
I'll take that coffee.

755
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,063
Óscar, a coffee for the lady.

756
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,273
Right away, sir.

757
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,899
With milk.
