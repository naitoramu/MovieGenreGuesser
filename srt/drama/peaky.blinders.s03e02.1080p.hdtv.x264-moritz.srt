00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,050
- Thomas Michael Shelby
- Today is my wedding day

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,950
[Go on,] take the photograph!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,550
- 'The Russians have made contact.
- On your wedding night?'

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,950
Whoever it is up there,
he gave the wrong name.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,950
Can you do it? Can you kill?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,950
You know why he didn't come,
don't you? My bloody man.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,950
'There was a fire at his restaurant.'

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,950
No fraternising with the foreigners.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,950
He's a cavalry officer.
In March we'll be engaged.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,950
'But you want to try things first.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,350
'Ruben Oliver. Portrait artist.'

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,650
You have my card.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,950
What was in your heart was beautiful.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,950
Just get this business done and
get away from things like this.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,950
Promise me.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I promise I will make us safe.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,540
Your brothers came to my house.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They said the Peaky Blinders
had business with me.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,200
You're not afraid of me?

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,950
So, what is it you want
from a simple working man?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,270
Fear.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,470
Poor Mr Nutley drank too much.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,950
He went for a piss on the train tracks

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,950
that run behind the factory.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,540
Train came.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,950
They found his body in
Saltley broken into bits.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know what you do. Tell me what you want.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,950
There.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,950
The lot, complete warehouse.
Bays four, five and six.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,950
You have the keys?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,070
Yes, I have the keys.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,940
What's in bay four?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,950
Completed type 40s and type 21s
waiting for the paint shop.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,950
Bay five?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,950
Paint shop and parts.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,950
Uh-uh.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,950
So, it's bay six.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
What is?

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Give me the keys to bay six.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,950
It's just old stock in storage.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Give me the keys to bay six.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For your trouble.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,270
Give it to your charity...

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm only doing this for
the safety of my family.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,950
So, will it be just boys in
your charitable institution

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
or girls, as well?

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Both.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,950
You must divide them.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,950
You know how the little creatures can get.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,950
Where are your people? You
said they'd be here by five.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,950
They're a law unto themselves.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,950
You can never quite grasp who they are.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,140
Like gripping wet soap.

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,070
I've done my research.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,950
Perhaps you know them as
the, er... Economic League.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,950
Only once did I get a letter from
them headed the Vigilance Committee.

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,950
Which tips the hand a little.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,950
Nope.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,670
The name I've heard is Section D.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,950
That's what Special Branch calls them.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Businessmen, MPs, army officers.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, it will be fun to bring
such men to a Gypsy scrapyard.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,950
You asked for privacy.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Since the election, the Government
has decided that we are the enemy.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When all we're trying to do is
save the country from revolution.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,470
Are you political, Mr Shelby?

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,950
Because these odd fellows believe
that the time is coming soon

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,670
when everyone must choose a side.

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,950
Are your people coming,
or are they not coming?

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,950
Mr Shelby, you will learn that
these men are far too grand

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,470
for the clock to govern them.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,950
You'll get used to meeting in
the small hours of the morning.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,940
They're like monks.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,950
So, when is your charitable
institute opening?

85
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,940
When I fucking say.

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,950
Well, I'll stop by from time to time.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hear confession from the little creatures.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,950
You will meet Mr Patrick Jarvis, MP.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,950
He'll probably want to become a trustee.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,950
It's just his thing, to drop by in
the evenings after a few drinks.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,950
We'll make it a formal arrangement

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
as part of the... bigger deal between us.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,400
I will have an office there.

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My God. Some devil gets
into you, doesn't it, boy?

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,950
Mr Shelby, if I want to play the squire

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,950
in your place of false
charity then I will.

97
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,950
Ambition for respectability
doesn't make you a saint.

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Am I wrong?

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
Oh, Lord. That's six, is it?

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,950
Well, I will wish you a good day.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,950
The fuck are you going?

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,950
Did I not make it clear?

103
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,950
They said if they weren't
here by morning prayers

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,950
then the meeting has been cancelled.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Perhaps Mr Jarvis has been held
up at the House of Commons.

106
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,950
Perhaps Admiral Hall's been
held up at the House of Lords.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,950
Am I impressing you?

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,950
Or perhaps they've decided they
don't care for doing business

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,950
with Gypsies in scrap-metal yards.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,950
Which would be a poorer outcome for you.

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You give them a message from me, priest.

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,950
You tell them I've been to the factories

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and the armoured vehicles
are in good condition.

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,470
How many?

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,950
27.

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
And the foreman is ours.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,950
This is someone you will meet,

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,950
today, at the Ritz.

119
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,950
I have meetings today.

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,950
You have one meeting.

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This one. In London.

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,740
So you'd best catch the milk train.

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,950
Cold.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,950
My apologies, sir.

125
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,950
And how many times I
asked you to tell them

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,950
about sending us the servants' crockery?

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,950
I have no control over the
choice of service, sir.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,950
Hmm. And what about the yesterday
egg? And last year's fish?

129
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,950
And last century's tea
leaves in a cracked pot?

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,950
Sir, I have a list of
today's social engagements

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,950
- if you'd like to hear them.
- Oh, are we in a rush today?

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,950
I have duties at the main house, sir.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Luncheon at the Ritz with
Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,950
Cancelled.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,950
What reason?

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,270
He says he's unwell, sir.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,950
You're due to have tea at three
with Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,540
and Lady Mary Lewington, sir...

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,950
Mm. Good.

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,950
I miss out on the bore
and meet the beauty.

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,950
However, in the absence of the Duke,

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
the Prince and the Lady
too have cancelled,

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,870
Other than that your day is your own.

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,950
You do have one business appointment

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,950
to discuss automobiles.

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
With a Mr Thomas Shelby, sir.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You asked for a meeting out in the open.

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,870
Fresh air and the fine aroma of shit.

149
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,950
"Neutral ground," you said.

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,950
This is hardly neutral ground.

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,950
Well, it's what you've got.

152
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,950
So, por favivo, sit down.

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,950
- Where is Thomas?
- He got called away.

154
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,950
- He said he'd be here.
- Yeah, he's busy.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I just told you he got
called away. What do you want?

156
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,950
There has been a peace
between the Peaky Blinders

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,950
and the Changretta family
for two years now...

158
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,950
Do you want some tea or not?

159
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,950
Here, Finn, pour the Italians
some English tea. Go on.

160
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,270
We don't want fucking tea!

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,950
We want an explanation.

162
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,950
Well, I'll have fucking tea.

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,950
Explanation for what?

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,950
The Little Venice restaurant
in Forge Street was burnt down.

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,950
No, no, couldn't have been
us. We was at a wedding.

166
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,950
You burnt it down to stop my
son being at that same wedding.

167
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,140
Yeah, he wasn't missed.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,950
You are such big boys now.

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,950
Where once you borrowed clothes
from us to look like men.

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,600
How's the tea, Arthur? Is it...?

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,470
It's cold.

172
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,950
Please tell Tommy that we pay
him whatever he asks us to pay.

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,950
Please tell Tommy that we pay
him whatever he asks us to pay.

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,950
We stay out of the city
and off the tracks.

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,950
But you tell him from me

176
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,950
that my son will walk with
any woman in this city.

177
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,950
Any woman he chooses.

178
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,950
Even if that woman works for
the Emperor, Thomas Shelby.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
My son is in love...

180
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,950
Sorry.

181
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,950
Do excuse me.

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,470
Carry on.

183
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,950
And if he wishes,

184
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,950
he will walk with the woman he loves.

185
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,140
OK.

186
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,950
Y'know...

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,950
It'd be hard for your son to walk anywhere

188
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
with a bullet in each knee, wouldn't it?

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,470
Too much.

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,470
You said too much, my friend.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Sabini says, "Suck and
swallow." But no. Too much.

192
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I spit.

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, fucking... Bit strong.

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,950
Fucking hell.

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,950
Isiah. Put two extra men
on our pubs in Nechells.

196
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,950
What you talking about, Arthur?

197
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,950
We're not scared of
fucking eyeties any more.

198
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't tell Tommy about the chair
and clean this fucking shit up.

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,950
We're not scared of fucking wops!

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,950
All right, John.

201
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,340
Arthur!

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,540
Hello, Ada.

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,950
Tommy Shelby in a library.

204
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,950
I'm here to borrow a book
about the Russian Revolution.

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Shh!

206
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,950
Have you got a new wharf
at Maida Vale now?

207
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,950
I've got a new wharf everywhere now.

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,950
I sometimes see our trucks driving past.

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
"Our" trucks?

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,670
Shelby trucks.

211
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,950
Why the interest?

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,950
I just want to broaden my mind.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,950
Well, this is a list of
the bastards who ran away.

214
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,950
And this is written from the point
of view of the people's struggle.

215
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,340
Uh-huh.

216
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,950
There was a Russian at your wedding.

217
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He wouldn't tell me how
come he got invited.

218
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,950
Well, sometimes exiled Russian aristocrats

219
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,950
get invited to social occasions
to add a bit of class.

220
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,950
Is that why he was there?

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,950
Why do you want to know?

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,950
He was nice. Maybe I'd
like to see him again.

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,950
Would that be possible?

224
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,950
No. That would not be possible.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,400
What business do you have
with Russians, Tommy?

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,950
Can I rip this page out?

227
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,950
No, you cannot rip that page
out. Property of the people.

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,950
Tommy, when Arthur took the Russian
away he had his killing pistol

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,950
under his jacket. And then
Johnny lit a fire in the woods.

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You want all the details
because you're bored, Ada.

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,950
You used to chase rats
with a revolver, Ada.

232
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,950
Shh! For fuck's sake.

233
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I might just have a job for you after all.

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,950
Did we run Kempton yesterday, or not?

235
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,950
Danny Lee got drunk.

236
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,950
Instead of injecting the
horses with the cocaine,

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,950
he decided to share it with his cousins.

238
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,950
Jesus Christ.

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,950
He's your brother-in-law.

240
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,950
Tell Esme to speak to him about it.

241
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,140
Look. Before I start...

242
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
.. I don't want you to
do anything about this.

243
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,540
About what?

244
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,950
Vicente Changretta's son.

245
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,950
The one Lizzie was stepping out with.

246
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,950
What, Angel?

247
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,950
He's no bigger than two
pence worth of change.

248
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,950
He heard you threatened him
directly to shoot him in the knees.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,950
And now he's going around Nechells

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,950
telling everyone he's going to kill you.

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,950
This is Lizzie's fault to start with,

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,950
Tommy's for leaving it up to you.

253
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,950
What are you talking about?

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,950
We run London.

255
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,950
We run the North, run the
whole fucking country.

256
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,950
What do we care about some
fucking Nechells Green eyeties?

257
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,950
We don't need to be getting involved
in all these little piss pots.

258
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,950
What does Arthur say?

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,950
That's why I'm here...

260
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,950
and not him.

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,950
If he said it, there'd be a fight.

262
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,950
He says...

263
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,470
apologise.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,950
He fucking said what?

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,950
We own the city.

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,950
But we don't need to rub
everybody's noses in it.

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,950
If the old man decides to make a stand,

268
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
- he might get Sabini feeling
sentimental... - Sabini's done.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,950
They're all done.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And they all pay up.

271
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But we don't... want... rebellions.

272
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,950
What does, erm... What does Tommy say?

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,950
Tommy's busy. He left me in charge.

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
What... What do you say?

275
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,950
Compromise.

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,140
Mm.

277
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,950
I've asked Lizzie to do it for you.

278
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,950
She's going to meet him,
break up with him for good.

279
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,950
Apologise for any inconvenience.
Say it was all her fault.

280
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,950
Fuck's sake!

281
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,950
You know what all this is?

282
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,950
This is Arthur's fucking missus.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,950
Turn the other fucking cheek.

284
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,950
We'll be handing out Bibles
in the fucking Bull Ring

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,950
- with her cousins...
- John, you don't have to do anything.

286
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,950
- Ah, it's done.
- Lizzie will do it for you.

287
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,950
Then it'll all calm down
and nobody will lose face.

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,950
I'll take his fucking
face, how about that?

289
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,070
John, do nothing. Oh!

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,950
I believe you have a reservation

291
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
for a private room in
the name of Mr Romanov.

292
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,950
You work for Mr Romanov?

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,950
- Yes. - For his
household or his office?

294
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,950
Is there a problem?

295
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,950
I'm afraid without the presence
of the Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,950
or Lady Lewington we shall have
to ask for payment in advance.

297
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,950
Can I ask why?

298
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,950
Already Mr Romanov has four
outstanding bills with us.

299
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,950
One for accommodation
and three for dining.

300
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,950
And two banquets which we wrote off.

301
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,950
We've been asked to be understanding
of our Russian friends

302
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,950
by His Majesty, but it
has been some time now.

303
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,270
And...

304
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,950
- May I ask your name, sir?
- Shelby. Thomas Shelby.

305
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,950
And in the future I'll be
dining here quite a bit.

306
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,950
- Then I shall put you on our
special list. - You do that.

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,950
Here is a menu.

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,950
I recommend the teal and the pork.

309
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,950
Although your guest, I'm
sure, will order the caviar.

310
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,950
Myself, my wife and my
niece travelled by train,

311
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,950
then coach, then on foot through
the Villa Ai-Todor in Crimea.

312
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,950
On that journey I lost a toe.

313
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,950
I don't know. I woke up one
morning and it was gone.

314
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,950
All of a sudden I saw a
dog and it was eating it.

315
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,950
They said the British
had taken pity on us.

316
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,950
And we were taken aboard HMS Marlborough.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,950
I immediately kissed the steel
deck. My lips froze to it.

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And then of course, I thanked
God and your King for saving us.

319
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,950
Though since then he has done
nothing but humiliate me...

320
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,950
Who? God or the King?

321
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,270
Sometimes both, Mr Shelby.

322
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Mm. So, you met my niece already.

323
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,400
Tatiana.

324
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,670
Are you in love with her yet? Hm?

325
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,950
You would be wise not to
love Russian woman, you know.

326
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,950
Better not speak of Russian women.

327
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,950
That's the worst thing about being here.

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,950
Russian women, they know how to hold it

329
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,950
and most important they know
exactly when to let it go.

330
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Your cock, I mean.

331
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
English women, they do not
know so much, you know?

332
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,270
Did he die well, the spy?

333
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,140
He begged for his life.

334
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,740
I heard you had your brother do it.

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So, you trust your family. Like me.

336
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Like us, Mr Shelby.

337
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's talk about trust, then, shall we?

338
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,950
You are not a direct
relation to the Romanovs.

339
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,870
You are Georgian.

340
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,950
And the palace where you
live in Hampton Court

341
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,950
is in fact a grace-and-favour house

342
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,950
donated to you rent-free
by the British Crown.

343
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,950
The maitre d' here tells me
that you are in some debt.

344
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,950
Both here and other places, I imagine.

345
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
See, I've been given ten...
but I've been promised 40.

346
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,950
Already I've had to have a man killed.

347
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,870
That sort of work does not come cheap.

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,870
Do you understand?

349
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,870
Let me tell you something, Mr Shelby.

350
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,950
Before we boarded the ship,

351
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,950
my niece sewed 16 diamonds
into her velvet dress.

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,950
And also she had two sapphires
in her intimate places.

353
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
My wife managed two
sapphires and five diamonds.

354
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
This is already for the
killing of the spy.

355
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,800
And down payment on future services.

356
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,950
Now tell me, where do you keep
these things? In a... bank?

357
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,950
How could we plead poverty
around London society

358
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
if we used banks, Mr Shelby?

359
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,950
Well, you should know
Hatton Gardens is not safe.

360
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,870
That is why we have our own treasury.

361
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Very well. I shall have my
people check its veracity...

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,950
Before the revolution began,
we were soft and weak.

363
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We made compromise.

364
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But let me tell you.

365
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,950
We will never be soft and weak again.

366
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,870
Do you understand?

367
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Good day, Mr Shelby.

368
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
This way, Mr Changretta.

369
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,140
Just there, sir. There.

370
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,950
I hear you want to kill me.

371
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Get fucking up! Stay away from Lizzie.

372
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
By order of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

373
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,950
Going to introduce me, Michael?

374
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
This is Charlotte Murray.
Her father makes cars.

375
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I really enjoyed your wedding, Mr Shelby.

376
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,950
Polly said you should call
her. There's been some trouble.

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,670
What trouble?

378
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm guessing the stuff she
doesn't like to tell me about.

379
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,870
Nice to meet you.

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
All right, Finn, thanks
for coming. Fuck off.

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,940
Finn, you can stay.

382
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,270
Sit down, John. Sit down.

383
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,540
John, you cut Angel Changretta.

384
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,950
Even though Arthur told you to apologise.

385
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,950
Mm-hm.

386
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,950
- Polly told you to compromise.
- Mm-hm.

387
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You chose not to listen to Mr
Apologise or Mrs Compromise.

388
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,950
And now I've got an Italian
walking around my back yard

389
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
saying he's going to kill my brother.

390
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So, what do we do, John? Do we
apologise, or do we compromise?

391
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,300
Oh, it was just something
John said as a joke.

392
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,950
Yeah, but he's your
brother as well, Arthur.

393
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,950
Yeah.

394
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,950
And I didn't want to start
a war over something

395
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,470
John said without meaning it.

396
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So, should he apologise in
Italian... or in English?

397
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,950
Or should we ask them which
fucking language they'd prefer?

398
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,670
I'm not clear.

399
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,950
You said while this business was going
on in London you wanted peace at home.

400
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,950
And the only way to guarantee peace

401
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,950
is by making the prospect
of war seem hopeless.

402
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,950
If you apologise once, you do
it again and again and again.

403
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,950
Like taking bricks out of the
wall of your fucking house.

404
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,950
- Do you want to bring the
house down, Arthur? - Ah...

405
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,950
If you're soft on rebellion, it'll grow.

406
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,950
Bloody "soft on rebellion".

407
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,950
You did the right thing, John.

408
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,950
Now we go on the offensive.

409
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,950
We take two of the Changretta pubs.
We take 'em tonight. That's it.

410
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,950
Oh, right. For Christ's sake, why?

411
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,950
- Hey?! - Why? - Why?
Because we fucking can.

412
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,950
Because we fucking can,
and if we can, we do.

413
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And if we lift our heel off their
necks now, they'll just come at us.

414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Remember, these are the bastards
that wanted Danny Whizz-Bang dead.

415
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,950
You're getting soft, brother.

416
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,950
Soft and weak.

417
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,540
Save the Bible for Sundays, eh?

418
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,950
Finn, I need to get to Hockley, then home.

419
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,070
It's been a long day.

420
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,950
You take the Wrexham,
you take the Five Bells.

421
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,950
You get them signed over
to us in the morning.

422
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You make sure the coppers stay away.

423
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,950
Don't use the fucking phones, all right?

424
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,270
There's someone listening.

425
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,470
Well done.

426
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,950
Not hungry, Mrs Shelby?

427
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,950
Hungry? Oh, no. Sorry, Mary.

428
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,070
You'll ruin your eyes.

429
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,270
Tommy.

430
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,950
Hello.

431
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,270
Hello.

432
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,470
Sit down.

433
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,140
- Guess.
- Guess what?

434
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,950
- He said yes.
- Who?

435
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,950
The leader of Birmingham City Council

436
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,950
is going to attend the dinner.

437
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,950
- Everyone has said
yes. - Ah.. - Everyone.

438
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,950
I keep having to change the catering.

439
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,950
And my writing hand is almost falling off.

440
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,950
What are you writing for?
I bought you a typewriter.

441
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,950
You don't write letters of a
social occasion on a typewriter.

442
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh. Forgive me.

443
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,950
I have the drawings of
what they plan to do

444
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,950
with the grounds of the house.

445
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,950
- There'll be an area for the
children to play. Look. - Mm-hm.

446
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,950
And the Birmingham Charity
Commission have agreed to set aside

447
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,950
the three rotten floorboards upstairs

448
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and grant us a licence within the month.

449
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,950
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, I am. I am.

450
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Do you think I am becoming obsessed?

451
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,200
Yes.

452
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,950
Should I ask you how your
day was, like a good wife?

453
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,140
No.

454
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,950
I'm guessing that means your day
was not as successful as mine.

455
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Well, depends on how you measure success.

456
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
See, personally,

457
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,950
I measure it in sapphires.

458
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,950
Oh...

459
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
- Sapphires?
- Mmm.

460
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,800
Close your eyes.

461
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,870
(Close your eyes.)

462
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,470
All right, you can open them.

463
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,600
Where the hell did you get that?

464
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,740
It's beautiful.

465
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You can wear it to the foundation dinner.

466
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,950
Don't you think it is a bit
much for a charity dinner?

467
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Grace, this is fucking Birmingham.

468
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Good taste is for people
who can't afford sapphires.

469
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh, Mr Shelby!

470
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,540
Did you wind the clock, Arthur?

471
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We should go to bed.

472
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,950
I need to...

473
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,870
I need to go out.

474
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,340
Some business I need to do.

475
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,470
Business?

476
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,950
But you only just got in.

477
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,950
I won't be long.

478
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,950
It's ten o'clock.

479
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,140
It's pouring with rain.

480
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,800
I'll go. I'll go and I'll come back.

481
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Arthur.

482
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Working in the dark is
for the devil. We said.

483
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,950
Start to do your work in the light.

484
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You have your own light. Inside your head.

485
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It's just paperwork.

486
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I need you to clear your
men out of Nechells tonight.

487
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,950
- I thought you boys were a bit grand
this sort of thing these days. - Moss.

488
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Mind you, I think Tom enjoys the sport.

489
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,950
Something like that.

490
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,540
- Goodnight, Arthur.
- 'Night.

491
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,340
Arthur, what are you doing?

492
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,340
Arthur?

493
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,950
We're going to the Garrison.

494
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No. I'm going home, John.

495
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,270
Go fuck yourself, Arthur.

496
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,740
Yeah. Fuck off!

497
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Come here, Charlie. Charlie.

498
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,950
This big man and his brother are
going to make us a lot of money.

499
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,950
Or lose us a lot of money.

500
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Who cares when they're
such beautiful beasts, eh?

501
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,950
You've got a house, John.

502
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,540
Oh, fuck...

503
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,950
Full of kids.

504
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,950
Well, you've got a maid
to look after the kids.

505
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,870
Yeah, she listens.

506
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,950
Have you even done the odds for tomorrow?

507
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,950
Something urgent came up.

508
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,950
They get worse when they're pregnant, Tom.

509
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,950
John.

510
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,950
Esme, I need you to leave
now. Go out the back door.

511
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,070
And lock it after you.

512
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,950
When I left the office...

513
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,950
There's two truckfuls of
coppers out there, John.

514
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,950
Where the fuck is Arthur?

515
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,950
He goes home to the Madonna Of
Moseley on the stroke of five.

516
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,950
You need to talk to him, Tom.

517
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,950
Esme, please go now. Please.

518
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,950
This is very fucking unusual.

519
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,950
So, call Moss.

520
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,950
They're from out of town.

521
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,950
London, by the looks of their boots.

522
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,950
Since when are we scared of coppers, Tom?

523
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,070
Since things changed.

524
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,950
Scotland Yard!

525
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,670
Flying Squad.

526
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,950
- John, it's the Yard. It's the Yard.
- Put it down. Put it down.

527
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,950
Down on your knees.

528
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,950
Hands on your heads! Down on your knees!

529
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,950
Let her fucking go!
She's fucking pregnant.

530
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,950
- Leave her alone!
- What the fuck is happening, Tom?

531
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,950
Let's go!

532
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,950
Put me down!

533
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,950
Tell Polly it's Russian business, John.

534
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,950
All right.

535
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,600
Peaky fucking Blinders, my arse.

536
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,950
Is he afraid?

537
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,140
No.

538
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,200
Sit.

539
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,470
I'm talking to you, Mr Shelby.

540
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,950
So, the Oddfellows want you to know that

541
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,950
any deviation from your
instructions will have consequences.

542
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,140
What's your dog's name?

543
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,950
You visited your sister.

544
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,270
Eh? What's your name, boy?

545
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,950
Your sister is a potential
security breach.

546
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,950
She has connections
with Bolsheviks in London

547
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,950
who have connections
with the Soviet Embassy.

548
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,940
I think I'll just call your dog, "Boy".

549
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,470
You love your Boy, don't you?

550
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Understand this.

551
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,950
You have the local police in your pocket.

552
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,070
We have Scotland Yard.

553
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,950
They do what we tell them
just as surely as this dog.

554
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,070
Let him off the leash.

555
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,950
Are you hearing me, Mr Shelby?

556
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,870
I can charm dogs.

557
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,870
Gypsy witchcraft.

558
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And those I can't charm I
can kill with my own hands.

559
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,950
You learn it when you
have a dog on a boat.

560
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,950
They go fucking mad in tunnels.

561
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,600
I feel like I'm in a tunnel now.

562
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You know that feeling when
you have to kill or be killed.

563
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,950
Let the dog off the leash and
give the order you give in Gaelic.

564
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,950
Like I'm told you do when
someone displeases you,

565
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,950
when someone reports you.

566
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Visit your sister again and she
will die crossing the road.

567
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Maraigh.

568
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Come on, you say it.

569
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,400
If you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead, wouldn't I?

570
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,470
It's true.

571
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,950
It's true, we do need you alive.

572
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,950
But when you go home today, Mr Shelby,

573
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,950
be sure to check under
your little boy's pillow.

574
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,270
The tooth fairy has been.

575
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,070
We can reach anyone...

576
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,600
.. anywhere.

577
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,950
Is everything all right?

578
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,950
Yes.

579
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,950
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

580
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,950
Yeah.

581
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You promised, Tommy.

582
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,600
I trust you.

583
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,950
I trust you, Tommy.

584
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,200
Yes.

585
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,950
He's fine. He's fine.

586
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Grace... Grace.

587
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Come on. Yeah.

588
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,950
You're not one of those
impressionists, are you?

589
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,950
They are all terribly
political, aren't they?

590
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,950
- And you're not?
- Goodness, no.

591
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,950
The people I work for just
want me to paint what's there.

592
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,950
To me, politics is deliberately
making things better for some people

593
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,200
by deliberately making
them worse for others.

594
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,670
Well, I thought I might wear this.

595
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,950
Oh, God. It's too much. I'll
try something more simple.

596
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,470
No. Don't.

597
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,950
Suddenly I feel incompetent.

598
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,950
I want the portrait to hang in the office,

599
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,950
so I want it to look formal.

600
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's not formal. It's beautiful.

601
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,950
It's made in Paris.

602
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,950
It was stolen in Birmingham.

603
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,950
My mother stole it from a
house she was cleaning, 1901...

604
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,950
No, no. It's yours. It belongs on you.

605
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,950
A woman of substance and class.

606
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,950
Believe me, I've painted many women

607
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,200
who don't belong in
their expensive dresses.

608
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,950
There'll be no charge.

609
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,950
Your normal rate. I insist.

610
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Mm. There's a first.

611
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,950
So, when shall we start?

612
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,950
I've already started.

613
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,950
Come to my studio this evening.

614
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,950
I'm busy this evening.

615
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,950
Polly, invite him.

616
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,950
Invite me to what?

617
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,950
Ada, this is a professional transaction.

618
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,950
Invite me to what?

619
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,950
Shelby Foundation dinner.
Polly is going alone.

620
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,270
- You're invited.
- Ada!

621
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,740
I'll come to your studio on Sunday.

622
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,200
And then we shall begin.

623
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
A woman of substance... and class.

624
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,270
Tommy?

625
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,950
This is the leader of
Birmingham City Council.

626
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,950
- Hello, Tommy. - All right,
Danny? - How's business?

627
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,950
All right. Holding up,
holding up. How are you?

628
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,950
You know each other?

629
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,950
I have interests in
steelworks in Cradley Heath.

630
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,950
Tommy helps me get my
products to the carmakers.

631
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,950
Congratulations, Mrs
Shelby, on your wedding.

632
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,950
Thank you. I'm surprised
you weren't invited.

633
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,470
Now, how would that look, eh?

634
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,950
Ah, now the party has really started.

635
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,950
Who are they?

636
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,950
Father John Hughes from St
Mary's Boys Reformatory.

637
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,950
And with him is Patrick Jarvis MP.

638
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,950
They are part of an organisation
called the Economic League.

639
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,950
Did you invite them, Grace?

640
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,950
The names sound familiar.

641
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,950
They were recommended by the Lord Mayor.

642
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,950
Oh. On your "best people
of the city" list, eh?

643
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,950
- Do you know them?
- I'll introduce you, Tommy.

644
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
No, it's all right, Danny.
I'll introduce myself.

645
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,950
We appear to have taken you by surprise.

646
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,800
I have adjusted.

647
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,950
Since the socialists
got into Downing Street,

648
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,950
we are all being followed.

649
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,950
We have to meet in places
where we'd meet anyway.

650
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,950
You should have stopped by Small Heath.

651
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,950
I could have given you a
more traditional welcome.

652
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,950
- They want to know about ammunition.
- And chains for the wheels.

653
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,950
When the White Guard make
their run for Tbilisi,

654
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,950
it'll be over rough terrain.

655
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,950
The chains are suitable
for snow or wet ground.

656
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,950
They're already stored on the vehicles.

657
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,950
There's a batch of weapons
set aside at the BSA

658
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,950
which is bound for the Turkish Army.

659
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,950
And how will you get it all
aboard the London train?

660
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,950
There will be a strike
that night across the city.

661
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,950
You will have to stop
the train twice. How?

662
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Two drivers will join the
strike at different points.

663
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,950
Rather fun getting the communist unions

664
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,950
to help get weapons to the Whites.

665
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Yes, rather fun, eh?

666
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,950
I'm thinking ahead, thinking
of every possibility,

667
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
remembering everything that is happening.

668
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,950
The Russians want to inspect the vehicles.

669
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,950
I'll take photographs.

670
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,950
Mm-mm.

671
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,950
The Duke has sent his niece. She's here.

672
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,950
Tomorrow, you will take her
to the factory and show her.

673
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,950
- No.
- Mm.

674
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,950
The union convenors are
watching the factories.

675
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,670
Not possible.

676
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,950
Anything is possible, Mr Shelby.

677
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,950
You will take her.

678
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,950
You will pick her up
from this hotel at ten.

679
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,950
Now, look.

680
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,950
A priest with an empty glass.

681
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,400
Let's get back to the party.

682
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,950
You know, gentlemen, there is hell...

683
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,870
and there is another place below hell.

684
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I will remember everything...
and forget nothing.

685
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:36,950
Tommy...

686
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,670
This is Duchess Tatiana Petrovna.

687
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,950
Come on, Tommy, aren't you
impressed to meet a real duchess?

688
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,950
Well, I understand they charge a fee.

689
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,950
Mr Shelby, you are very direct.

690
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,950
Too direct.

691
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,950
But it's true. I attend these
things for the champagne.

692
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,950
And for the chance to be
treated like a duchess again.

693
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You should have kissed my hand, Mr Shelby.

694
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Forgive me.

695
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,950
She was asking about my sapphire.

696
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,950
I thought I'd recognised it.

697
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,950
She says it was Russian.

698
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,950
My husband has business in Russia.
Perhaps you know about it, Tatiana.

699
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,950
Well, tonight's not a
night for business, eh?

700
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,950
Is that why you were in the
concert hall for ten minutes?

701
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,950
I think people are ready
for dinner now, Grace.

702
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,950
No, no, I am not done
pumping people for money.

703
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,950
What is "pump for money"?
It's what I do every day.

704
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,950
You, er...? You know each other, do you?

705
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,950
You see, I am in charge of
compiling the list of guests,

706
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,950
but it's my husband who
seems to know all of them.

707
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,950
I hear he's very well connected.

708
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,950
And where does a duchess hear that?

709
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,950
In certain circles.

710
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,950
All right, enough, Ada.

711
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,950
Grace, there's a lady dowager
wants to speak to you

712
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,950
about coffee mornings.

713
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,950
She mentioned a £2,000 cash donation.

714
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,950
Tatiana, you and I will speak later.

715
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,870
I would like that.

716
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,950
Going to the factory
tomorrow is a mistake.

717
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,270
Nevertheless, we will go.

718
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,950
Also, my uncle ordered me to
seduce you, to give us an advantage.

719
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,950
But with a beautiful wife like
that, it will be difficult, no?

720
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,950
Tomorrow is a mistake.

721
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,950
Have you not heard? We have
no morals, we Russians.

722
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,950
And no fucking sense.

723
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,950
And no options.

724
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,950
I would fuck you for the cause.

725
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,950
What do you think of that?

726
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,950
I think you should not
drink vodka with champagne.

727
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,950
Does your wife know that
the sapphire she's wearing

728
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,340
has been cursed by a gypsy?

729
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:27,950
What did you say?

730
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Nothing on earth would make me wear it.

731
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,500
Grace... Grace, come here.
Look, I can explain...

732
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,950
Ladies and gentlemen,

733
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,950
- For once, you shouldn't have to explain...
- The loyality toast: to His Majesty the King.

734
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,950
The King.

735
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,950
Dinner is served.

736
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,950
You look beautiful. You look beautiful.

737
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,950
- You need to take this off.
- Why?

738
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,950
Because you think it
would look better on her?

739
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,950
Grace, look at me. Fuck
these people. Fuck 'em.

740
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,950
I need you to be all right.

741
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,870
I need you, Grace.

742
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,540
I need you.

743
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,140
Damn you, Tommy Shelby.

744
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,470
- Shall we go inside?
- Yeah.

745
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
For Angel!

746
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Get a fucking ambulance now!

747
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,950
