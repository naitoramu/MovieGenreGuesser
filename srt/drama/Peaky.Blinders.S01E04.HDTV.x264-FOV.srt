1
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:09,796
I'll tell you where to find
the guns. What shall I do?
Find out where the guns are hidden.

2
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:15,675
Raise a hand if you want to strike!

3
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:18,195
Freddie Thorne is at the very
top of my list.

4
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:20,915
Well, cross him off.
I'll make him part of our deal.

5
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,035
To hell with them.

6
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:25,475
The more they try to stop us,
the madder I'll be.

7
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:28,675
Times like these, a communist
in the family is bad for business.

8
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:29,796
You have to leave the city.

9
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:35,755
You are also at war with
the Lees, Mr Kimber, am I right?

10
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:38,556
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

11
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:01,596
God, he's getting big now.

12
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:05,956
Do you still love me even though
I am fat? No. Not at all?

13
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:10,196
You married me,
now you're stuck with me.

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,278
So, how was London?

15
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,198
It's crackling with revolution.

16
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:31,638
The Poplar docks are on strike.

17
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,959
Did our friends give us
what we asked for?

18
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,438
How much? £200.

19
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,238
Who did you meet?

20
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,638
An attache from the Russian embassy.

21
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,159
In a Chinese restaurant.

22
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,878
Our revolution is international.

23
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,119
And it grows by the day.

24

25
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,198
Jeremiah, Jeremiah...
What do you see?

26
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,798
Your sister
and Freddie got back this morning.

27
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,798
I tried following them...

28
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,438
but Freddie's so good
at getting away.

29
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,478
He's like a fish.

30
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,439
Right, well, keep fishing, eh?

31
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,399
Last bets now!
Don't spend your rent money, Charlie!

32
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,638
That's your starters, gentlemen.

33
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,479
No more bets.

34
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,678
I was here on time. Finished.

35
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,438
I've had a tip-off, I need this bet.

36
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,278
The race has started. Please.

37
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,118
No!

38
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,278
Fine.

39
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,758
Get rid of him.

40
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,479
We said, "no", now get out! All
right. All right, I'm off. I'm off.

41
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,399
Night, lads. See you tomorrow.

42
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,478
It's a good day.

43
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,558
Where's John?

44
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,478
John is in the Garrison.

45
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,159
He says he wants
a meeting about a family matter.

46
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,718
After he's said his piece

47
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:02,558
he'll come back and take his place
with Scudboat.

48
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:06,639
Scudboat? John will be here in ten
minutes. All right. Five.

49
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:36,799
Wait.

50
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,999
Good boy.

51
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,319
John?

52
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,719
Put that down! Put that down!

53
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,398
This is for Cheltenham.

54
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,318
We're just taking back what's ours.

55
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,439
There's money here.
Search everywhere.

56
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,998
All right, John.
There's only one right... No.

57
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,718
There's only one man
guarding the house.

58
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:39,959
What's troubling you?

59
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,198
Polly, you know what it's
been like since Martha died.

60
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,198
God takes the best first.

61
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,359
The truth is, my kids have been
running bloody rings around me.

62
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,199
Running barefoot with the dogs
until all hours.

63
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,758
Pol, give him ten bob, some shoes.
Is that it, John?

64
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,239
Tommy, we'd be better doing
this without you.

65
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,399
Now, what's your point?

66
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,679
What the kids need is a mother.

67
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,239
So, that's why I'm getting married.

68
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,958
Does this poor girl
know you're going to marry her

69
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,118
or are you going to spring it
on her all of a sudden?

70
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,518
I've already proposed
and she said "yes".

71
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,159
I think there's a shell
about to land and go bang.

72
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,399
It's, er... It's Lizzie Stark.

73
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,998
John, Lizzie Stark's a strong woman

74
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,278
and I am sure she provides a fine
service for her customers.

75
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,838
I WON'T hear the word.

76
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,358
Understand? Do not use that word.

77
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,679
What word is that, John?

78
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,398
You know what word that is.

79
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,278
Everybody bloody knows...

80
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,798
Everybody can go to hell...

81
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,398
"Whore"? That word? Or "prostitute"?

82
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,238
How about that one?

83
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,678
Right, I want it known...

84
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,358
if anyone calls her a "whore" again,

85
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,838
I will push the barrel
of my revolver

86
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,558
down their throats and blow the word
back down into their hearts.

87
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,918
Men and their cocks
never cease to amaze me.

88
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,278
John, Lizzie Stark never did
a day's work vertical.

89
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,278
She's changed. All right.
People change.

90
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,718
Like wi-wi-with religion.

91
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:30,478
Oh, Lizzie Stark
has got religion, eh?

92
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,798
No, no, she doesn't
have religion. But...

93
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,998
Well, she loves me.

94
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,839
Now, listen, Tommy.
I won't do it without your blessing.

95
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,599
But of all the people in the
world...

96
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,159
..I want you to see it...

97
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,878
..as brave.

98
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,318
It's brave all right.

99
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,438
"Brave" is going
where no man has gone before.

100
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,718
With Lizzy Stark, John, that is
REALLY not what you'll be doing.

101
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,719
Listen, Tommy.
Welcome her to the family.

102
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,959
As someone who's had a hard life.

103
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,519
All right? Because, I need someone.

104
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,558
All right, the kids need someone.

105
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,958
Tommy! We've been done over!

106
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,159
What?

107
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,358
Jesus Christ.

108
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,678
What the bloody hell happened here?

109
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,519
The Lees. All of them.

110
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,679
Cousins, nephews,
even the bastards.

111
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,639
They've taken anything they can
lay their hands on.

112
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,759
Four cash boxes.

113
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,358
They left these....

114
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:45,358
Wire cutters.
Why would they leave wire cutters?

115
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:46,439
Nobody move.

116
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,238
I think our friends
are playing the game.

117
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,839
What game?
Aunt Pol. Don't touch anything.

118
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,879
Erasmus Lee was in France.

119
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,119
Shit.

120
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,839
When we gave up
ground to the Germans...

121
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,679
..we'd leave behind booby traps,
set up with wires.

122
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,959
And we'd leave wire cutters
as part of the joke.

123
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,279
Somewhere in here there's
a hand grenade... Holy Jesus.

124
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,399
..attached to a wire.

125
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,799
Don't move any chairs
or open any doors.

126
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,399
Go easy, John boy. Easy.

127
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,239
Boys, no. It's not in here.

128
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,158
If it was in here,
it would have blown by now.

129
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,439
It was my name on that bullet
Erasmus sent.

130
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,239
He's set a trap all right.

131
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,639
But he's set it up just for me.

132
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,079
Finn?

133
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,439
Finn, stay exactly where you are.

134
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,799
I was pretending I was you.

135
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,918
Which door did you open to
come in, Finn?

136
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,439
I didn't. I climbed in.

137
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,519
I want you to climb out exactly
the same way you climbed in, OK?

138
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:35,599
No, no... Finn!

139
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,679
Clear!

140
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,279
What happened? Are you all right?
It could have killed us.

141
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:05,238
That's why you should never pretend
to be me.

142
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,039
OK? OK?

143
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,039
I got you ten minutes with her.

144
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,078
You can at least say thank you.

145
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,119
It's easier to get to see
the Pope these days.

146
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:26,078
Put your hand on the Bible.

147
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,199
I don't believe.

148
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,439
Anyway, I didn't come here to lie.

149
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,759
This war is cutting us all up.

150
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,078
You're all children.

151
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,918
I say enough.

152
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,399
Your boys tried to kill me -
it didn't work.

153
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,798
No wonder you won't touch a Bible.

154
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,478
I have ambitions.
You want to play a switch.

155
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,038
I need your boys.

156
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,318
For what?

157
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,478
Kimber's not the brains.

158
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,838
There's a gadze who runs the races.

159
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,879
I'm collecting smart people.
But I need strong men too.

160
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,758
Now your boys should know this,

161
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,318
we now get the winner in one
of every three races

162
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:28,358
before the race even starts.

163
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,438
No need for chalkers or rafflers.

164
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:31,718
I'm talking certainties.

165
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,278
You come in here boasting
you're going to do someone down

166
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,399
and in the same breath you ask me
to trust you.

167
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:41,999
On my mother's side, we are kin.

168
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,759
Ada, can you do my back?

169
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,319
Ada?

170
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,518
I know what was in the envelope.

171
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,118
I looked. Money.

172
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:14,118
And that bloke we met in London who
you said was a Frenchman.

173
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,518
He was Russian.
I'm not an idiot, Freddie.

174
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,078
How is it you take all the risks

175
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,798
and Stanly Chapman gets the money?

176
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,919
It's money for the cause.

177
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,878
You're blind.

178
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,238
I would be if your brothers had
anything to do with it.

179
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,958
This isn't about them.
This is about you.

180
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,759
And me. And... this.

181
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,959
You're a dreamer, Freddie.

182
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:45,398
You give money away
while we rot in here...

183
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,839
and you talk about revolution.

184
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,919
I need to know.

185
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,479
Who are you loyal to, Freddie?

186
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,719
I said, "Who are you loyal to?"

187
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,599
Did you have something to
do with this?

188
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,718
I asked an acquaintance
for an address.

189
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,518
She said she would only give it to
me anonymously.

190
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,959
She was afraid of the
consequences.

191
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,159
Whose address is it? Tommy, I'd like
to suggest a strategy.

192
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,439
Your message said you have
an address for me.

193
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,799
Anonymous tip off.

194
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,439
The address of Stanly Chapman.

195
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:35,758
You promised me Freddie Thorne.

196
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,278
This is instead of Freddie Thorne.
No deal.

197
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,279
Inspector, Stanly Chapman is
a bigger fish than Freddie Thorne.

198
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,799
He is currently holding
£200 in cash.

199
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,159
Given to the Communist party
by the Russian Government.

200
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,638
That's right,

201
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,918
Chapman has snow on his boots

202
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,439
and all you'll need is a shovel.

203
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,919
If he talks, you'll have proof.

204
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,959
You might even get that medal.

205
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,239
Now...

206
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,479
..before I give you the address...

207
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,119
..I want your word...

208
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:21,919
..that you will let Freddie Thorne
and my sister leave the city.

209
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,719
Very well. You have my word.

210
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,998
I'd say our little truce
is proving productive

211
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,359
for both of us, Inspector.

212
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,198
I get the information...

213
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,279
and protection and you...

214
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,399
Well...

215
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,199
..you get Bolsheviks.

216
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,679
But on a more pressing matter...

217
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,399
I'm afraid that Mr Churchill
is becoming impatient.

218
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,199
And I fear that...

219
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,839
..if you don't give back those stolen
weapons soon...

220
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,478
..I will be replaced.

221
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,038
That would be the finish of me,
that's for sure.

222
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,638
When my business with Kimber is done

223
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,918
the guns will be returned.
That was the deal.

224
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,839
Then I am in your hands. Completely.

225
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,679
You hold all the cards.

226
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,198
But I hope to God that my dismissal

227
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:37,358
doesn't come before your decision
to hand back those guns.

228
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,199
I say this for your sake,
because...

229
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,319
..if I were to be fired
and it were your fault...

230
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,919
..I would do things that would
shame the devil.

231
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,999
My fury is a thing to behold.

232
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,558
On my last day in power, for example,

233
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,478
I would see to it that you
and your scum brothers

234
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,799
have your heads stoved in
with mallets and spades.

235
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,439
And your sister too.

236
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,999
That baby inside her
would be of no consequence to me.

237
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,839
The only one to be spared...

238
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,079
..would be your little brother Finn.

239
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:26,718
He would however
be lifted as a juvenile

240
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:29,119
and dumped into that part of the
adult prison...

241
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:34,159
..where men have most appetite for
boys like him.

242
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,079
That would be a dark day indeed,
Mr Shelby.

243
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,359
If my dismissal comes
before YOUR decision.

244
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,159
Do you understand?

245
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,519
And know this...

246
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,519
..the clock is ticking.

247
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:46,879
Stanly, it's the police.
Stanly, get here!

248
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,759
You're under arrest, mate!
You bastards!

249
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,119
Look what we found.

250
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,559
It seems Stanly Chapman really
does have snow on his boots.

251
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,759
Mr Chapman...

252
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,559
..you're fucked.

253
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,159
He still refuses to say where
it came from.

254
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:46,559
I'm sure, with a little persuasion,
he'll tell us everything he knows.

255
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,519
Including the whereabouts
of Freddie Thorne.

256
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,119
Sir?
Your face is a picture.

257
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,358
I thought you had done a deal.

258
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,158
Oh, is that is what you thought.

259
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,559
Well, you gave your word.

260
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,039
My word?

261
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,478
Do people still talk about
such things this idiotic century?

262
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,519
My word to who?

263
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,399
To a Peaky Blinder?

264
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,558
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman

265
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,639
until he tells us where we can find
Freddie Thorne and his wife.

266
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,199
The source of the money
is of secondary importance.

267
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,559
You think my campaign against
Shelby has become personal?

268
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,798
Correct.

269
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,919
"Spot-on", as they say
in London society.

270
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:44,638
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman

271
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,519
and do not make the mistake
of being too gentle.

272
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,159
Right, sir.

273
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,919
Today's her birthday.

274
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:27,999
I know you never miss it.

275
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:31,718
Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.

276
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:33,078
What do you want?

277
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,039
I came to warn you.

278
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,518
They've lifted Stanly Chapman.

279
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,438
How do you know?
Police don't spill that information.

280
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:45,558
I know cos it was me and Tommy who
tipped them off. Tommy did a deal.

281
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,758
In return for safe passage
for you and Ada he's given them
Stanly and the money.

282
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:50,959
Money? What money?

283
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:57,199
Who told you about the money?
Who do you think?

284
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:02,478
Yeah, it was Ada's idea.
That's how desperate she is

285
00:24:02,479 --> 00:24:05,159
to get out of that rat-hole
you're keeping her in.

286
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,998
She doesn't mind if you knew she just
didn't want to be here when you found out.

287
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,838
Sometimes the women have to
take over. Like in the war.

288
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:16,078
Who the hell do you think
you are, you fucking Shelbys.

289
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,239
Don't swear over
your mother's grave.

290
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:23,118
You play your tune, you expect
the whole world to dance to it.

291
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,278
You don't have time for this,
Freddie.

292
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,318
You did a deal for me?

293
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,438
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

294
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:33,358
And you think this copper
will keep his word.

295
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,718
If he does, you're safe. If he
doesn't, Chapman will give you up,

296
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:39,279
you'll still have to leave town.
Same result.

297
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,758
So neat! So leave.

298
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,358
Except there's one thing
that you got wrong.

299
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,158
Stanly won't be able to give up my
address because he doesn't know it.

300
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,878
That's how it works.

301
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,679
None of us know each other's
addresses.

302
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,959
So, you've wasted your fucking time.

303
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,958
They'll keep beating him and beating
him for information he doesn't have.

304
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,959
All you've done is sign the death
warrant of a good man.

305
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,718
So, you won't leave.

306
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:11,118
No! I won't fucking leave!

307
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,039
If you want me out of Birmingham
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

308
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,119
You lay a hand on our Ada,
I'll put you in a wooden box myself.

309
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,279
You raised a stubborn one there,
Irene.

310
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,239
You told me to carry on.
I wanted to stop.

311
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:10,559
He had some kind of seizure.

312
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,559
So, you killed him?

313
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,599
Did he give you an address?

314
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:24,638
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

315
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,198
This is not bloody Belfast!

316
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,558
Not yet, but if men like him get
their way, it soon will be.

317
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,159
So, find some stairs, throw him
down, and call the coroner.

318
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,358
Use Grayson.

319
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,998
If he has any awkward questions

320
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,479
ask about the welfare
of his mistress in Saltley.

321
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,639
That'll shut him up.

322
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,158
To think I used to live in
a shit-hole like this.

323
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,958
Bloody animals.

324
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:59,319
But the Shelbys really
are doing an excellent job for us.

325
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,438
We haven't lost a single penny
to rafflers or chalkers

326
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,438
in eight race meetings.

327
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,878
The bookies are purring.

328
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,479
So, we throw the dog a bone.

329
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,959
I think so.

330
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:21,239
Mr Kimber. Mr Roberts.
Come and have a look around.

331
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,158
After you.

332
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,278
Come on, Fred.

333
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,998
You can feed half of Birmingham
with what you have had for lunch.

334
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,999
Get back to work.

335
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,878
We heard the Lees
had turned you over.

336
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:43,559
You shouldn't listen to gossip,
Mr Kimber. This way.

337
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,919
Business is good.

338
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,078
Especially since now you know
which horse is going to win

339
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,679
before you set the odds.
Your information is very much appreciated.

340
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,879
Right, well, where are they?

341
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:05,319
John, Lovelock, Scudboat, in here.

342
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,878
This is my team.

343
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:14,838
They will take up their pitch
at your convenience, Mr Kimber.

344
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,998
John is the book.
Scudboat is the bag man.

345
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,119
And, of course,
we bring our own protection.

346
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:26,319
Warwick, next Saturday. At least
fifty yards from the beer tent.

347
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,399
Gentlemen...

348
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:56,879
And lady.

349
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:02,838
I have in my hand a legal
betting licence.

350
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,199
Issued by the board of control.

351
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:12,719
The Shelby family has its
first legal racetrack pitch.

352
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,438
We're a business, Pol.

353
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,559
Congratulations. There you go.

354
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,118
Congratulations.

355
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,839
30, 40, 50...

356
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:41,358
These cigarettes have
a strange smell, Arthur.

357
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,358
They smell like rotting water.
And look.

358
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,798
Rats have gotten some of them.

359
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,518
They're stolen, are they not?

360
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,078
Don't ask. They smell
because you keep them on a boat.

361
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,279
What do you care? Now, can you come
and check my adding up, please?

362
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,998
You know, you should make a new
start with this place.

363
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:08,598
Do it properly. These cigarettes
are not fit to sell.

364
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,278
Smells like Gallipoli.

365
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,518
You should find
a new place to store them.

366
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,319
It has to be far away from coppers.

367
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:18,279
But not rats?
All the wharves have rats, Grace.

368
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,159
What's wrong with a dry warehouse?
Tommy's orders.

369
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:29,439
What orders? Always keep contraband
near to petrol boat moorings.

370
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,078
Don't boats get searched?

371
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,958
We moor them at junctions...

372
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,158
so there's more than one way out.

373
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,679
No locks within a mile
so we can move that stuff fast.

374
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,518
Your brother doesn't obey the law,
but he has rules.

375
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,799
A precise man, your brother.

376
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,199
Is my adding up right?
It is now.

377
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,718
One.

378
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,358
Two.

379
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,199
Three... and four.

380
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,799
And we'll search them one by one.

381
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,119
Please, Lord,
let that which I seek be found here.

382
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,879
Not so much as a bullet, sir.
Just more cigarettes and whisky.

383
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,879
Arthur tells me
you've been asking questions...

384
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:47,878
..about how we run our business.

385
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,438
And how we get our booze
and where we keep it.

386
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,799
I am just trying to help.

387
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,599
Let's you and me go for a walk.

388
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,719
Where to? Come on.

389
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,799
Why here?

390
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:16,039
You're a good Catholic girl,
aren't you?

391
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,639
Yes. Well, then you know it's here
people come to confess.

392
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,559
After you.

393
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:37,799
Well, here it is, Grace.

394
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:40,919
I confess.

395
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,559
I need someone.

396
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,678
Kimber has an adviser
by the name of Roberts.

397
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,398
He talks well.

398
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,638
Keeps the accounts.

399
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:57,759
Runs the legal side of the business.
And you need a Roberts.

400
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,438
Arthur tells me you have ideas.
I'm not an accountant. Nor a lawyer.

401
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,399
No.

402
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,399
No, but you have something I need.
Class.

403
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,718
I need someone who looks right
at the big meetings.

404
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,358
Epsom, Ascot...

405
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,518
Is a job interview? Arthur says
you're good with numbers.

406
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,039
Well, that's relative.
He is quite poor.

407
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,079
You keep the books in order.
They were chaotic.

408
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,599
But you're a liar.

409
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,478
No Catholic girl would
enter a church

410
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,159
and forget to make
the sign of the cross.

411
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,878
You are very perceptive.

412
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:45,238
First, you lied about that pub
you used worked in.

413
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:47,239
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

414
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,238
Do you care?

415
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,118
No.

416
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,239
I lied to fit in.

417
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,998
You pull a pint like someone
who's thinking about it.

418
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:02,079
This is not an interview,
it is an interrogation. Sit down.

419
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,759
Look, Grace...

420
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,239
You washed up in a place you don't
belong for whatever reason.

421
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:19,319
My good fortune. And perhaps mine.

422
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,038
You know that most of what I do
is illegal. I'm not blind.

423
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:33,199
And yet, you'd still be
willing to work for me?

424
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,399
Are you offering me the job?

425
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,479
Then I accept.

426
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:46,599
There's something else you
should know.

427
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,679
A very important detail
about my reasons for employing you.

428
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:12,999
You disappoint me.

429
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,039
Do you resign?

430
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:21,639
No.

431
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:25,039
My appetite for the work
has only increased.

432
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,679
Tomorrow I'll show you around.

433
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,119
Lizzie. Hello, Lizzie.

434
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,078
That bag looks heavy, jump in.

435
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,238
Kids' teas.

436
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,038
You like kids?

437
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,799
Yeah. Good,
cos John's got four of them.

438
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,999
It's all right. I'm not going to try
to talk you out of it.

439
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,598
I just want to talk.

440
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,518
You're not against us?

441
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,398
John is his own man.

442
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,479
And you are your own woman.

443
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,838
Now, Lizzie...

444
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,999
since I came back from France,
I've come to you on many occasions.

445
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,959
Tommy, you didn't tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.

446
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,559
Just like you didn't tell him.

447
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,878
Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

448
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,958
Why didn't you tell him

449
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,759
that you'd been serving his brother
for the past two years?

450
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,279
Because the past is the past.

451
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,039
I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

452
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,078
That was the answer I was hoping
you'd give - the past is the past.

453
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,598
You see our John says
you've changed. And I believe him.

454
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,799
And that's good. Change is good.

455
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:18,319
These are new times I'm told.

456
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:25,518
So I wish you both
every happiness.

457
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,679
And I want you to see that
as my wedding gift to you.

458
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,599
And our farewell
to pleasures gone by.

459
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,079
You mean...

460
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,719
..one last time?

461
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,719
One last time. You and me.

462
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,599
It's eight bloody pounds.

463
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,239
So, where shall we go?

464
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,999
Tommy, shall we go to my lodging?

465
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,199
So, the past is not the past.

466
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,478
You can keep the money, Lizzie.
Just get out of the car.

467
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:40,999
Tommy, please... Get out of the car.
I love him, Tommy. Really.

468
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,559
Really.

469
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,079
John will make his own decision.

470
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:56,999
But he will have the facts.

471
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,719
Your brother is ten times
the man you are!

472
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,999
Of that I have no doubt.

473
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,919
He is obviously not stupid.

474
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,158
All we found was stolen tobacco
and whisky. Which you left in place.

475
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,678
Of course.

476
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,199
I would never endanger you.

477
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:51,839
You are doing well, Grace.

478
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:58,039
I've been working on Arthur -
he's easier. Than Thomas. Yes.

479
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,399
Less intelligent.

480
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,598
Yes.

481
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,879
Is that a word you would
use about Thomas? It's your word.

482
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,399
He has promoted me.

483
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:14,239
He wants me to be his book-keeper
and secretary.

484
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,919
A cut-throat gangster
with a secretary.

485
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,798
The pretensions of these hoodlums
are quite breathtaking!

486
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:25,478
Are they not?

487
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,839
Yes. Quite breathtaking.

488
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,158
He has obviously fallen quite
heavily for you.

489
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,798
I thought you would be pleased.

490
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:39,118
I just hope you remember
who you are dealing with here.

491
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,839
A man who cuts off ears
and cuts out tongues.

492
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,159
I know what he is, sir.

493
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:51,559
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

494
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:56,119
I come here with good news
and I get this.

495
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:00,439
Grace!

496
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,598
Tommy. I need a favour.

497
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,398
I want to borrow the car.

498
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:26,558
I want to take Lizzie for a ride
in the country with the kids.

499
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,639
We're going to celebrate getting
the licence. Not a problem, John.

500
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,919
I'll need the keys.

501
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,119
Look, John, you're my brother...

502
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,279
There's something
I have to tell you.

503
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:46,638
Yesterday on the front
seat of that car,

504
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,239
I offered Lizzie some money.

505
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,599
And, John, she said "yes".

506
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,798
Now, that's a fact.

507
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:58,598
You do with it what want.

508
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,078
Take the keys.

509
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,838
Take Lizzie to the country.

510
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:04,719
Marry her if you want.

511
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:08,159
But you have to know...

512
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,239
..she said "yes".

513
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,679
Get another glass.

514
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:06,999
Can you make a toast?

515
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:10,598
I'm Irish,
I can make a million toasts.

516
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,678
May you be in heaven
a full half hour

517
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,919
before the devil
knows you're dead.

518
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,798
What are we celebrating?

519
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:26,239
Contract of employment.

520
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,318
Book-keeper.
Shelby Brothers Limited.

521
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:32,799
I don't like that word, "Limited".

522
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:36,839
To be respectable, you have to be
"Limited". That's what worries me.

523
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:40,679
I had the phone put in.

524
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:43,999
It's in the back.

525
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,719
If we knew someone else who
had a phone, we could call them.

526
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,479
And since we are celebrating...

527
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,439
..I had this delivered from
Rackham's Department Store.

528
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,119
Will you open it?

529
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,718
No.

530
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,079
Save it for a special occasion.

531
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:13,118
Right, your first job for the
company.

532
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,758
I want you to get that to my sister.

533
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:16,918
I don't see her?

534
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:19,079
No-one does. She is hiding from me.

535
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,358
I am told she goes to
a bathhouse on Montague Street

536
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,318
on woman-only days.

537
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:30,078
She goes in disguise,
so I need to get someone inside.

538
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,119
What am I delivering?

539
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,158
It's an invitation to a family
occasion. I want her there.

540
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,518
So, tell her there will be a truce.

541
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:41,999
Am I delivering bait for a trap?

542
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,518
If you check that contract

543
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,398
I think you'll find it doesn't say
anything about asking questions.

544
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:50,239
Just give her the invitation.

545
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
And put that in the cupboard
until I say.

546
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,238
What the hell, John? I couldn't
get it lit. Couldn't even do that.

547
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,598
Why would you want to be
smoking that for? Same reason as you.

548
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,599
Pain in the head.

549
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:56,839
I spoke to Lizzie.

550
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,359
I told her what you told me.

551
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,799
She said, "Your brother Tommy
is a dirty liar."

552
00:46:06,279 --> 00:46:09,158
But then I spoke to her sister
and her cousin.

553
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:10,379
Bought them a couple drinks.

554
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,999
"Just a few of regulars," they said.
"That's all."

555
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:19,678
"To keep the wolf from the door,

556
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,599
"she still sees
a couple of regulars."

557
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,759
You must think I'm an idiot.

558
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:39,078
I think you're the first
Shelby in history...

559
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:40,839
to have a legal licence for anything.

560
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,719
What would our granddad say, eh?

561
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:48,439
He'd be turning in his grave.

562
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:52,838
"Honest bloody money? Eh?"

563
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:55,278
"In this house? Here?"

564
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,879
You always used to do voices
when we were kids.

565
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,919
We're not kids now, John.

566
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:09,119
But we still have to look
out for each other, right?

567
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:12,599
Yeah.

568
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,078
Yeah.

569
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,359
Come on. Go home. Get some sleep.

570
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,478
We've got a big day tomorrow.

571
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:24,519
We have?

572
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,039
Tomorrow, we finish the war with
the Lees for once and for all.

573
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:32,759
Since when? Since just now.

574
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:36,079
Ten o'clock tomorrow.

575
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,799
Be ready for anything.

576
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:49,519
Out you get, boys.

577
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,279
Ready, boys?

578
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,879
John, ready? Yeah. Yeah I'm fine.
Have a drink.

579
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:11,558
What? What are you all staring
at me for? What?

580
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,679
Good. Let's go.

581
00:48:14,879 --> 00:48:16,079
What?

582
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,159
Tommy, what you playing at?
We're in shotgun range.

583
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:34,919
John...

584
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:39,799
..before we go into battle, there's
something you are going to need.

585
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,999
What are you bloody doing, Tommy?

586
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:48,878
Smile, John, it's a wedding.

587
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:51,959
Whose bloody wedding? Now if we'd
told you, you wouldn't have come.

588
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,758
There's a girl from the Lee family
who's going a bit wild.

589
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:58,999
And she needs marrying her off.
Fuck!

590
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:03,878
John!
You have no bloody right, Tommy!

591
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:05,439
Listen to me. Listen to me.

592
00:49:07,919 --> 00:49:10,799
A girl who needs a husband.
A man who needs a wife.

593
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,398
Tommy, I'm not bloody marrying
some fucking mushroom picker!

594
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:19,159
Shh, John boy, come on. Listen.

595
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,678
I have already betrothed you.

596
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,358
So if you back out now there's going
to be one fucking mighty war

597
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:29,438
breaking out here that's going to
make the Somme...

598
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:32,358
It's going to make the Somme
look like a fucking tea party.

599
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,038
But if you marry her,

600
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:38,598
our family and the Lee family
will be united for ever.

601
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,319
And this war will be over.
It's up to you John.

602
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,399
War...?

603
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:46,279
..or peace?

604
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:50,359
Let go of me.

605
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:07,199
Right... You should see
the size of her dowry.

606
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:10,398
Her what?

607
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:11,619
Her dad is giving you a car.

608
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:22,199
Will he do?

609
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:29,999
He'll do.

610
00:50:38,479 --> 00:50:39,638
Here she is.

611
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:41,598
She'd better be under 50.

612
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,119
Come here. Go on.

613
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,118
We're here today to join in
matrimony

614
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,999
this man and this woman...

615
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:02,318
You look well.

616
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,999
..and harmony and togetherness.

617
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:10,518
Which is sanctioned and honoured by
the presence and the power

618
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:11,999
of these two families around us.

619
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,198
Do you John Michael Shelby
take Esme Martha Lee

620
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:21,998
to be your beautiful wife?
You got my invitation?

621
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,159
Grace said there's a truce.

622
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:25,919
Family day.

623
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:30,158
Your husband couldn't make it?

624
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,318
He's not speaking to me.

625
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,918
And when he does he calls me
a fucking Shelby

626
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:36,998
even though I'm a Thorne now.

627
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:38,758
Thorn in my side, that's for sure.

628
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:41,718
..to have and hold...

629
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:42,719
My God, Tommy.

630
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,118
You admire him, don't you?

631
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,678
There remains one more
part of the ceremony.

632
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,719
It's the mingling of the two bloods.

633
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,039
Where the two families
become the one... family.

634
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,719
I now pronounce you man and wife!

635
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:03,758
Come on, John, kiss the bride
will you?

636
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:05,958
# Oh, I slept all night

637
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,358
# In a tinker's arms

638
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,838
# He put his arms around me

639
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:10,918
# Oh, there was folks
and there was dance

640
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,558
# And Paddy here's lost his banjo

641
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,398
# I wouldn't part from my sweetheart

642
00:52:14,399 --> 00:52:16,358
# Tuppence, ha'penny or farthing

643
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:18,158
# Another load of wagon men

644
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:19,959
# Spare a little thought
for the wind men. #

645
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:02,878
And again.

646
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,478
Come on, spin me round again.
You should tell Ada to slow down.

647
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:07,678
You think she'll listen to me?

648
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,718
I tried to stop her
but she's been drinking.

649
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:13,878
Been stuck in that little basement
for weeks. What do we expect?

650
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:15,438
She's going off like a firecracker.

651
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:17,478
Oh, Christ, Tommy, please...

652
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:20,639
Enough now. Come on. Enough.

653
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,958
All right, Ada, come on, have a
rest, sit down. Come and look, Esme.

654
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:29,518
Come and look at the family
you've joined. Come and look
at the man who runs it.

655
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:34,918
Chooses his brother's wives for them.
He hunts his own sister down like a rat

656
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:37,358
and he tries to kill his own
brother-in-law!

657
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,998
Ada, that's enough. And now he won't
even let me have a fucking dance!

658
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:43,918
Not even at a fucking wedding!
Sit her down.

659
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,679
Calm down, Ada. Ada, calm down.

660
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,798
Holy shit!

661
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,518
Water. Right.

662
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,999
Not now, Ada. Bloody hell,
you do pick your times!

663
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:09,278
Slow her up. Nice and easy.

664
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,718
Story of your fucking life, Arthur.

665
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:12,399
Right, we are here.

666
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:16,439
Come on.

667
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:20,678
Nice car, John. How's she run?

668
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,438
Yeah, beautiful. Really smooth.

669
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:25,478
Your sister in there giving birth,
you're talking about the bloody car.

670
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:28,158
Not much us men can do now, Pol.
Except go get drunk.

671
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:30,239
Right, come on.
There's one man should be here.

672
00:54:34,999 --> 00:54:37,759
You are right, Pol,
Freddie should be here.

673
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,638
Is that a heartbeat
I hear inside that chest?

674
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,678
The truce lasts till sunrise.
On my oath.

675
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:46,358
Tell Freddie it's safe.

676
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:49,999
Ada! Right, boys,
let's wet this baby's head.

677
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:56,439
Keep going. That's right. Push.

678
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,078
I think it might be
the wrong way round.

679
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:06,359
I tended three sisters.

680
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:10,078
Yeah, I think you're right.

681
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,998
We should move her forward.
Come on, Ada.

682
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:13,999
Right, come on.

683
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:17,919
It's not long to go now, darling.

684
00:55:18,999 --> 00:55:21,718
Push. Two, three.

685
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:22,719
Two beautiful women.

686
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:28,238
I should go. I should go.
It's my wedding night.

687
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:29,998
No, you sit down.

688
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,598
You don't want to be among the women
when there's a baby coming.

689
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,638
Have another.

690
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,878
So, do you think her husband will
take the same advice and stay away?

691
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:40,798
Nah. Freddie will be there.
Nothing will keep him away.

692
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,158
Tommy's said it's
all right for him to be there.

693
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:44,958
Isn't that right, Tommy?

694
00:55:44,959 --> 00:55:46,639
That's right. I'm all heart tonight.

695
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:54,318
You know what, John boy?

696
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,158
I think it's that lovely barmaid,

697
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,998
that pretty barmaid
that's just walked out

698
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,598
that's made our brother go all soft.

699
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,479
Drinks to that.

700
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:21,319
Ada!

701
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:27,279
Come on, open up.

702
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:33,279
There you go, love.

703
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:38,839
Oh, he's beautiful.

704
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,879
It's a boy, Freddie.

705
00:56:51,999 --> 00:56:53,759
It's a beautiful baby boy.

706
00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:06,759
There you go.

707
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:10,599
Welcome to the world, Son.

708
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:14,558
Welcome.

709
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,799
Open up! Police!

710
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:18,918
Freddie?

711
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:21,438
You can't come in here,
there's a baby just been born.

712
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,599
Freddie?

713
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:27,038
Don't hurt him. Freddie!

714
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,278
You are hurting him,
leave him alone.

715
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,118
You're taking me away from my baby?

716
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,919
Ada! Freddie!

717
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,919
You want me to open
that champagne now?

718
00:57:54,759 --> 00:57:55,879
It's a boy.

719
00:57:57,279 --> 00:57:58,638
Pol? Polly?

720
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:00,478
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

721
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:02,558
Polly! Polly!

722
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,518
But the police came
and took his father away!

723
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,479
Don't you DARE look at me like that!

724
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,239
You liar!

725
00:58:30,480 --> 00:59:03,120
