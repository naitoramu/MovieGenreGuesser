1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:02,623
Previously on Prison Break:
The ranch is gone, Michael.

2
00:00:02,653 --> 00:00:05,295
We gotta do something, and it's
not going to involve hurting anyone.

3
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:06,070
I got an idea.

4
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:10,237
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:12,081
Those cons are in
one of these towns

6
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:15,211
and couldn't have gone further
than 64 miles in any direction.

7
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,392
I want everything you've
got in that perimeter.

8
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:19,160
Well, to be honest, uh...

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,064
I was expecting to
brief the president.

10
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,510
You report to me now.

11
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,950
Frankly, the biggest
issue we have to address,

12
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:28,118
are the charges
facing your daughter.

13
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:30,324
Good to meet you, sir.

14
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,232
Sara, do you remember that guy that
I met with you in your apartment?

15
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,983
I want you to stay
away from him.

16
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:39,880
- What are you talking about?
- I found out some other things too.

17
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,980
- Where is that?
- It's Holland.

18
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:44,570
It's beautiful.

19
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:46,352
And that's for the car.

20
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:48,590
We'll meet you right
back here in an hour.

21
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:52,340
Put your hands behind your
head and drop to your knees.

22
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,422
Oh, God.

23
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:58,982
Don't say a word,
you little whore

24
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,662
or I'm gonna cut
your throat out.

25
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,602
Ah! Oh, please!

26
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:05,720
You try that again,

27
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:08,513
I'll pry those vocal chords
right out of your throat.

28
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:11,053
She's coming up.

29
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:16,590
What's she doing?

30
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:19,393
She's coming up here.

31
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,490
Stay there. Stay there.

32
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:37,683
Mom, you home?

33
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:43,003
Stay quiet.

34
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:55,130
Mom?

35
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,100
It's okay. It's okay.

36
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,840
Back away and put
your hands up.

37
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:48,670
Just go easy.

38
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:51,771
Go nothing. She ain't the
one carrying the cards here.

39
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:54,071
Back away and put
your hands up.

40
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,322
I put my hand up,
I'll take her jugular with it.

41
00:02:57,455 --> 00:03:00,193
I don't want anyone to do
anything stupid, okay?

42
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:08,010
Let's be civil here.

43
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,731
Stop. Relax. You can go.

44
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:14,850
Guy at the garden center said
Burrows was strong as a gorilla.

45
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:16,930
It was 1:00 p.m.
when they tangled it up.

46
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:18,493
The guy ID'd both of them--

47
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,812
Scofield, Burrows.
No doubt about it in his mind.

48
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,452
Of course,
given that was 1:00 p.m.,

49
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,513
those two could be 300
miles from here by now.

50
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,150
You have a half a
dozen picks, shovels

51
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:28,082
and power tools missing
from that store.

52
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,433
They're here and
they're digging.

53
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:32,352
Five million dollars buried somewhere
beneath the streets of Tooele.

54
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,580
You really believe that?

55
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:36,050
They believe that,
and that's the important thing.

56
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:37,630
They could be anywhere now.

57
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,072
We don't have the units
to go door-to-door.

58
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,231
We won't need them.

59
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,232
He's going to tell
us where to look.

61
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:28,033
It's so funny:
I was just about to text you.

62
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:29,903
- Today's your lucky day.
- Is it?

63
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:33,013
Yeah, my Aunt Maxine finally

64
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,822
gave me her famous chocolate
chip cookie recipe and

65
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,703
if you're free tonight,
I'd love for you to be my guinea pig.

66
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,270
Uh... I can't. Not tonight.

67
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:45,943
Come on. You sound just like Daniel.
Not tonight. Not tonight.

68
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,950
You know what? If you don't mind,
I've actually gotta go.

69
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:54,433
Are you okay?
I mean, your cart's empty.

70
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,353
- I'm good. Just gotta go.
- Sara.

71
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,763
This is going wrong in
every possible way.

72
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:17,613
This is stupid, man.
We can not do this.

73
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,140
Hat's over the wall now.

74
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,232
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

75
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,123
I mean we committed.
It's time to go get the hat.

76
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,093
We don't have a choice.

77
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,623
Yeah, we do. We can walk right
up out of here right now, man.

78
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,020
And then what?

79
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:36,551
We are already in the house.

80
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:39,643
Those women are bound.
We have already committed this crime.

81
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:42,420
We leave,
it ain't gonna change any of that.

82
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:47,033
Why couldn't there
just be a silo

83
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,612
in the middle of a field
with no one around?

84
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,122
We'll figure it out.
We can get the money another way.

85
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,973
Yeah, maybe I can
rob another bank.

86
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:59,723
You know what Charles
once said to me?

87
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:03,610
He said there's no such
thing as an ex-con.

88
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:06,133
Because I used to think

89
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,690
there was a way we could
wipe the slate clean,

90
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:13,683
make up for everything
we've done.

91
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,481
The hat's over the wall, Linc.

92
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,361
For everyone.

93
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,132
"Sorry" isn't going to mean
anything to you right now,

94
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:37,231
but I want to say it anyway.

95
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:41,110
This wasn't supposed to happen.

96
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:46,023
One or two hours tops
and we'll be out of here,

97
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:50,062
and you have my word,
no one will harm you.

98
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,080
Keep your eyes open, okay?

99
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,651
Nothing happens to them.

100
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,371
Nothing.

101
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:17,280
- The doctor is suspicious.
- She should be.

102
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:20,070
She was on the line with the
governor when you walked up.

103
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,363
You were listening.

104
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,992
Both lines are tapped.
We're not rookies.

105
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,991
Did her father tell
her what you know?

106
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:33,643
Not over the phone. But he knows
who you are, and so does she.

107
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:36,440
Seeing how she was supposed
to lead you to Scofield

108
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:39,320
and eventually to Burrows,
it looks like we're back to square one.

109
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,412
Not necessarily.
There are other people they care about.

110
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,562
The kid. L.J.

111
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:50,502
- In terms of the governor...
- Burrows' kid, Paul.

112
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:51,990
Focus.

113
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:03,463
Governor Tancredi's office.
Please hold.

114
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,833
Governor Tancredi's office.
Hold, please.

115
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,252
- Hey, is, is my father in?
- Just a second.

116
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,101
- Hey, Bruce.
- Oh, hi, Sara.

117
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:13,811
I'm trying to get a hold of Dad.
I need to reach him on his cell.

118
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:15,891
He actually just landed.
Should be home soon.

119
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't know if he's going to be
in much of a mood to talk, though.

120
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:19,182
Why?

121
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:21,483
Your father got a call
from the White House.

122
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,271
They withdrew his nomination.

123
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:27,500
What? I talked to him two hours ago.
He didn't say anything about that.

124
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:28,620
It just happened.

125
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:32,152
According to them, his confirmation
was going to be a problem.

126
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:34,490
We had the votes, right?

127
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:38,212
- Super majority.
- Okay. So...

128
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,813
President Reynolds pulled
the plug on a sure thing

129
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,912
in order to start
over from scratch?

130
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:46,060
How often does something like
that happen in politics?

131
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:47,090
Never.

132
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,293
Since when did we become kidnappers?
It ain't right.

133
00:08:57,908 --> 00:09:00,801
Well, we can buy a
conscience tomorrow.

134
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:05,003
Yeah, well, yeah. Closing your
eyes ain't gonna make it go away.

135
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:09,380
I'll take five minutes of
a situation I can control

136
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,622
over 50 years of
one I can't any day.

137
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,482
Hey, Mr. Hundred Dollar Bill.

138
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:18,963
Uh, what's it like being with
the African persuasion anyhow?

139
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:22,073
- You shut the hell up.
- Oh, hit me a nerve.

140
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:28,093
Why don't you get down in
that hole and dig, man?

141
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,343
Oh, yeah.
How about you backin' up, dark fella?

142
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:33,101
You're a long way away from home,
trailer park.

143
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:36,410
I can put you in that hole,
and nobody would ever hear you scream.

144
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,510
Knock it off.

145
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,868
We have security expert
Marc Bruni with us

146
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:42,544
who will explain how
other prisons are ensuring

147
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:46,681
that they are not victimized
by the next Fox River Eight.

148
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,801
Should be the Fox River Seven

149
00:09:48,947 --> 00:09:52,473
now that Abruzzi's
taken his dirt nap.

150
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:54,723
God rest the man's soul,
of course.

151
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:58,060
Speaking of numbers,
we're short one.

152
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,791
Kid's taken a long time
to fill that gas tank up.

153
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,893
Leaned on him in every way
I can think of. He's, uh...

154
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:15,150
He's not talking.

155
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,792
Are you Catholic?

156
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:36,963
Are you Catholic?

157
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:45,333
Not much good in it.
Lot of guilt.

158
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,721
But the one good
thing is confession.

159
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:55,801
Whatever you got eating at you,
you just...

160
00:10:56,687 --> 00:10:58,182
give it up.

161
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,222
Feels good, I have to say.

162
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:05,353
Guess it's letting it out.

163
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,420
Letting another
human being hear it.

164
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:10,371
I ain't got nothin'
to say to you, man.

165
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,182
What if I told you something?

166
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:22,681
A secret nobody else knew.

167
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:26,982
Oscar Shales...

168
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:36,483
Guy I was chasing
a few years back.

169
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:38,960
Smart as hell. I...

170
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,060
kept just missing him.

171
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:47,192
It became kind of a game,
like, uh, chess.

172
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:50,252
Would've almost been fun
if it weren't for the fact

173
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:54,051
that he was killing
people all along the way.

174
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,850
Bodies kept stacking up,

175
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:02,903
and I started to feel that
it was because of me.

176
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,243
Because I couldn't do my job.

177
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,500
Because I wasn't smart enough.

178
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:15,302
Never did catch him,

179
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,322
but I did lose him.

180
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:24,372
I saw things when I would
drive at night: bodies...

181
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:29,160
nightmares to the point
that I couldn't sleep.

182
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:35,600
It... was a complete
break from reality.

183
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:39,861
That's what these
little guys are for.

184
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:42,520
To keep me in the game.

185
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:51,140
So now you know.
Now it's off my chest.

186
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,072
Ought to try it sometime.

187
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:08,601
Like I said before...

188
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:14,891
- I ain't gonna tell you nothin'.
- You know where those guys are.

189
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:19,432
If you're looking for a rat,
you got the wrong guy, man.

190
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,342
Nah, I'm just trying to
spare you some guilt.

191
00:13:27,438 --> 00:13:31,822
Bagwell was free less than 24 hours
before he killed his first victim.

192
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:37,990
If you don't tell
me where he is now,

193
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:39,453
he's gonna kill again,

194
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:44,302
and that blood is gonna be on your
conscience and nobody else's.

195
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:54,010
Confession might not be
such a bad thing, huh?

196
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:03,951
He just arrived, LJ.
That's impossible.

197
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:06,822
I don't have a meeting
scheduled with my lawyer.

198
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:12,422
He's a court-appointed
public defender in Illinois.

199
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:15,121
I doubt he would come to
Arizona without calling me.

200
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:17,221
Let's go.

201
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:47,771
Yeah.

202
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:51,290
We're all set in Arizona
with the Burrows kid.

203
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,223
Good.

204
00:14:52,547 --> 00:14:54,853
The kid's as good as gone.

205
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,832
What'd you say the name
of that lawyer was?

206
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:06,081
Didn't give it to me.
Gave it to the warden.

207
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:07,992
Then I want to talk
to the warden.

208
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,910
- Hey, you hear me?
- After.

209
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,330
Hello, LJ.

210
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,661
What do you want?

211
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:42,962
They didn't tell
you why I came here?

212
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:43,712
No.

213
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,172
I'm an ADA here
in Mohave County.

214
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,751
I'm here to serve
you with these.

215
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:54,120
- What are those?
- Your release papers.

216
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,621
- Hey, Matt.
- Ms. Tancredi.

217
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,782
- Is my dad in?
- In his study.

218
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:21,791
Hey, Dad?

219
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,842
Help!

220
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,111
I need my pill.

221
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,052
Please, I need my pill.

222
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:12,843
- What?
- I need my pills.

223
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:13,541
Forget it.

224
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:18,681
No, you don't understand; I need them.
They're for my baby.

225
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:23,341
They're Metformin to prevent
a miscarriage. Please.

226
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:29,722
They're in the drawer in the kitchen.
That one right there.

227
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:35,060
- How many?
- Two.

228
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:38,253
And water. Please.

229
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:58,523
You know I got to
put the gag back on.

230
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:01,221
Wait, before you do,
I just have one more question.

231
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:05,420
You seem like a really good guy.
Why are you doing this?

232
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:11,133
I'm not a good guy.

233
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,500
Do you really think
they'll help keep predators

234
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:21,703
like Theodore Bagwell
safely behind bars?

235
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:26,710
Picture makes me look
like a sociopath.

236
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:33,573
I'm not joking with you, trailer park.
Now, get in here and dig!

237
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,810
I am incapable,
thanks to all y'all.

238
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,343
You just remember:
my X marked the spot! You remember that.

239
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:45,061
We got a bigger issue. The kid.
How long's it been since he left?

240
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:47,123
An hour and a half, maybe.

241
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:50,941
Hour and a half to fill a tank of gas?
That ain't right.

242
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,731
There has been a
breaking development

243
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,170
in the double homicide
prosecution of Lincoln Burrows Jr.

244
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:58,551
Due to the sudden disappearance
of crucial blood and...

245
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,610
Hey, Linc,
I didn't know you had a boy.

246
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:03,872
...the Cook County
District Attorney's Office

247
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:08,763
had no choice but to drop all
charges against the 16-year-old.

248
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:12,851
Burrows is scheduled to be released
from the Klipton Detention Center

249
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:17,700
in Kingman, Arizona, where he's
currently being held, tomorrow morning.

250
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:24,263
Keys to the car--
where are they?

251
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,002
- Just hold on.
- You okay?

252
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:28,440
You can't do this. Linc.

253
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:31,940
We're five minutes
away in there.

254
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:34,063
We've been five
minutes for four hours.

255
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:36,152
Just give me some time.
Be patient.

256
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:37,770
You think I give a
damn about the money?

257
00:19:37,806 --> 00:19:38,942
I'm doing what's necessary!

258
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,890
You're afraid to fail--

259
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:42,291
you're afraid this big plan of
yours ain't gonna work out.

260
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:45,140
You want to get caught proving you
can pull this thing off, be my guest.

261
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:47,462
LJ's out there;
I'm gonna get him.

262
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,500
We have come 1,500 miles
across the country.

263
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:53,322
We have made it this far.

264
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,572
Then I guess this is
where we part ways.

265
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:40,643
Any word of how the
interrogation's going?

266
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,262
Nah, the kid's
still stonewalling,

267
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:44,241
but we've got
confirmation on Patoshik;

268
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:46,852
his prints were all over
that old lady's house.

269
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,392
So he leaves the cash
and the jewelry.

270
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:52,263
The only thing he steals is
a ten-dollar oil painting.

271
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:55,212
What the hell's
wrong with that?

272
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,643
Is there something
I can help you with?

273
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:21,562
What? No.

274
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:25,333
You know, it'd be a little easier if
you use the cart for all that stuff.

275
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,282
I'm just, uh, I wanted to...

276
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,422
see if it'd all fit in the bag.

277
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,313
What happened to
your knee there?

278
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:36,952
Motorcycle accident.

279
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,732
So, uh...

280
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:41,113
you don't move around too well,
then, do you?

281
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:42,481
Not very.

282
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:45,353
- That's good.
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

283
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:06,750
You can still come with me.

284
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:08,532
No, I can...

285
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,540
I can do this.

286
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:17,672
- And if you can't?
- Then we still meet up

287
00:22:17,768 --> 00:22:20,073
exactly where we planned.
Bolshee Booze.

288
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:22,370
- Bolshoi.
- Bolshoi.

289
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:27,431
- LJ's going to be with me.
- You remember how to get there?

290
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:31,342
- How can I forget?
- Thursday night, 6:00.

291
00:22:31,628 --> 00:22:39,402
It's our last shot.
If we're, uh... Um...

292
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,923
If we do this right,
we're gone forever.

293
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:47,433
Lot of ground to
cover in three days.

294
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:49,221
Lot of ground.

295
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:51,741
Yeah. All right.

296
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,133
Take care.

297
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:59,010
They'll be gunning for you.

298
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:02,010
They'll get you any
way they can, so...

299
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,341
Yep.

300
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,773
Tell LJ...

301
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:09,391
tell him I said
there'll be a surfboard

302
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,223
with his name on it.

303
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:12,533
Nice.

304
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,671
- Bolshoi Booze.
- Three days.

305
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,590
Keep your head down.

306
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,603
Ms. Tancredi...

307
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:53,863
Hi. Um...

308
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,082
I just wanted to let
you know that the ME--

309
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:58,861
she's finished her preliminary
examination of the body.

310
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,643
She found no signs
of foul play.

311
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:08,252
I know it's a shock, but we've
also spoken to the detail guard

312
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:11,611
stationed outside and he didn't
see anyone other than your father

313
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:15,032
enter or exit the mansion since
he came back from Washington.

314
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,912
My father is not
a suicidal man.

315
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,831
Look, is there any extended
family I should call?

316
00:24:25,027 --> 00:24:28,463
I'm an only child.
My mother passed away.

317
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:32,060
- Could I have a moment, please?
- Yeah.

318
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,680
That's a hell of
a good deal, son.

319
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,652
We're talking no additional time
on your sentence for the escape.

320
00:25:10,688 --> 00:25:13,233
You want it in writing,
I'll put it in writing.

321
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:16,130
We will put you up
at Club Fed and

322
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:20,612
you'll spend your days playing
racquetball with stockbrokers
and lawyers.

323
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:24,641
Four years from now you'll
be out on the street,

324
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,450
22 years old with a clean slate

325
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:29,980
and your whole
life ahead of you,

326
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:35,660
and no blood on
your hands. Okay?

327
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:42,753
There's a woman in the house.

328
00:25:45,806 --> 00:25:48,301
If you guys show up...

329
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,883
it's just going to turn
her into a hostage.

330
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:58,972
T-Bag-- he ain't
coming out alive.

331
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,302
And he's going to
take her with him.

332
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:06,960
- Let me worry about that.
- Uh-uh. No, hell, no.

333
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:10,261
The only way that that
woman comes out free

334
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:14,920
is if someone shows up on
that porch that they trust.

335
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:20,673
- Being you?
- Being me.

336
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:32,042
I'll take it then.

337
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,853
You like it?

338
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:38,952
You like jerk...
you like jerky?

339
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:42,540
You like jerky.

340
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:50,671
What were you in for?

341
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,241
I don't want to talk, lady.

342
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:56,312
I'm a prisoner in my own house.

343
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:59,372
Least you could offer me
is a little conversation.

344
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,310
All right.

345
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:06,763
Just let me know when I hit it.

346
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:08,013
Murder?

347
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:09,033
Rape?

348
00:28:09,178 --> 00:28:10,250
Kidnapping?

349
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,172
Sexual abuse?

350
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,032
- Child sexual abuse?
- Aggravated robbery.

351
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:20,633
- How long were you doing?
- Five years.

352
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,903
How much longer did
you have left to serve?

353
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,273
18 months.

354
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:27,523
Why on earth would you
break out of prison with...?

355
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:34,480
What's her name?

356
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:37,831
It doesn't matter.

357
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:41,131
So what,
she was running away with another man?

358
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:46,080
Look, maybe you should have
let her go rather instead of...

359
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:47,520
She's having my baby.

360
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:52,701
- How far along is she?
- I don't want to talk about it.

361
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:56,192
I'm two months. I just had my first
trimester sonogram on Tuesday.

362
00:28:56,328 --> 00:28:59,852
- 10-5 Dispatch to all units.
- Has she shown you pictures of...?

363
00:29:00,135 --> 00:29:03,880
Transporting David Apolskis
in FBI custody. Stand by.

364
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,643
Yo, this is going to take all day.
We need more manpower.

365
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,461
Standing around jabbering ain't gonna
get the dirt out of that ground.

366
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,690
Son of a bitch. Now what?

367
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:30,412
- We got to roll.
- Why?

368
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,001
They got Tweener.
It was on the radio.

369
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,432
Nice knowing y'all.

370
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:39,283
They say anything
about where we are?

371
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:41,710
I'm not hanging
around to find out.

372
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,343
Well, maybe you should.

373
00:29:58,407 --> 00:29:59,903
Maybe you should.

374
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:10,732
Maybe we all should.

375
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:31,231
Let's go over this again.
None of them are armed?

376
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:32,922
With guns-- no.

377
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,550
Bagwell had a
screwdriver or something.

378
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,862
Do we really need this, man?

379
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:39,601
Yeah.

380
00:30:40,348 --> 00:30:43,782
In case you decide to do something
stupid like tip them off.

381
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:50,510
You know it's out
there. Holland.

382
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:59,031
I'm going to live
in a windmill.

383
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:00,901
All we need is a raft.

384
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:05,103
I'm going to build it.

385
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:10,421
It all starts with this...
No, this stick.

386
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:18,733
Charles Westmoreland,

387
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:22,833
God bless you and your
wrinkled old sack.

388
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:24,652
It's all here.

389
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:27,333
I owe you a profound
thanks, pretty.

390
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:29,930
A couple days from now,

391
00:31:29,966 --> 00:31:32,010
I'm going to be walking
down the streets of Bangkok

392
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:33,593
with a million US in my pocket.

393
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:36,320
That's about 40 million
Baht in the local currency.

394
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:39,013
Man, what the hell is up
with you and Thailand, huh?

395
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:41,103
Black market surgery,

396
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:43,030
anonymous transplant donors,

397
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:46,220
"he"s dressed like "she"s--
what's there not to like?

398
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,170
Are you really going to
try to replace that hand?

399
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,413
Body ain't takin' to this one.

400
00:31:57,018 --> 00:31:59,360
- Unbelievable.
- All right, let's move.

401
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,323
You know,
that hand ain't gonna be white.

402
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,762
- What?
- The new one.

403
00:32:04,858 --> 00:32:08,523
Even if you get down there,
it ain't gonna be white.

404
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:13,701
Hey, Johnny KKK over here is
going to have an Asian hand.

405
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:32,810
No mistakes.
Let's get them clean.

406
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:43,443
I need to know if
I can trust you.

407
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:50,841
- We had a deal, remember?
- Now walk.

408
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:38,860
Scott... I don't got much time,
all right.

409
00:33:38,997 --> 00:33:40,872
I had to tell you something.

410
00:33:41,196 --> 00:33:44,302
What you did for me that
day at the motel...

411
00:33:45,595 --> 00:33:49,651
...ain't nobody in my life has
been to bat for me like that.

412
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,821
And I lied to you.

413
00:33:54,586 --> 00:33:56,441
My name isn't Scott.

414
00:33:56,588 --> 00:34:00,071
My name is Dave. Dave Apolskis.

415
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,552
I wanted you to know.

416
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:11,753
Because I'm gonna
be writing you.

417
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:14,431
And I sure as hell hope
that you write back.

418
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,872
Can I help you?

419
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:38,261
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

420
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:42,020
Contractor. We got some
electrical issues.

421
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:44,411
No. No, you can't help me.

422
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,242
Excuse me. Is there a problem?

423
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,800
Ms. Owens is not home.

424
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:52,541
Yeah, well,
I'm supposed to drive her to the club...

425
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,543
She already went to the club.

426
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:58,032
Yeah, um, she came out,
said she was going to the club.

427
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:00,573
She got into her car and left.

428
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,951
I don't know what
else to tell you.

429
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:08,151
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

430
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:28,573
He's gone.

431
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:31,450
We got to get out of here.
'Cause once he gets to the club,

432
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:34,831
he's going to find out she's not there.
Then he's going to be back.

433
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:42,863
Know what? You were right.

434
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:45,832
It does feel good to get
stuff off your chest.

435
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:49,151
I'm sorry I had to play
you like that, bro.

436
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,621
Yo, what's up?

437
00:36:02,448 --> 00:36:05,881
Come on. It's going to be a long drive.
Stretch your legs.

438
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,720
All right.

439
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,013
Kellerman.

440
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,352
I thought you were going to deal
with the LJ Burrows situation.

441
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:50,752
Oh, I did.

442
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:53,450
Then why is he being released
from custody tomorrow?

443
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,491
In and of himself,
the kid is useless to us.

444
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:59,550
His only value is in who
comes looking for him.

445
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,980
More importantly, though,
Governor Tancredi...

446
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:05,722
not part of our plan.

447
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:09,021
Last time I checked, you left no
shortage of bodies in your wake.

448
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:11,031
No, I did what I
had to do to get

449
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:13,942
Caroline where she is.
Now that she's there,

450
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:16,620
let's not draw any more
attention than we have to.

451
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:19,022
You think getting to the
top is the hard part?

452
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,812
She's a hundred
times more visible,

453
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:22,411
has a hundred
times more enemies.

454
00:37:22,446 --> 00:37:24,990
Anyone who knows anything
has got to be dealt with.

455
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:27,662
If someone is a liability,
they go.

456
00:37:27,806 --> 00:37:30,531
Tancredi was becoming
a liability.

457
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,542
So was his daughter.

458
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,741
Wait. What? Sara?

459
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:41,750
Goodbye, Paul.

460
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:29,083
You walk out that door
with those guys right now,

461
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:31,202
and it's only a matter of
time before you get caught.

462
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:32,361
You realize that, don't you?

463
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:34,502
You're not just gonna be
dealing with escape charges,

464
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:37,011
but assault,
unlawful imprisonment, kidnapping...

465
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:38,611
I don't need to hear
this right now.

466
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:39,393
Oh, no, you do.

467
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:42,780
How much longer do you really think
you can stay ahead of the cops?

468
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:48,802
Look, if you turn yourself in,
I will testify at the sentencing.

469
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:51,451
I will say that you cooperated.
That can make a huge difference.

470
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:53,352
- Shut up.
- Be smart.

471
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,702
You have a baby on the way.

472
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:58,663
Do you want to be around for
its second birthday or its 22nd?

473
00:38:58,696 --> 00:38:59,162
Shut up.

474
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,053
If you didn't want to
hear what I had to say,

475
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,521
if you didn't want to hear what
a big mistake you're making,

476
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:05,503
you would've put that
gag back on me...

477
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:09,980
Fernando!

478
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:11,703
Time to go.

479
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,812
You can still do the
right thing, Fernando.

480
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,013
Look-a-here, look-a-here.

481
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:25,712
Look-a-here.

482
00:39:26,127 --> 00:39:27,290
Pocket change.

483
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:30,082
In case you want to tip the
valet when you're at the Ritz.

484
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:33,783
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about,
boy. Where's Sucre?

485
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:37,883
- Right here.
- What are you doing?

486
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:41,973
Drop the bag.
No one's going anywhere.

487
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,910
Hey, yo.

488
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:05,180
Just so you know, man,
I'm not gonna roll on those guys.

489
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:09,471
It ain't gonna happen, so...
if that's what this is about...

490
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:20,481
We were talking about
confession earlier. And, uh...

491
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:27,301
I think I owe you an apology
because I lied to you...

492
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:31,330
...about Oscar Shales.

493
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:38,192
Smart-ass just kept pushing it,
and I...

494
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:40,622
I snapped.

495
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,071
Right there.

496
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:47,072
That's where I put
the bullet in him.

497
00:40:53,558 --> 00:40:55,901
I don't care about
none of this.

498
00:40:56,035 --> 00:41:00,801
Mistake about that is forensics
will tell the whole tale.

499
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:05,231
Powder burns.
The gun was right against his head.

500
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:10,661
Sir... I think we
should go back to...

501
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,883
See, that's what's good
about confession, you know,

502
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:16,071
'cause you say something,
you get it off your chest and...

503
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:17,813
it just goes out there
into the whole world.

504
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:20,691
And I'm so sorry about this, kid,
because I really hope you understand.

505
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:21,611
Yo, yo...

506
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,382
I got nothing against you, kid.

507
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,593
What are you doing, man?

508
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:28,513
What they do.

509
00:42:32,518 --> 00:42:36,611
