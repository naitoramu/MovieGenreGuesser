Sir? 
This is her.

7
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,599
The girl who tells fortunes?

8
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,399
They're doing a magic spell
to make her win a race.

9
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:13,398
The horse's name's Monaghan Boy.
Kempton, three o'clock, Monday.

10
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,799
You ladies have a bet yourselves
but don't tell anyone else.

Finn?

00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,519
Arthur's mad as hell.

26
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,158
What does a ten-year-old
know about hell, eh?

27
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,919
I'm 11 Sunday.

28
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,519
Place your bets here now
for the 2:30 at Kempton.

29
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,319
Down to fours...

30
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,559
OK, girls and boys,
you want to push that now, mate.

31
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,439
Thanks very much.

32
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,358
2-1, get your bets in now.

33
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:19,199
What d'you say? We've got Sovereign,
he's an old favourite, 4-1.

34
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,638
Tommy.
 Tommy!

35
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,438
Tommy, look at the book. Just look.

36
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,038
- Tommy! All on Monaghan Boy.
- Good work, John.

37
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,199
Tommy! Get in here, now!

38
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,319
That'll be six pennies, Nipper.
That's ten bob you'll see for that.

39
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:50,798
You was seen doing the powder trick
down at Garrison Court.

40
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,958
Times are hard.

41
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,918
People need a reason to lay a bet.

42
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,958
There was a Chinese.

43
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,398
The washer women say she's a witch.
It helps them believe.

44
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,318
We don't mess with Chinese.

45
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,758
Look at the book...

46
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,678
Chinese have cutters of their own.

47
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,959
We agreed, Arthur.

48
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,799
I'm taking charge
of drumming up new money.

49
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,359
What if Monaghan Boy wins, Tommy?

50
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,438
You fixing races now?

51
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:24,359
Do you have permission from Billy
Kimber to be fixing races, hm?

52
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,799
Then what's got into you?

53
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,078
You think we can take on
the Chinese and Billy Kimber.

54
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,198
Billy's got a bloody army!

55
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,159
I think... Arthur. That's what I do.

56
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,279
I think...

57
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:47,159
so that you don't have to.

58
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,798
There's news from Belfast.

59
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,759
Down from tens over eights...

60
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,678
I'm calling a family council
tonight at eight o'clock.

61
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:03,999
I want all of us there.

62
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,519
You hear me?!
There's trouble coming.

63
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,799
All right, shut up now. Shut up.

64
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,598
Comrades...

65
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,958
- we're here today to take
a vote on strike action. 
- MEN: Yes!

66
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,119
But before we have a show
of hands for that...

67
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,598
let's have a show of hands
from all those who fought in France,

68
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,998
all those who stood side-by-side
with your comrades

69
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,239
and watched your comrades fall.
Raise your hands.

70
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:39,398
The blood shed on Flanders fields,

71
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,679
the sweat of YOUR brows!

72
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,199
Who reaps the rewards?

73
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,558
- Is it you ?
- No!

74
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,678
- Is it your wifes ?
- No!

75
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,838
- Who, then? Do they stand among us?
- No!

76
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,958
Or do they sit at home, comfortable,
with a full belly

77
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,878
while you scrape to find enough to
put shoes on your children's feet!

78
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,359
- Yes!
- And what is the reward they offer
you for your sacrifices made?

79
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,078
A fucking cut in your wages!

80
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:11,078
THAT is your reward!

81
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,638
Raise a hand, all those
who want to strike!

82
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,479
Yeah!

83
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,439
On the house, Mr Shelby.

84
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,559
- I'll take a mild. 
- Right.

85
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,678
Cheers, Thomas.

86
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,839
Good health to you.

87
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,799
The crown of a prince.

88
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,958
Soon to be King, I'd bet.
You don't bet.

89
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,639
No, but these past few days
I've been speculating.

90
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:18,799
About what?

91
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,278
One of my Union comrades
has a sister,

92
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,158
works in the telegraph office
at the BSA factory.

93
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,998
She says over the past week
they've had messages

94
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,999
coming up from London to the brass -
from Winston Churchill himself.

95
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,919
Something about a robbery.

96
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,519
"A robbery of national
significance", it said.

97
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:48,399
She found the list of names
left on the telegraph machine.

98
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,599
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

99
00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:00,439
What kind of a list would have
the name of a Communist and the name
of a bookmaker side-by-side?

100
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:08,319
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

101
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,758
The only difference
between you and me, Freddie,

102
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,798
is that sometimes...

103
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,519
my horses stand a chance of winning.

104
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,878
You know, there are days
when I hear about the cuttings

105
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,639
and beatings that I really wish I'd
let you take that bullet in France.

106
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,519
Believe me, there are nights
I wish you had.

107
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:48,199
- They're going to get me!
- On three. One, two, three, down!

108
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,798
Breathe, Danny, breathe!

109
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:54,118
They're going to kill me!

110
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,238
Danny!

111
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,798
Danny! Danny, you're home.
We're all home in England.

112
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,758
You're not in France.

113
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,598
You're not an artillery shell,
Danny, you're a man. Eh?

114
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:07,798
You're not a whizz bang.
You're a human being, Danny.

115
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,678
You're all right, you're all right,
you're all right.

116
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,639
Up! Up!

117
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,239
It's all right, it's all right.

118
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:27,359
Oh, hell. Did I do it again?

119
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,719
You did it again, Danny.

120
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,399
Got to stop doing this, man.

121
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,438
- It's all right.
- Oh, God, Mr Shelby, I'm sorry...

122
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,838
It's all right. You go home
to your wife now, Danny.

123
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,798
Try and get all that smoke
and mud out of your head, eh.

124
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,519
Yes, Mr Shelby.
 I'm sorry.

125
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,159
Go on.

126
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,198
Mr Shelby, you have to do
something about him.

127
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,758
Damn right, Harry.

128
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,519
You pay the Peaky Blinders
a lot of money for protection.

129
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,838
You're the law around here now,
Tommy, aren't you?

130
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
Maybe you should put a bullet
in Danny Whizz Bang's head
like they do with mad horses.

131
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,399
Maybe you'll have to put a bullet
in my head someday, too.

132
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,839
Bring the bill to the Peaky
Blinders. We'll take care of this.

133
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,759
Look at the gun.

134
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,759
Recognise it?

135
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,518
Oof!

136
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,118
Get up off your arse,
you mumping pig!

137
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,278
Aunt Pol! What the fuck
d'you do that for?!

138
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,078
Finn was playing with this this
afternoon by the cut. It was loaded.

139
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,158
He nearly blew Ada's tits off.

140
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,998
It must've fell out of my pocket.

141
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:13,118
He said he found it on the sideboard
of the betting shop...
with bullets in it.

142
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,879
Ma... I must've been drunk.

143
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,878
When are you not drunk?

144
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,478
Look, Aunt Pol, I'm sorry.

145
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,519
I'm... I'm sorry.

146
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,518
We'll keep this between ourselves

147
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,879
if you swear not to leave guns
lying around.

148
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,878
Look, I know having four kids
without a woman is hard.

149
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,199
But my boot's harder.
Now, come on, we're late.

150
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,278
'Right,

151
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,918
'I've called this family meeting
because I've got some
very important news.'

152
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,599
Scudboat and Lovelock got back
from Belfast last night.

153
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,758
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

154
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,518
They were in a pub
on the Shankhill Road yesterday,

155
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,079
and in that pub,
there was a copper...

156
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,879
handing out these.

157
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,679
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

158
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:12,318
They're recruiting Protestant
Irishmen to come over here
as Specials.

159
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,558
- To do what?
- To clean up the city, Ada.

160
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,079
He's a Chief Inspector.

161
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,838
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

162
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,158
How do you know so bloody much?

163
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,598
Cos I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

164
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,119
And why didn't you tell me?

165
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,159
I'm telling you.

166
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,758
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

167
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,478
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA...

168
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,438
and the Austin works lately.

169
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,038
Now the papers are talking
about sedition.

170
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,958
And revolution.

171
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,118
I reckon it's Communists he's after.

172
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,078
So this copper's going to
leave us alone, right?

173
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,758
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away
from him.

174
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,958
They say Catholic men who crossed
him used to disappear in the night.

175
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,479
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.
We bloody fought for the King.

176
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:05,238
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.
We're not scared of coppers.

177
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:08,678
- He's right.
- If they come for us,
we'll cut them a smile each.

178
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,038
So, Arthur...

179
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,799
- is that it?
- What do you think, Aunt Pol?

180
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,599
This family does everything open.

181
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,278
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

182
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,399
No.

183
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,398
Nothing that's women's business.

184
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:27,638
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business
while you boys were away at war.

185
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,399
What's changed?

186
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,358
We came back.

187
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,958
And the Lord will smite the unholy
when the great judgment comes.

188
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,678
And judgment is coming, my friends.

189
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,838
Judgment is coming
to this wicked city.

190
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,438
And your wickedness and your
fornication will be revealed.

191
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:50,598
You cannot hide from the Creator.

192
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:56,918
You cannot hide from the Almighty
Himself. The Creator sees all.

193
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,678
You cannot hide
from the true and living God...

194
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,199
Get off with yer!

195
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,199
Fuck off!

196
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,759
That's it, I don't go any further.

197
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,639
I have ten minutes.
What do you want?

198
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,279
An explanation.

199
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,919
I've always been able to tell when
you're hiding something.

200
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,919
People round here talk.

201
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,758
Some of them work at the BSA.

202
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,478
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

203
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:14,639
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

204
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,318
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

205
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,438
Speak.

206
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,559
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

207
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,439
It was meant to be routine.

208
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,638
I had a buyer in London
for some... motorcycles.

209
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,799
I asked my men to steal me four
bikes with petrol engines.

210
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,238
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

211
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,959
There's a still inside the factory
makes tram-line gin.

212
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,079
They picked up the wrong
fucking crate.

213
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,158
The boys dropped it at Charlie
Strong's yard as agreed.

214
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,398
They must've taken it from
the proof bay

215
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:09,919
instead of the export bay.

216
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,598
Holy sweet baby of Mary!

217
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,798
Inside we found 25 Lewis
machine guns,

218
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,758
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

219
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,998
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

220
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,278
Jesus, Tommy!

221
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,279
All bound for Libya.

222
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,399
Sitting right there in Charlie
Strong's yard.

223
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:43,438
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

224
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,918
We put 'em in the stables,
out of the rain.

225
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,759
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

226
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,519
So that's why they sent a copper
from Belfast.

227
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,439
Maybe, maybe not.

228
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:03,198
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man,

229
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,838
you're not a fool.

230
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,439
You sell those guns to anyone who
has use to 'em, you will hang!

231
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,678
Dump them somewhere the police
can find them.

232
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,678
Maybe if they know they haven't
fallen into the wrong hands

233
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,318
this might blow over.

234
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,478
Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.

235
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:27,718
No. He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

236
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,118
Three days until it wanes.

237
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,319
Then you'll do the right thing?

238
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,558
You have your mother's common sense,
but your father's devilment.

239
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,638
I see them fighting.

240
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,519
Let your mother win.

241
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:38,558
I got tickets for the Penny Crush.
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

242
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,038
I'm not in the mood for the pictures
tonight, Ada.

243
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,478
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

244
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,198
Let's just walk a bit.

245
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,638
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

246
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:51,118
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

247
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,958
They have friends everywhere.
We'd have to walk to London.

248
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:57,638
I'm with you because you're the only
man round here not scared of them.

249
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:59,838
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

250
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,359
But you love me more than
you fear them, right?

251
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,079
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

252
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,519
- Soon, we'll tell them.
- When?

253
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,119
How did the family meeting go?

254
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,838
- Usual. There's a new copper coming.
- I heard.

255
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,678
Hmm. And Tommy says he's after
the likes of you.

256
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,038
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

257
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,318
Oh, my Ada.

258
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,798
The only princess of the royal
family of the Kingdom of Small Heath.

259
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,559
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

260
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:47,479
Give me a kiss, Princess Ada.
[SHE LAUGHS]

261
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,119
I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

262
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,398
- Are you mad? 
- Am I what?

263
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:41,238
- Do you know about this place?
- I saw it in an advertisement.

264
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,038
- Job's been filled.
- It was in yesterday's paper.

265
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,798
Believe me, love,
I'm doing you a favour.

266
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,119
I'm not asking for favours,
I'm asking for employment.

267
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:56,638
You're too... nice.

268
00:24:56,639 --> 00:25:00,158
- How would you know? 
- And too pretty.

269
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,398
They'd have you up against a wall.

270
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:05,839
I have experience and references.

271
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,678
What part of Ireland are you from?

272
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,998
- Galway.
- Ah!

273
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:16,519
I worked in Dublin.

274
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,839
Me mother was from Galway.

275
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,118
You're too pretty.

276
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,758
Watch.

277
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,639
And listen.

278
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,838
# I wish I was in Carrickfergus

279
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:42,038
# Only for nights in Ballygrand

280
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:49,318
# I would swim over
the deepest ocean

281
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:54,758
# The deepest ocean
my love to find

282
00:25:54,759 --> 00:26:00,878
# My boyhood friends
and my own relations

283
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:07,039
# Have all passed on now
like the melting snow. #

284
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:15,679
In Ireland my singing made them cry
and stopped them fighting.

285
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,519
Well, I hope you know
a lot of songs.

286
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,438
Babies...

287
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:15,919
discarded... with the fish bones
and eggshells.

288
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:22,119
Girls, 11 years old...

289
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,758
pierced and punctured by old men
for thruppence a time!

290
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,318
Rutted upon like animals!

291
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,918
Degradation.

292
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,558
Fathers with their daughters,
brothers and sisters sharing beds.

293
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,838
Beggars and thieves left to run
in the streets.

294
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,679
And astride the whole stinking
pile of wounds and rotten flesh...

295
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,998
your masters!

296
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:57,039
The men who you touch your cap to.

297
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,199
The Peaky Blinders!

298
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,078
The vicious... merciless gangs

299
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,999
who blind those that see and cut out
the tongues of those who talk.

300
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,679
You are worse than them!

301
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,278
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war,

302
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:31,319
those of you who look the other way,
you... are worse than them!

303
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,479
God damn you for soiling
your uniforms!

304
00:28:39,879 --> 00:28:47,198
And then... there are the IRA Fenians
and the Communists.

305
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,838
Blacker hearts still.

306
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:56,959
They feed on the puss of all this
corruption like maggots in a corpse.

307
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:03,158
And like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

308
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:09,118
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country
and across the world!

309
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,919
Those then... are our enemies!

310
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,918
A three-headed beast.

311
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,079
It is my job to decapitate each one
and by God I will do it!

312
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:32,759
I don't trust any of yous
until you earn my trust!

313
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,959
And that takes some earning.

314
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:44,879
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

315
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,478
Good men...

316
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,919
from God-fearing families.

317
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:58,358
By the time the sun sets, they will
be sworn in and in uniform.

318
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:02,039
And by sunrise tomorrow,
they will be on the streets.

319
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,719
God help those who stand in our way!

320
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,198
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

321
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:19,839
- Right. 
- Move out of the way for Mr Shelby.
- Mr Shelby. 
- This way.

322
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,038
You see, ladies,

323
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,599
when you're out with a Blinder,
you don't have to queue.

324
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:35,398
Right... I want a blow job
off both of you

325
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,838
before they let
the ordinary people in.

326
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,918
Away you go. Take your hat off.

327
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,638
What the fuck?!

328
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,238
Who the fuck are you?!

329
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:47,119
I'm Arthur-fucking-Shelby!

330
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,198
Arthur Shelby.

331
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:16,119
Lead pack dog of the Peaky Blinders.

332
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,399
Look at me.

333
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,599
Bastard!

334
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,518
Your uniform?

335
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,678
Terrifying, I'm sure.

336
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,239
Did he have a gun? No gun. A knife
in his sock, cosh in his belt.

337
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:14,638
Now, Mr Shelby...

338
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:19,838
I want you to see this as me
introducing myself to you.

339
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,878
Understand?

340
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:28,278
In all the world the only thing
that interests me is the truth.

341
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,239
So...

342
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,238
what do you know about the robbery?

343
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,999
What robbery?

344
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,839
I will ask you again.

345
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,638
What do you know... about
the robbery?

346
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:56,638
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

347
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,879
What fucking robbery?

348
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,359
Argh!

349
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:14,118
Aye, after 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

350
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,439
I can tell just by sniffing the
air... whether or not you're lying.

351
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,078
I'm not fucking lying!

352
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,679
All right? I'm not fucking lying!

353
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,039
I know.

354
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,479
I see nothing of interest behind
the blood in your eyes.

355
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,478
And no blood in your veins

356
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:51,719
that could carry... even a trace
of cunning or guile.

357
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,639
But understand this.

358
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:04,118
It is well within my power to have
you and the rest of your scum family

359
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:07,359
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

360
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,199
On the other hand...

361
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,279
we can help each other.

362
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,438
- Is it always this busy on a daytime?
- No. These boys are on their way
to St Andrews.

363
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:41,278
- To pray? 
- That'll be the day.
St Andrews is a football ground.

364
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,318
The Blues are playing.
That's the forward line there.

365
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:47,599
- And that's the goalie,
believe it or not.
- Hello!

366
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,118
I need a bottle of rum.

367
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,878
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

368
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,158
- A whole bottle? - Yeah.
- White or dark rum? - Don't care.

369
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,559
Right, lads, what'll it be? Two?

370
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,599
Thank you.

371
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,039
Harry said it's on the house.

372
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:12,639
Are you a whore?

373
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:18,839
Cos if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

374
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,598
He's one of them
you warned me about?

375
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,918
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl
but be careful.

376
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:34,758
If I say something's on the house,
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

377
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:39,438
If they decide that they want you,
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

378
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:43,878
Lucky for you, since he got back
from France, Tommy doesn't want
anybody at all.

379
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:45,519
Yes, lads?

380
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,838
- John, wipe the blood out of his eye.
- Since when did you give orders?

381
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,558
- I'm a trained nurse. 
- Don't make me
laugh, it hurts me face.

382
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,358
- I bloody am! 
- You went to one
first-aid class in the church hall

383
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,078
and got thrown out for giggling.

384
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,158
- Not before I learnt how to stop
somebody from choking.
- I'm not bloody choking, am I?

385
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,238
You will be when I wrap this cloth
round your neck.

386
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,518
Let me see him.

387
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,479
All right, have this.

388
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,879
Give me that.

389
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,479
You're all right.

390
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,839
He said Mr Churchill
sent him to Birmingham.

391
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,678
National interest, he said.

392
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,839
Something about a robbery.

393
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:40,158
- He said he wants us to help him.
- We don't help coppers.

394
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:43,158
He knew all about our war records.

395
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,599
He said we're patriots... like him.

396
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,039
He wants us to be his eyes and ears.

397
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:56,078
I said...

398
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,639
I said we'd have a family meeting
and take a vote.

399
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:14,039
Well, why not? Hmm? We've no truck
with Fenians or communists.

400
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:21,758
What's wrong with you?

401
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:24,558
What the fuck is wrong
with him lately?!

402
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,358
If I knew, I'd buy the cure
from Compton's Chemists.

403
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:32,398
# I am just a young girl

404
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:35,238
# I have just come over

405
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:41,158
# Over from the country
where they do things big

406
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,918
# And amongst the boys

407
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:47,638
# I've got myself a lover

408
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,958
# And since I have a lover

409
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:54,758
# I don't care a fig

410
00:37:54,759 --> 00:38:00,558
# The boy I love
is up in the gallery

411
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:06,238
# The boy I love is...
# ..looking at me

412
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,278
# Can't you see him standing there

413
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:12,278
# Waving his handkerchief

414
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:18,839
# As merry as a robin
that sings on the tree. #

415
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:29,479
We haven't had singing
in here since the war.

416
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,599
Why do you think that is, Harry?

417
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:11,919
So did Arthur say what kind of deal
this new copper offered him?

418
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,399
God! The second your balls are empty
it's back onto politics.

419
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,638
What did Tommy say?

420
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,518
He didn't say anything.
You know what he's like.

421
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:31,198
Yeah, I know what he's like.

422
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,598
He likes to take his fights
onto the mud.

423
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,478
Doesn't like to stand and wait.

424
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:38,198
You know what he'd do
if he found out about us.

425
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,718
He could try.

426
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,759
Sometimes, it's like you're with me
just to show you can.

427
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:49,199
One day me and Tommy will be
on the same side again.

428
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,159
Tommy...! Aargh.

429
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,679
Hey, what you do?
We're closed. Go home.

430
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:21,078
Go home, crazy man.

431
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,159
I said go home, crazy man!

432
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,718
I said go home.

433
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,679
Fix bayonets!!!

434
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:07,559
Secretary of State,
this is Chief Inspector Campbell.

435
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:17,078
Mr Churchill, sir, may I say what
a great honour it is to meet you.

436
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,078
Bit of a whistle stop tour.

437
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,039
- Love the hat, by the way.
- Thank you. It's beaver.

438
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:29,359
So, how are you settling in?

439
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:32,718
I have set up a command network.

440
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,278
I have agents in place
across the city

441
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,998
who will act as my eyes and ears.

442
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:43,438
And I have begun to interrogate
suspects vigorously.

443
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:49,678
You were in Belfast. I understand
you broke a few Fenian hearts.

444
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:51,278
A rat's nest, sir.

445
00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:55,798
So who do you think stole the guns?
Fenians or Communists?

446
00:43:55,799 --> 00:44:00,918
If it is IRA Fenians, I will
find them and find the guns.

447
00:44:00,919 --> 00:44:04,238
If it is Communists, I will find them
and find the guns.

448
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,558
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

449
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,639
To me there are no distinction
between any of the above.

450
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:16,678
We chose you
because you are effective.

451
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:20,398
But remember this, Mr Campbell.
This is England, not Belfast.

452
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:24,598
Bodies thrown in the rivers,
wash up in the papers here.

453
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,918
We must keep the existence of these
stolen guns out of the news

454
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:30,919
otherwise we will simply be
advertising them for sale.

455
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,799
If there are bodies to be buried,
dig holes and dig them deep.

456
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:44,519
I want everything accounted for
down to the last bullet.

457
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,678
Uncle Charlie, a word.

458
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:03,959
They are aboard. There's no moon.

459
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:08,638
We can take them out to the turning
point beyond Gas Street

460
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,638
and leave them on the bank.

461
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:13,079
They'll be found by railway men
first thing.

462
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,159
Is that agreement?

463
00:45:23,439 --> 00:45:24,879
I changed my mind.

464
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,799
You what?

465
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,479
I have an alternative strategy.

466
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:37,078
Tell Curly to take her out
to the old tobacco wharf.

467
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,878
There's a lock up mooring
we used to keep cigarettes.

468
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,958
He knows it.

469
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:45,399
When the boat leaves your yard,
it's no longer your concern.

470
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:49,479
Have you lost your fucking mind?

471
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:52,598
Have you not seen the streets?

472
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,078
They've sent a fucking army
to find these things...

473
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,078
That's right.
They've shown their hand...

474
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,438
Their hand?

475
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:02,678
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

476
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,558
That's the way of the world.

477
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,438
Fortune drops something
valuable in your lap,

478
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:10,199
you don't just dump it
on the bank of the cut.

479
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:14,678
You're blood, Tommy.

480
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:17,079
I've always looked out for you
like a dad.

481
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,399
You're going to bring holy hell
down on your head.

482
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,239
This copper takes no prisoners.

483
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:29,079
I'm told he didn't serve.

484
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,399
Reserved occupation.

485
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:37,839
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

486
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:42,398
The tobacco wharf.

487
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,039
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

488
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:17,079
Are you in position?

489
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:21,799
I am, sir.

490
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,199
Your first impressions?

491
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,359
I am quite shocked at how
these people live.

492
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:34,518
Have you found anything
out that might help me?

493
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:39,118
I interrogated the head of the Peaky
Blinders. He didn't know anything.

494
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,758
A brute.

495
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:44,478
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

496
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:46,839
It is the younger one, Thomas.

497
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,358
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

498
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,879
You sound fascinated.

499
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,118
However, my opinion has not changed.

500
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,758
The bookmaker gangs
have other business

501
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:06,519
and the Communists are too weak
to have planned this.

502
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,799
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

503
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:17,799
You must not let your personal
history cloud your judgment.

504
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,639
What history?

505
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,759
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgment.

506
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,959
If you see any guns, check the
serial numbers against that list.

507
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:48,758
Your father was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

508
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,599
I know he would be very,
very proud of you.

509
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:25,678
Danny, as you know, the man
you killed was Italian.

510
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,479
And those two men
over there are his brothers.

511
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,638
If I let the Italians do this,
Danny,

512
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,158
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

513
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:40,199
That's how those bastards do things.

514
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:44,999
So, to stop a war breaking
out between us and the Italians...

515
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:50,199
and to save you from
their barbarity...

516
00:49:52,919 --> 00:49:55,719
I said I would
dispatch you myself.

517
00:49:57,479 --> 00:49:59,279
They are here to witness.

518
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:10,158
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

519
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,879
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

520
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:18,319
You have any last requests, comrade?

521
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:27,079
You'll look out for my Rosie
and my boys?

522
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:34,919
See they get apprenticeships.
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

523
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,838
They'll make foremen.
I know they will.

524
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,559
Just ordinary...

525
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:46,639
Just ordinary men.

526
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:50,758
And they won't get told
to do this shit...

527
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:53,679
This shit... This shit
that we got told to do.

528
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,319
I suppose I ought to pray now.

529
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,879
Those fucking guns blew God
right out of my head.

530
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,919
Is that boat for me?

531
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,158
We have to get your body out
of the city, Danny.

532
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,798
This new copper, you know...

533
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,678
Don't bury me anywhere
where there's mud. OK?

534
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,319
Promise me.

535
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,559
Bury me on a hill
and tell Rosie where.

536
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,879
You were a good man
and a good soldier.

537
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,719
Yes, Sergeant Major.

538
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:23,119
In the bleak midwinter.

539
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:13,879
Where are you?

540
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,438
It bloody won!

541
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:21,879
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

542
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:25,319
Yeah. It won.

543
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:29,478
And word will spread.

544
00:53:29,479 --> 00:53:32,918
So next time we do the powder trick
it won't just be The Garrison

545
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:36,278
that'll bet on the horse,
it'll be the whole of Small Heath.

546
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,918
And you know what?
The horse will win again.

547
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:42,118
And the third time we do it

548
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,438
we'll have the whole of Birmingham
betting on it.

549
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:47,758
A thousand quid bet
on the magic horse.

550
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:52,999
And that time, when we are ready,
the horse will lose.

551
00:53:57,479 --> 00:53:59,879
Think about it.

552
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,718
You OK, Danny?

553
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,639
I'm still in shock.

554
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,798
You sure this isn't heaven?

555
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:47,199
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

556
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,758
Tommy wanted you to think
it was real

557
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:55,598
to try and knock some
sense into you.

558
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,398
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

559
00:54:58,399 --> 00:54:59,879
It was meant to.

560
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:04,958
- So where are you taking me?
- London.

561
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,199
Tommy has a little job for you.
Give you chance to say thanks.

562
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:14,919
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

563
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,519
A bad week.

564
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:34,838
There was no moon last night.
I checked.

565
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:36,638
Did you do the right thing?

566
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,879
Yes, I did the right thing.

567
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:51,160
