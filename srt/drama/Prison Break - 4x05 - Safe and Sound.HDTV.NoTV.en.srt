1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
<i>Previously on Prison Break.</i>

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,900
It was a meeting between
all six cardholders.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,000
Now we know who has
the other five cards.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,600
Your nose is bleeding.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm Cole Pfeiffer.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Welcome to Los Angeles.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,390
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,500
He was with us in Panama, and
now he's here in Los Angeles,

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,790
And he has a book that
used to belong to Whistler

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,300
And Mahone thinks this book has
a plan for the break-in.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,790
Cole Pfeiffer did not
arrive for our meeting.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,900
You don't have Scylla?

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
It seems your friend Whistler wasn't
the only one looking into Scylla.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,200
- You know anything about that?
- No.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm looking for the
man who killed my son.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,890
This man is a professional assassin.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>He's African-American, six-foot four,</i>

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
<i>About 220 pounds.</i>

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,090
We refined the images the best we could,

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,690
but we're going to need one of your
specialists to sharpen the video

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,200
so we can ID
the rest of them.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,700
All right, I'll see what I can do.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But I've seen what those tech
guys are capable of.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sometimes, it's...

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
Wait a sec, I know this guy.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,090
This guy works in my building.

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,800
- That's Griffin Oren.
- You know him?

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,890
I know of him.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,700
He's the head of treasury's L.A. bureau.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Well, if he's in your building
you can get close to him.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,290
I would need a reason. Well,
you make something up.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,990
Something about Al Qaeda
using, uh, stolen bearer bonds

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
to finance shady operations, whatever.

34
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,390
Come on, making false claims
in matters affecting government?

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
That's up to five years in prison.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Welcome to the club, Agent Self.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,790
Thanks for meeting me.

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,090
I-I would have come out to see you,

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,390
But I-I can't travel that far...

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm sorry...

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,000
But you said that you had
some pictures to show me.

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,900
That's him.

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll get in touch with
you as soon as...

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,300
As soon as I... I find out.

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,700
You didn't do this.

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
In your heart, you
are a really, good man.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,100
That's why... I married you.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,100
That's why I started
a family with you.

49
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,100
Remember when you used
to bring your files home

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,100
and I would beg you to
leave that stuff at work?

51
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,700
But when you have a
monster in your sights...

52
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,500
You can't focus until you get him.

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,200
I used to hate that about you.

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,800
Right now it's the only thing that
lets me sleep, because I know...

55
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,900
You're going to get him.

56
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,022
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

60
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
What are you doing?

61
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
Hey there, Blauney.

62
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,400
Just, uh...

63
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,900
Doing a little research.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,900
Gate-related?

65
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm adding a little flourish to my pitch.

66
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,800
Like the caged macaw who
cannot spread her wings.

67
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,200
You know, Cole...

68
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,390
I was thinking maybe you
should spend a little less time

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
Practicing and a little
more time actually pitching.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,100
I mean, number one
salesman in the world?

71
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,400
We're all just waiting with bated breath
to see what you can do around here.

72
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
<i>We saw him right here.</i>

73
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:07,260
- Hey.
- Hey!

74
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,090
You haven't seen
Sara, have you?

75
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,900
No.

76
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,300
You want to end up back in Fox
River, you just go right ahead.

77
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,590
Hey, what's going on?

78
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,590
- He wants to look for T-Bag.
- You're damn right I want to look for him.

79
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,890
We know he's got the bird book.

80
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,000
We know the bird book's got
the plan for the break-in.

81
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,900
And we saw that snake
right here today.

82
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,390
All I'm saying is, it ain't safe for a member
of The Fox River Eight to be out there looking

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
- for another member of The Fox River Eight.
- Yes, but...

84
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,890
Bellick, I want you to go with Sucre,

85
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,890
canvass the area, see if
you can get a lead on him.

86
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,590
There are like six big
buildings over there.

87
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
He could be in any one of them.

88
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,400
That's why it's called canvassing.

89
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,500
You do realize this is
the treasury department, right?

90
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,500
You tell Self to go down a few floors, walk
past the right computers and we are billionaires.

91
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,800
Just the card, please.

92
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,890
Don Self, Homeland Security.

93
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,790
- I need to see Mr. Oren right away.
- He's not available.

94
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
Ma'am, I need to see him right away, otherwise
hundreds of American lives will be in jeopardy.

95
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Don Self, Homeland Security.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
Talk to Angela down the hall.

97
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,590
Sir, I'm sorry to barge in
here, but this is urgent.

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,590
I'm sure it is.

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,290
Talk to Angela down the hall.

100
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,490
Sir, we are hearing chatter
about some stolen bearer bonds,

101
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,490
and we have reason to believe
that Al-Qaeda operatives...

102
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
You have serial numbers?

103
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
No, I do not.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,990
Mind turning around?

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,100
Not at all.

106
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
I leave for Asia in six hours.

107
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
He's got it.

108
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,200
Until then...

109
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,800
I've got meetings with the bureau chiefs
of the FBI, the CIA and Homeland Security.

110
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,100
It's gone.

111
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,900
If what you tell me is actually important,
I'll hear about it from your boss.

112
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,490
Until then...

113
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Talk to Angela down the hall.

114
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,090
And if you set foot in my office
again without my prior consent,

115
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,390
I will see to it that
you spend the rest

116
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,200
of our career running
border security in Alaska.

117
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,500
Did we get it?

118
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,300
<i>What happened?</i>

119
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
What do you mean what happened?

120
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,500
We had it for two seconds
and then it disappeared.

121
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
It's in the safe.

122
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,690
He has this crazy safe in his office.

123
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,400
That must have been
blocking the transmission.

124
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,890
I'll bet you that's
where he keeps the card.

125
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,400
So we need to get into that safe.

126
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,100
Trust me, there's no
way to crack that thing.

127
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,390
Look, I'll have the enhanced
images of the other cardholders

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
in a couple of hours.
We'll go from there.

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,400
Now you can access the
building's blueprints, right?

130
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,800
I can't go back up there.

131
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,700
No one's asking you.
We'll take care of that.

132
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,690
Come on, you'll never get
past the front door, okay?

133
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,590
Even if they don't recognize you, you
need a security card that matches--

134
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
Just get the blueprints and
get back here, all right?

135
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,100
Yeah...

136
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,500
Sara, what happened?

137
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm fine, but someone was following me.

138
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,690
I lost him about a mile back.

139
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,290
I don't think there's any way
he could have followed me here.

140
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,700
- I made sure of that.
- What'd he look like?

141
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,590
Uh, tall, black. He had a beard.

142
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,900
Is this the guy?

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

144
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Who's that?

145
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
That's the man who killed my son.

146
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,300
Now he is come to kill us.

147
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,290
Where were you the first
time that you saw him?

148
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
The very first time?

149
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,600
Walking home.

150
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
He didn't just run
into you on the street?

151
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,500
Where were you before that?

152
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,700
The Towne Lounge.

153
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Is that a bar?

154
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
Do you have a problem with that?

155
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,500
No, I just want to know
how long you were there.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,100
Sara,

157
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,390
I need to find this guy and
I can't do it without your help.

158
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,490
I don't care why or what you
were doing in the bar.

159
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,890
I just really want to know
how long you were there.

160
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Okay. A-a couple hours.

161
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you. So something must
have tipped him off.

162
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,890
You paid cash, right?

163
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,000
Of course.

164
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,100
But the credit card that
Bruce gave me is gone.

165
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,700
What credit card?

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,100
These are the security checkpoints.

167
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,000
You can't get past one of those
unless you have one of these.

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,300
Any way we can forge it?

169
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Sure, if you have two weeks and access
to the building's mainframe, maybe.

170
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,211
Well, doesn't look like there are any
security checkpoints on the tenth floor.

171
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,800
No, just that all the access
points to the tenth floor.

172
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,690
But if you could
somehow magically appear

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,690
and wind up in the middle of
the hallway, you'd be fine,

174
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,690
except for all the government
officials who'd be swarming

175
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,600
around and who would
arrest you in a heartbeat.

176
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,990
And if you can get us
into the parking structure,

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,700
will security check our van?

178
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Sure. Transporting known felons, why not?

179
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,900
The parking structure.

180
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,890
This is our point of entry.

181
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,100
We need the details to the safe.

182
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Okay, the, um, the safe
has an... insignia on it.

183
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,500
It looks something like this.

184
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,300
You're gonna need some of this.

185
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
I got a positive ID of Sara
Tancredi in Los Angeles.

186
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
That means Michael Scofield was here.

187
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,900
That means Lincoln Burrows is here. Why?

188
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,700
Sara, huh?

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
She's a slippery little bitch, isn't she?

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
Time is not on your side, Gretchen.

191
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
Maybe you hadn't noticed,

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,700
but since you seem to be somewhat
immune to physical coercion,

193
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
We've decided to move on.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,100
The nose is an evolutionary marvel.

195
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,400
Our brain has been constructed
so that certain aromas...

196
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,000
Coffee beans, blueberries that are helpful
to our body, we perceive as pleasant.

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Whereas other smells that signify death,

198
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Disease.

199
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Initial symptoms include nausea, dizziness,

200
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,100
Burning eyes, all of which you
are experiencing right now.

201
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,000
Prolonged exposure will lead to faintness,
rapid degradation of your mental faculties.

202
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,300
Tell me.

203
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,800
I don't know anything.

204
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,600
You've got one more Day.

205
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,100
Top of the line.

206
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,580
It's a biometric design,

207
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,750
and only Oren's fingerprint will open it.

208
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,580
So we lift his prints off
something he touched.

209
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,460
The pad knows what human
skin feels like.

210
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,560
If we try to trick it,
we'll set off the alarm.

211
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,690
And then there's the 12-digit key code.

212
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,710
What about the hinges?

213
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,750
Wired to the alarm.

214
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,870
We drill it.

215
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,420
Through the outer
layer of steel maybe,

216
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,340
But the bones of this thing are
three-quarters inch of cobalt alloy hard plate.

217
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,630
Drilling's not gonna work,
not in our timeframe.

218
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,300
All right, so basically,
we have a way to get you

219
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,560
into the garage, which,
in case you guys forgot,

220
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,000
that puts me on the hook
for another four charges.

221
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,120
But no way to get you
up to the tenth floor.

222
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,240
But let's say you do
get up to the tenth floor.

223
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,590
Then we need to get you into Oren's office
for an hour during the middle of the day.

224
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,060
Then, we need to hope that not one
of Oren's co-workers is gonna hear

225
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,850
The extremely loud drill that you're gonna be
using to break into a safe that I'm telling you...

226
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,400
cannot be broken into.

227
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,800
Do you understand there are homeland agents
whose sole job is to design safety measures

228
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,740
to make this structure impregnable.

229
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,060
Yeah. They had those
guys at Fox River, too.

230
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,020
Whose office is this?

231
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,340
Sam Middleton, department of justice.

232
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,900
This wall separates Middleton from Warren.

233
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,440
I'm gonna need some supplies.

234
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,020
The credit card was
used at the bar at 10:32.

235
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,370
What time did you see him?

236
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,410
About 11:00.

237
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,370
And how long were you walking at that time?

238
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,390
Ten, 15 minutes.

239
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,620
Let's assume that he was at his
place when we received the call.

240
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,050
That's an 18-minute drive...

241
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,450
from the Towne Lounge
bar in San Pedro.

242
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,470
Averaging 30 miles
an hour the whole way.

243
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,800
That's a, that's a nine-mile radius.

244
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,570
So he's gonna be somewhere
around the perimeter

245
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,480
- of that circle.
- He's got to be mobile

246
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,390
within a half mile of
a major freeway.

247
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,640
The 10, the 110, the 405.

248
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,830
No permanent address,
so we're looking for hotels, right?

249
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,410
Yeah, but nowhere where you
need to valet your car.

250
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,050
It's got to be readily
accessible at all times.

251
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,560
And somewhere that you don't need to put a
credit card down for incidentals. You got that?

252
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,900
I'll see what I can do.

253
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,430
Hurry.

254
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,130
Trishanne, I'm gonna need
a mug of tea with lemon.

255
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,850
I'm sorry, Cole. I can't
leave the desk right now.

256
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,820
Good help is so hard to find.

257
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,610
May I help you?

258
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,750
We're with Upper Valley Insurance.

259
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,440
And this man just came
into a $100,000 inheritance.

260
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,170
We can't track him down, so we're
offering a ten percent finder's fee

261
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,660
to anyone who can point
us in his direction.

262
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,700
Oh, my gosh! What, $10,000?

263
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,660
Yeah.

264
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm sorry. I don't recognize him.

265
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,890
Okay, so if you do see him,
would you please give us a call?

266
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,780
Thank you.

267
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,050
"Gate"?

268
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,080
"Greatness Achieved Through Excellence."

269
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,710
A toy?

270
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,340
You want to try to explain this?

271
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,530
Mix aluminum powder with iron oxide.

272
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,950
Add a little heat.

273
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,570
Hey. Yeah, well, thanks for
calling me back, Sam.

274
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,820
Yeah. No, I just, I know you
have these trial dates coming up

275
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,150
and we just want to make sure
you have everything you need

276
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,150
to convict these bastards.

277
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,660
Okay, that's terrific.

278
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,090
All right, I'll see you then.

279
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,700
All right,

280
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,720
We're gonna have lunch.

281
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,830
I'll keep him out of his office
for as long as I can.

282
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,410
Good luck.

283
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,170
All right.

284
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,340
- Hello.
- Hey, any sign of him?

285
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,950
No, we checked about ten
buildings, but nothing so far.

286
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,190
Well, scrap it; we're
going after the next card.

287
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,070
Meet me on the corner of
Santa Monica and Century West.

288
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,270
Hey, Charlie.

289
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,990
Yankees lost again last night.

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,980
Yeah, well, at least our fans show
up before the fifth inning, right?

291
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,100
Have a good day,
all right, Charlie?

292
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,730
You, too, Mr. Self.

293
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,980
I'm letting you guys know right now.

294
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,540
If you get busted,
don't mention my name.

295
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,650
All ready?

296
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,110
Now!

297
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,800
You lift me up.

298
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,980
So...

299
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,340
A couple of scruffy guys walk in, tell
me they're from the insurance company

300
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,750
And they offer me $10,000
if I know where you are.

301
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,330
Something tells me there's
a better offer on the table.

302
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,620
Well, I'll be, Trishanne.

303
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,990
You just caught yourself a leprechaun.

304
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,010
And as the legend goes,

305
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,460
you got yourself one wish,
anything in the world.

306
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,290
Oh, really?

307
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,140
And I am bound to grant it.

308
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,620
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

309
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,410
Well, your commencement check's
sitting on my desk, waiting to be signed.

310
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,410
That's a pretty nice pot of gold.

311
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,570
Before you say another word...

312
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,860
Now, it's true, leprechauns cannot
refuse their captor's demands,

313
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,050
But, if they deem her to
be greedy or covetous,

314
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:15,320
whatever she desires will certainly
be accompanied with disastrous tidings.

315
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,840
Or so the legend goes.

316
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,140
Three percent of your
commission from here on out.

317
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,420
Done.

318
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,140
Don Self to see you.

319
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,810
You can go right on in.

320
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,440
Thank you. Have a great day!

321
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,120
Hey, hey.

322
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,280
Hey, Sam!

323
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,960
Great to meet you.

324
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,720
Same here.

325
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,100
Oh, thanks again for squeezing
me in on such short notice.

326
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,100
I figure we had so much to get
through, this'd be the best way.

327
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,910
I-I thought we were going out for lunch.

328
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,510
Is there a problem?

329
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,770
Actually, um...

330
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,210
I'm a vegetarian.

331
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,870
It's a new diet, b-b-but there's
a great place down the street.

332
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,530
And it'll be my treat.

333
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,250
Elise.

334
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,740
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

335
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,090
I'm heading out for lunch.

336
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,630
Hold it there.

337
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,810
Sorry, I was just coming in to...

338
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,950
There's no more TP
in the ladies room.

339
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,580
We'll get right on that.

340
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,210
How about you get it right now?

341
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,590
Best we got in here.

342
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,670
You guys need to get better organized.

343
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,980
53 hotels match the search criteria.

344
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,450
You know I read, I read this
article a little while ago, right?

345
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,370
About the whole, uh,
nature versus nurture thing,

346
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,210
and it turns out, it's
all kind of a mish-mash

347
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,930
Because DNA trumps everything.

348
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,260
And I believe it, because I
mean, I grew up in the same house,

349
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,110
uh, went to the same school as my
brother, who's a Math professor,

350
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,100
My sister's a pediatrician.

351
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,950
And I'm a thief who blows
his money on hookers and coke.

352
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,330
So, like the same way Scofield's
hardwired to be a genius,

353
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,490
and you are always
gonna be a lawman, right?

354
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,550
I mean, whoever this guy is, you think
he wanted to grow up to be a murderer?

355
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,020
Probably not.

356
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,210
Be very careful choosing the next
words that come out of your mouth.

357
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,360
I... I'm just saying.

358
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,580
We are who we are.

359
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:52,376
Oh, man!

360
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,520
Jake. I'm gonna need you in front
of Room 1018. Now.

361
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,230
- What's going on?
- I apologize, ma'am,

362
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,000
but we're gonna be in your way
for the next 90 minutes or so.

363
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,170
Black?

364
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,280
Yeah.

365
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,730
Excuse me, ma'am,

366
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,110
But where can I plug in?

367
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,090
For now, you can go in there.

368
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,270
But when my boss gets back
from lunch, you're gonna...

369
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,620
The safe should be somewhere behind this wall.

370
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,130
As soon as you're through the steel,

371
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,370
I'll have the thermite ready.

372
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,240
What is it?

373
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,380
How long has it been happening?

374
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,500
It's not a big deal.

375
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,090
It was a big deal when you were 13.

376
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,370
Just promise me you won't tell Sara.

377
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,240
Sara's a doctor. She can help.

378
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,930
Look, I acclimating to the
warmer climate, all right?

379
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,820
Come on. We've got work to do.

380
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,630
Let's go.

381
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,600
I don't know what this
company is up to, but it sure

382
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,600
sounds like there's a whole
lot of money involved.

383
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,050
I don't know.

384
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,370
Lisa Tabak just hopped a
flight to Laos, didn't she?

385
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,310
Yeah, I guess.

386
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,350
And now Griffin Oren just said
he was going somewhere in Asia.

387
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,760
Down the cobalt.

388
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,740
Right.

389
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,720
What can I get you?

390
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,360
Just a moment of your time.

391
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,510
I'm a private investigator,

392
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,810
and I'm working with a
woman named Sara Tancredi,

393
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,050
and she was recently
a patron of yours.

394
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,410
I don't want to get involved.

395
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,550
She moved all the way across the
country to get away from this guy.

396
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,580
Help me find him,
before he finds her.

397
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,730
Last time, Sara had a broken jaw.

398
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,670
I was standing by the
front door when he left.

399
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,970
A second later I saw him come past,
take something out of his car.

400
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,310
Do you remember what
the car looked like?

401
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,690
Gray. A sedan, sort of like one
of those rental cars, you know?

402
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,790
You need something?

403
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,520
Just a small...

404
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,000
Kindness.

405
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,170
That's the easiest $300 you'll ever make.

406
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,070
We're working here.

407
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,460
So am I.

408
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,620
There's a stack of letters
that I need to put in the mail.

409
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,990
The chemicals, they don't
react so good with leather.

410
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,450
What are you using, lye?

411
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,620
Wait, wait, wait.

412
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,180
Listen, we...

413
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,450
We know this is a hassle.

414
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,120
<i>We know we're disrupting your
work, and giving you a headache.</i>

415
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,100
<i>We annoy a different
person every day,</i>

416
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,140
<i>But if this gets dirty
while it's still wet,</i>

417
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,120
it's gonna leave a stain,
and... and, uh, and then we'll be

418
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,640
back here all over again.

419
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,660
Why don't you just tell me where
they are and I'll get them for you?

420
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,010
On the corner of his desk,
near his computer.

421
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,050
How much longer?

422
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,550
Another couple of minutes,
and we'll be ready to copy.

423
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,460
Is Griffin in?

424
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,120
He's in a meeting right now...

425
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,120
But I can pull him out if you'd like.

426
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,220
If you could.

427
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,830
Just have a seat in his office.

428
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,870
He'll be right with you.

429
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,120
All we need is one more.

430
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,940
Someone is in there.

431
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,910
If I could hear him sitting down, there's
no way he's not gonna hear the drill.

432
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,870
You can do it manually.

433
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,230
Generate enough heat to
activate the thermite?

434
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,220
Come on, man, we're like a
16th of an inch away from this.

435
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,560
Can I help you?

436
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,280
I phoned earlier about
one of your guests.

437
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,220
Gray sedan, right?

438
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,050
Yeah, right.

439
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,860
Is that the guy?

440
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:06,780
Yeah, that's him.

441
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,150
What room?

442
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,840
He was in 130.

443
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,910
He checked out.

444
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,230
Did, um...

445
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,330
Did he leave any clue as
to where he was going?

446
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,940
Do you mind if I look at the room?

447
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,360
$19 an hour, $59 for the night.

448
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,660
Fine, whatever, give me a key.

449
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:00,710
Yes.

450
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,240
You wanted to know if
anyone came looking for you.

451
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,330
Did they?

452
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,780
No. I was just calling to let
you know my shift was ending

453
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,040
- and nobody showed up.
- All right.

454
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,850
<i>Thank you!</i>

455
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,810
What do you say you give me that
little piece of paper in your hand?

456
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,000
How's that sound, huh?

457
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,170
Sorry for keeping you.

458
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,530
To what do I owe the pleasure?

459
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,080
Just making sure you're
ready for your trip.

460
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,710
Well, I better be.
I'm leaving in five minutes.

461
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,230
All right, and if we dial it down to
the lowest setting, that might work.

462
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,410
- Sure?
- We don't have a choice.

463
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,440
I'll tell you when.

464
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,700
The finance minister's anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

465
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,790
Well, if you recall, I
successfully negotiated

466
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,040
financial policies with
the IMF and World Bank.

467
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,040
Pretty sure I can handle Laos.

468
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,070
Now.

469
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm well aware of
your resume, Griffin.

470
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,590
Got it.

471
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:27,190
We're in.

472
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,562
Got it.

473
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:32,020
<i>The runaway inflation in Laos
has given way to food riots</i>

474
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,220
in the capital city of Vientiane,

475
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,940
where the death toll
has risen over 200.

476
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,880
<i>The monetary policy
is a means to an end.</i>

477
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,510
<i>I'm aware of our final
objective, General.</i>

478
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,580
This is an important day for us.

479
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,690
I need to make sure that
everyone knows his role.

480
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,450
You could've told me all of
this on the telephone.

481
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,360
<i>Why did you take today of all
days to come down here</i>

482
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,860
<i>and berate me in person?</i>

483
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,790
Things have happened in the past few days

484
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,360
That have made me somewhat uneasy.

485
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,330
<i>Today we got confirmation that one
of our targets is in Los Angeles.</i>

486
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,751
<i>That... on top of the fact,</i>

487
00:35:28,263 --> 00:35:30,391
That one of Lisa's bodyguards was killed.

488
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,050
I thought that was because
she was married to that Turk.

489
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,520
That's the official story.

490
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,010
What is it then?

491
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,150
Come on, come on.

492
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,040
Do you have your
card on you, Griffin?

493
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:44,780
Of course.

494
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,170
I'd like to see it.

495
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,270
Where are we?

496
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,660
Talk to me, Roland.

497
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,910
72%.

498
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,667
<i>I put it in my safe this morning.</i>

499
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,241
I'd like to see it.

500
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,780
86.

501
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,100
87.

502
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,690
92.

503
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,560
15 years of working together,
you think you'd trust me.

504
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,420
Don't turn this into an opera.

505
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,790
Just hand me the card.

506
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,120
Come on, come on.

507
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,840
Happy?

508
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,770
From now on, I'm asking that
everyone keep their card on them...

509
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,900
At all times.

510
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,130
Anyone makes a move,

511
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,310
anything goes missing, you call me.

512
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,690
Did we get it?

513
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,670
- 100.
- Yeah.

514
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,780
I don't know how you
eat that crap, Don.

515
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,670
- What was that called? Tempeh?
- Yeah.

516
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,440
It looked like you could
barely choke it down.

517
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,280
Yeah, well, it's an acquired taste.

518
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,530
Excuse us.

519
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,430
All right, well, it looks like
I should be getting back to work.

520
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,730
Oh. This was a pleasure.

521
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,580
Apparently, billions in counterfeit
currency flooded the economy,

522
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,920
which is what caused it all.

523
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,300
What I don't understand is why?

524
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,570
I mean, so far all the cardholders have
been experts in their fields, right?

525
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,780
In-in energy, and logistics,

526
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,780
and finance.

527
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,605
I mean, it looks like they're just
trying to tear the country down.

528
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,944
So they can profit by rebuilding it.

529
00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:16,340
So for the rest of us, what's next?

530
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,050
I was at a bar earlier.

531
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,650
And nothing happened, and I didn't drink.

532
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,470
But... look, if-if this
is too much for you--

533
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,420
No. No.

534
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,570
Because, say the word,
and we'll scrap the whole thing.

535
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,920
- That's a promise.
- It's not going to happen again.

536
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,370
But it would be a lie,
not to tell you, and I...

537
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,900
Want you to know that
I'll never lie to you.

538
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,890
I'm sorry.

539
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,340
Somebody's here for you.

540
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,850
For me?

541
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,170
Cole Pfeiffer.

542
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,180
Is your name Xing?

543
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,020
Mr. Xing stayed behind in New York.

544
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,850
Well, have a seat then, uh--

545
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:24,670
What can I help you with?

546
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,950
You were supposed to deliver
the item two days ago.

547
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,730
Where is it?

548
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,130
Where's what?

549
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,360
I've traveled a long way,
Mr. Pfeiffer.

550
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
My patience is wearing thin.

551
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,530
Playing games is not going to
be good for either of us.

552
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,290
Scylla. Where is it?

553
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,200
- Mr. Pfeiffer?
- I'm at work.

554
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,480
It's not exactly like I
can talk freely, you know.

555
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,210
Just-just tell me the latest.

556
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,090
The latest?

557
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,380
If you deliver it to me
by the end of the day,

558
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,180
I will pay you the sum
that we agreed upon.

559
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,800
As much as I'd like to tell
you that were possible--

560
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,990
Get it to me by tomorrow and
you will receive 50% of your fee.

561
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,640
Two days, 25%.

562
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,690
Three days,

563
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,500
I shoot you through the brain.

564
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,550
That, is the latest.

565
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,290
No problem.

566
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,990
I thought that urine might be
getting a little stale.

567
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,800
So I brought you some more.

568
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,620
Hey, the image enhancement from
the video came back.

569
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,780
Did you get what I sent over?

570
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,330
Yea, we got all three cardholders?

571
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,580
Yeah, well, for the first two,
we have names, addresses...

572
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,290
Everything we need to grab them.

573
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,290
Sara.

574
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,580
But for the General,
we got nothing.

575
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,800
This guy's a ghost.

576
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,050
You all right?

577
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,490
Look, most of what happened
to me in Panama is a total blank.

578
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,090
But, um, when I was
being held, I could hear

579
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,740
Gretchen talking on the
phone on the next room.

580
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,860
And she was taking orders
from the guy in charge.

581
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:24,300
And she called him the General.

582
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,430
In charge of the mission?

583
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
No, I think in charge of the Company.

584
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,910
I told you...

585
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,830
We should have killed Gretchen
when we had the chance.

586
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,050
She'll come home.

587
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,850
She always has.

588
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,760
You better be sure about that.

589
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,060
Excuse me, sir?

590
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,160
What?

591
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,070
Someone at Homeland Security did an
enhanced image search on you today.

592
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,630
We couldn't tell where
the original picture--

593
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,390
Who?

594
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,360
The guy who ordered it...

595
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,130
His name is Don Self.



9999
