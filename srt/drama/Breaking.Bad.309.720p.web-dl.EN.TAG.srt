6

22
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:49,260
{\pos(192,225)}Better over than under.

23
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,284
{\pos(192,225)}Over by a pound and a half.

24
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,859
{\pos(192,225)}I thought you were all,
like, precise.

25
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,556
{\pos(192,225)}Whatever. We'll just save
it out till next week.

26
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,971
{\pos(192,225)}No. We ship it as-is.

00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,495
{\pos(192,225)}What are we, running a charity?

28
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,738
{\pos(192,225)}Come on, man,
we're gonna take it out.

29
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:06,132
{\pos(192,225)}Leave it.

30
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:07,520
{\pos(192,225)}One batch, one ship.

31
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,438
{\pos(192,225)}Stop complicating things.

32
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,847
{\pos(192,225)}Why are you purposely
giving him free meth?

33
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,333
{\pos(192,225)}These bitches are bleeding
us enough already.

34
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:25,851
{\pos(192,210)}You are paid extraordinarily well.

35
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,987
{\pos(192,210)}Why can't you just appreciate that?

36
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:30,201
{\pos(192,225)}I been crunching numbers, all right?

37
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,686
{\pos(192,225)}- You've been crunching numbers?
- I've been crunching numbers,

38
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,799
{\pos(192,225)}and I don't gotta be a
mathematician to figure out

39
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,388
{\pos(192,225)}that this deal you made is bullshit.

40
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:39,706
{\pos(192,225)}- We both earn...
- I know...

41
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,215
{\pos(192,225)}a million and a half each.

42
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:43,951
{\pos(192,225)}Whoop-de-doo.

43
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:45,704
{\pos(192,225)}What's he getting?

44
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:49,842
{\pos(192,225)}Say he's wholesaling

45
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:51,844
{\pos(192,225)}at 40 large a pound.

46
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,235
That's probably high.

47
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,492
{\pos(192,210)}High. What, for our stuff?

48
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:57,224
{\pos(192,210)}That's what I was getting.

49
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,518
{\pos(192,210)}Look, say he's getting 40 a pound.

50
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,822
All right? 200 pounds a
week for three months.

51
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,369
And, like, what happens at
the end of the three months?

52
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,126
Look, what... whatever.

53
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:09,228
200 pounds a week for three months.

54
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:11,167
That's 2400 pounds.

55
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,534
2400 times 40,000 is...

56
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,502
and I swear to God, I double-checked
this, like, 10 times...

57
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,077
96 million dollars.

58
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:22,224
96 million dollars.

59
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,369
All right? 96 million.

60
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,385
96 to our three.

61
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,785
That is messed up, yo.

62
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,568
That is so messed up.

63
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,315
Fairness-wise, I can't even...

64
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,584
{\pos(192,210)}You are now a millionaire,

65
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,947
{\pos(192,210)}and you're complaining?

66
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,167
{\pos(192,210)}What world do you live in?

67
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:47,800
One where the dudes who are
actually doing all the work

68
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,468
ain't getting fisted.

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,918
What is going on with you lately?

70
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,693
{\pos(192,190)}What's happened to you?

71
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:56,129
{\pos(192,190)}Hang on, can't we just...

72
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:59,176
{\pos(192,210)}We got to hash this out.

73
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,743
{\pos(192,210)}What's more important than money?

74
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,688
These things they
laughingly call pillows,

75
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:12,691
I would not give them
to prison inmates.

76
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,246
You want me to go ask for another?

77
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,066
Just remind me to
bring his from home.

78
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,741
They're not moving his legs enough.

79
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
Everybody.

80
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:28,240
{\pos(192,210)}Hi, Marie.

81
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,615
{\pos(192,210)}Is it okay if...

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,150
{\pos(192,210)}if I visit?

83
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,089
{\pos(192,210)}His color looks good.

84
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,149
Gomie, is that you?

85
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,070
Buddy. It's me.

86
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,379
That's you, Gomie?

87
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:03,482
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

88
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,836
Come here. Closer.

89
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,478
What is it?

90
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Closer.

91
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:17,168
Asshole.

92
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:21,800
Man, he got you good.

93
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:26,874
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

94
00:06:35,413 --> 00:06:37,200
{\pos(192,210)}Check this out.

95
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,239
I got something that'll
make you feel better.

96
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:42,715
I've been keeping an eye
on that blue meth of yours.

97
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,653
Six, seven weeks, nothing.

98
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:47,920
Then all of a sudden, boom.
It's popping up everywhere.

99
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,326
Look at the new locations.
Texas,

100
00:06:51,164 --> 00:06:52,215
Nevada,

101
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:53,792
up in Farmington.

102
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,394
Even right here in town.

103
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:59,031
A teener here and there,
strictly street-level amounts.

104
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:00,899
Man, it's crazy.

105
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,624
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

106
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:07,611
Because you were right.

107
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:09,719
You're the only one
that saw this coming.

108
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:11,180
Three cheers for me.

109
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,982
This thing doesn't
do a damned thing.

110
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:19,985
Hank, it's probably
still on lock-out.

111
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,398
It's been an hour, right?

112
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

113
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:27,747
{\pos(192,210)}Okay. I'll go find somebody.

114
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,951
No more shop talk.

115
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,076
Sorry.

116
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:39,564
{\pos(192,170)}I didn't see it coming.

117
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,106
What?

118
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,681
{\pos(192,210)}Damn right you did.

119
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,276
{\pos(192,210)}No, I didn't see shit.

120
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:49,142
Day late and a dollar short,
as usual.

121
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,742
The only reason I'm...

122
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,999
even breathing...

123
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:00,285
is I got a warning call.

124
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,963
A warning call? What do you mean?

125
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,843
One minute before they

126
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:08,951
attacked me,

127
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,198
somebody called my cell

128
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:13,972
and told me to expect it.

129
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:16,597
A voice scrambler.
It could have been anybody.

130
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,645
Marie's got my phone somewhere,

131
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,472
if you want to run the incoming.

132
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,421
Not that you're going to
learn anything worth knowing.

133
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,992
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

134
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:31,171
Who would have called to warn you?

135
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,358
I don't know.

136
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:35,692
Jesus.

137
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:37,713
Come on already.

138
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:24,021
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

139
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:30,325
Are we safe?

140
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,456
Yes.

141
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:46,506
Are you safe?

142
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,608
Absolutely.

143
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,335
What about you?

144
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,708
Face looks better.

145
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,758
How's it all going?
Anything you want to tell us about?

146
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:38,035
What, like my interesting life?

147
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:42,022
One day pretty much
bleeds into the next.

148
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:45,478
Been working a lot.

149
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:47,695
I got a job.

150
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,178
Job is good.

151
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:51,848
It's in a Laundromat.

152
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:54,094
- It's totally corporate.
- Corporate Laundromat.

153
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,823
It's, like, rigid.
All kinds of red tape.

154
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,582
My boss is a dick.
The owner? Super dick.

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm not worthy or whatever to meet him,
but I guess everybody's scared of him{\the dude}.

156
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,766
The place is full of
dead-eyed douche-bags,

157
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,164
the hours suck,

158
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,033
and nobody knows what's going on,

159
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:11,158
so...

160
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,554
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

161
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:19,882
Totally Kafkaesque.

162
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,105
Majorly.

163
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,016
From the U.S. attorney in Santa Fe.

164
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:32,275
Very nice.

165
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,630
We've got all these nice
tulips and baby's breath.

166
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:39,935
This is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

167
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,998
Look at these Hank.
Aren't they beautiful?

168
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:45,168
- Beautiful.
- Look at the size of this basket.

169
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,670
It's got so many goodies in it.

170
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:49,338
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels

171
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,441
and cheese sticks

172
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:54,096
and some some fancy designer olives.

173
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,769
You had me at cheese sticks.

174
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,872
You're going to have
to fight me for those, Hank.

175
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:00,616
"Get well, and best
wishes from Ted Beneke

176
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,055
and all the folks at
Beneke Fabricators."

177
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:05,878
He gives you all this time off,

178
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,124
and now this?
Get me a job there.

179
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,625
I know. He's great.

180
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,771
Boss hall of fame.

181
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,909
I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

182
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,904
They're going to have
to get on the stick.

183
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,634
How's everybody doing today?

184
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,780
Good. We're good.

185
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,137
How are you?

186
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,492
I'm very good.

187
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,976
Just going to do a quick
peripheral response, all right?

188
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,451
See where we're at.
Moment of truth?

189
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:32,001
Yeah. I wouldn't call it that.

190
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:34,522
All right, let's just
take a look here.

191
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:37,444
All right.

192
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,969
All right, I want you to
tell me if you can feel this.

193
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:48,143
All right.

194
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,652
How about this?

195
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:54,733
Okay.

196
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,842
How about now?

197
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,966
Do that one again, would you?

198
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:04,116
Right there?

199
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:08,092
Yeah, yeah, I feel it. A tingle.

200
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:09,919
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,

201
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:13,000
ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

202
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:14,420
I don't know.

203
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,293
A four?

204
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,501
Four. Okay.

205
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,204
And how about...

206
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:24,366
there?

207
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:27,247
A six.

208
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,567
Okay, good.

209
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:29,692
And...

210
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,318
here?

211
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,368
Yeah, still there. A little less.

212
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:38,567
A three. Okay.

213
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,298
All right, good.

214
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,619
Thank you very much, Hank.
Good, good.

215
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:46,364
So this is good news, right?

216
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:48,786
Definitely.

217
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,242
It looks like some

218
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,041
nerve function is returning.

219
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:55,849
Oh, thank God.

220
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:59,324
All right, so when do we
get him walking again?

221
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,577
It's important that
we manage our expectations.

222
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,367
We're talking about
months of very hard work,

223
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:16,522
and even then the odds,
they're not great.

224
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:18,624
But you can't know for sure.

225
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,652
When does he start physical therapy?

226
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,186
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

227
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,595
It's high priority.

228
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,118
We should have pre-authorization
the next few days.

229
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,829
Certainly by early next week.

230
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,070
Next week?

231
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,206
No, that's not going to do it.

232
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,625
I've looked into this.

233
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,507
The sooner physical therapy begins,

234
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:40,276
the better his chances are.

235
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,993
He needs daily sessions.

236
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:43,299
Isn't that right?

237
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:44,584
Actually,

238
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,573
your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

239
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:48,971
Actually,

240
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:51,364
she asked the doctor.

241
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:56,772
Plan-wise, four sessions
a week is fairly typical.

242
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,216
And the therapists in your
network are mostly fine.

243
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,694
Mostly fine? Okay.
There's a ringing endorsement.

244
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,001
Look, if Hank had
more physical therapy,

245
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:10,878
with better therapists,

246
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,497
wouldn't it be more
likely he would walk?

247
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:18,487
It's very hard to say, Marie.

248
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,547
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

249
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:26,129
Is it absolutely optimal?

250
00:15:26,863 --> 00:15:28,613
You know, screw it.

251
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:33,307
{\I'm going to}I'll make sure he gets what he needs,
and they can{\just} reimburse me later.

252
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:36,464
Mrs. Schrader, I get your
frustration. Really, I do.

253
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:39,802
But my best advice is
stay in the network.

254
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:41,107
Don't go out of pocket.

255
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,300
Physical therapy is
just the beginning.

256
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,768
We're talking nursing care,

257
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,276
modifications to your home,

258
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:49,945
occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

259
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,384
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

260
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:54,567
So what?

261
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,540
We're just supposed to
compromise on his care?

262
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:01,223
Well, if you don't follow the
insurance company's procedures,

263
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:02,753
they may never pay you back.

264
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,894
I've seen patients and
their families go bankrupt,

265
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:06,769
waiting to be reimbursed.

266
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:10,428
Who is the best physical
therapist that you know?

267
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,902
I can give you some names.

268
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:15,237
But they're not likely
to be on your plan.

269
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,559
To hell with the plan.

270
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,052
There he is.

271
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:39,541
Finally. I went ahead
and started without you.

272
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:42,752
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

273
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,910
Kick off your shoes.
Lay back.

274
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,019
Exfoliate.

275
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:47,507
Maybe later.

276
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,907
So, where's the maestro?
Out parking the mini-van?

277
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,430
What do I look like, his shadow?
Who cares where he's at?

278
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,105
What am I doing here?

279
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,238
I was going to
have you two flip a coin,

280
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,812
but since the genius
can't be bothered,

281
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:02,932
today's your lucky day.

282
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,191
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

283
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:06,705
What?

284
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:09,806
This?

285
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:13,072
Yeah. You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

286
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,159
For free?

287
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,042
Free? Ladies, cover your ears.

288
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,332
Not free.

289
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:22,687
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,

290
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:25,239
highly profitable,
at least potentially...

291
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:28,870
local institution, looked upon with
favor by the Chamber of Commerce.

292
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,383
Better Business Bureau.

293
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,965
At $312,000, it's a steal.

294
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:34,787
312,000?

295
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,491
Don't you get it?

296
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:39,642
On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

297
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,069
On the inside,

298
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,033
it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

299
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:47,859
Wait.

300
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,027
Wait.

301
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,438
Ladies, thank you.

302
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:52,780
Thank you. Good job.
Come back here.

303
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:55,388
Sit. Come on.

304
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:58,873
Humor me here for a second.

305
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:02,591
Now, you know you need to
launder your money, right?

306
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,003
Do you understand the basics of it?
Placement, layering, integration?

307
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:10,178
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

308
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,008
You want to stay out of jail,
don't you?

309
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,542
You want to keep your
money and your freedom.

310
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:17,646
Because I got three little
letters for you. IRS.

311
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:20,058
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

312
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,315
Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

313
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:28,215
Here's your cash.
You're out on the town.

314
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,988
You're partying hearty. You're
knocking boots with the chickie babes.

315
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,636
Who's this?

316
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:34,822
It's the tax man.

317
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,611
And he's looking at you.

318
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,086
What does he see?

319
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:40,707
He sees a young fellow with a big,
fancy house,

320
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,701
unlimited cash supply, and no job.

321
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:46,646
Now what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

322
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,127
I'm a drug dealer.

323
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:50,338
Wrong.

324
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:51,983
Million times worse.

325
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:53,786
You're a tax cheat.

326
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:56,512
What do they do?
They take every penny,

327
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:59,806
and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

328
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:02,222
Ouch. What was your mistake?

329
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,822
You didn't launder your money.

330
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,442
Now, you give me your money.
That's called placement.

331
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:11,463
Hand me that little thinGod bin.

332
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,196
This is the nail salon, right?

333
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:17,178
I take your dirty money

334
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:21,268
and I slip it into the salon's nice,
clean cash flow.

335
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,231
That's called layering.

336
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:24,956
Final step, integration.

337
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,334
The revenues from the
salon go to the owner.

338
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:32,193
That's you. Your filthy drug
money has been transformed

339
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:34,943
into nice, clean, taxable income,

340
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,988
brought to you by a savvy
investment in a thriving business.

341
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:44,294
So you want me to buy this
place so I can pay taxes.

342
00:19:45,054 --> 00:19:46,394
I'm a criminal.

343
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,582
And if you want to stay a criminal

344
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:52,108
and not become, say, a convict,

345
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:54,836
then maybe you should grow
up and listen to your lawyer.

346
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:58,243
Right, so you can get your 5%.

347
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:00,093
No, that's 17%.

348
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,080
I heard you say 5.

349
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,092
You said it right in front of me.

350
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:07,290
That was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

351
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,925
But for you, it's the usual.
17%, and that's a bargain.

352
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,087
Hey, what, you... Hey, listen to...

353
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,237
Come on, I'm talking to you
about your future here.

354
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:18,259
Listen to reason.

355
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,386
How is your brother-in-law?

356
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:04,893
He'll live.

357
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:07,423
Good.

358
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,314
I'm glad.

359
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,242
Walter, you seem troubled.

360
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:17,071
How can I help you?

361
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:22,198
I asked to see you in order to...

362
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,363
clear the air.

363
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,857
There are some

364
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:30,703
issues

365
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:34,849
that could cause a misunderstanding
between us,

366
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,798
and I think it's in our

367
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:39,206
best interest

368
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,147
to lay the cards on the table.

369
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,817
That's the best way to do business.

370
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:50,621
My brother-in-law,

371
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,123
moments before he was attacked...

372
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,209
someone called to warn him.

373
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,556
I believe that same
person was protecting me.

374
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:03,902
Those two men,

375
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,855
the assassins...

376
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,086
I believe I was their prime target,

377
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,140
but that somehow they
were steered away from me

378
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,330
to my brother-in-law.

379
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:22,062
Because of this intervention,

380
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:24,873
I am alive.

381
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:27,225
And yet

382
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:29,942
I think that this person

383
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,694
was playing a much deeper game.

384
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:39,738
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout,

385
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,553
not a silent assassination.

386
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:45,087
In one stroke,

387
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,666
he bloodied both sides,

388
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:52,060
set the American
and Mexican governments

389
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,635
against the cartel,

390
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:57,836
and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

391
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:04,599
If this man
had his own source of product

392
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:07,011
on this side of the border...

393
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:11,742
he would have the market to himself.

394
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:16,263
The rewards would be...

395
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:18,844
enormous.

396
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:29,116
We're both adults.

397
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,727
I can't pretend I don't
know that person is you.

398
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,458
I want there to be no confusion.

399
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,804
I know I owe you my life.

400
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,145
And more than that,

401
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,657
I respect the strategy.

402
00:23:58,547 --> 00:23:59,897
In your position,

403
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:03,528
I would've done the same.

404
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:11,832
One issue

405
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,682
which troubles me...

406
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,696
I don't know what happens

407
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,374
when our three-month contract ends.

408
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:26,543
What would you like to happen?

409
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:30,082
You know why I do this.

410
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:34,081
I want security for my family.

411
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:36,434
Then you have it.

412
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:38,545
Three million for three months.

413
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,123
That was our agreement.

414
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,980
Extended annually,

415
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:44,121
twelve million a year.

416
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,575
Call it fifteen.

417
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:49,515
Open-ended.

418
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,366
Would that be agreeable?

419
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,548
Part of the reason we talk about
what gets us riled up,

420
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:41,187
in our daily lives

421
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:45,316
is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be,

422
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,420
head off our disease
before it comes back.

423
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:53,763
Anyone?

424
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:59,170
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

425
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:05,416
Jesse, last time you seemed pretty down
about your job at the Laundromat.

426
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:09,588
Let me ask you something. If you had
the chance to do anything you wanted,

427
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,340
what would you do?

428
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:14,240
Make more green, man, a lot more.

429
00:27:14,697 --> 00:27:17,697
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

430
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:24,382
I don't know.

431
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:29,352
I guess I would make something.

432
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,489
Like what?

433
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,125
Not that it even matters, but...

434
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:41,553
work with my hands, I guess.

435
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:43,679
Building things, like...

436
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:47,278
carpentry or brick laying
or something?

437
00:27:47,864 --> 00:27:51,584
I took this vo-tech class
in high school,

438
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,440
wood working.

439
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:56,843
I took a lot of vo-tech classes
because it was just a big jerk-off,

440
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:01,057
but this one time I had this teacher

441
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,382
name of...

442
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:06,293
Mr. Pike.

443
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:12,312
I guess he was, like, a Marine
or something before he got old.

444
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:13,610
He was hard of hearing.

445
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:16,557
My project

446
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:19,800
for his class was to make this

447
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,340
wooden box,

448
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:25,782
you know, like a small...

449
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,797
just like a... like a box,

450
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,722
you know, to put stuff in.

451
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,706
So I wanted to get the thing done
just as fast as possible.

452
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:38,349
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester,

453
00:28:38,474 --> 00:28:40,452
and he couldn't flunk me
as long as I,

454
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:43,379
you know, made the thing.

455
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,464
So I finished it in a couple days.

456
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:51,638
It looked pretty lame,
but it worked,

457
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,413
you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

458
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:59,223
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike

459
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:01,779
for my grade,

460
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,544
he looked at it and said,

461
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,630
"Is that the best you can do?"

462
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:14,049
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell, yeah, bitch.

463
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:16,317
"Now give me a D and shut up

464
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,177
"so I can go blaze one
with my boys."

465
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,097
I don't know.

466
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:27,883
Maybe it was the way
he said it, but...

467
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:31,561
it was, like...
He wasn't exactly saying it sucked.

468
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,736
He was just asking me honestly,

469
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:36,654
"Is that all you got?"

470
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:41,043
And for some reason
I thought to myself,

471
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,937
"Yeah, man, I can do better",

472
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,220
so I started from scratch.

473
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:48,469
I made another,

474
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:49,842
then another,

475
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:53,954
and by the end of the semester,
by, like, box number five,

476
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:56,515
I had built this thing.

477
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:01,673
You should've seen it.
It was insane.

478
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,456
I built it out of Peruvian Walnut

479
00:30:05,581 --> 00:30:08,197
with inlaid Zebrawood.

480
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:10,730
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

481
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:14,647
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

482
00:30:15,076 --> 00:30:18,234
Then I rubbed all the wood
with tung oil so it was...

483
00:30:18,815 --> 00:30:20,015
rich and dark.

484
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:22,504
It even smelled good.

485
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,447
You know, you put your nose in it

486
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,951
and breathed in, it was...

487
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,828
It was perfect.

488
00:30:32,657 --> 00:30:34,407
What happened to the box?

489
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:40,768
I gave it to my mom.

490
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
Nice.

491
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:47,764
You know what I'm going to say,
don't you?

492
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:49,686
It's never too late.

493
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,437
They have art co-ops
that offer classes,

494
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,293
adult extension program
at the university.

495
00:30:57,418 --> 00:31:00,542
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

496
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:05,922
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

497
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:17,365
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

498
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,313
They'll say
they're not denying coverage.

499
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:20,927
No, I'm agreeing with you,

500
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:23,502
but I went through all this
with Walt.

501
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:27,189
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

502
00:31:27,314 --> 00:31:28,964
You two managed, right?

503
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,641
You said yourself
that Elliot and Gretchen's money

504
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:33,804
didn't cover everything.

505
00:31:36,012 --> 00:31:37,225
I've got to get back.

506
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,234
What? No.

507
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,391
No, you should rest.

508
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,507
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath

509
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:46,284
I put some fresh sheets on the bed.

510
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:48,241
I want to be there
in case he wakes up.

511
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:51,095
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

512
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,584
What are you doing here?

513
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,254
I just thought I'd stop by
to see how you're holding up.

514
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,172
Is this a bad time, or...

515
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:09,046
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

516
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:10,763
Oh, you're Ted.

517
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,322
I've heard so much about you.

518
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,476
Thank you for your gift basket.
That was really thoughtful.

519
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,698
- It was really nice. Thank you.
- Cheese sticks.

520
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:20,773
You're welcome.

521
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,553
We care about Skyler so much

522
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,914
that naturally
that extends to the whole family.

523
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,177
Are you coming in?

524
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,192
Yeah, you should.
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,617
Come on in, Ted.

526
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:37,320
We were just having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

527
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:38,656
No, thanks.

528
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,416
I'm just on my way home.

529
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,875
- I just thought I'd...
- You know, I...

530
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:46,515
I am really beat.
I think I'm going to take that bath.

531
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,010
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

532
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,097
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
{\Please }Give my best wishes to your husband.

533
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:54,842
I will.

534
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:01,522
Thanks for stopping by,

535
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,165
but it's actually not a...

536
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,222
not the best time for a visit, so...

537
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:09,843
Can we just talk for a minute?

538
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:12,948
I know you need to be
with your family, but...

539
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,245
I haven't heard from you in days

540
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,269
- I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

541
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,124
You gave me all that time off,
and I{\ really should've}...

542
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,792
That's not my point.

543
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,420
I care about you. That's all.

544
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:29,451
It's just this whole thing with Hank
has been one non-stop horror show,

545
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:30,826
you know, so...

546
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,390
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

547
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:37,946
Thank you.

548
00:33:39,788 --> 00:33:43,361
But I really do need you to...

549
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:53,074
Skyler, I've got to say
your sister seeing me here...

550
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,199
I mean...

551
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:55,827
So what?

552
00:33:56,946 --> 00:33:59,111
I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

553
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:01,207
Let's talk about it later, okay?

554
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,807
Is there some reason for secrecy
I'm not getting? Because...

555
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:04,919
Not now.

556
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,907
- Just tell me...
- You really want to do this now?

557
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:10,383
Are you really going
to make me do this right now?

558
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,109
Yeah, you're right.

559
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,924
Bad idea to come here.

560
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:28,822
I'll see you in a day or two.

561
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:31,237
Back at the office.

562
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,719
Take as much time as you want.

563
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:45,383
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

564
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,717
Must've been, like...

565
00:34:47,848 --> 00:34:48,984
depressing.

566
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:51,303
For real. That's a stone loss.

567
00:34:51,953 --> 00:34:53,953
No one misses it more than me.

568
00:34:54,078 --> 00:34:56,736
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

569
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,515
No quotas, no one to answer to.

570
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,145
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you've got responsibilities?

571
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:07,849
Darth Vader had responsibilities.

572
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,616
He was responsible
for the Death Star.

573
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,791
True that. Two of them bitches.

574
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,355
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

575
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,665
I've got to pay taxes now?
What the hell{\'s up with that}?

576
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,120
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

577
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,052
- Church.
- Right.

578
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,413
Let's kick it back into gear.

579
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:31,339
Let's start slinging again.

580
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:38,212
Let's do it.
Life's too short. That's what I say.

581
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:39,930
Hell, yeah{\, bitches}. We don't need no RV.

582
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,018
Alls we need is a bicycle,

583
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:44,894
- some Drano, soda bottles...
- Nah, no shake 'n bake.

584
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,979
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

585
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:49,574
Maybe it ain't top shelf,
but we could at least move it.

586
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:52,234
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

587
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:54,282
Who says we sell on the street?

588
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,892
Maybe I know a whole new market.

589
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:59,321
Maybe alls we need is the meth.

590
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:36,862
What's the yield?

591
00:36:41,211 --> 00:36:42,661
The yield. Come on.

592
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:46,706
201.8.

593
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,684
{\pub}I see a couple new faces.

594
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:09,682
Anybody want to introduce
themselves?

595
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,120
Don't all speak at once.

596
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:26,334
My name's Brandon.

597
00:37:29,273 --> 00:37:31,554
You want to tell us something
about yourself?

598
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:34,148
Why I'm here...

599
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,524
it's just one thing.

600
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
It's meth.

601
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:44,117
It's bad.

602
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,896
Thought I had it kicked
a couple times, you know,

603
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:51,980
but then... Jesus.

604
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:56,117
This new version of it
hit the streets and...

605
00:37:57,983 --> 00:37:59,483
Not that blue stuff.

606
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,583
Sorry, I didn't raise my hand.

607
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:04,534
Go ahead.

608
00:38:04,702 --> 00:38:05,849
This is what we do.

609
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:07,974
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

610
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:10,582
You had it, too.

611
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,750
Yeah, bro.

612
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,439
I wish I never even heard of it.

613
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:17,561
It was like lighting
my whole head on fire.

614
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:20,430
Stuff will burn you down.

615
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,751
Only reason I have a hope in hell

616
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,029
is because it's long gone.

617
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:27,437
That's the shame of it.

618
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,562
- Don't tell me that.
- I hear it's back in town.

619
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,152
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

620
00:38:40,177 --> 00:38:41,627
It's gonna be okay.

621
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:59,214
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

622
00:38:59,382 --> 00:39:01,928
I will go to <i>48 Hours.</i>
I will go to <i>Nightline.</i>

623
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:04,276
{\I don't even know if there is a Nightline anymore. It doesn't matter.}Maybe <i>Nightline</i> doesn't exist anymore.
It doesn't matter.

624
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:07,021
They will all take it,
and they will run with it

625
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:08,569
because he is a hero,

626
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:12,229
and he is not going to be
in a wheelchair at 43.

627
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:24,725
I know
Skyler's already told you this,

628
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:27,938
but if there's every
anything that you need,

629
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:29,411
anything at all...

630
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,114
It's good to have you here.

631
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:34,278
Both of you.

632
00:39:35,955 --> 00:39:37,655
I just wish there was...

633
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,880
something more that we could do.

634
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,351
We can always pay their bills.

635
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,390
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

636
00:39:58,515 --> 00:39:59,607
We have the money,

637
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:01,125
more than enough.

638
00:40:01,563 --> 00:40:02,813
Walt earned it.

639
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:05,364
I think Marie should know the truth.

640
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:09,186
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

641
00:40:09,702 --> 00:40:11,536
- I think that...
- He earned it gambling.

642
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,249
Walt and I...

643
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:22,505
We've had our problems lately.
You know that.

644
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:26,276
And...

645
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,280
what it all came down to
really was...

646
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,039
money.

647
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,500
Pure and simple.

648
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:38,396
When Walt was diagnosed, it...

649
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:41,909
It changed him.

650
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,176
Looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood

651
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,741
what it was
that he was going through.

652
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:52,678
It was more than facing death.

653
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:55,910
It was knowing
that he was going to leave behind...

654
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,041
nothing.

655
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:04,659
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse,

656
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:07,487
he wanted to provide,

657
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:09,052
and so...

658
00:41:11,363 --> 00:41:15,131
he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

659
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:20,515
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

660
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,340
Yeah, I thought so, too,

661
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:25,791
but the truth is
he never took their money, not a dime.

662
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:30,066
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

663
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:32,909
Isn't that right?

664
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:41,334
He put his mind to it and...

665
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:46,848
You know how Walt is.

666
00:41:47,886 --> 00:41:49,486
He's a problem solver,

667
00:41:50,014 --> 00:41:51,444
and he read books,

668
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:55,045
and he did a whole
bunch of research,

669
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,770
and he came up with...

670
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:59,235
this system.

671
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:01,196
A system?

672
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:05,898
A system for counting cards
in Blackjack.

673
00:42:07,586 --> 00:42:09,686
What do you mean, like Rain Man?

674
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:14,220
I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details,

675
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:17,655
but he was convinced
that if you put enough money into it,

676
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,980
he'd have a...

677
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,360
God, what is it?

678
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:23,983
A statistical edge?

679
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:29,028
Yes, statistical...

680
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:33,279
So he...
Every spare minute,

681
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:36,075
Walt was at some
card table somewhere,

682
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,269
and at first he went to the casinos,

683
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,294
but then he realized that...

684
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,794
But then he realized

685
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:48,166
that the casinos report
your winnings to the IRS,

686
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,997
and if it gets reported,
your family might find out,

687
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:53,359
and if you do not want
your family to find out,

688
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:55,491
then you find another place
to gamble,

689
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:58,316
like an illegal,

690
00:42:58,737 --> 00:43:00,079
backroom game.

691
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:05,148
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take,

692
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:07,378
all that time

693
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,646
he used to spend away from home?

694
00:43:12,649 --> 00:43:15,254
I guess for a couple months there
you were...

695
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:18,079
sort of leading a double life,
weren't you?

696
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:28,524
Your fugue state,

697
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,943
was that some sort of cover?

698
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:33,846
He did not fake that, Marie.

699
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,520
The night that Walt disappeared...

700
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:43,089
he lost $14,000.

701
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,576
It was his pension fund,

702
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:48,801
our savings,

703
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:53,047
basically every last dime
we had to our name,

704
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,172
gone.

705
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,729
He couldn't live with it.

706
00:43:58,518 --> 00:43:59,927
He was suicidal.

707
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:02,675
But you have to understand

708
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,350
that as soon as he got out
of the hospital,

709
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:06,985
he went right back to gambling.

710
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,398
I mean, that's how deep this went.

711
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:12,835
How could you

712
00:44:13,922 --> 00:44:15,830
do that to her, Walt?

713
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:20,702
Anyway, this system of his...

714
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:24,174
he finally got it to work.

715
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,260
So all this is to say

716
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:30,738
we have the money.

717
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:32,895
No more gambling.

718
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:37,168
But we have the money.

719
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,040
How... much money?

720
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:59,574
It's in the seven figures.

721
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,060
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

722
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:06,157
What can I say?

723
00:45:07,933 --> 00:45:09,233
I did very well.

724
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:16,336
You will take our money.

725
00:45:18,441 --> 00:45:21,637
Use it to take care of Hank.

726
00:45:22,646 --> 00:45:23,646
Please.

727
00:45:24,193 --> 00:45:25,643
Marie, let us help.

728
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:31,287
- Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
- Absolutely not,

729
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,817
and I need to keep it that way,

730
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:37,041
and Hank's got enough
on his mind right now,

731
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,956
so can we just please
keep this between us?

732
00:45:42,754 --> 00:45:44,354
I just... I need to...

733
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:46,899
We'll talk about it later.

734
00:45:48,171 --> 00:45:50,171
How did you come up with that?

735
00:45:51,853 --> 00:45:54,629
I mean, where did you possibly...

736
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,188
I learned from the best.

737
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:08,542
Somehow something tells me

738
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:11,062
that Hank is here because of you.

739
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:15,956
And I'm not forgetting that.
