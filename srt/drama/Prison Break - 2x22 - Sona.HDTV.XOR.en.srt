1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:02,410
Previously Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,664
A very credible witness
has just come forward,

3
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:05,973
and he's willing to testify.

4
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:08,793
He'll corroborate everything
you've said about this conspiracy.

5
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:09,488
Who?

6
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:15,179
How much do you know about Sona,
Mr. Kim?

7
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:16,922
Only what I've been
given clearance on.

8
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,066
There's been a, uh,
change in strategy.

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,844
How much further
would I have to go?

10
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:22,670
For this,
you only have to go to Panama.

11
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:24,360
I didn't know you were
gonna be here, Michael.

12
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,718
You e-mailed me. You said T-Bag
was here. It's on the Web site.

13
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:28,064
I didn't write anything
on no Web site.

14
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:29,701
This is looking more
and more like a setup.

15
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:31,330
He's got Maricruz
locked away somewhere.

16
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,851
You're gonna help him get
the money or she's dead.

17
00:00:34,347 --> 00:00:35,611
Freeze, Bagwell!

18
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:41,022
Theodore Bagwell-- he's the one you
want for that dead chick in there.

19
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,323
Sucre, you'd better
pull it together.

20
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,811
Go get the money, please.

21
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,710
Who are you fooling?

22
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:53,763
You ain't going to kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

23
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:55,311
You ain't got it in you.

24
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:00,790
- Linc?
- Hello, Michael.

25
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:02,420
What do you want, Alex?

26
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,681
Bring me the money,
bring me the boat.

27
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:05,980
You are out of your mind.

28
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:08,370
We both have something
the other person needs.

29
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,100
Your brother for your plan.

30
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:12,681
Five minutes.
That's all you have.

31
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:27,221
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- I'm getting you out of here.

32
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:30,830
- I've got three weeks.
- Just have a little faith.

33
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:36,942
- I did everything I could.
- I know you did.

34
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,560
Señor?

35
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,470
- Chicle?
- No.

36
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:57,701
Soda?

37
00:01:57,897 --> 00:01:59,253
Beer, my friend?

38
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:02,741
Spleef? Magic mushrooms?

39
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:05,832
Burst your brains,
split it wide open.

40
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,880
I'm your man, man.

41
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:10,253
Magic Mystery Tour
right here in this box.

42
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:12,362
And if I don't got it,
I can get it.

43
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:15,331
Beat it.

44
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:21,890
So you gonna do
the right thing?

45
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:26,023
Right for who, Alex?

46
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:29,301
You lost, Michael.
That's what you've done here.

47
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:31,411
And you're gonna lose
a whole lot more,

48
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:33,883
unless you tell me
right here and right now

49
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:37,172
you're gonna bring me the money,
you're gonna bring me the boat.

50
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,382
And you'll just
let my brother go?

51
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:40,950
Yeah.

52
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,251
Just like you let Tweener go.

53
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:45,061
And Abruzzi...

54
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:47,353
And Haywire.

55
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:48,841
Things are different now.

56
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

57
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,773
The people I was working for,
they kind of, uh...

58
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:58,660
sold me down the river.
Now I just want to go out to sea.

59
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:01,202
Well, that's funny--
I'll have to remember that one.

60
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,733
I face more prison
time than you.

61
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,692
I sort of jumped ahead of you a
few spots on the public enemy list.

62
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,551
You're my way to freedom,
Michael, and I'm yours.

63
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,221
We both know what the other
one's capable of. Come on.

64
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:16,193
Let's treat each other with a little
respect here. No games. No nothing.

65
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:19,983
Just two guys doing each other a favor.
What do you say?

66
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,463
Where are you?

67
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:28,300
Miraflores shipping docks,
just outside of Panama City.

68
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:30,500
It's a big warehouse
right on the water.

69
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,420
That's a long ways.

70
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:34,663
It'll take me at least
24 hours to get there.

71
00:03:35,597 --> 00:03:37,471
Well, then, I'd get moving.

72
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:45,680
- How's it feel being on the run?
- I'll survive.

73
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:49,402
Not if they catch you.
They'll send you to the chair.

74
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:54,223
- You think that's ironic?
- Maybe justice.

75
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,552
Mr. Kim, Alex Mahone. Call me.

76
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:02,110
Oh... justice will be served.

77
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:09,542
What I'm about to divulge to you will
in all likelihood get me killed.

78
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:13,442
- Actually, I guarantee it.
- Then why are you doing it?

79
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:18,023
Because this was supposed to be
about country, about loyalty,

80
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:22,243
about what's right,
but it wasn't because...

81
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:26,311
I wronged people who should
not have been wronged.

82
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:34,271
Those orders were given
by Caroline Reynolds,

83
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,521
who was Vice
President at the time.

84
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,531
Acting on those orders,
I planted evidence...

85
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:42,471
I procured a body,

86
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,620
I lured Lincoln Burrows
into that parking garage

87
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:48,570
that evening under the
auspices of a different hit.

88
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,870
From the ground up,
we framed him.

89
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:58,653
Perfect.

90
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:02,732
So, Lincoln Burrows gets executed,
people forget about Terrence Steadman,

91
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:05,173
the controversy surrounded
him and the presidency.

92
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:08,653
And nobody ever knows about...
the Company.

93
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:12,413
Ah, yes,
which is a shadowy cabal of corporations

94
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:16,183
that pretty much influence everything
that happens in this country.

95
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,621
But I fail to see how
any of this is relevant

96
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:21,323
to Sara Tancredi and the fact
that she aided and abetted,

97
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:22,633
that she jumped bail...

98
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:26,511
She did so because she feared for
her life, which was appropriate,

99
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:29,103
as I had orders to kill her.

100
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:52,813
Hey!

101
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,401
Are you still in
the magic business?

102
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:00,801
Siempre.

103
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:03,233
- What's your name?
- Chaco.

104
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,081
It's all here.

105
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:10,281
Everything Mr. Kellerman said is
corroborated in these documents.

106
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,243
In light of this evidence,

107
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:16,233
my question, I guess, to you is
whether your time and resources

108
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,803
are best spent in pursuing
charges against Dr. Tancredi.

109
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:23,893
No. My office will drop all charges,
effective immediately.

110
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,550
But, Your Honor, I would like
to devote my time and attention

111
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:33,263
in prosecuting this man,
Mr. Kellerman.

112
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:34,941
Officer.

113
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:43,263
I literally don't even
know what to say to you.

114
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,121
It was good knowing you, Sara.

115
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,893
- Yeah?
- Where are we?

116
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:02,312
I'm in Panama. Nice place.
Good weather. Cool breeze.

117
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:04,322
Where are we with the brothers?

118
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,521
When you get them
where they need to be,

119
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:08,990
I want to come down there
for visual confirmation.

120
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,891
Then I suggest you get on a plane,
because by the time you get here,

121
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:13,741
I will have Scofield and
Burrows where you want them.

122
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,720
And then this whole
thing is over.

123
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,800
Sara, it's me.
It's a strange thing...

124
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:37,353
leaving a message for someone
you know is never gonna get it.

125
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:42,211
I can only assume
the worst, so...

126
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,731
this will be the last
message I leave for you.

127
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:50,122
I just wanted you to
know that I made it.

128
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:54,082
But it's no good without you.

129
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,432
Anyway, you remember when I...

130
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:03,290
remember when I told
you about those...

131
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:06,392
50-cent beers in
Baja at happy hour?

132
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,802
They're even cheaper down here.

133
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:12,981
If by some miracle,
you do get this...

134
00:08:14,906 --> 00:08:16,742
I need you to listen close.

135
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:24,080
Sara... Sara,
I suggest we get you out of here.

136
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,942
It's going to be a media circus outside.
It'll only get bigger.

137
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:27,773
Let's go.

138
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,153
Sure.

139
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:32,392
Larger, unexpected fireworks

140
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:35,961
at the trial of Dr.
Sara Tancredi in Chicago today.

141
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,443
New testimony has implicated
that former President Reynolds

142
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:44,383
was complicit in the falsification
of her brother's death.

143
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:48,150
The fall out from all this,
the purported killer Lincoln Burrows

144
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,320
who has fled the country
on a nationwide manhunt

145
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:55,938
will be exonerated of all
charges effective immediately.

146
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:00,434
Oh, my God, Bruce,
Lincoln's a free man.

147
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:38,672
Michael left me a message.
Okay... my God.

148
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,320
He doesn't know.
He's still planning on running.

149
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:48,922
Uh... Come on, Michael,
come on, come on.

150
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:54,672
- Let me do the introduction.
- Fine, but I'll do the talking.

151
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:04,473
- Okay, I got to go to him.
- What's that, about 3,000 miles, Sara?

152
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:06,700
It is. So we're going to
have to swing by my hotel

153
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,821
and you're going to have
to get me to the airport,

154
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,963
because, Bruce, he's got to know
he doesn't have to run anymore.

155
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,113
What he's doing right now
is going to get him killed.

156
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,863
The stars are finally
aligning, sir.

157
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:22,361
Mahone's got Burrows.
Scofield's on his way.

158
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:28,190
I will make it happen.
I'm going down there myself.

159
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:33,303
Just one is needed.

160
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:36,360
Uh, I assume we both
know which one that is.

161
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,612
I will call you when
I get down there.

162
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:02,033
I just... I...
I want you to listen really close, okay?

163
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,402
- Alex, Alex, slow down.
- Okay, okay.

164
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:08,192
We talked about getting back together,
about giving it another shot.

165
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,780
Yes, and I said that
maybe we could.

166
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:15,323
Alex?

167
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:19,442
- What about Colombia? Cartegena?
- Go there?

168
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:22,443
You got summer break coming up,
don't you? Same with Cam.

169
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,780
- Yeah, but...
- I'm not far from there right now,

170
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,672
and I was thinking that why not just
stick around and have you come down?

171
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:33,482
You always wanted to go, didn't you?
Visit the homeland?

172
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:37,660
- Yes, but you didn't.
- Yeah, but I do now.

173
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:43,481
Uh... Yeah. I mean, I suppose

174
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:46,392
we can maybe do two weeks
at the end of the summer...

175
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:49,072
- Is that a yes? That's a yes, right?
- Yes, yes...

176
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,690
Come on, great coffee, great beaches,
wildlife parks for Cam.

177
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:56,862
Alex, look, it might not work out.
You've got to be prepared for
that, okay?

178
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:00,240
I... It can't be
like it was before.

179
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:04,850
It will never be like before.

180
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:07,153
I know what's important now.
I know what matters.

181
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:10,623
Well, I guess I could...
I could look online.

182
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,332
- I don't know, I should go.
- Just come be with me, Pam.

183
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,033
Be with me.

184
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,013
Hey...

185
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:36,590
You've got nothing to
worry about, okay?

186
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,270
It's you I'm marrying.

187
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:42,730
Senor Gonzalez...

188
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,362
*What are you doing?

189
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:45,652
*Leaving.

190
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:47,991
*That's ridiculous.
You're hypovolemic.

191
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,061
*You're down 3 pints of blood.

192
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,970
*That's 30% of the blood
that's in your body.

193
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,840
*Kidney damage,
brain damage, even death.

194
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:07,612
*American Embassy please.

195
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,373
*Connect me please.

196
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:20,123
- U.S. Embassy operator.
- I'm looking for a friend.

197
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,311
A missing American friend.

198
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:24,043
He could be in the hospital.

199
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,621
Could be in jail.

200
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,671
What's the name?

201
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,130
Bellick...

202
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,503
Brad Bellick.

203
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:38,303
Hey! Hey,
do I get to call my lawyer or what?!

204
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,080
What are you
savages down here?!

205
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,223
I get to call my
lawyer or something.

206
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:58,723
Freakin' banana benders.
Finally. That's him.

207
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,492
That's the guy.
He's the one who killed that girl.

208
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:04,021
Good job, guys. Bueno.

209
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,772
Hey... Aren't you going
to release me now?

210
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:09,702
Hey.

211
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:11,653
Hey!

212
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,362
- You're busted.
- Am I?

213
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:23,380
- Where's the money?
- Pretty boy's got it.

214
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,010
He's out there
with a royal flush

215
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:29,581
and you're in here with a busted
straight. Hardly seems right, does it?

216
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:31,132
Your hand don't
look much better.

217
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:35,720
- Maybe I got an ace up my sleeve.
- You know something I don't?

218
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,330
You should rest your leg, boss.

219
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,373
*DeJesus, how goes it?

220
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,110
*Chaco, what's going on?

221
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,332
*I have a guy for you
with a ton of money.

222
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,933
*What the devil is this?

223
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,723
*Calm down.
I just want to do business.

224
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:09,352
*Get out.

225
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:11,742
I was told we
could make a deal.

226
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:15,040
You're a long way from home, boy.
Ain't no deal for you here.

227
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,432
You haven't heard
what I have to offer.

228
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:24,232
Guy looking like you do...
coming here...

229
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:27,041
the only thing you're
offering is jail time.

230
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:30,590
*You crazy,
bringing a cop here.

231
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:31,801
I'm not a cop.

232
00:15:39,457 --> 00:15:40,572
Check online.

233
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:42,860
Type in "Michael Scofield."

234
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:47,032
- That means nothing to me.
- Could mean 100 grand.

235
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:01,920
This takes longer than 30 seconds,
you're in the canal.

236
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,940
Bait... for the catfish.

237
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,491
Hey...

238
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,740
*Here he is.

239
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:21,932
You just gave me a 100,000
reasons to turn you in.

240
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:23,052
That's true.

241
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:27,691
I guess I'll just have to
give you a few more not to.

242
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:35,573
You know I'm innocent.

243
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:38,431
- Yeah? Probably.
- And yet you don't care.

244
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,811
I don't care about anything other
than getting my life back, no.

245
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,881
Your wife know who
you really are?

246
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:45,982
Yeah, you know how it is.

247
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:48,703
Good men doing bad things
because of circumstance.

248
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:51,271
I'd call her back
if I were you.

249
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,432
Tell her to forget
you were ever born.

250
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,761
Oh, you would, would you?

251
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:58,632
Stop the cancer from your
life spreading to theirs.

252
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,243
Cancer of my life.

253
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,532
I wouldn't be begging her to
meet me in this third world dump

254
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:09,293
- if it weren't for you and your life.
- There's no way out of this.

255
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:12,592
For you or for any of us.

256
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:17,362
For me there is.

257
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,550
For me there is.

258
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,152
How much of it have you spent?

259
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:32,011
100,000... 200,000.

260
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:34,190
Of course, down here,
it'd be more like a million.

261
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:39,011
Be Louis XIV or something like that.
The Sun King of Panama.

262
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:41,592
You ain't gonna be
seeing much sun now.

263
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:43,740
I don't know.

264
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,111
You know, Bagwell,

265
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:52,053
out of all the guys,
all eight of 'em,

266
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,052
you were the guy I was hoping would
go down in a blaze of gunfire.

267
00:17:56,235 --> 00:17:58,821
Why don't you give me your best shot.
Finish the job.

268
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,511
Maybe I will.

269
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:08,933
That Siamese cat smile just makes me
want to open you up that much more.

270
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:12,503
It's Cheshire.
Cheshire cat smile.

271
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:13,992
Señor Bellick.

272
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,150
I'm free?

273
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:26,951
What the hell's this?

274
00:18:27,327 --> 00:18:31,791
Hey, wait... wait a minute. What
about him? He's the one that did it.

275
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:33,612
Bueno suerte.

276
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,990
"Bueno suerte"?
"Bueno suerte," what's that mean?

277
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:40,381
Bueno suerte--
what does that mean? Bueno suerte?

278
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,723
Good luck.

279
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:53,892
*Relocada Station. This way?

280
00:18:54,457 --> 00:18:55,291
*Yeah.

281
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,483
*You need some help?

282
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:06,961
Bellick.

283
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:10,212
Bellick!

284
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:12,912
Where is she, Bellick, huh?!

285
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:20,090
Where is she?!
Where's Maricruz?!

286
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:27,600
You want to know where she is,
find a way to get me out of this!

287
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:31,742
Get me out of here! Get me out!

288
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,193
Maricruz...

289
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:51,502
Maricruz...

290
00:20:58,266 --> 00:21:00,053
Michael, that's
a beautiful boat.

291
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,562
Just promise me you'll change
the name when you take it.

292
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,831
I don't think my mother
would have approved of you.

293
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:07,963
Consider it done. Come on.

294
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,492
- Uncuff me.
- No, not yet.

295
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:13,103
So is this the part where
you go back on your word?

296
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:15,150
Hands up. Hands up.

297
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:24,030
No. And as of now
they want you alive.

298
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:29,060
- Why?
- That's a good question.

299
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,200
Figure it out someday on your own time.
Where's the money?

300
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,411
- Cut him loose.
- No.

301
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,103
Come on, Alex, you already got the boat.
Show a little good faith.

302
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:41,011
The money. I want...

303
00:21:44,017 --> 00:21:46,113
- Yeah.
- I'm here. Where are you?

304
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:50,583
- I'm inside the warehouse.
- I'll be right there.

305
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,633
Here we go.

306
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:03,042
Hello. Hola.

307
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:05,091
You speak English?

308
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:07,410
Yes, yes.

309
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,090
Miraflores Docks.

310
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,061
Yes, there's been a murder.

311
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:14,863
A well-dressed Asian man has
just been shot by two Americans.

312
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:17,012
Come. Yes, come.

313
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:24,940
So you kill him
and frame us. Why?

314
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:31,023
So everyone will
leave me alone.

315
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:35,702
'Cause that's all I want.
That and the money.

316
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:37,551
It's not gonna happen, Alex.

317
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:39,791
- Let him go.
- Give me the money.

318
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,572
- Let him go.
- Give me the money!

319
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:56,441
I am dumbfounded.

320
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:05,181
Don't be shy.

321
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:07,420
They're all yours.

322
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:11,841
You said you'd have them
right where we wanted them.

323
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:14,243
This isn't right
where we want them.

324
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:19,182
- That's your job now.
- Oh.

325
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:21,433
This is as far as I go.

326
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:27,521
Or is there soemthing else?
Another reason we're all here.

327
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:32,183
Like that. Like a double-cross.

328
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:34,623
Yeah, just like that.
Say good-bye.

329
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:40,323
Great minds think alike,
huh Alex?

330
00:24:48,336 --> 00:24:50,020
Come on. Come on.

331
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,221
Once seated, your four-piece will
be mounted to the floor mount.

332
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,860
During transport,
do not speak to either...

333
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,263
I know the drill.

334
00:25:16,586 --> 00:25:17,690
Get in.

335
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:44,933
- So, what do we got, 30 minutes?
- Yeah, something like that.

336
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:48,323
- Why didn't you take the freeway?
- Rush hour.

337
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,001
- Aw, hell.
- What?

338
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:56,460
The engine light just came on.
It just got serviced at motor pool.

339
00:25:56,878 --> 00:26:00,212
Yeah, we better pull
over just to make sure.

340
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,310
All right, I'll check it out.

341
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:26,603
In the French Resistance

342
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:29,281
it was considered a high honor
to face a Nazi firing squad.

343
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:32,053
- I thought I told you to be quiet.
- Meant you did your job.

344
00:26:32,836 --> 00:26:35,510
The highest honor was to
smile when they shot you.

345
00:26:38,658 --> 00:26:41,240
Took you long enough.

346
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:57,702
Lake Gatun, Eastern Canal,
approaches to Cartagena. $27.50.

347
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,331
What's that crossing take?

348
00:26:59,848 --> 00:27:02,622
Two days if you're under
full sail all the time.

349
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,240
Good time of you to be down here.
No storms, nothing.

350
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:10,180
- Had enough storms recently.
- Enjoy it. It's a beautiful crossing.

351
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:13,651
- I plan to.
- This boat here, who's it belong to?

352
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:18,563
Señor? We got a call that this boat
was used in some illegal trafficking.

353
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:21,783
It's the wrong boat, pal.
You can check it if you want to, but...

354
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:25,011
- Hey, you can't just...
- This is Panama, friend.

355
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:27,593
Get acquainted
with the law, huh?

356
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:38,631
Yes, I definitely think
you need to get acquainted.

357
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:39,920
Chico.

358
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:45,933
Oh... I...

359
00:27:47,508 --> 00:27:48,432
Vamanos.

360
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:55,782
- You think they got him?
- It's a pretty singular boat.

361
00:27:55,977 --> 00:27:57,690
That's a lot of coke
to be carrying around.

362
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,012
If you're at the helm, man...

363
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,550
Be doing some serious time;
ten years minimum.

364
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:06,022
Yeah, you would. We lost the boat.
At least we got dead man's money.

365
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,123
It's out ticket to
the rest of our lives,

366
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,222
minus what I'm sending
Westmoreland's daughter.

367
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:12,121
Hey.

368
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:16,320
- You showed up.
- We had a deal.

369
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:18,621
- This is my brother.
- Hey.

370
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:19,882
This way.

371
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:25,101
So we get out of here,
and we never look back.

372
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:26,743
We never look back.

373
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,552
I want to thank you,
Michael, for everything.

374
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:38,883
You're welcome.

375
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:43,590
It's the best I could do
with the money you gave me.

376
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:45,903
That'll work.

377
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:50,960
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

378
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:54,220
She's very pretty.

379
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,231
She'll get us where
we need to go, right?

380
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:58,240
Not the boat, señor.

381
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,751
So, I got your message.

382
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:28,240
Thank God, I found you guys.

383
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:33,343
"Thank God" is right.

384
00:29:33,716 --> 00:29:35,263
Michael, Lincoln's free.

385
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:37,122
What?

386
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,933
Uh, it's all over the news.

387
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,991
Paul Kellerman came forward

388
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,733
and he had everything documented
and he made a full confession.

389
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:48,393
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

390
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,463
- Everything?
- Everything, all charges.

391
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:56,213
Whoa.

392
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:06,251
What, uh...? No more...

393
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,693
That means you don't
have to run anymore.

394
00:30:12,295 --> 00:30:13,562
What about Michael?

395
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:19,991
Uh, a friend of my father's getting
into it, but he's pretty confident

396
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,433
that under the circumstances nobody's
going to pursue you on this.

397
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:29,553
I need a drink.

398
00:30:31,675 --> 00:30:33,413
I'll go see what I can find.

399
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:55,532
Here. Help me out of this.

400
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,011
We did it, Linc.

401
00:31:06,418 --> 00:31:08,291
- We did it.
- Yeah.

402
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,500
No...

403
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:12,980
you almost did it.

404
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,413
You want the money?!

405
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:25,362
Take the money. Take it.

406
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,303
You think this is
about the money?

407
00:31:31,497 --> 00:31:33,321
Pocket change like
five million?

408
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:35,991
Then what is it about?
My brother's been exonerated.

409
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:40,542
The President stepped down.
We're not a threat anymore. It's over.

410
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:42,970
You may be done with us,

411
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,963
but that doesn't mean
we're done with you.

412
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,740
The police are on their way.

413
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:48,280
It started with me.

414
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:53,260
- Let my brother go.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's sweet.

415
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:56,833
You don't hear that much anymore,
that sort of fidelity in families.

416
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,903
Two brothers that'll go to the
ends of the earth for each other.

417
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:03,711
Too bad only one
of you survive.

418
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:04,781
Don't!

419
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:18,710
We got to go.

420
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:37,502
My men are ordered to fire

421
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:40,082
if you don't come out of
there with your hands first.

422
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:41,670
Come on, come on.

423
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:49,640
Murder is not something that we take
lightly here on Panamanian soil.

424
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,941
So come on out of there and
there will be no more death.

425
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,003
Michael, I took a man's life.

426
00:33:56,706 --> 00:34:00,892
Don't think about that now.
You and I have got a date, remember?

427
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:04,310
Two limes and a couple of beers,
don't forget that.

428
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:06,331
This is your last warning!

429
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:07,860
Give me the gun.

430
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:13,120
I took a man's life.

431
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:16,712
We're going to walk
out of here together,

432
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:19,572
and we'll tell them
exactly what happened.

433
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:24,183
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

434
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:26,643
Then we're going to tell
them what happened.

435
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,230
- Okay.
- We'll explain everything.

436
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:33,200
And I'm going to do
whatever I can to help you.

437
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,091
- Okay?
- Yeah.

438
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:43,950
- Now give me the gun.
- Here.

439
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,302
I love you.

440
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,283
I love you, too, Sarah.

441
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:22,200
- Okay.
- You all right?

442
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:24,920
- All right.
- Yeah. Come on.

443
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:33,802
Don't move! I'll shoot!

444
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:37,181
- Michael, what are you doing?
- Nobody moves! Nobody!

445
00:35:39,426 --> 00:35:41,721
You sacrificed
everything for me once.

446
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,441
- No! Don't move!
- No, I can't let you do this.

447
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,853
Now it's time to say thank you.

448
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:52,531
- It was me. It was me!
- He's innocent!

449
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:55,392
- I did it! I did it!
- He's innocent!

450
00:35:56,828 --> 00:35:58,702
He's done nothing wrong!

451
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:07,872
Michael! Tell them the truth!
He's done nothing wrong!

452
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:37,230
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

453
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:42,121
Ooh, getting impatient.
Reminds me of when we were in college.

454
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:47,943
- Did you buy the tickets yet?
- No, I'm still looking.

455
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:51,463
- Don't.
- What?

456
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,021
Forget about them.

457
00:36:57,178 --> 00:36:59,383
Forget I ever existed.

458
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,481
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

459
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:27,003
- Yes, can I help you?
- Yeah.

460
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:28,593
I'm looking for a woman--
Sarah Tancredi.

461
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:30,653
She was brought in to give her
statement and then released.

462
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:31,933
You just missed her.

463
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:43,041
Sarah!

464
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:20,950
Ah... ah!
I thought you'd never show up.

465
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:27,613
Okay, uh,
when am I getting out of here?

466
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:32,063
That's the thing.
There's been a hiccup.

467
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:34,480
A hiccup.

468
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,523
Look, you guys got me...

469
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:39,201
you got me fair and square in Mexico,
all right?

470
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:41,623
I did what you wanted me to do.

471
00:38:41,768 --> 00:38:43,582
Now it's time to cut me
loose just like we agreed.

472
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:45,591
Getting caught wasn't
part of the agreement.

473
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:49,302
I got caught running your setup,
being your bait.

474
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:53,562
Now I got you Scofield down here,
I got you what you wanted.

475
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:57,900
You got caught, Bagwell.

476
00:38:59,706 --> 00:39:01,770
Hey, where... where you going?!

477
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:03,353
Where you going?!

478
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:07,391
I got you what you want!
I got them boys down here!

479
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:10,623
I did what you told me to do!

480
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:14,970
Do you hear me?!
I did what you told me to do!

481
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:17,871
I did what you told me!

482
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:30,221
This is as far as we go.

483
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:57,343
General...

484
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,553
I trust this is a
safe place to speak.

485
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:05,062
It's Scofield.

486
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:07,150
They got him.

487
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,533
Scofield back in the penn.

488
00:41:48,908 --> 00:41:49,973
Got to be honest,

489
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:52,173
I didn't think we'd
see it happen.

490
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:57,912
You know he's gonna break out.
It's in his blood.

491
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:02,772
That's exactly what
we want him to do.

492
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:07,071
