Probably something about

Oh, yes.

sentimental, unfit creature of habit
with appalling halitosis.

- Why would he be isolated?
- He?

00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,649
- Obviously.
- Why? Size of the hat?

535

Don't be silly.
Some women have large heads, too.

536
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,046
No, he's recently had his hair cut,
you can see the little hairs

537
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,726
adhering to the perspiration stains
on the inside.

538
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,006
Some women have short hair, too.

539
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,406
Balance of probability.

540
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,164
Not that you've ever spoken
to a woman with short hair,

541
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,287
or, you know, a woman.

542
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,725
Stains show he's out of condition.

543
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,167
And he's sentimental because
the hat has been repaired three...

544
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,685
Five times. Very neatly.

545
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,364
The cost of the repairs exceeds
the cost of the hat,

546
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,169
so he's mawkishly attached to it.
But it's more than that.

547
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,208
One, perhaps two patches
would indicate sentimentality

548
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,770
but five? Five's obsessive behaviour.

549
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,571
- Obsessive-compulsive.
- Hardly. Your client left it behind.

550
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,847
What sort of an obsessive-compulsive
would do that?

551
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,888
The earlier patches are
extensively sun-bleached,

552
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,564
so he's worn it abroad, in Peru.

553
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,051
- Peru?
- This is a Chullo.

The classic headgear of Andes,
it's made of Alpaca.

555

- No. Icelandic sheep wool.
- No?

556
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,480
Similar but very distinctive,
if you know what you're looking for.

557

I'm sure there's a crying need for that.

You said he was anxious?

561
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,768
The bobble on the left side
has been badly chewed,

562
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,410
which shows he's a man
of a nervous disposition but...

563
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,481
But also a creature of habit

564
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,403
because he hasn't chewed
the bobble on the right.

as stupid as this

around other people, is he?

Not at all.

being different.

have to be isolated.

Absolutely nothing to

It's very common, but I'm

about Professor Presbury.

- Absolutely.

- If it makes you feel better.

Why didn't you assume it was your wife?

Because I've always had

No, it's because you emptied it.

729

Now, this man gets into the last car.

- Car?
- They're cars, not carriages.

He gets into the last car
at Westminster, the only passenger,

737
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,088
and the car is empty
at St James's Park station.

739

<font color="#404040">MOLLY:</font> Couldn't he have just jumped off?

740
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,166
There's a safety mechanism that prevents
the doors from opening in transit.

741
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,040
But there's something else. The driver
of that train hasn't been to work since.

742
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,130
According to his flatmate,
he's on holiday.

743

- Came into some money.
- Bought off?

Hmm?

745
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,930
So if the driver of the train
was in on it,

746
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,365
then the passenger did get off.

00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,926
So I'm going to need maps, lots of maps.
Older maps, all the maps.

761
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,001
Right.

762
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,923
- Fancy some chips?
- What?

763
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,002
I know a fantastic fish shop
just off the Marylebone Road,

764
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,844
the owner always
gives me extra portions.

765
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,811
Did you get him off a murder charge?

766
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,450
No, I helped him put up some shelves.

767
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,646
- Sherlock?
- Hmm?

768
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,491
- What was today about?
- Saying thank you.

769
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,886
- For what?
- For everything you did for me.

770
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,964
It's okay. It's my pleasure.

771
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,251
No. I mean it.

772
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,368
I don't mean pleasure,
I mean I didn't mind.

773
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,966
- I wanted to.
- Moriarty slipped up, he made a mistake.

774
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,081
Because the one person he thought
didn't matter at all to me

775
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,722
was the one person
that mattered the most.

776
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,604
You made it all possible.

777
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,930
But you can't do this again, can you?

778
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,247
I had a lovely day.
I'd love to, I just, um...

779
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,924
And congratulations, by the way.

780
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,081
He's not from work.

781
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,447
We met through friends,
old-fashioned way.

782
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,885
He's nice, we... He's got a dog, we...
We go to the pub on weekends

783
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,368
and I've met his mum and dad
and his friends and all his family.

784
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,283
I've no idea
why I'm telling you any of this.

00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,485
My markers, agents, low-lifes.

908
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,891
People who might find
themselves arrested

909
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,440
or their diplomatic immunity
suddenly rescinded.

910
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,126
If one of them starts acting
suspiciously, we know something's up.

911
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,771
Five of them are behaving perfectly
normally but the sixth...

912
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,001
I know him, don't I?

913
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,005

North Korea since 1996.

916
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,327
- What?
- He's the big rat, rat number one.

917
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,571
He's just done something
very suspicious indeed.

918
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,562
Yeah, that's odd.

919
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,481
There's nowhere he could have got off?

<font color="#404040">JOHN:</font> Hmm.

921
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,002
There's something, something,
something I'm missing.

922
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,730
Something staring me in the face.

<font color="#DF01D7">(MOBILE BEEPS)</font>

924
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,480
Any idea who they are,
this underground network?

925
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,485
Intelligence must have a list
of the most obvious ones.

926
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,284
Our rat's just come out of his den.

927
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,245
Al Qaeda? The IRA have been
getting restless again,

928
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,129
- maybe they're going to make...
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

929
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,521
- I've been an idiot, a blind idiot!
- What?

930
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,683
Oh, that's good.
That could be brilliant!

931
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,761
What are you on about?

932
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,723
Mycroft's intelligence
is not nebulous at all,

933
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,531
- it's specific, incredibly specific.
- What do you mean?

934
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,171
It's not an underground network,
John, it's an Underground network!

935
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,688
Right. What?

936
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,683
Sometimes a deception is so audacious,
so outrageous

937
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,649
that you can't see it even when
it's staring you in the face.

938
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,890
Look, seven carriages leave Westminster.

939
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,961
<font color="#404040">JOHN:</font> Hmm.

940
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,847
And only six carriages arrive
at St James's Park.

941
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,203
<font color="#404040">JOHN:</font> Ah, but that's...
I mean, it's impossible.

942
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,046
Moran didn't disappear.
The entire Tube compartment did.

943
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,771
The driver must have diverted the train
and then detached the last carriage.

944
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,046
Detached it where?

945
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,360
You said there was nothing
between those stations.

946
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,329
Not on the maps, but once you
eliminate all the other factors,

947
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,731
the only thing remaining
must be the truth.

948
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,201
That carriage vanished,
so it must be somewhere.

949
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,966
But why, though?
Why detach it in the first place?

950
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,930
It vanishes between St James's Park
and Westminster.

951
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,164
Lord Moran vanishes.

952
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,483
You're kidnapped and nearly burnt
to death at a fireworks party...

953
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,045
What's the date, John, today's date?

954
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,642
Hmm? November... My God!

955
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,330
Lord Moran, he's a Peer of the Realm.

956
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,890
Normally he'd sit in the House.

957
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,084
Tonight there's an all-night sitting to
vote on the new anti-terrorism bill.

958
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,482
But he won't be there, not tonight.

959
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,764
Not the 5th of November.

960
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,411
- "Remember, remember."
- "Gunpowder, treason and plot!"

961
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,246
<i>There's nothing down there, Mr. Holmes,</i>

962
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,846
<i>I told you. No sidings,
no ghost stations.</i>

963
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,160
There has to be, check again.

964
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,644
This whole area is a big mess
of old and new stuff.

965
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,848
Charing Cross is made up
of bits of older stations,

966
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,968
like Trafalgar Square, Strand.

967
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,451
No, it's none of those,
we've accounted for those.

968
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,565
St Margaret Street, Bridge Street,
Sumatra Road, Parliament Street...

969
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,290
<i>Hang on, hang on, Sumatra Road.</i>

970
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,644
<i>You mentioned Sumatra Road, Mr. Holmes.</i>

971
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,166
<i>There is something,
I knew it rang a bell!</i>

972
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,847
<i>Yes. There was a station down there.</i>

973
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,046
Well, why isn't it on the maps?

974
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,645
<i>Because it was closed
before it ever opened.</i>

975
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,769
- What?
<i>- They built the platforms,</i>

976
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,649
<i>even the staircases,</i>

977
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,290
<i>but it all got tied up in legal disputes</i>

978
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,408
<i>so they never built
the station on the surface.</i>

979
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,369
It's right underneath
the Palace of Westminster.

980
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,684
So what's down there, a bomb?

981
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,966
Oh.

982
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,170
<i>With many commentators
saying the vote on the Terrorism Bill</i>

983
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,483
<i>will be too close to call,
MPs are now making their way</i>

984
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,166
<i>into the Chamber for what
the Government is calling</i>

985
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,244
<i>the most important vote
of this Parliament.</i>

988
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,370
<i>This is an Orwellian measure
on a scale unprecedented...</i>

989
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,970
So it's a bomb, then? The Tube
carriage is carrying a bomb?

990
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,401
- Must be.
- Right.

991
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,285
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

- And illegal.
- A bit.

- Coming.

1082

The criminal network
Moriarty headed was vast.

1083
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,529
Its roots were everywhere, like a
cancer, so we came up with a plan.

1084
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,650
<i>Mycroft fed Moriarty
information about me.</i>

1085

Moriarty, in turn, gave us hints,

1086
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,851
just hints as to the extent of his web.

1087
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,044
We let him go,

1088
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,566
because it was important to let him
believe he had the upper hand.

1089
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,326
And then I sat back and watched Moriarty

1090
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,767
destroy my reputation, bit by bit.

1091
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,045

<i>There were 13 likely scenarios
once we were up on that roof.</i>

1094
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,445
<i>Each of them were rigorously
worked out and given a code name.</i>

1095
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,368
<i>It wasn't just my reputation that
Moriarty needed to bury. I had to die.</i>

01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,526
Oh, those things you said, such sweet
things. I never knew you cared.

1202
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,285
You know, I will kill you
if you ever breathe a word of this...

- ...to anyone! You knew!

1204
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,891
- You knew how to turn it off!
- There's an off switch.

1205
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,450
There's always an off switch.

1206
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,884
Terrorists can get into all sorts of
problems unless there's an off switch.

1207
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,530
So why did you let me
go through all that?

1208
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,409
I didn't lie altogether.

1209
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,601
I've absolutely no idea how to turn any
of these silly little lights off.

Killing me, that's so two years ago.

Yeah. I've moved on.

Did you, uh...

- No, best not.

- Hmm?

Why did they try and kill me?

1249
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,847
If they knew you were
onto them, why come after me?

- Put me in a bonfire?
- I don't know.

I don't like not knowing.

Unlike the nicely embellished fictions
on your blog, John,

1253
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,447
real life is rarely so neat.

1254
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,764
I don't know who was behind all this
but I will find out, I promise you.

1255
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,801
- Don't pretend you're not enjoying this.
- Hmm?

1256
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,528
Being back. Being a hero again.

1257
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,809
- Oh, don't be stupid.
- You'd have to be an idiot

1258
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,370
not to see it. You love it.

1259
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,885
Love what?

1260
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,083
Being Sherlock Holmes.

1261
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,443
I don't even know
what that's supposed to mean.

1262
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,120
Sherlock, you are going
to tell me how you did it?

1263
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,170
How you jumped off that
building and survived?

1264
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:48,369
You know my methods, John.
I am known to be indestructible.

1265
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:53,321
No, but seriously. When you were
dead, I went to your grave.

1266
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,531
- I should hope so.
- I made a little speech.

1267
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,564
I actually spoke to you.

1268
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:02,041
I know. I was there.

1269
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,246
I asked you for one more miracle.

1270
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,371
I asked you to stop being dead.

1271
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,086
I heard you.

1272
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:19,923
Anyway, time to go and be
Sherlock Holmes.
