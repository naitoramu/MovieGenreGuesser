00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:33,726
Son of a bitch!

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,164
Hang on, baby.

{\pos(192,220)}<i>Hello.</i>

6
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,157
Walt, are you in the house?

7
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>It's me.</i>

8
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:16,083
What the hell
are you doing in there?

9
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:17,795
<i>I'm back.</i>

10
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,491
{\pos(192,220)}You're not back.

11
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:23,466
{\pos(192,220)}Walt, you're not back.
Get out of there.

12
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,096
<i>It's my house, too, Skyler.</i>

13
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:28,021
<i>I'm staying. End of story.</i>

14
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,970
- We had an agreement.
- <i>I didn't agree to anything.</i>

15
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,912
{\pos(192,205)}<i>Just come on inside,
and we'll talk this through.</i>

16
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:39,128
There's nothing to talk about.

17
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,945
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

18
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:47,711
{\pos(192,205)}<i>Suit yourself.</i>

19
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,980
{\pos(192,205)}What is wrong with you?

20
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,722
I have every right to be here.

21
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,372
You don't.

22
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,794
You don't live here anymore.

23
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:28,410
- We're getting a divorce.
- I don't agree to a divorce.

24
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,949
It's not up to you.

25
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,870
If you don't get out of here
right now,

26
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,485
I'm going to call the police

27
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,467
and I'm going to tell them
everything.

28
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,860
I mean it.

29
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,817
{\pos(192,205)}It's ringing.

How may I help you?</i>

33
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,044
{\pos(192,205)}I want to report
a disturbance, please.

34
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,363
{\pos(192,205)}It's not exactly...
It's,

35
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:36,088
{\pos(192,205)}It's a domestic issue.

36
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,148
They're connecting me.

37
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,362
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

38
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,405
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

39
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:55,338
This family is everything to me.

40
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,612
Without it,

41
00:08:58,429 --> 00:08:59,795
I have nothing to lose.

42
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:00,831
Fine.

43
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,647
{\pos(192,205)}Yes, my name is Skyler White.

44
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:09,066
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

45
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,466
My...

46
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,736
soon-to-be ex-husband

47
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,289
{\pos(192,205)}broke into my house,

48
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,387
{\pos(192,205)}and I need an officer

49
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:18,933
{\pos(192,205)}to come and remove him.

50
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,767
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

51
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:32,427
{\pos(192,205)}Thank you.

52
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,995
They're coming.

53
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:31,764
Dad's here?

54
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,613
How are you, son?

55
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,235
How are you?

56
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:38,722
Are you back for good?

57
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:41,090
Why are you home so soon?

58
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,133
I'm not.

59
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,141
I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

60
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:50,024
- Sure.
- You want one, too?

61
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,389
Your dad and I have something
we need to discuss.

62
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,189
When your sandwich
is ready I'll bring it to your...

63
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:56,447
to your room.

64
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,724
Mom, can't it wait?

65
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:01,331
I haven't seen Dad in,
like, forever.

66
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,564
How's the school?

67
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:04,703
It was good.

68
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:06,954
- Homework?
- Not really.

69
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:08,876
Not really? What does that mean?

70
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:21,013
Are you gonna be at work tomorrow?

71
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:22,773
That's the plan.

72
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:40,032
We were called about a disturbance?

73
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:43,154
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

74
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,565
that was me.

75
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:51,514
You called the cops on Dad?

76
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,901
I came home from work,
and he was back.

77
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,722
He just moved back into the house.

78
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,814
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen.

79
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,907
I just...

80
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,512
I want him out.

81
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,458
I want him out of the house.

82
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,585
{\There's a couple of questions}I need to ask you a couple of questions
right off of the bat.

83
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,636
It's {\very }important that you answer
them honestly. Did he strike you?

84
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,938
Has he ever hit you?

85
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,259
No. This is not about

86
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,121
violence.
This is about trespassing,

87
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:28,651
about him

88
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:30,916
being here against my will.

89
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,156
Trespassing.

90
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,791
You're divorced, then?

91
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,769
No, working on it.

92
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:39,030
- Right now we're separated.
- Legally separated?

93
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:42,543
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean,

94
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:45,016
but we've been living apart
for almost

95
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:48,031
two weeks, give or take...
I changed the locks.

96
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:50,497
Isn't that breaking and entering?

97
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:52,396
Whose name
is on the title to the house?

98
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,334
Both of us.

99
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,905
It's jointly owned.

100
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,463
We can't arrest a man
for breaking into his own house,

101
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:01,113
not without a court order requiring
he stays away from the premises,

102
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:04,021
unless he's threatened you
or the kids in any way.

103
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:08,512
Not physically,
but having him in the house is just...

104
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:12,101
It's not a good thing.

105
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:13,672
Excuse me.

106
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,044
I got her, honey.

107
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:19,089
Come here.

108
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,326
There we go.

109
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:22,480
You hungry?

110
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,110
You hungry?

111
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:28,474
That was it.

112
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,130
I'm sorry, Officer.
Where were we?

113
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,145
Disagreements.

114
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,630
So we've had our share of that.

115
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:39,242
I haven't...

116
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,571
I haven't been the most attentive
husband lately.

117
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:49,216
Would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

118
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,641
I'm fine right here.

119
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:01,105
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

120
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,759
If you want him{\your husband} out of the house,
you're gonna have to help me out.

121
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,424
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

122
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:08,665
Anything at all.

123
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:11,710
Anything that we can work with here,
just tell me.

124
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:16,063
Even if you've just got a suspicion
of wrongdoing, I can work with that.

125
00:14:17,562 --> 00:14:18,999
What's your take on all this?

126
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,694
It's my mom's fault.

127
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,674
She won't even say what my dad did,

128
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,119
and it's because
he didn't do anything.

129
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,687
I don't know why
she's being this way.

130
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,182
But my dad...

131
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,601
... he is a great guy.

132
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:41,597
Son. It's not your mom's fault.

133
00:14:42,692 --> 00:14:43,742
Mrs. White?

134
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,556
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis for us

135
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,687
to remove your husband
from the house.

136
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,949
Next time you feel like
things are getting out of control,

137
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,105
{\you should }call this number.

138
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,234
It's the family hotline.

139
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,848
I'd really look
into some counseling.

140
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,405
Best of luck to you{\ folks}.

141
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:09,283
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

142
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:20,085
Why do you got to do this to Dad?

143
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,560
Junior. Wait. Come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

144
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:29,689
Sorry.

145
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:48,708
Welcome home.

146
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,632
{\pub}

147
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:33,864
He lives!

148
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:35,928
Happy housewarming, kid.

149
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,040
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

150
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,070
Interesting decor.

151
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:42,643
It's... subtle.

152
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:46,589
The whole minimalist thing
never really blew my hair back, but hey.

153
00:16:49,027 --> 00:16:50,249
How are you doing?

154
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:51,774
You staying clean?

155
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:54,519
Good.

156
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:57,142
I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits,

157
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,534
since I didn't hear from you,
you know?

158
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,573
Realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

159
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:07,110
What if I was trying to warn you
that the DEA was going to {\kick down your door}come?

160
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:08,728
{\I mean, }What then?

161
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,953
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

162
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:12,991
Fair enough.

163
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,407
Remember{\ the other day} when I brought up the idea

164
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,382
of you getting back in touch
with your partner?

165
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:20,957
I kind of wanted
to refloat that boat.

166
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,061
I'm not suggesting that you yourself
get back to cooking,

167
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:26,379
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

168
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:30,097
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

169
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,167
What do you say?

170
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:36,264
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

171
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:38,554
I mean, you going to call him?

172
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,545
I said I'll handle it.

173
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,229
Now bounce, will you?
Please?

174
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,597
Final thought.

175
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,716
Look at this place.
You're house poor.

176
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:50,498
You got no bankroll.

177
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,323
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

178
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:57,285
Call him.

179
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,091
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you...</i>

180
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:48,327
<i>do not call list.</i>

181
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,836
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

182
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,048
Schrader.

183
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,726
Yes, sir?
Yeah, what's up?

184
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,493
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

185
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:31,207
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
You can bet on that.

186
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,794
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir.

187
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,624
I really appreciate
you stepping to the plate. Thank you.

188
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:42,598
You going to keep me in suspense{\ or what}?

189
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,685
- What's the good news?
- Merkert called in a couple of favors.

190
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,546
El Paso wants me back.

191
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,558
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

192
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:52,683
Thank you.

193
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,118
Hello.

194
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,164
{\pub}

195
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:15,066
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,

196
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:16,261

201
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,311
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you...</i>

202
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:25,841
Oh, sweetheart.

203
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:27,619
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

204
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:29,588
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

205
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:32,191
It's okay, my girl.

206
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:34,907
It's okay.

207
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:37,349
It's okay. Mama's got you.

208
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,181
Skyler, want some help?

209
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,195
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

210
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,277
What do you mean?
Against your will?

211
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,630
Very much against my will.

212
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:42,847
He just...
He showed right back up,

213
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,018
and he doesn't want a divorce.

214
00:28:45,143 --> 00:28:46,793
Won't even consider it.

215
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,077
I... I called the police on him.

216
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:53,458
I was so clo...

217
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,402
So close to what?

218
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:58,219
Nothing. Never mind.

219
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:03,872
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

220
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:07,734
Understand I am bound
by the attorney-client privilege

221
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,833
to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

222
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:12,901
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

223
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,849
Even if it's something illegal?

224
00:29:16,777 --> 00:29:18,627
Especially if it's illegal.

225
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,073
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

226
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,948
My job is to protect you.

227
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,997
My husband makes meth.

228
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:39,165
Methamphetamine.

229
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,326
- Your husband's a drug dealer.
- A manufacturer.

230
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,157
Technically, they...

231
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:50,187
They call them cooks.

232
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:53,668
I looked it up on the Internet.

233
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:55,772
This is my advice,

234
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,608
and you should take it.

235
00:29:58,026 --> 00:30:00,592
Sue your husband
for divorce immediately.

236
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:04,534
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you've just told me.

237
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:05,803
I'll go in <i>ex parte</i>

238
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:08,154
to get a restraining order
from the court today.

239
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,471
If he comes anywhere near you
and your children,

240
00:30:10,596 --> 00:30:13,104
he goes straight to jail,
no questions asked.

241
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,874
This is a no-brainer.

242
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,525
It's the best thing
for you and your family.

243
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,499
I can't.

244
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:25,823
I can't do it.

245
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:30,454
I don't want my son to find out

246
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:32,790
that his father is a criminal.

247
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:34,494
I just...

248
00:30:35,822 --> 00:30:37,737
I can't do that to him.

249
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:40,818
In the end, it may not be up to you.

250
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:44,260
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

251
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,561
Walt has lung cancer.

252
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:52,429
His treatment bought him some time,

253
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:55,204
but the doctors say
that sooner or later...

254
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:01,038
But I can't see why I should lay
all this on my family when...

255
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:03,882
things may...

256
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:09,534
resolve themselves on their own

257
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:14,249
without anyone else knowing.

258
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:23,536
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

259
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:28,049
- What are we doing in this shit hole?
- Just relax, will you?

260
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,659
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

261
00:31:30,784 --> 00:31:32,398
We should have went to Chili's, man.

262
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,323
All right, already. Jesus.

263
00:31:34,637 --> 00:31:35,963
Outback Steakhouse.

264
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:39,038
It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

265
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:41,446
What's wrong with spicing
things up a little bit?

266
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:44,195
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

267
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:49,055
So when are you headed
back down to El Paso?

268
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,249
You know,
between the packing and errands

269
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:55,898
and getting my ducks in a row,
maybe a week or two.

270
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:57,223
A week or two?

271
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,627
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

272
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,215
Yeah, well, it's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

273
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,414
What are you talking about?
There ain't jack going on up here.

274
00:32:05,744 --> 00:32:07,194
It's quiet as hell.

275
00:32:08,757 --> 00:32:10,557
I'm going to hit the head.

276
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:43,805
Those two over there.

277
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:46,641
I think they're holding.

278
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:51,591
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

279
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:57,329
All right.

280
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:00,104
- What are you doing?
- Calling APD. What do you think?

281
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,786
Since when can't we handle
a couple of dirtballs?

282
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,811
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

283
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:07,986
What if Vice is running
some kind if undercover op?

284
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:11,974
Screw it.

285
00:33:12,662 --> 00:33:14,262
It's your turn to pay.

286
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:51,251
- Where are you going?
- I have to take a leak.

287
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:53,476
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

288
00:34:05,189 --> 00:34:06,139
Stand up.

289
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:16,767
Do you got a problem with us, bitch?

290
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:19,267
Your move.

291
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,881
DEA! Don't move.

292
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,930
Go tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

293
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:31,214
{\pub}

Skyler.

302
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,548
Can we talk?

303
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,331
ASAC wants to see you.

304
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,660
And?

305
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,101
We're hanging back.
Saw a deal go down.

306
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:29,034
I went outside to call it in.

307
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,176
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

308
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:33,301
That's when they attacked you.

309
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:42,389
What I didn't tell them
is that you left your gun

310
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:45,214
under the seat
before you went back inside.

311
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,187
I've done a terrible thing,

312
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,120
but I did it for a good reason.

313
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:09,696
I did it for us.

314
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,350
That...

315
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,883
is college tuition for Walter Junior

316
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:21,501
and Holly, 18 years down the road.

317
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,796
Then it's health insurance
for you and the kids,

318
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,727
for Junior's physical therapy,

319
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:34,979
his SAT tutor.

320
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:39,281
It's money for groceries

321
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:42,303
and gas,

322
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,690
for birthdays
and graduation parties.

323
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:54,509
That money is for this roof
over your head,

324
00:39:55,397 --> 00:39:57,772
the mortgage that you are not going
to be able to afford

325
00:39:58,135 --> 00:40:00,826
on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

326
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:02,569
- Walt, I...
- Please.

327
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,163
Please.

328
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:11,319
This money...

329
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,680
I didn't steal it.

330
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:17,135
It doesn't belong to anyone else.

331
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:19,799
I earned it.

332
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:23,142
The things I've...

333
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,519
done to earn it...

334
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,350
The...

335
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:34,738
the...

336
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:37,289
things I've had to do,

337
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:42,209
I've got to live with them.

338
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:50,246
Skyler.

339
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,703
All that I've done,

340
00:40:56,672 --> 00:40:58,913
all the sacrifices that I have...

341
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,585
made for this family, all of that

342
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:07,314
will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've earned.

343
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,240
Please.

344
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:17,879
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

345
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,370
You can give me your answer then.

346
00:41:44,985 --> 00:41:45,935
Hey, Sky.

347
00:42:45,805 --> 00:42:46,905
Some coffee?

348
00:42:48,111 --> 00:42:48,903
Yeah.

349
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,145
That report's looking real good.

350
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,592
- I like how it looks.
- Good.

351
00:43:03,968 --> 00:43:05,418
Are your kids home?

352
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,543
<i>Oh, it's here, it's here!</i>

353
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:49,032
<i>Everybody, come on in!</i>

354
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:53,339
Hello, Mrs. White.

355
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:56,886
Hi, Louis.

356
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:59,862
Thanks for having me over
for dinner.

357
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,920
Um, sure.

358
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:03,889
Hey, Skyler.

359
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:07,939
I'm, uh, cooking dinner.

360
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:09,728
Pot roast.

361
00:44:11,673 --> 00:44:12,773
Could you...

362
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:34,717
So how was your day?

363
00:44:36,904 --> 00:44:37,696
Good.

364
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:40,803
Good. Excellent.

365
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:43,354
I hope you don't mind.

366
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:46,529
I invited Louis to stay
for dinner tonight,

367
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:50,772
you know, as a thank you for driving
Walter Junior to school for us.

368
00:44:51,944 --> 00:44:54,254
We've been kind of absent,

369
00:44:54,964 --> 00:44:58,805
but I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

370
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:07,808
Look, I just want to say that I...

371
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:10,952
I feel good
about our talk this morning,

372
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:13,877
I'm very eager to hear
what you're thinking about...

373
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,363
about what we talked about.

374
00:45:16,488 --> 00:45:19,135
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

375
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:28,580
Honesty is good.

376
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,140
Don't you think?

377
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:54,519
I fucked Ted.

378
00:46:04,372 --> 00:46:05,522
Boys, dinner.

379
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:10,087
Who wants tea?

380
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:13,838
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

381
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:20,039
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

382
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:24,095
- Really?
- I know. Nobody likes salad,

383
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:26,250
but it's good for you.

384
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,475
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
