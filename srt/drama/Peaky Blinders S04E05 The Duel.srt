You're drunk. Again.

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,896
I'm drunk again.

170

Tell me what you said to me
this morning.

173
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,250
Tell me... Tell me again.

174
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,094
Tell me.

175
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,134
Say it, say it, say it. Tell me.

176
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,529
We'll be back in our garden

177
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,852
before the time comes to plant
anything out.

178
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,093

No fucking way.

185

You've never eaten hedgehog, Michael?

186
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,613
I'm getting back in this car.

187
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,057
Michael, you're number two
on Luca Changretta's hit list.

188
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,893
Yeah, and I'll stay in a hotel.

189

If you stay in a hotel,
I'll know where you are.

190
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,614
So will the people who take you there.

191
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,612
So will the people
who work in the hotel.

192
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,016
And hotels don't move around.

193
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,091
They don't even know
where they'll be tomorrow.

194

They follow the patron and the crows.

195

And if anyone
should come for you, Michael,

196
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,899
the Palmers and the Boswells
will put up a fair fight.

Show some respect, Mr Gray.

202
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,931
They've agreed to welcome you
on account of your blood.

Take the gun.

205
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,059
I won't be able to contact you,

206
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,060
till you phone me.

207
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,820
We'll make a plan.

208
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,978
Tommy says it won't be long.

209
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,974
Then we'll be free.

210

213
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,776
You're royalty up there, Michael.

Is that true, Mrs Gray?

215

00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,859
Don't I look like royalty?

217
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,818
Well, now that you mention it, you do.

he used to take us out.

Yes.

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,333
Your wife's often around you.

She watches you.

when I put my head in a noose.

a window and seeing the whole world.

I believe it's you who's kept
Tommy Shelby alive all these years.

250
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,492
How we've kept each other alive...

251
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,015
That I didn't just put my head
through that window.

252
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,859
I climbed through it.

253
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,494
First, I thought it was madness,
but, no.

254
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,891

out of that window,

Let me make one thing clear, Mr Gold.

267
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,254
I just gave Michael a little speech

268
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,536
about how no one would know
where to find him.

269
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,453
But you'd know how to get him.

If any harm comes to Michael,

271
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,817
you shall have me as your enemy.

272
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,934
And none of your knives can kill me.

273
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,700

going to stop a revolution?

my invitation to dinner.

(SCOFFS) Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

491
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,211
Tommy Shelby is gonna stop
the revolution with his cock.

492
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,417
It's not her
the military are interested in.

493
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,980
It's the people around her.

494
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,056
The people like you used to be.
Like Freddie used to be.

she gives me the names
of the instigators,

498

500
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,251

501
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,299
at the bottom of the Saltley Canal
want to help the British military?

three five-year contracts

Tommy, this can only happen
if you're still alive.

510
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,052
I'm planning on staying alive.

- No, we weren't.

All right, well, since I invited you

These two beauties
were shot this morning

545
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,973

00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,417
at Lord Packwood's estate.

I thought you'd like that. These here,

these were stolen from under his trees.

Mr Shelby, I came to talk business.

00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,455
Yes.

551
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,613
So did I.

552
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,412
Wage cuts withdrawn, parity between
men and women guaranteed.

You can instruct your members
to return to work tomorrow.

554
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,094
And all I have to do in return

555
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,297
is tell you everything I know
about socialism.

556
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,413
That's what your sister said.

557

It's okay.

What do you want to know
about the cause?

561
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,939
I'm approaching
the current political crisis

562
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,054
as I would approach a horse race.

563
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,809
Assessing the runners and the riders.

564
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,372
Now the favourite is,
of course, the King's horse,

565
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,452
but the King's horse
was also the favourite in 1913

566
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,294
when Emily Davison
threw herself in front of it.

567
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,417
You know the names of Suffragettes?

568
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,580
I'm impressed.

569
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,295
Ah, everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look,

570
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,450
women with serious faces everywhere.

571
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,295
When I study a horse race, I study form,

572
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,014
and on the other horse, the one
that wants to beat the King's horse,

573
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,936
let's call her "Dangerous", shall we?
She's no form.

574
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,930
- That's what makes her so dangerous.
- Russia.

575
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,772
- Isn't that form?
- Ah.

576
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,776
The Russians are not like the English.
We're beer, they're petrol.

577
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,137
So I invited you here for dinner,

578
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,937
because you know people.

579
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,373
People that want to make this fight
real with guns and ammunition.

580
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,380
So before I place a bet
on who's gonna win,

581
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,018
I need to know how strong they are.

582
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,940
How serious they are.

583
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:37,778
Your concern is
that if the unthinkable happened,

584
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,052
you would find yourself
on the wrong side of the barricades.

585
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,012
Well, as you can see,

586
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:50,337
my natural side of the barricades,
is the same as yours and, as you know,

587
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,819
I once believed...

588
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,619
But the war changed you?

589
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,295
Yeah.

590
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,210
Man I love couldn't speak
when he got back.

591
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,334
Not one word.

592
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,015

00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,452
- Well, well.
- Yes.
