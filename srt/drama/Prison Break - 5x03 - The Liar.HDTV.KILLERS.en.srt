1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:02,070
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:03,573
The strikes are getting closer.

3
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:05,617
We got a day, maybe two, tops,

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,359
- to get out of this hole.
- Desperate times, desperate measures.

5
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:11,531
- Michael's reaching out to us.
- We got to get help. A woman named Sheba.

6
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,768
Your brother speaks in riddles, does he?

7
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,323
ISIL. We're gonna get stopped.

8
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:17,581
Why don't we forget
each other ever existed.

9
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,385
Beauty's not so easily forgotten.

10
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:22,010
Friends in high places, Bagwell.

11
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,284
I can equip you with a
fully articulate prosthetic.

12
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:26,867
- Who's behind this?
- Nobody.

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,547
- This is Kaniel Outis.
- Okay, but you and I both know

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,934
- who Michael Scofield was.
- We've awoken something,

15
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:34,095
something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

16
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,664
Jacob?

17
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,348
That's game theory. You meet people.

18
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,742
You bring them into your life

19
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:39,989
until the moment

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,577
you need to manipulate the relationship

21
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,630
to your advantage.

22
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,128
You agreed to help him... how?

23
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,630
If I could arrange a blackout.

24
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,432
He knew someone who could get him out.

25
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,285
Someone found my father.

26
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:50,607
It means the escape is on.

27
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,202
ISIL forces are also bent

28
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:54,189
on freeing their leader Abu Ramal,

29
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,726
known for his extreme
views and practices.

30
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:00,101
_

31
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,975
_

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,281
_

33
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:53,888
_

34
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:48,961
He says Bubble Gum Man sent him.

35
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:51,888
Someone in the prison he hasn't met,

36
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:55,478
but gives him gum in
exchange for errands.

37
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:58,014
He says he's frightened.

38
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,816
Tell him it's all right.

39
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:02,718
Ask him if he does Tic Tacs.

40
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,185
He can have the whole lot

41
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:06,823
if he keeps the messages coming.

42
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,392
Thank you, Tic Tac Man.

43
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:16,365
Tic Tac, Tic Tac, Tic Tacs.

44
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,034
It's a passage from the Suras.

45
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,467
"And Yusef said to the prisoner:

46
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,004
'Remember me in the
presence of your lord.'

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,673
"But Satan made him forget,

48
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,975
and Yusef stayed in prison

49
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:27,410
for several years."

50
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:29,078
The calligraphy is unusual,

51
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:32,058
the spacing, the way it's shaped,

52
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,995
like, like spokes on a wheel.

53
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:37,360
Like the center of Sana'a.

54
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:43,349
You think his brother sent us a map?

55
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:44,760
There's a red dot

56
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:47,141
dotting the "I",

57
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:49,091
and whatever this is here.

58
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,824
He's trying to give us a location.

59
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:53,026
A location for what?

60
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:54,189
The only thing I can think of

61
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,605
is where we're supposed to meet him

62
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,634
when the escape goes down tonight.

63
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,882
Your brother is your business now.

64
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:05,043
I have to get my family
on a flight tonight

65
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,519
- before the airport shuts down.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

66
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,908
Hold up.

67
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:09,541
We need tickets, too, three of them.

68
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:11,344
One for me, one for Michael, one for C.

69
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,850
If I'm getting anybody any
tickets it's these kids,

70
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,286
not your mercenary brother.

71
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,488
And how are you going to
do that without any money?

72
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,107
You're holding these kids' freedom

73
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,509
over my head, is that it?

74
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:26,845
Sheba, you get me those plane tickets,

75
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,459
and I'll pay for every
single one of these kids

76
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:30,845
to get out of this country.

77
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:34,086
Something tells me that's
what you want to do anyhow.

78
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,287
Careful.

79
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,964
You're accusing me of having a heart.

80
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:55,407
Out of my way. Get out of my way.

81
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:57,376
Hmm? Huh? What, you want to go?

82
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:59,578
Hey.

83
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,116
Keep it together.

84
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,395
You got to have it together
to keep it together.

85
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,488
One of those hits us now,

86
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,690
- after all this time, I swear to God...
- Nine hours.

87
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,226
Nine hours till we get
out, you understand?

88
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,465
It's 1:00 a.m.

89
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:17,496
We get through today
and we're on the bricks.

90
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:18,931
And then what?

91
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,621
It was four years ago.

92
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,790
All of our plans, the
passports, the shop,

93
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:25,894
everything is probably
under rubble by now.

94
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:28,622
I got someone on it.

95
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,510
What, the kid you throw planes to?

96
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:35,378
No.

97
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,583
I'm talking about the only
person I trust in the world

98
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:40,586
as much as I trust you.

99
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,591
So, this is it, the spot on the map.

100
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,391
The owner says he sold the auto shop

101
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:47,860
to an American four years ago

102
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,462
and hasn't seen him since.

103
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:07,894
You know that American
was Michael, right?

104
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:10,897
Question is what was
he using this place for.

105
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:14,167
Planning his escape.

106
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,624
It looks like his original exfil point

107
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,226
was at the northern border.

108
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,368
Won't be doing that now.

109
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,779
It's ISIL territory.

110
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:32,252
Mock-ups, passport photos,

111
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:34,587
disguises.

112
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:38,258
But it looks like he just wasn't
planning on getting himself out.

113
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:40,460
He was getting Abu Ramal out.

114
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,397
This guy's the enemy

115
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,033
of everything that's civilized, Linc.

116
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:50,403
That brings me to my real question.

117
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:52,277
Who in the hell are we breaking out?

118
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,940
Is it Michael Scofield

119
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:56,476
or Kaniel Outis?

120

_

123
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,213
What the hell's going on?

124
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:46,813
Ramal's men are gonna
institute Sharia law.

125
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,349
And that son of a bitch
himself is gonna enjoy the show.

126
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:51,552
We just have to keep our
heads down and get through this

127
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,476
- so we can get out tonight.
- _

128
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:57,227

129
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,963
_

130
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,665
No. No, don't let them take me!

131
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,534
No!

132
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,544
_

133
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,589
_

134
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,626
- Sorry.
- No!

135
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,181
_

136
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,585
_

137
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,732
_

138
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,301
Ramal!

139
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,508
Get back. Just let him go.

140
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,310
Ramal!

141
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:52,913
What are you doing?

142
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,080
- Stay out of this.
- No.

143
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,549
The escape is tonight.

144
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,084
If you want to get out, you
need me and you need him.

145
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,719
Get to the point.

146
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,756
Let him go, Ramal.

147
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:10,230
Then I'll do it.

148
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:12,098
Do not touch him.

149
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,400
Get back, dog!

150
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,441
There will be no killing in
this prison... Understand?

151
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:33,320
He's tried to contact her before.

152
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:36,323
Only difference is he
succeeded this time.

153
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,292
It's smart... going through the boy.

154
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,534
Ask a question?

155
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,407
Why are we pulling our
punches with this woman?

156
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,638
I got sent to her house
a couple of days ago,

157
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,640
started spilling blood, but
I'm just supposed to stop

158
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,910
before I start spilling hers.

159
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,345
How's that work?

160
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,182
You'll get used to Poseidon's game.

161
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,817
It's all chess.

162
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,353
It's a performance.

163
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,660
A performance designed to
make Outis reach out to her.

164
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,762
Now all we got to do is listen in,

165
00:10:15,797 --> 00:10:18,265
find out what his plans are.

166
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,333
And she doesn't know it.

167
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,371
She's the one that's
going to lead us to him.

168
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:25,777
They said I can go in the morning.

169
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,172
Your femoral artery was severed.

170
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,243
That's not something you usually
just get up and walk away from.

171
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,480
Hey, they gave me the okay.

172
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,282
They're the doctors
on this one, not you.

173
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:38,297
And I'm going full mental
in here, so I'm gonna go.

174
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,319
Okay. How about this?

175
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,622
When you are discharged,

176
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:45,158
why don't we go up to
your parents' lake house?

177
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:47,927
I'll just pick you up
with Mike and we'll go.

178
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,256
Mmm.

179
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:52,223
You don't want to be
in the house, do you?

180
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,221
Somebody comes into your house

181
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,518
and shoots up your husband
and they're still out there.

182
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,030
No.

183
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,698
What?

184
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:02,767
No, it's just something
you do with your nose

185
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:03,968
when you're determined.

186
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,470
- With my nose?
- It's subtle.

187
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,505
- I mean, it's really subtle.
- Better be.

188
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,575
The face is amazing.

189
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,377
I mean,

190
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:16,548
the tiniest detail,
less than a millimeter,

191
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,416
differentiates everything.

192
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,519
An emotion on one person can be...

193
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,222
so troubled

194
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,218
and on another...

195
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,191
so beautiful.

196
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:33,695
You're not trying to get
somewhere, are you, Mr. Ness?

197
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:35,531
Yes, actually,

198
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:36,767
I am.

199
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,520
Hello there.

200
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:58,210
I come as a compatriot, Sara.

201
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:00,327
Get out of my way or I'll scream.

202
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,245
Last thing I want.

203
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,993
For your information,

204
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,263
I know about Kaniel Outis.

205
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,277
Tell me what you know.

206
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,929
The day I hit the bricks from Fox River,

207
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,531
someone named Outis,

208
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,300
out of the goodness of their soul,

209
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:28,783
unsolicited, pays for
this modern prosthesis.

210
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:31,439
What's that?

211
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,042
A million bucks? Why would anyone

212
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:35,717
come out of a pocket
for a wretch like me,

213
00:12:35,746 --> 00:12:37,946
a penny, much less a million bucks?

214
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:41,604
Yeah, if you're coming to me
for answers, I don't have any.

215
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,386
Oh, I went looking
for answers, Doc Sara.

216
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,721
I looked up Outis on the Interwebs.

217
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:49,291
Whose face comes up but
your dead ex-husband's,

218
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:50,525
looking very much alive.

219
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,527
Lazarus arisen from the dead.

220
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,363
He's drawing us into
something, isn't he?

221
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,733
He wants something, doesn't he?

222
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,237
Come near me or my family
again, I will kill you.

223
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:04,372
Better to have me on your side, Sara.

224
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,608
We can figure this out together.

225
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,088
We have all heard the war

226
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,853
outside.

227
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:22,289
But even if it is just
within these walls,

228
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:25,903
the law of the land is still in place.

229
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:30,298
The law of God supersedes
the law of this corrupt land.

230
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,969
We will not be reduced to animals.

231
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:38,940
Amazing you still trust him.

232
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,443
He will use you for the
escape and he will leave you.

233
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,245
No one's escaping.

234
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,947
Who are you?

235
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,549
A man who knows your friend there

236
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,017
more than anyone in this prison.

237
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:51,052
I was in solitary with him

238
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,253
- for years.
- Yeah, so was I.

239
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,053
But not in the cell across from him.

240
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:57,125
He told me about the escape.

241
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,519
- We have to work together.
- No.

242
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,936
Tried to convince me to go with him,

243
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,999
just the two of us.

244
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:05,834
But I told him no.

245
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:08,003
I would not leave my brother.

246
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:09,838
That is the Army in me,

247
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:12,043
the Christian in me.

248
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,642
He is an opportunist.

249
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:16,111
He will use whoever he needs.

250
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,780
He has told you something
about the escape. I know he has.

251
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,582
You were in the cell with him. You.

252
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:23,551
You tell me, so I can help you,

253
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:27,288
before he uses you to get that devil out

254
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,080
and we are all left here to die.

255
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:47,208
We need passports, Omar.
You think you can help us?

256
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:49,638
Hold on. We're gonna trust this guy?

257
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:52,002
He's the one who stole my
passport in the first place.

258
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,967
It was honest bargaining, friend.

259
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:55,836
I took nothing. Besides,

260
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:58,271
your passport is long gone,

261
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:00,874
somewhere far overseas by now, I bet.

262
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,478
If you want, um, I can have
the forgers make you another.

263
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:07,047
My own fake passport coming from you?

264
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:08,580
You have another option?

265
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,586
Quick. I'm leaving the city.

266
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,455
Nowhere is safe anymore.

267
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,524
I need two passports. One for me,

268
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,527
one for my brother, Michael Scofield.

269
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,665
$1,000 U.S. each, deposit.

270
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:28,034
$1,000 U.S. when you pick them up.

271
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,771
C?

272
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,308
You screw with me and I'll kill you.

273
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:36,810
I screw you,

274
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:39,346
I won't be around for you to kill me.

275
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:41,381
11:00 tonight, Sheba.

276
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,383
Passports will be ready.

277
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,386
That means we're gonna have to split up.

278
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,112
You two get the passports,

279
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,290
and I'll go with our friend
here to the power plant

280
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,759
and kill the lights.

281
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:56,296
And we get Michael out.

282
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,532
A U.S. State Department
spokesperson said

283
00:15:58,567 --> 00:15:59,539
the capital of Yemen

284
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,134
grows ever closer to collapse

285
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,869
and it's only a matter of time

286
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:05,972
until Sana'a's fallen to
the hands of ISIL radicals,

287
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:09,276
with the total collapse
coming as soon as tomorrow.

288
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:13,847
Hey.

289
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,950
Looking for a smartphone?

290
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:18,718
Yeah. You, um...

291
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:20,954
you fix phones, too, right?

292
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,289
Yeah.

293
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:25,525
I think somebody hacked my cell.

294
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:32,065
Whoa.

295
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,136
Is there any chance you
can help me figure out who?

296
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,391
_

297
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,860
_

298
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:50,051
_

299
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,641
_

300
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:54,120
That Christian guy said

301
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,690
you told him you'd just
take him. No one else.

302
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,458
He's a liar. You don't want anything

303
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:01,394
- to do with him.
- I don't know. Christian, Army.

304
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,363
- Seems pretty up front to me.
- Did he happen to tell you

305
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:04,965
about some of the arrests
he and his brother made

306
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,601
- at their security checkpoint?
- No, focused on you.

307
00:17:07,636 --> 00:17:09,402
They had a specialty: women.

308
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,505
Body parts strewn around Yemen.

309
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,906
That's why they're here.

310
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:14,808
Wearing a cross is one thing.

311
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:17,444
- Living by it is another.
- All right, okay, sure.

312
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,778
Just promise me I can trust you,

313
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:20,914
that we're still doing this tonight.

314
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,517
All these years

315
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,105
we've been working together,

316
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,847
you've been able to
trust me the whole time.

317
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,854
Last four years in the
hole, sitting in the dark,

318
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:30,524
I couldn't even hear
a voice. I don't know.

319
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:32,092
Maybe something's changed or...

320
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,694
Nothing's changed.

321
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,430
Poseidon put us in
here to get Ramal out,

322
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,171
but then he abandoned us.
Ramal is Poseidon's guy,

323
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:43,336
- not ours. He's an animal.
- I suggest

324
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:46,706
you watch your mouth. Some
of these guys speak English.

325
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:49,142
Why are we still getting him out?

326
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:51,912
We're telling him we're getting
him out. There's a difference.

327
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,513
We got to act like we're

328
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,002
on his side until the moment we're not.

329
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,583
But what if you're acting
like you're on my side

330
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:57,651
till the moment you're not?

331
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:58,829
You are getting paranoid.

332
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,178
Yeah, well, four years in the
box is gonna do that to you.

333
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,689
I'm not leaving you behind.

334
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,858
- You're my whip hand.
- I don't know that.

335
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,627
How do I know I'm your whip hand?

336
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,930
- You'll understand later.
- I want to understand now.

337
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,198
Okay?

338
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,702
Get your hands off me.

339
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,104
Answers, now. I'm serious.

340
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,706
Okay.

341
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,108
I said don't touch me!

342
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,644
Okay. Mm.

343
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,047
Mm. Okay, that's fair.

344
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:30,106
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

345
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,286
You want the hole again, huh?

346
00:18:32,289 --> 00:18:34,422
No, we're good.

347
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:36,623
No.

348
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,557
We're good.

349
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:40,093
We're far from good.

350
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,276
By tomorrow, we won't
have to worry about him.

351
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:08,575
Keep your head down.

352
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,657
Don't make eye contact with anybody.

353
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:13,193
A lot of ISIL sympathizers everywhere.

354
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:15,462
We get our passports, we're out of here.

355
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:17,130
Understand?

356
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,215
Planning on leaving?

357
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,797
Right when the glorious
revolution is beginning.

358
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,689
I'm not here for political
discussion, just passports.

359
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,893
Money first.

360
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:49,496
Passports first.

361
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,342
They're empty.

362
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:07,747
Sheba!

363
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,510
I'm sorry I hit you.

364
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:30,678
- I can explain.
- Can you explain why

365
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,447
you were going to let that man kill me?

366
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,449
I wouldn't have let him kill you.

367
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,718
You sure seem to be chums
with the head of ISIL, friend.

368
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:39,988
Didn't know you participated
in these conversations, Ja.

369
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:41,689
Only when they're interesting.

370
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:43,758
And they're usually not.

371
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:46,547
There are people in my government,

372
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,283
believe it or not, who want that man out

373
00:20:48,286 --> 00:20:51,099
for their own convoluted
foreign policy over here.

374
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,701
That's the job Whip and
I were sent here to do.

375
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:54,903
But for some reason,

376
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:56,704
we were betrayed.

377
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,507
Which means we're
getting out without Ramal.

378
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,843
And every one of you
is crucial to that plan.

379
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:03,311
How?

380
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,013
Your whole escape's already wired.

381
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,382
Lights out, you're over the wall.

382
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:09,684
What do you need a Korean junkie

383
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:12,320
- like me for?
- Korean genius, you mean.

384
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,575
Getting over that
wall is just the start.

385
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:17,411
Once that happens,

386
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,413
there are things only you can do.

387
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,318
Back on point: you hit me.

388
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:25,518
You wanted proof that I
sided with you and not Ramal.

389
00:21:25,521 --> 00:21:27,689
- And splitting my lip does that how?
- Son of a bitch

390
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,420
Kaniel Outis keeps playing, doesn't he?

391
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,168
Where is my watch?

392
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:42,936
I don't know what you're talking about.

393
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:45,372
Hmm. You don't?

394
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:50,043
I'm going to break you in half
when I find that watch, you know?

395
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,716
Toss the cell.

396
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:25,045
It's not here.

397
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,784
Order a lockdown of the whole prison.

398
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,930
No one gets out of their cells

399
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,787
until that watch is found!

400
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,023
_

401
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:40,943
_

402
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,403
_

403
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:46,782
_

404
00:22:47,536 --> 00:22:50,003
I told you, Ramal's not
going anywhere. Only we are.

405
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:53,129
We're gonna be locked in our
box just like the rest of them,

406
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:54,865
only our box has a way out.

407
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:57,344
And in two hours when
those lights go black,

408
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,713
we're gonna disappear from
this place like ghosts.

409
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,956
Yeah, all right.

410
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,375
Sheba!

411
00:23:29,478 --> 00:23:32,245
Who are these men you work with?

412
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,818
They're beneath you.

413
00:23:37,853 --> 00:23:39,820
You're beneath me.

414
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:47,227
It pains me to hurt you,

415
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:51,898
but a good woman is a humble woman.

416
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:56,069
Remember that.

417
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:58,705
Who are these men?

418
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,540
Doesn't matter.

419
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:02,209
They're leaving.

420
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:05,045
I am not the bad guy here.

421
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:07,555
You and I have a history.

422
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,596
How I doted

423
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:13,186
on you in grade school,
how I waited and I waited.

424
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:15,180
You did not wait.

425
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:16,844
You tried to rape me!

426
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,964
Please.

427
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,368
Please. Please untie me...

428
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:31,922
so I can take your other eye.

429
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:47,254
Afternoon.

430
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:51,832
I'm looking for a cell phone
that a woman stole from me.

431
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,427
She looks like this?

432
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:59,673
No, can't help you.

433
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:02,777
Can't... or won't?

434
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,273
Sorry. Store policy, that's all.

435
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:16,216
Hey, what are you doing?

436
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,084
- Just...
- Ow!

437
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,920
- Oh!
- Let's go again.

438
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:23,857
Have you seen her?

439
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:25,792
Yes. Yes!

440
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:28,495
She was here, like, ten minutes ago.

441
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,645
Said her phone was hacked
and wanted to know who did it.

442
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:32,814
And now she knows, doesn't she?

443
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,872
She baited us.

444
00:25:56,858 --> 00:25:58,509
Dead end.

445
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,003
Any chance Poseidon'll just

446
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,271
- let us kill her?
- It might come to that.

447
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,992
We get out, where are you going?

448
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,994
Back to my couch.

449
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:18,129
My couch in Seoul.

450
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:20,498
Where the walls are mine,

451
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:23,801
the floors are mine,

452
00:27:23,837 --> 00:27:25,949
no one can get to me.

453
00:27:26,002 --> 00:27:29,003
The world stays outside
like it's supposed to.

454
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,976
Calgary.

455
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:33,511
Canada?

456
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:37,148
I'm going to be a ski jumper.

457
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:40,518
You've never seen snow, have you?

458
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:42,387
That's the point.

459
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:44,989
Everything in my life
till now in this country...

460
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:49,627
The heat, the hate, the
skies that never snow.

461
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:51,985
You talk about the world.

462
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:54,282
I want to be on the other side of it.

463
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,142
_

464
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:07,812
Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom.

465
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,347
Hi, son. Yeah, Sara,

466
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:11,459
- let me, uh...
- Thanks, sir.

467
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:14,818
Oh, give me one sec. Sorry.

468
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,488
Hello?

469
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:20,889
Hi. This is Brian at
Jep's. I got this number

470
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:22,593
when I activated your new phone.

471
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:24,077
You never came back.

472
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,914
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm going to.

473
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:28,468
Well, okay, I just want
to let you know that

474
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:30,868
I figured out who was
hacking your phone.

475
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:32,437
Who?

476
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,301
You... hacked your own phone.

477
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,403
What are you talking about?

478
00:28:35,406 --> 00:28:38,598
Your thumbprint is your
password, right? Well,

479
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:41,231
whoever hacked your phone
used your thumbprint, so,

480
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:44,983
unless you're missing
a thumb, that's you.

481
00:28:44,986 --> 00:28:46,884
I don't know what you're messed up in,

482
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,311
but I'd watch your back...

483
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:51,956
When you were in the hospital,

484
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:54,741
the woman who attacked us
came back with her partner.

485
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:55,559
What?

486
00:28:55,562 --> 00:28:57,250
They tracked me down
using my cell phone,

487
00:28:57,253 --> 00:28:59,563
so I brought it to Jep's
to try and figure out

488
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:01,720
- who they were working for.
- Whoa, wait. Sara, this has police

489
00:29:01,722 --> 00:29:03,891
- written all over it.
- Police haven't been able to do a thing.

490
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:05,670
So, what? You went to Jep's Electronics

491
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:07,981
in some hackneyed attempt
at counter-espionage?

492
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:11,275
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...

493
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,211
I get you don't know where to turn,

494
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:14,879
but I got a stake in this, too.

495
00:29:14,914 --> 00:29:17,749
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay? This is my wife, my son.

496
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:20,494
You want to get back at these guys?

497
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,722
The university. I mean,
it has real resources,

498
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:24,089
their computer sciences department.

499
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:26,356
The phone's done. It's
gonna stay at Jep's.

500
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,049
So that's your plan... just
bury your head in the sand?

501
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,731
No.

502
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:36,200
No, I've learned over the years

503
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:38,770
that's exactly what
you don't do. Thank you.

504
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:52,207
Which one's this?

505
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:54,676
The one you accosted in a bathroom.

506
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:57,612
Oh, that wasn't accostment, honey.

507
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:59,648
I've learned some things

508
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:03,385
about who it is we're
apparently both looking for?

509
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,021
But I need to know that you're
willing to go the distance.

510
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,457
I'm made of the distance, honeysuckle.

511
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:10,607
I am the distance.

512
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,061
Good. Because you're
gonna have a conversation

513
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,629
with Paul Kellerman for me.

514
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,132
Bull. Kellerman's behind this?

515
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,167
And you are gonna get
every shred of information

516
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:21,770
you can about what's really going on.

517
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:27,142
15 minutes.

518
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:31,012
I'm soiling myself
here, just so you know.

519
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:41,224
Look, I'm just gonna
say one thing, okay?

520
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,625
You're like a brother to me,

521
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,360
like an older brother.

522
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:47,872
- I'm not much of a brother.
- Sure.

523
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:51,333
Point is that I had zero,
nobody, till you recruited me.

524
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:54,896
When you pulled me out of that prison
in the Ozarks, you had integrity.

525
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:01,209
I know we were doing CIA work, sure,

526
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:02,944
you know, pulling their people out, but

527
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,282
it was about you and me,
and having each other's back.

528
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:09,678
And it didn't matter if you
were Ramon Cadena when we did

529
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:12,753
the Colombian break,
or, you know Asaf...

530
00:31:12,756 --> 00:31:15,190
What was his name?

531
00:31:15,225 --> 00:31:17,526
Whatever. The one in Egypt.

532
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:19,428
You were still you.

533
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:23,973
And it's the same with this one.

534
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:26,435
You know, we trump
you up as Kaniel Outis,

535
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,136
big international terrorist.

536
00:31:28,172 --> 00:31:31,696
It's just a name,

537
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:35,500
it's just a rap sheet, it's
a way to get you locked up.

538
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:36,869
Right?

539
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,050
I guess what I'm asking you is did...

540
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,836
did something happen to you
while you were in solitary?

541
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:49,537
Did you become Kaniel Outis

542
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,828
in there in your head?

543
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:56,331
Do you now want Ramal out after all?

544
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:59,676
I already told you Ramal
is out of the picture.

545
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,146
Yeah, you said that,
but one small thing...

546
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:04,989
We go up through that hole,

547
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,926
and then we skirt above the block.

548
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:10,879
Goes right above
Ramal's cell, doesn't it?

549
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:13,081
Knock out a couple tiles,

550
00:32:13,116 --> 00:32:16,485
he joins the escape, doesn't he?

551
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,456
What did you whisper to him

552
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:24,059
in that moment after the fight?

553
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,331
You whispered something, what was it?

554
00:32:29,972 --> 00:32:32,907
Nine minutes.

555
00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:34,508
How do you know?

556
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,838
He told me at dinner.

557
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:39,107
He said he would come for us.

558
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:42,611
It's supposed to be only me,

559
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:45,614
but you will all be coming.

560
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,155
Open block five.

561
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:53,159
Everyone out.

562
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:54,660
Shakedown.

563
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:09,142
Got it.

564
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:12,706
Found it, Mustapha. It was
in the emir's coat here.

565
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,906
You trusted the liar, didn't you?

566
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:25,684
Now, we just pray they
get the lights out.

567
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,820
We got to hurry, man.

568
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,054
We got less than ten minutes

569
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:30,889
to kill the power.

570
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,428
Don't worry.

571
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:34,972
With luck, both your friend and my son

572
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,641
will be free within the hour.

573
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:41,308
Okay, breakers are down.

574
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,418
Now, we just need to
pull the redundancies.

575
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,887
They're down the hall.

576
00:33:44,918 --> 00:33:47,005
I'll stay here and
deal with security. Go.

577
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:51,243
Okay.

578
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:53,345
Come on, where are you?

579
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,680
Ah.

580
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,684
Oh, come on.

581
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,018
Oh, when in doubt, go old school.

582
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,390
Let's go.

583
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,277
Get the generators up.

584
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,668
Get these inmates back inside!

585
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,278
Now!

586
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:35,954
Let's go, let's go!

587
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:38,957
The weapons, get their weapons.

588
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,810
They are trying to escape without us.

589
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,368
Get to their cell.

590
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:54,273
Block six. Come on!

591
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,725
You heard them, brother.

592
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:03,994
- Block six.
- Yes.

593
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:05,999
Ja, give me your phone.

594
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:07,802
Come on.

595
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,799
Mount flashlights.

596
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,100
Secure every room.

597
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:17,769
Shoot only if you have to.

598
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:19,804
And if you do, shoot to kill.

599
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:43,317
This way.

600
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,897
A shortcut to block
six, brother, come on!

601
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:48,299
Get off me, you sick bastard!

602
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:50,234
It's easier if you don't struggle.

603
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,398
This is how you treat me?

604
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,976
You're going to die now, dog.

605
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:43,321
Sheba, Sheba, it's me, it's me.

606
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:45,523
Are you okay?

607
00:36:56,604 --> 00:36:57,803
Linc, talk to me.

608
00:36:57,831 --> 00:37:00,064
Get to the rendezvous, the auto shop.

609
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:02,182
We ain't gonna make it.
Sheba's busted up real bad.

610
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:04,209
- What happened?
- Just get to the rendezvous.

611
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:07,079
We got to be there for Michael, damn it!

612
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,984
Damn. Lockdown.

613
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,953
Extra guards on the roof.

614
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:16,956
Question is whether they move on.

615
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:20,092
Quickly! Hurry, hurry!

616
00:37:20,128 --> 00:37:21,727
It's here, this one!

617
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:24,852
We got problems.

618
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:27,600
- Guys are trying to get into the cell.
- Problem.

619
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,168
- What's wrong?
- People coming.

620
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:30,403
Damn it, we got guards up here.

621
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:31,637
Try and buy us some time.

622
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:33,839
I'm taking care of it.

623
00:37:36,135 --> 00:37:37,777
No, they're escaping, hurry!

624
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:42,365
Ah!

625
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,284
No, please! Don't leave us.

626
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,819
Please, we are Christians,

627
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:48,454
they will kill us! Please!

628
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:50,022
No, we're still not clear up top.

629
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:51,257
Make sure they don't get up.

630
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,858
Go!

631
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:54,227
They're coming, Ja.

632
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:56,295
- How we doing?
- Not good.

633
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,331
Guards are even closer.

634
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:01,000
Pull yourself up!

635
00:38:05,773 --> 00:38:07,473
Help, help!

636
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:09,942
Sid!

637
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:15,982
Sid!

638
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:19,385
Help me out!

639
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,653
Get him up here first.

640
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:21,921
That's not how this works.

641
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:23,756
You pull my brother up first.

642
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,725
Hurry, Ramal is coming.

643
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,060
Lend me your hand. I swear I'm gonna...

644
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,162
The kid comes up first!

645
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,333
Step away, step away.

646
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:36,602
- No!
- Muza, Muza, look at me!

647
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:38,504
Muza! Muza!

648
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:40,473
No! No, look at me, brother.

649
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:44,010
Go, go, go! It's Ramal.

650
00:38:44,045 --> 00:38:45,645
Look at me! Muza!

651
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,687
Hurry. We've got a minute
tops to get out of here.

652
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:55,788
Get up there, after him.

653
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:57,590
Drop them!

654
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:59,992
Drop them!

655
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:01,661
Put it down!

656
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:08,977
Do it!

657
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:14,273
- No!
- Down, now!

658
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,943
- Board spans the gap.
- Blanket covers the wire.

659
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:19,912
Get out!

660
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:27,119
What are you doing in this cell?

661
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:32,191
They're on the roof!

662
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:44,603
Don't shoot!

663
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,539
I trusted you, Kaniel Outis.

664
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,131
And you lied to me.

665
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:49,835
By God and my armies of the caliphate,

666
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:51,404
you will die for it.

667
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:53,639
Maybe even tomorrow.

668
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:40,820
Sara...

669
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,591
I'm putting you in
danger by saying this,

670
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:49,161
but maybe it doesn't
matter because I'll be dead,

671
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:51,298
and they'll leave you alone.

672
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:57,722
But I love you.

673
00:41:57,773 --> 00:42:01,041
You see, I loved you.

674
00:42:01,091 --> 00:42:05,644
I never stopped loving you.

675
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,582
This whole lie, it was for you.

676
00:42:10,651 --> 00:42:15,521
Sara, if I... if I do die,

677
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:18,624
don't let them put Kaniel
Outis on the headstone

678
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:22,428
because that's never what it was.

679
00:42:23,914 --> 00:42:27,299
Make them put my real name,

680
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,702
the man I have always been.

681
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:36,275
Michael Scofield.

682
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:56,783
