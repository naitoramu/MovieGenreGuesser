1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:02,108
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,283 --> 00:00:04,964
It's the only building sitting
on top of those tunnels.

3
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:07,802
All we gotta do is get in there--
on PI--

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,507
and dig ourselves an onramp.

5
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:10,704
I'm gonna find out, you know,

6
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,384
what it is you're
doing up there.

7
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:16,857
If we talked about who had motive to
kill Terrence, we'd be here all day.

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,320
Have anything to
do with EcoField?

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,981
Do the math. CEO of a corporation
gets indicted for fraud,

10
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:23,628
investors start losing money.
Lots of money.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,971
You call Nick Savrinn,
works for Project Justice.

12
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:27,048
They're here.

13
00:00:27,502 --> 00:00:28,645
Who's here?

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,875
LJ? LJ?!

15
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:33,209
You gotta come get me.

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,110
We can't, okay. We're not in Chicago.
You have to come to us.

17
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,674
First of the month
is coming up, John.

18
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,888
Yeah, so?

19
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:41,981
Checked my balance online,
it's looking seriously deficient.

20
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:44,618
Apparently, Fibonacci's
coming up for air again.

21
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:49,044
And if he testifies at that hearing,
a lot of people are going down,

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,815
including me.

23
00:00:50,956 --> 00:00:54,365
Listen, there, uh,
there's been a restructuring.

24
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:56,261
This comes from Philly himself.

25
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,254
So I'm the man in here now.

26
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,112
What the hell are you doing?

27
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:05,230
Uh-oh. We got a problem.

28
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Bellick. What's going on?

29
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:11,110
That's PI. I run it.

30
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,520
Not anymore you don't.

31
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:19,438
Bellick.

32
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,021
Hey, boss.

33
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:23,728
Check that volume, inmate.

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,728
We been doing business too long.
We can fix this thing, right?

35
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,892
Let's get something clear.

36
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,364
You and I haven't done crap.
Falzone's the one been paying me.

37
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,923
Falzone is just an envelope.

38
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:37,267
You've been doing business
with me face-to-face.

39
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:40,915
You think I like getting
piss thrown at me? Spit on?

40
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,533
These other chumps might do
it for the 40 grand a year

41
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:46,972
and the little blue uniform,
but I'm not that dumb.

42
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:51,290
Falzone's envelope is the only reason
I come through that fence every day.

43
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:52,854
And it's the only reason

44
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:55,562
I'm gonna keep coming
through that fence

45
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,778
until I have enough money to
buy that house on Lake Gray.

46
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,007
I'm thinking early
retirement, John,

47
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,665
and you're
interfering with that.

48
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,880
Hey, boss,
just give me some time,

49
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:07,822
and I can match whatever
Falzone's paying you.

50
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:11,296
You're out of business.
Get used to it.

51
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,815
Hey, boss. Boss!

52
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,008
They're gonna find it.

53
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,855
The longer they're in there,
the sooner they're gonna find it.

54
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,593
Then we got to
get back in there.

55
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,696
I'm gonna say something
crazy to you right now.

56
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:46,287
Surprise, surprise.

57
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:49,364
I don't give a damn
about Fibonacci anymore.

58
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,067
You're right. That is crazy.

59
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:54,539
Because I got bigger things to
think about, like survival.

60
00:03:55,053 --> 00:03:57,480
You see,
I'm kinda short on friends in here,

61
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,140
in case you haven't noticed.

62
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:04,374
I need to get out. Right now.

63
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,059
While I still got my life.

64
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:08,195
Then why are we talking
about Fibonacci?

65
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:10,805
Well, the only way I
can get that room back

66
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:13,204
is if I can prove to Falzone
that I'm still worthy,

67
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:15,375
that I still got
what it takes. Yeah?

68
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,320
And the only way I can do that
is if I can give him Fibonacci.

69
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,300
Interesting.

70
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:26,873
You see, this is not a "me
versus you" thing anymore.

71
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,768
This is us,
an "us" thing, all right?

72
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,855
It's us for the escape.

73
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:32,709
Is it?

74
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,883
Or is this about you getting
back in good with the mob again?

75
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:37,868
That life is over for me, Fish.

76
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:39,948
I mean, they clipped my wings.

77
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,175
They want me to rot in here.

78
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,965
So I got no allegiance
to them anymore.

79
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:47,415
Yet you still want
to do them a favor.

80
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:52,454
Falzone is desperate.

81
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:56,782
You see, if Fibonacci testifies in
front of the congress next month,

82
00:04:56,874 --> 00:04:59,014
Falzone's going to
go down in flames.

83
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:03,629
But if we give him Fibonacci,
he will give us anything--

84
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,718
anything-- including
that very special room.

85
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:11,400
What do you say, Fish?

86
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:30,908
Give him up.

87
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:32,246
If I do, they'll kill him.

88
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,510
Maybe he deserves it.

89
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,648
That's just it, he doesn't.

90
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,705
Who is this guy?
You told me he was Mafia.

91
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,492
He was working for the Mafia,
he just didn't know it.

92
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,654
Otto Fibonacci is...

93
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,878
is just like you.

94
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,726
An innocent man.

95
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,000
Caught in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

96
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,980
What are you doing...?
You know...

97
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,926
I didn't steal from you, John.

98
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:00,987
He was middle management at
one of Abruzzi's warehouses.

99
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:04,747
Just a normal guy.
Working class, religious.

100
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:06,857
I didn't steal from you, John!

101
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:10,029
Hey,  Nicky. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Shh, shh, shh.

102
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,289
What did I tell
you about talking?

103
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,222
John, please.

104
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,199
John, please! No!

105
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:25,507
And somebody that couldn't
turn his back on murder.

106
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,520
He realized that Abruzzi and Falzone--
the men he worked for--

107
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:30,928
were killers.

108
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:32,921
And he had the key to
all their dealings.

109
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,001
Things  that could put
them away for life.

110
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:37,462
And now he's in witness
protection for life.

111
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:41,318
The judge asked him why he was coming
forward with all this information.

112
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:45,262
He said it was because he thought
it was the right thing to do.

113
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,870
What's the right thing
to do now, Michael?

114
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,815
I don't know.

115
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,090
But if I don't give him up,

116
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:55,119
this whole thing's over.

117
00:06:56,942 --> 00:07:01,041
What you're telling me is, if...
if I'm to live...

118
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,253
A good man has to die.

119
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:47,777
Kellerman.

120
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,896
You're in the
place we discussed?

121
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:50,838
Yes.

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,202
I'm still not exactly sure
why we're here, but...

123
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,675
A friend of mine should
be along there shortly.

124
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,616
A friend?

125
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,094
Just to see where
you are with things.

126
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,869
I think we're clear on
where we are with things.

127
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,312
Everything's under control.

128
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,986
Nothing is going to affect tomorrow,
if that's what you're worried about.

129
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,965
I'm not worried about tomorrow.

130
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:12,200
My friend is a problem solver,
that's all.

131
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,624
He's there at your
disposal if you need him.

132
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,473
Do me a favor.

133
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:20,897
Make him feel like
part of the team, hmm?

134
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,743
Talk soon.

135
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:28,248
- What?
- She's bringing someone in.

136
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,748
What does that mean?

137
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,607
Something in her tone changed.

138
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,781
You think she knows
about the kid?

139
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:35,952
We don't know that.

140
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,317
We shouldn't have lied.

141
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:39,698
Shouldn't have told
her we had the kid.

142
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,390
What is it you
don't understand?

143
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,591
We tell her that kid got away,
you and I, we are not here right now.

144
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,141
I swear to God,
it just get deeper and deeper.

145
00:08:48,283 --> 00:08:49,518
What is that supposed to mean?

146
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:50,925
It means if I'd have known

147
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:52,619
that this is how this whole
thing was gonna turn out,

148
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,420
I would've gotten some
crap job with the feds.

149
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,217
Push pencils, drink coffee all day long
behind a desk. God, that sounds good.

150
00:09:00,478 --> 00:09:04,487
Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be
forced to put a bullet in your head.

151
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:12,329
As for her friend,
whoever that is,

152
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,513
we find out what he wants,
we play nice,

153
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,596
we deal with it accordingly.

154
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,531
Michael, you better see this.

155
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,964
Hey, Jersey.

156
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,103
Putting that carpet
in the guard's room?

157
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,330
Yeah. Think so.

158
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,079
Mm-hmm. When?

159
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,339
Got to tear up the
old stuff first.

160
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:41,586
Soon as we're done with that.
Tonight. Tomorrow maybe.

161
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,470
They're gonna find it, bro.

162
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:45,277
They're  gonna find the hole.

163
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,040
We got to do something.

164
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,605
Linc. Chow.

165
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,210
What's this?

166
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:12,687
It's for, uh, you know,
your last meal.

167
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,581
Write down what you want.

168
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,139
Linc, you gotta
write something down.

169
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,370
I don't gotta do nothing.

170
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:32,130
You don't fill it out,

171
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:35,456
all they're gonna give you is
what's on chow for that day.

172
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:36,355
So?

173
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,059
You don't want that for your last meal,
do you, man? Hmm?

174
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,543
In case you think of something.

175
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:09,625
Hey, eye-tie.

176
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,861
Something you need
there, rughead?

177
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:19,834
Yeah, a job, man.

178
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:23,536
Why don't you hit the DQ down
the street. We aren't hiring.

179
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,604
I'll put a hundred in your kick,
every month.

180
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,034
You want to pay me to work?

181
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,557
Man, I've been in the
kitchen for eight months.

182
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:33,975
I scrub one more tray,

183
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:36,396
I'm gonna go J-Cat,
you know what I'm saying?

184
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:38,391
Hey! Fiorello, how about it?

185
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:39,036
Eh...

186
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:42,285
One fifty.

187
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,294
Sign me up then, baby.

188
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,692
I was thinking
about what you said.

189
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,172
That it's not a "me
versus you" thing.

190
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:02,829
It's an "us" thing.

191
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,927
That's right.

192
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,981
How far are you willing
to go with that?

193
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,498
As far as I have to.

194
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:11,615
Then set up a
meeting with Falzone.

195
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:14,070
I want to talk to him directly.

196
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,056
Falzone doesn't talk to
guys like you directly.

197
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:22,600
If he wants Fibonacci,
he's gonna have to.

198
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:28,693
No, no! No, you heard me right.

199
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,038
You're telling me this kid
is gonna give up Fibonacci?

200
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:32,552
- You're sure?
- Definitely--

201
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:36,060
Only one thing.
He wants to meet with you directly.

202
00:12:36,154 --> 00:12:39,613
Son of a bitch,
you actually did something right, John.

203
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:40,555
That's good.

204
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,086
Guess I'm gonna have to call off
those guys I hired to shank you.

205
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,915
- That was a joke, John.
- Funny.

206
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,151
Good. I'll come out
there this afternoon.

207
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,658
And John...
If I come all the way out there,

208
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:55,648
and this turns out to
be a waste of my time,

209
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:57,386
I'm gonna castrate you.

210
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,144
I hope you understand that.
Be well, my friend.

211
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:01,666
I love you, too.

212
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:12,577
He's coming.
Don't mess this up.

213
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:43,475
Hello?

214
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:44,932
It's me.

215
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:48,147
I know.
I saw "Inmate" on the caller ID.

216
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:51,315
Remember when I said I might
be calling you on Fibonacci?

217
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,311
Yes.

218
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:56,301
Well... it's time.

219
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,753
You seem distracted.

220
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,027
Got a lot on my mind, I guess.

221
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,205
Yeah?

222
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:06,384
Got anything to do with the
people who took these toes?

223
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,093
- Nice flowers.
- Right.

224
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,314
Do we have an admirer?

225
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:12,924
They're from my father.

226
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:15,609
Ah... what's the occasion?

227
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:17,444
It's my birthday.

228
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,894
- Today?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,944
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

230
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,952
- Okay.
- Hmm.

231
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,287
Nothing.

232
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:34,139
Birthdays aren't usually a sore subject,
that's all.

233
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:37,557
Unless the celebrant
is feeling her age,

234
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:40,343
which I don't see
how you could be.

235
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:45,311
I'm 29 years old, Michael.
I'm not feeling my age.

236
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:47,232
It's just that out of
those 29 birthdays,

237
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,781
my father has actually managed to
see me on precisely... six of them.

238
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:55,778
So...  I get flowers instead.

239
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:59,115
Flowers that end up dead and
in the trash a week later.

240
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,502
That sounded bitter, huh?

241
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:04,398
Kind of.

242
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,043
It's not that big a deal.

243
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:08,327
You are all set.
I will see you tomorrow.

244
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,072
Okay.

245
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,676
I'm sorry you feel that way.

246
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,244
About the flowers, I mean.

247
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:27,955
Hey! Somebody get on this.
I want these in the other room.

248
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,063
I got it, boss.

249
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:31,241
Chill, lily white, I got it.

250
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:56,992
Come on,
I know you're around here somewhere.

251
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,876
He's not doing well, is he?

252
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:32,149
Just lost his mother.

253
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:35,998
Ten days from now,
he loses his father.

254
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:46,216
How are you holding up?

255
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:52,715
You know, I, uh...

256
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,334
I sort of get what you're
going through here, LJ.

257
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:01,916
No disrespect,
but I don't know that you do.

258
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:05,034
No, with my dad.

259
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,119
I was in the same spot
when I was your age.

260
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,065
He was in prison.

261
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,506
And like your dad,
he was innocent.

262
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:15,665
What happened?

263
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:18,691
I mean, you know, at the end.

264
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,163
What I hope happens here.
He got exonerated.

265
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:25,341
What'd they say he did?

266
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,107
A lot of bad things.

267
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,310
They weren't true.

268
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,299
And we proved that.

269
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:34,525
Every day,
every day was a lost cause...

270
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,041
but we kept fighting.

271
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,396
I mean,
what else are you gonna do?

272
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:41,360
When you love somebody,
you gonna let them go out like that?

273
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,956
So you fight.

274
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,519
You keep fighting.

275
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,250
You  never give up.

276
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,711
We're gonna beat this thing.

277
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:52,754
Okay?

278
00:18:01,743 --> 00:18:03,446
- Hello.
- Hello.

279
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,204
You were expecting me.

280
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,158
A mutual friend arranged the...

281
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:07,986
Yes.

282
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,799
- You mind if I...
- Please.

283
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,241
Hey, how are...

284
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:19,842
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

285
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:20,656
Quinn.

286
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,253
Mr. Quinn,
mind telling us what you're doing here?

287
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:29,252
You can probably tell just by looking
at me, I'm not a wave-making sort.

288
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,359
Just think of me
as a supervisor,

289
00:18:32,436 --> 00:18:35,386
here to make sure things are
under control, as we approach,

290
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:36,918
you know, the big event.

291
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,515
I wasn't aware that things
are out of control.

292
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:42,005
You'd be the one that would know,
wouldn't you?

293
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,188
Well, the reason I'm here

294
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:52,591
is because there's a discrepancy
between what you know,

295
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,561
and what you've said
to the vice president.

296
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,108
The lawyers you tried to blow up,
they're still running around,

297
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:58,388
healthy as thoroughbreds.

298
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,378
You know it, I know it.

299
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:02,446
Same thing goes with the kid,

300
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,677
Who you were silly enough

301
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:07,622
to tell the old lady that you
were actually in possession of.

302
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:10,889
Everything that I'm saying
is boiling down to this.

303
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,666
You got to hand the reins over to me
now, so that I can save your ass.

304
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:22,075
First of all...

305
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:26,125
No! No!

306
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,269
See? Now you made
me make a wave.

307
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:34,448
You and your partner are off
the job until further notice.

308
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:35,738
That doesn't come from me,

309
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:39,418
doesn't come from the White House,
it comes from the company, understand?

310
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:52,526
Your proximal and middle
phalanx are broken.

311
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,908
Ice it for 45 minutes,
then splint it--

312
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,490
that's what a doctor
would tell you to do,

313
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,992
so you don't need
to go see one.

314
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,739
EcoField's SEC filings?

315
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:21,270
Terrence Steadman was murdered

316
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,313
so the information from his indictment
wouldn't be made public, right?

317
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:26,232
Sure, but since it never
saw the light of day,

318
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:28,612
we have no way of knowing what
they were trying to cover up.

319
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:31,204
Steadman's wife said there were
hundreds of millions of dollars

320
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:32,945
at stake if her
husband went down,

321
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:36,408
so I figure we follow the money,
and see where it takes us.

322
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:39,342
$109 million. $212 million...

323
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:41,982
Over half a billion dollars
that I've found so far

324
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:45,499
in federal grants to EcoField
for alternative fuel research.

325
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:47,319
That  is a hell of
a lot of money.

326
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,449
But for what? Not only did the
company never make a profit.

327
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,989
As far as I could tell,
they never made anything.

328
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,388
No fuel cells, no patents,
no findings-- nothing.

329
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,785
So EcoField was a sham,
it was a cover?

330
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:01,144
Question is, for what?

331
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:13,998
Philly.

332
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,172
Sit down, kid.

333
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:28,807
So... Fibonacci.

334
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,845
- How'd you find him?
- Did my homework.

335
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,990
You get elliptical with
me for one more second,

336
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:41,898
and I will cancel you.
You understand me?

337
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,501
Give it up, Fish.

338
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:48,157
Before someone's transferred to the U.S.
Marshall Service

339
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:51,228
to be placed in Witness Protection,
they're guarded

340
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,744
by a local sheriff from the county
where the trial will take place.

341
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:00,375
Sheriff Solomon, please.

342
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,823
Please hold.

343
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,926
Andrew Solomon here.

344
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,277
If the sheriff was available,

345
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:13,123
then he wasn't the one
guarding Fibonacci.

346
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:15,096
Putnam County Sheriff's Office.

347
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:17,529
Yeah, is, uh,
Sheriff Pronzo there?

348
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:20,166
I'm sorry,
Sheriff Pronzo is on vacation.

349
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:22,651
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

350
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:24,969
There were only four
sheriffs in the county.

351
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:28,131
And since Pronzo was the only
one who wasn't in his office,

352
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,633
and his wife and kids were
waiting for him at home,

353
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:33,749
I knew the only vacation he
was taking was with Fibonacci.

354
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,469
Watching him until they
could put him in Protection.

355
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:38,085
Thing is,

356
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,876
sometimes it takes weeks for the
Marshall Service to set up a
new identity.

357
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:45,894
So some local sheriff is stuck in
the middle of nowhere with Fibonacci.

358
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,525
He gets lonely and calls home...
a lot.

359
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:56,740
I called the phone company,
said I was Pronzo and I'd lost my bill.

360
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:59,430
I asked for another copy.

361
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,535
Seems Mrs.
Pronzo was receiving dozens of calls

362
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:07,145
from an area code a
long way from Chicago.

363
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:11,806
I went online,
reverse-traced the number, and voilà,

364
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:15,662
there was Fibonacci's
exact location.

365
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,360
How do you know
he's still there?

366
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,370
I have someone
looking after him...

367
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:21,997
watching from afar,
in case he moves.

368
00:23:22,116 --> 00:23:22,823
Mm-hmm.

369
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:28,179
This is about money, isn't it?

370
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,267
You're an astute man,
Mr. Falzone.

371
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:30,923
What?

372
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:34,327
Your friend here, John,
is trying to extort me.

373
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,679
Not extortion, insurance.

374
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,790
I plan on being out
of here one day.

375
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:42,701
And I don't think my new resume's
gonna cut it in most places.

376
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,168
- How much?
- $200,000.

377
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:47,950
I'm gonna kill you.

378
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,812
Quid pro quo.

379
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:52,173
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

380
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:54,598
Well, I'll give you
some quid pro quo.

381
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:00,341
Where did you get this?

382
00:24:03,453 --> 00:24:04,553
Who took this picture?

383
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:06,581
Well, since you took
it upon yourself

384
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:09,096
to have some people watching over
our interests on the outside,

385
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:13,126
we took it upon ourselves to have
some people watching over yours.

386
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,561
So who's it gonna be?

387
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,743
Fibonacci or your pretty
little girlfriend there?

388
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:33,317
Yeah, you should be careful with
who visits you in here, Fish.

389
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:35,081
These walls have eyes.

390
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:40,051
If you touch her,
I'll kill you myself.

391
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,383
One, that is an empty threat.

392
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,426
You are less than a gnat to me.

393
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,774
And two,
all you got to do is give me the address

394
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:51,863
and we avoid all this
melodrama all together.

395
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:58,620
The address, you gnat.

396
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,042
Now.

397
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,209
Promise me.

398
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,760
Promise me it'll be
quick and painless.

399
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:13,895
- Do you believe this guy?
- Promise me.

400
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:17,651
The next thing that
comes out of your mouth

401
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,487
that's not that address,

402
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:23,680
there's gonna be a lot of pain...
in a lot of places.

403
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:36,377
Canada.

404
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,969
345 Hamilton Avenue.

405
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,406
Thunder Bay, Ontario.

406
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:46,869
Get out of here.

407
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:04,473
Nice work, John.

408
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,695
I guess the demise of John
Abruzzi was greatly exaggerated.

409
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,208
Thank you, I appreciate it.

410
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,626
Could you do me a favor and
fix this Bellick thing for me?

411
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:20,446
Consider it done.

412
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,920
Thank you.

413
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:27,697
And Philly,
before you pull the trigger,

414
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:30,292
look that son of a
bitch in his eyes and

415
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:33,336
tell him John Abruzzi
said good-bye.

416
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:08,844
"In the race toward worldwide peace and
prosperity, America will set the pace."

417
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:10,230
"Race"?

418
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:12,515
Rat race. Arms race.

419
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:16,294
Can you think of a word with
a worse connotation? Fix it.

420
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:20,523
Did you send me a baby-sitter?

421
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:23,871
This is not the
time or the place.

422
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:25,801
This is the time and the place.

423
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,328
Don't take that tone with me.

424
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:29,010
Remember who you
are talking to.

425
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:31,247
I am the Vice President
of this country.

426
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:35,425
No, actually, you're Caroline
Reynolds from Montgomery, Illinois.

427
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,975
I know exactly who you are.

428
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:41,780
Come with me.

429
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,368
There is something you
need to understand.

430
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,495
If you had done your job,
I never would've had to ask for Quinn.

431
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,966
And there's something
you need to understand.

432
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:03,254
You woke a sleeping beast when
you called these guys in.

433
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,094
They have a bigger
agenda than any of us.

434
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:08,396
And they get real nasty real quick
if things don't go their way.

435
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:10,197
So now, no one is safe.

436
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,332
Not you.

437
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,774
Not me.

438
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:15,643
Let's not overreact.

439
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:19,792
I mean, I know everyone is nervous
about tomorrow. I understand that.

440
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:23,430
But the one thing both
of us have to remember

441
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:26,196
is that we are in
this together, okay?

442
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:28,974
All I'm saying is these guys
are into this thing now.

443
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:30,304
And there's no going back.

444
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:34,609
That's bad news for everyone.

445
00:28:49,003 --> 00:28:50,694
Sebastian Balfour?

446
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:53,204
Yeah?

447
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:56,989
Yeah, I'm Nestor Pollack.
Midwestern Life and Casualty.

448
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,186
I'm already covered. Thanks.

449
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,901
Oh, no,
I'm here to discuss Veronica Donovan.

450
00:29:03,214 --> 00:29:03,964
What about her?

451
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:05,672
Well, we've been trying
to track her down

452
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,476
with respect to the property damage
from the apartment explosion.

453
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,215
- Explosion?
- You didn't know.

454
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:13,734
Oh, I'm sorry.

455
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:18,379
It's just that her records list
you as her fiancé. So I assumed...

456
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:19,293
Hold on.

457
00:29:19,722 --> 00:29:20,993
Is Veronica okay?

458
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:22,754
Well, there has
been a fatality.

459
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,718
Oh, my God.

460
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:27,049
No, but the medical examiners
haven't been able to identify the...

461
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,673
remains with any certainty.

462
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:31,454
So Veronica could be okay,
we just can't find her.

463
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,690
We were hoping you could help.

464
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:04,422
Rozz.

465
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:08,409
Reese.

466
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:12,719
Burrows.

467
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:26,003
Blueberry pancakes, huh?

468
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:29,932
All right, man, you got it.
Blueberry pancakes.

469
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:53,287
Veronica. Are you there?
If you are there. I am worried.

470
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:01,023
I'm fine.

471
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,397
Thank God. Where are you?

472
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:15,625
Can't say. Have to go. Bye.

473
00:32:17,886 --> 00:32:19,503
345.

474
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,616
This is it.

475
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:30,218
All right, that's it, kids.
Time for bed.

476
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,336
Give me a kiss.

477
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:35,501
You okay, down there?

478
00:32:36,585 --> 00:32:37,531
Night-night.

479
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:41,324
All right, sweetheart,
give me a kiss.

480
00:32:57,689 --> 00:32:59,984
- Kids are down.
- Thanks.

481
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:05,532
Tonight, we send a
message, gentlemen.

482
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:09,467
We are gonna hurt him and his
family the way he hurt ours.

483
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:31,934
- Oh, honey?
- Yeah.

484
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:35,272
Um, can you change the timer on the
sprinkler while you're out there?

485
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:36,151
Oh, okay.

486
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:38,123
- Love ya.
- Love you, too.

487
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:44,428
Freeze!

488
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,955
Police! Drop your weapon!

489
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,246
I said drop it!

490
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,208
Down!

491
00:34:25,025 --> 00:34:27,879
Hi. It's John.
You wanted to talk to me?

492
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:30,113
Yeah. You hear the news?

493
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:33,271
Falzone got popped last
night up in Canada.

494
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:39,630
International gun charges.
Parole violation. He's in deep.

495
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,589
You threw away your flowers.

496
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,976
Yeah, like I said,
they don't last.

497
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:51,529
I don't think they're dead yet.

498
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:57,098
I don't like getting attached to
things if I know they won't last.

499
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,256
There you go.

500
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,151
Why are you so cynical?

501
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,250
Michael, I think there's cynicism,
and then there's realism.

502
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,230
And there's optimism,
hope. Faith.

503
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:12,413
This coming from a eight-toed guy
locked away in a penitentiary.

504
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,593
Mm, toes are overrated.

505
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:18,176
Thank you for trying to make me smile.
Not today.

506
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:21,376
- You never know.
- We're all set.

507
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,231
You and I have a lot to talk about,
don't we, Fish?

508
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:59,325
Seems Philly Falzone ran into
some problem up in Canada.

509
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:02,388
Just because of the
information you gave him.

510
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:03,667
What kind of trouble?

511
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:06,675
International gun charges,
parole violation.

512
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,475
He's gonna go away
for a long time.

513
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:11,682
How'd you feel about that?

514
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:13,775
Pretty darn good.

515
00:36:18,238 --> 00:36:21,477
- And what about PI?
- Got that back, too.

516
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,311
Falzone paid Bellick yesterday,
so we're good for now.

517
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:27,565
- It all worked out.
- Sure did.

518
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,372
Nicely done.
You're a hell of an actor.

519
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:32,122
Thank you.

520
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:36,528
Well, this helped.
It's nice. Nice shot.

521
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,303
Where did you take it?

522
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,955
It's Lincoln's,
from back in the day.

523
00:36:41,038 --> 00:36:42,684
Camping trip or something.

524
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,836
So, when do we get
back in that room?

525
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,500
- Right away.
- Well, let's get to it.

526
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:48,350
Yeah...

527
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:52,444
Oh, there's one more thing.

528
00:36:56,002 --> 00:36:57,801
You are going to
give me Fibonacci

529
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:00,377
once we're outside of
these walls, right?

530
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:02,725
Of course.

531
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:07,511
Thank you.

532
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,392
But I think I'll keep this.

533
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,040
As insurance.

534
00:37:28,698 --> 00:37:29,583
More juice?

535
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:32,012
Why can't we have
breakfast every day?

536
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:34,123
You should have
breakfast every day, LJ.

537
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:35,414
It's an important meal.

538
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:38,828
No. Why can't I have
breakfast with you every day?

539
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,424
Nothing would make me happier,

540
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:45,378
but, uh, your mommy and me--
we don't live together anymore.

541
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:46,463
Why?

542
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,472
Well, um, sometimes that happens
with mommies and daddies.

543
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,392
But you know what?

544
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,415
You're the luckiest
boy in the world,

545
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:59,790
'cause your mommy
loves you very much,

546
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:02,074
and I love you very much.

547
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,634
I'll tell you what--

548
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:05,276
how about every Sunday,

549
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:08,415
we have our own special breakfast,
just you and me?

550
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:09,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

551
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:11,526
Little bit or a hand full?

552
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:13,349
- Hand full.
- Hand full.

553
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:17,750
Here we go.

554
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:30,191
Take a walk.

555
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:38,318
Anyone else want
to walk with him?

556
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:41,267
Yeah.

557
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:46,492
This is my game.

558
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:49,213
Looks like our friend
got his throne back.

559
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:50,789
Looks like it.

560
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:55,694
Something tells me we may
have you to thank for that.

561
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:58,654
- You don't want to know.
- You got that right.

562
00:38:58,752 --> 00:39:00,641
Stretch your legs, old head.

563
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,771
Now, we got to have us a
lot to talk about, don't we?

564
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:22,241
I got nothing to say.

565
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:25,910
You think you can
play me, snowflake?

566
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:27,652
'Cause you got college?

567
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,428
Big school learnin', huh?

568
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:32,318
Well, let me school you.

569
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,928
Darwin wins inside these walls.

570
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,330
Not Einstein, Darwin.

571
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:42,544
Yard time's over, ladies.
Let's line it up.

572
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:46,158
I'm not done with you, Fish.

573
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,048
You never even got started.

574
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:09,585
All right.

575
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,895
We're through the hard part.

576
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:16,935
Another 18 inches,
we'll hit that pipe.

577
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:19,825
We'll be there by Friday.

578
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:21,096
Friday?

579
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:23,196
Better start making
travel arrangements.

580
00:40:23,226 --> 00:40:25,039
Maricruz, here I come, baby.

581
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:26,938
Sardinia, here I come.

582
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,216
- Where are we going?
- Panama.

583
00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:30,965
- Panama.
- Panama.

584
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:33,776
Darien Gap, South of the Canal.

585
00:40:33,856 --> 00:40:36,473
No roads,
no electricity, no cops.

586
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:41,211
Nothing but white sand
beaches and ice cold beer.

587
00:40:41,495 --> 00:40:43,828
Well, that's nice,
but what about our lives?

588
00:40:43,915 --> 00:40:45,176
I don't know.

589
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:46,792
We'll open a scuba shop.

590
00:40:46,888 --> 00:40:48,046
Hey, I don't dive.

591
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,800
Neither do I,
but we'll have plenty of time to learn.

592
00:40:52,523 --> 00:40:53,337
Bulls.

593
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:02,113
This con says he's
on the job in here.

594
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:04,988
No, I don't think so.

595
00:41:05,082 --> 00:41:06,396
You heard the paisan.

596
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,197
Move your ass.

597
00:41:07,206 --> 00:41:09,128
C.O., hold on one minute.

598
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:17,601
Now, you sure about that?

599
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:20,852
Now, you sure you can't
use an extra hand?

600
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,172
You know anything
about construction?

601
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:26,674
Concrete is my specialty.
Can you dig it?

602
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:34,043
- Okay, boss. Sign him up.
- You got it.

603
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,522
All right, looks like Darwin
wins after all, hey, Fish?

604
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,748
I have a lot of dots,
but no way to connect them.

605
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:59,464
Nobody's getting rich here.

606
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:00,835
What about shareholders?

607
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:03,452
Oh, profits were minimal, and they
were all converted back to shares.

608
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:06,266
Looks like they subcontracted out
some research and development,

609
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:08,361
but it's pennies in the
grand scheme of things.

610
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,191
Nobody was pulling
early retirement.

611
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,650
You can't hide $500 million just
by moving a few decimal points.

612
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,656
In a move anticipated
by many pundits,

613
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:19,417
Vice President Reynolds announced
she is running for the Presidency.

614
00:42:19,457 --> 00:42:22,662
She made the announcement from her
hometown of Montgomery, Illinois.

615
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:28,627
The move toward worldwide peace and
prosperity is a marathon, not a sprint.

616
00:42:28,711 --> 00:42:33,592
But I assure you,
America will be setting the pace.

617
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:36,041
Money like that just
doesn't disappear, Nick.

618
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:37,902
You could run a small
country with that.

619
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:42,088
The Vice President is reported to have
the largest campaign war chest
in history.

620
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,391
It is so large, in fact,

621
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:45,923
that prognosticators
are already casting her

622
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,413
as the favorite in
the presidential race.

623
00:42:48,604 --> 00:42:50,540
Maybe not a small country.

624
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:52,540
Maybe this one.

625
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:06,422
