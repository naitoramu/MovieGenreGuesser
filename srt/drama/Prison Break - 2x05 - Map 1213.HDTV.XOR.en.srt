1
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,594
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,661
There's something
about this guy.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:12,239
It's like he knows where we're
going and what we're thinking.

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,760
If that's true,
it's just a matter of time

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,719
before he finds out
about the money in Utah,

6
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,172
our way into Mexico...

7
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,341
Everything.

8
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,808
...have an attorney present
during questioning...

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,308
Caroline, they're
taking her in.

10
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,900
Of course.
I'll keep an eye on her.

11
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:31,680
I did it, Dad.

12
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,468
Just do as you're told.

13
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:37,144
Otherwise there will be consequences
that will affect us all.

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,012
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

15
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,600
When I told him I was
staying in a hotel with

16
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:45,372
a guy that I maybe sorta liked,

17
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,191
he lost it.

18
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,441
What are you doing here?
Where's Maricruz?

19
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:50,893
She's with me now.

20
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:53,981
- Don't push it.
- Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

21
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:57,043
I was trying to tell you,
the wedding is in Vegas.

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,671
- Which one of them was it?
- Might be Scofield.

23
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,063
Probably gonna find his
brother in there, too.

24
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:08,051
- Where to, sir?
- Utah.

25
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:18,970
This morning,
authorities in Illinois issued an update

26
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:22,791
on the escaped convicts known
until now as the Fox River Eight.

27
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:25,472
Chicago mob boss John
Abruzzi was gunned down

28
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,850
outside a Washington D.C.
motel last night

29
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:31,002
after investigators received
a tip from an informant.

30
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:35,222
The other seven escapees are still
at large and considered dangerous.

31
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:42,252
I didn't think Abruzzi'd
be the first to go.

32
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:44,941
I have a feeling we're in
for lots of surprises.

33
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:48,663
They said seven are still out there.
So much for faking our deaths.

34
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:51,661
I bought us some time--
that's what counts.

35
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:57,471
- How much further?
- 70, 80 miles.

36
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,032
Good.

37
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,683
Means we should be hitting the
Double K Ranch by this afternoon.

38
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,751
Or we can keep driving,
pick up LJ and hit Panama.

39
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:03,751
We can't hit Panama!

40
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:06,810
We can't hit anything!
We can't do anything without the money.

41
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,251
We need to find
Charles's stash.

42
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:14,120
I know some other guys who
are thinking the same thing.

43
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:22,152
The money is buried under a
silo at the Double K Ranch

44
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:25,300
just outside of Tooele, Utah.

45
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,932
There's $5 million there.

46
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:48,621
Oh. Um, you know,
when I was in Cheyenne,

47
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,821
I pulled my ticket
out of the bag.

48
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,333
It tore in half, and...

49
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,721
I have no idea what
happened to the other part.

50
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:56,693
They didn't issue
you a replacement?

51
00:02:56,918 --> 00:02:59,502
No. The young lady-- I think--
her name was Sherry--

52
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:03,183
she actually said that this half is
okay because the bar code is on it.

53
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:05,293
Well, you really need
the whole ticket.

54
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,972
This is exactly what
I was trying to avoid.

55
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,090
She said that everything
would be fine because...

56
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:11,781
That's okay. It'll do for now.

57
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:15,071
But make sure you ask for a
replacement when you get to Provo.

58
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:17,753
I definitely will. Thank you.

59
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:21,413
- It's always something, uh?
- Oh, God, I know.

60
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:35,472
I don't wanna go home.

61
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,340
I wish we could keep driving.

62
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,360
I don't think your Pops
will be down for that.

63
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,260
Wouldn't it be fun?

64
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:48,081
We could go to...

65
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,200
Hawaii?

66
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,010
Yo, you can't drive to Hawaii.

67
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:52,741
Yo.

68
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:54,611
I know.

69
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,292
I'm just saying I wish.

70
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:01,390
Whoa, whoa.

71
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,273
No, no. Don't get it.
They'll leave.

72
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,430
Just let me see who it is.

73
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:11,842
It's a cop.

74
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:14,192
No, no, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

75
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,980
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

76
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,851
Have you happened
to see this person?

77
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:58,863
Last night we got a few phone calls
that he was spotted in the area.

78
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:00,870
So we're going door-to-door.

79
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,400
Why are you looking for him?

80
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:06,123
He escaped from prison in
Illinois a couple of days ago.

81
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:07,481
Have you seen him?

82
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,220
No.

83
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:16,220
He doesn't look familiar.

84
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:17,942
Are you sure?

85
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,311
Yeah. I'm sure.

86
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,970
All right.
Thanks for your time.

87
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:34,790
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This ain't...

88
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,511
This is not what you think,
all right? Look.

89
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,143
Listen to me, this...

90
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:43,012
Just... listen. Okay?

91
00:05:43,378 --> 00:05:46,152
All I did was steal
a baseball card.

92
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:50,180
Okay? I'm not like those
other fools up in there.

93
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:54,401
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

94
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:58,072
I'm gonna leave my
keys right here.

95
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:02,123
And when I come back,
my car will be gone.

96
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:07,862
I'm sure, in a few hours,
they'll find it somewhere...

97
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:09,920
abandoned.

98
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,140
Wait. Wait.

99
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,433
I wish it could be different.

100
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,952
I have to go.

101
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,413
"Too-le."

102
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,280
I think it's "To-ill-uh."

103
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,731
Hell of a town.

104
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:54,073
Small is good.
Means the ranch'll be easier to find.

105
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,091
All we got to do
is get that money

106
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:59,141
and we'll be out of
here by nightfall.

107
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:00,212
Right.

108
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,821
Oh, sir. Soil test came
back from Scofield's crash.

109
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,033
Not that you need any
more proof, but...

110
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:28,232
he really went out of
his way this time.

111
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:29,783
What else do you have?

112
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:32,653
Man was violently assaulted
in Nebraska by a hitchhiker

113
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:35,811
matching Bagwell's description.
He was headed west on the I-80.

114
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,820
Omaha's putting together
a photo lineup.

115
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:39,702
What do you have on Scofield?

116
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:42,432
What does anybody
have on Scofield?

117
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:46,933
Uh, I've got some results
from his hard drive.

118
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,992
The one recovered
from the river.

119
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:53,642
We were able to use the sector editor to
restore the master boot. So
from that...

120
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:56,892
I don't care how you did it.
What do you have?

121
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:02,641
More than half the contents
of the buffer. About 60%.

122
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,001
It looks pretty random.

123
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,720
Print it up. All of it.
I want it on my desk.

124
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,243
Well, guess what?

125
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:20,013
No listing for a
Double K Ranch.

126
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,583
Excuse me. You know where I
might find a Double K Ranch?

127
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,313
- What you call it?
- Double K Ranch.

128
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,453
- No.
- You from around here?

129
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,931
Yeah. Born and raised.
There's no Double-nothin'.

130
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:34,523
Great. Thank you.

131
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:39,110
Looks like Westmoreland spent his last
breath blowing smoke up your ass.

132
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:42,603
There's one way to find out.
The county keeps property records.

133
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:47,192
Every plot is mapped out with
dimensions. It's public record.

134
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:51,013
But if there is a tax
assessor's office here,

135
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:56,191
it's gonna be in there,
the Municipal Building.

136
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,962
Lots of cops in there, Michael.

137
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:05,483
- Dispatch.
- Someone...

138
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,391
someone stole my
car this morning.

139
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,882
I'm at the Lotus Motel
off Interstate 80.

140
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,522
Did you see who took it?

141
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,340
No. I went out for a walk and
when I came back, it was gone.

142
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,593
This morning?
Why didn't you call before?

143
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:20,460
I... I don't know.

144
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:19,820
- Mr. Kellerman.
- Mr. Kim.

145
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,658
Surprised to see
you in Chicago.

146
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:27,534
- Just looking for updates.
- Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

147
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,342
Is pursuing her the
best use of your time?

148
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,641
It is.
She's in contact with Scofield.

149
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:34,610
I was there when he
called yesterday.

150
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,052
We stay with her,
she takes us right to him,

151
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:38,510
he takes us to Burrows.

152
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:43,001
All right.
If you're that confident.

153
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:44,202
I am.

154
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:49,170
- I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president directly.

155
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,302
I'll contact her.

156
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,420
Keep me posted.

157
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:25,172
If you want to restore your dignity,
you need to take action.

158
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,130
Making amends requires much
more than saying "I'm sorry."

159
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,202
It means learning to change.

160
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:33,731
The apology is just
the first step.

161
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:37,720
The most important thing is
that you display honesty,

162
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:42,790
courage and compassion when
you extend your apologies.

163
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:45,421
You need to earn
your forgiveness.

164
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:48,192
We'll talk about
it more on Friday.

165
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,512
I've got a great idea.

166
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,732
What's that?

167
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:09,542
Since you are such a fan of lame,
store-bought blueberry pie,

168
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:15,152
I am going to bake you a real
pie of your choice tonight.

169
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,322
I can't.

170
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:22,882
I really don't need to be seeing anyone
right now who isn't my therapist.

171
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,933
I've been a hermit lately, too.

172
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:28,512
My partner Daniel's
away on business.

173
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:33,932
I've been sitting around every
night by myself. Kind of pathetic.

174
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,692
I am so sorry.
I thought you meant...

175
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,271
Um...

176
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,912
I thought...

177
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:45,941
- The pie...
- Oh, no.

178
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,371
That's my ego.

179
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,781
No, I was really
talking about...

180
00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:51,372
- Pie?
- Yeah. Actual blueberries.

181
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,902
Like we'd make pie and
watch Fried Green Tomatoes.

182
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:54,790
I get it, I get it.

183
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:57,331
I'm the best ex-junkie
cook in this town.

184
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,631
Thank you. I just...
I got to clean my apartment.

185
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,923
It's disgusting, and I realize that
sounds like an excuse; it's not.

186
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,991
No, no, no, I get it. Um...

187
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,673
You do what you got to do.

188
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,241
Have a good night.

189
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,041
Do you deliver?

190
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:23,703
Next batch.

191
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:56,693
Just... put it on the desk.

192
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:00,372
Does any of this
stuff mean anything?

193
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,613
I don't know. Ask me later.

194
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,712
Think he's a genius
or a whack-job?

195
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:05,173
I think we answered
that question

196
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:07,052
when we assigned a hundred
agents to the case.

197
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:10,243
So why don't you go and get me the rest
of it, huh? Does that work for you?

198
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:47,653
Alackaday. I just found
me an In-betweener.

199
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,343
Where you going in
such a hurry, huh?

200
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,971
- None of your beeswax, yo.
- I know where.

201
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,543
Same place as every other man
who was in that room that night.

202
00:14:56,658 --> 00:15:00,423
They all comin' around here
for a big family reunion

203
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,763
at the Ku Klux Ranch.
If they ain't here already.

204
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,651
Ain't no country folk in this town
ever heard of the Double K Ranch.

205
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,713
Seems like you've been misinformed.
Indeedy there is a Double K.

206
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:12,740
It's just a matter of who
gets there first, all right?

207
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,713
The stars are going to
collide in Tooele, my friend.

208
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,953
You're going to need
me on your side.

209
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:19,813
This ain't Fox River, all right?
I don't need any...

210
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:26,881
As you can see... I need you.

211
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:32,383
Get your grubby paws off me, you freak.
I ain't your ditch digger.

212
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:34,730
I don't want nothing from you.
I don't need nothing.

213
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:39,820
You might ...if a man knew where
he was supposed to be looking.

214
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:59,171
Hi. Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

215
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:03,933
- Avila.
- No? Okay, thanks.

216
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:14,953
Hi. Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

217
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:16,682
Avila.

218
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,670
Delgado.

219
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,403
Really?

220
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:23,361
When?

221
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:37,533
Stay calm.
We'll be out in ten minutes.

222
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,272
One at a time. Clear.

223
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:43,372
Back up.

224
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:51,450
- Are you wearing a watch?
- Uh, yeah.

225
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,851
Have a nice day.

226
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:08,573
Thanks.

227
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,660
This is exactly what we need.

228
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:24,612
It's a map of every parcel of land.
Topography, buildings...

229
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:25,870
everything.

230
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:32,012
Karl Kokosing. Double K.

231
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:35,883
I don't like the way this
guy is looking at us.

232
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:45,483
1213.

233
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,793
Where's 1213?

234
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:59,432
Ms. Sebern,
I need to speak with you.

235
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:01,833
Come on, man,
we got to roll now.

236
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,350
Ms. Sebern.

237
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,232
Come on. You got the map?

238
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,663
No.

239
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,563
Someone else does.

240
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,771
Someone got here before us.
It's the only explanation.

241
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:31,581
Son of a bitch is still alive.

242
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:35,820
Hey, pretty!

243
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:39,991
What are you going to do,
scream, man?

244
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:44,110
How the hell...
are you still breathing?

245
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:46,640
What the hell did
you do to your hand?

246
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:50,211
Easy, easy...

247
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,373
I recently had some work done.

248
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:56,963
- Where's the map?!
- Easy, easy...

249
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:58,983
I don't have it.

250
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:00,570
Where is it?

251
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:04,062
I'm telling you, I don't have it.
I dot have it, all right?!

252
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,753
You were there. We saw you.

253
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,290
It was gone whe I got there.

254
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,363
Now why don't you keep
your pooch away from me.

255
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,331
I'll tell you
everything I know.

256
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:16,330
It's the kid. He has it.

257
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:19,722
I saw him this morning
and I needed some help.

258
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,590
We made a deal, all right?

259
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:25,031
He said he would dig.
I told him where we could get a map.

260
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,120
What kid?

261
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,743
What kid?

262
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:46,291
The best thing to
do is nothing.

263
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:48,210
That's how I'm going
to the U.S. Senate

264
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,471
to confirm my vice president,
do nothing?

265
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,533
Shows them you can do the job.

266
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,802
It's my daughter.

267
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:59,500
Sir, we need to talk
about your daughter.

268
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:00,653
What about her?

269
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:03,811
Well, the media is all over
this Fox River situation.

270
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:07,053
We think it would be best if you
could distance yourself from her...

271
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:10,902
If I hear this one more time...
I paid her bail, I walked away.

272
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:13,903
I have distanced myself.

273
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:18,840
Give me a minute.

274
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,071
Hey, Dad, it's me.

275
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,402
When you get a chance, I really need
to talk to you about something.

276
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:29,833
Um, actually a lot of things.

277
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:34,302
Uh, the most important
one is that..

278
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,851
I owe you an apology.

279
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:40,470
I, uh, I realize that I've made
things difficult fou lately.

280
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:47,142
And I want to take
responsibility for that.

281
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:48,350
Um...

282
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,930
call me back. Bye.

283
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,373
Hi. I know I'm early,
but I brought dinner.

284
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:56,260
Come in.

285
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:57,853
You're not a vegetarian,
are you?

286
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,152
No. Just shut that behind you.

287
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:13,691
You mind if I check my e-mail?

288
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,661
- No, not at all. Here.
- Oh, you're so kind. Thank you.

289
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:42,480
Do you happen to
have a pen handy?

290
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,401
Yeah.

291
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,890
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

292
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,953
Not at all.
Look, I have a little pencil and a pad.

293
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:49,830
Thank you.

294
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:57,521
Sir?

295
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:58,830
Sir?

296
00:21:58,978 --> 00:21:59,620
Yeah.

297
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:03,383
There's no Sherry in Cheyenne.
Your ticket is not valid for travel.

298
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:06,822
Hold on. That can't be right.
That can't bght.

299
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:08,423
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

300
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:12,020
All right now, listen, brother.

301
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,633
I'm going to give
it to you straight.

302
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:17,681
Listen, I'm broke, okay?
That's the truth.

303
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,723
I just run into some
trouble back in...

304
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,941
I'm just really trying to pull it
altogether now, you understand?

305
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:29,283
Well, you can tell that to the
authorities in five minutes.

306
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,693
Oh, come on, we don't have to
get the authorities involved.

307
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:32,611
It's too late.

308
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:35,613
They're already waiting
at the next stop.

309
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:39,330
These guys here, they're gonna
sit with you until we stop.

310
00:22:40,908 --> 00:22:43,961
I understand. I understand.

311
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:51,471
Hey!

312
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,482
Hey, you can't go in here!

313
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:19,201
Okay, we've got a confirmed
sighting on Franklin.

314
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,112
Jumped out of a moving
train in Preston, Idaho.

315
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:26,972
What is a black man from Chicago
doing in Idaho? He's got to be lost.

316
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,360
Franklin's in Preston, Idaho.
Bagwell's in Nebraska.

317
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:31,530
And both men have never been
across the Mississippi.

318
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:35,100
Visiting friends and family?
I don't think so. And not...

319
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:41,370
south of the border. They're due
west and we need to know... why.

320
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:45,602
Out.

321
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,090
What's going on, friends?

322
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:50,971
Where did you say
Tweener was headed?

323
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,311
Up on the main drag.
He was supposed to find a shovel.

324
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:00,532
In.

325
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:02,413
No. No, no, no.

326
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,480
In!

327
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:12,233
You coming back, right?
You coming back?!

328
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:13,670
Yep.

329
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:17,201
Hey, you guys! Hey!

330
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,633
Come on, man,
I'm gonna help you here!

331
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:33,580
I was on my ATV,
and I was hauling ass.

332
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:34,843
I was right on her tail,

333
00:24:34,988 --> 00:24:36,672
and I pulled out
my gun and blam!

334
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:39,592
That bitch treed herself,
and I brought her down in one shot.

335
00:24:39,726 --> 00:24:41,790
- What'd she weigh?
- Least a hunny.

336
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:42,910
Maybe one-ten.

337
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:45,692
Come on out and see us if you want.
It's gonna be a good time.

338
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,473
Yeah, I just might do that.

339
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,920
Hey, now, what you digging?

340
00:24:58,476 --> 00:24:59,602
Uh...

341
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,973
some stuff in my
grandpa's yard.

342
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,982
We got a bigger one in the
back if you're going deep.

343
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:08,632
No, this will do.

344
00:25:10,256 --> 00:25:12,890
Damn it if I don't know
you from somewhere.

345
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,220
Maybe I know your grandpa.

346
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:18,661
I doubt it, man.
He moved here, like, a month ago, so...

347
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:19,780
What's his name?

348
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,470
His name's Grandpa. A'ight?

349
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:26,492
Look, man, can you just ring this up?
I gotta get out of here.

350
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:31,200
Sure thing, fella. I'll ring it up.
I'll ring it right now.

351
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:38,011
I know where I seen
you on the TV.

352
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:39,980
You're one of them
Fox River boys.

353
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:02,583
- You got it wrong, man.
- No, I think I got it right.

354
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,080
We're closed!

355
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:20,140
Sorry, bud.
Closing up early today.

356
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:25,720
Hold on. Stay right there.

357
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:37,353
You're going down,
just like your buddy, you son of a...

358
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,211
Where's the kid?

359
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,113
Where's the kid?!

360
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:47,702
He's back here.

361
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:48,822
Get up.

362
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:56,192
Come on, tough guy. Let's go.

363
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:39,502
Maricruz. Baby, open up.

364
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:44,341
Theresa! It's me.
It's me, okay?

365
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:47,283
Fernando, what are
you doing here?

366
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,913
- You can't be here.
- I know, Theresa.

367
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,931
Where's your sister?
I need to see Maricruz.

368
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:53,923
She's getting her picture
taken with my mom and dad.

369
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:56,793
- The wedding's at 2:30.
- I need to see her now.

370
00:27:56,965 --> 00:28:00,212
- You have to go.
- She's the mother of my kid, Theresa.

371
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:01,573
Please.

372
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:06,191
You don't want her to marry Hector,
do you? Do you?

373
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:11,231
I'll go see if I
can go get her.

374
00:28:11,518 --> 00:28:13,390
- Wait in here.
- Okay.

375
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,520
Lance, I got a
question for you.

376
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:30,502
Yes?

377
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:34,871
Do you know who I am?

378
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:40,410
Uh... I happened to see
the news last night, yes.

379
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:45,200
Hey, I don't care. I've got some
skeletons in my closet, too.

380
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,310
One of them wears a dress.

381
00:28:48,568 --> 00:28:51,720
Thank you.
I appreciate your lack of judgment.

382
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,211
From what I can tell,
you didn't do anything wrong,

383
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:57,251
but it's none of my business.
And you don't need to talk about it.

384
00:28:57,437 --> 00:28:59,321
The whole thing just...

385
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,830
I never meant for it to happen.

386
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:10,091
Okay, you do not need to
answer this question.

387
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:13,290
But were you and that guy,
like, uh...

388
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:20,173
You're right,
I don't want to talk about it.

389
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,372
- You done?
- Yeah.

390
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:28,750
Does it worry you that he's...

391
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:30,102
out there?

392
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,483
Give me one second.

393
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:45,502
Dad.

394
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:51,353
- Sara, hi. I got your message.
- Please, come in.

395
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,990
Uh, Lance, this is,
uh, my father Frank.

396
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,903
- How do you do?
- Dad, this is my friend Lance.

397
00:29:60,007 --> 00:30:02,333
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I voted for you.

398
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,492
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

399
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:05,891
Sara, I can take off.

400
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:09,401
No, no need.
It'll only take a minute.

401
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,271
Why don't you step into my office
and you make yourself at home.

402
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,302
Sure.

403
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:27,741
So, uh...
So, in my program, um...

404
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:29,710
we've been talking a
lot about making amends,

405
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:33,103
and I've been thinking
a lot about, um...

406
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,892
about some of the
choices I've made lately

407
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,863
and I know that
that affects you.

408
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:43,341
Um... and, uh...

409
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:46,380
and I...

410
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,402
I wanted to tell
you that I'm sorry.

411
00:30:48,537 --> 00:30:50,742
You don't have to
say you're sorry.

412
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,290
Yeah, I do.

413
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:56,442
And it must be hard to
understand why I did it.

414
00:30:56,587 --> 00:31:00,683
Um, I had no idea that I was

415
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:03,022
putting these guys back
out on the street.

416
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:06,551
I thought I was saving the
life of an innocent man and...

417
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:08,761
And I know that you didn't read

418
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:12,860
the information I gave you on Lincoln
Burrows, but he is innocent and...

419
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:16,343
a lot of the people involved
right now are dead.

420
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,313
Uh... I'm sorry.

421
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,231
This isn't why I call you.

422
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,111
I'm fine...

423
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:31,272
but I'm scared.

424
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:34,803
Sara...

425
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,081
I'm gonna help
you through this.

426
00:31:38,178 --> 00:31:40,802
We're gonna get
through this together.

427
00:31:41,596 --> 00:31:44,980
- Thank you.
- I promise.

428
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:48,871
Kellerman.

429
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:50,511
We ran that trace
you requested.

430
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:51,470
What'd you get?

431
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,200
- The line is disconnected.
- Whose was it?

432
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:57,072
- Apparently, no one's.
- What does that mean?

433
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,451
It's been out of
service for 17 years.

434
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,003
Fernando.

435
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,953
- Where is she?
- Oh, calm down. Calm down.

436
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:14,421
She's gonna come down
and talk to you.

437
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:17,421
She's on her way
down right now.

438
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:22,203
You and I got history.
We're family.

439
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,412
And out of respect for that,

440
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,151
I'm gonna let her make
her own decision.

441
00:32:25,297 --> 00:32:27,923
- I'm not leaving without her.
- That's for Maricruz to decide.

442
00:32:28,118 --> 00:32:29,861
You've been filling her
head with all this crap.

443
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:33,050
She's a smart girl. I personally
don't think she's gonna want

444
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,052
to live her life on the run,
but we'll see.

445
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,290
You know, she doesn't love you.

446
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:38,972
Yeah, I don't want to
get into that right now.

447
00:32:39,008 --> 00:32:42,300
You're not raising my kid.
¿Tu me estas entendiendo?

448
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,920
That don't sound good, cuz.

449
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:56,592
Maricruz! Baby! Mari.

450
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:58,260
- You have to go.
- Where is she?

451
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,490
Please, Fernando,
they're coming!

452
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:02,403
Did you tell her I was here?
Did you?!

453
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,091
Maricruz...

454
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,992
Mahone.

455
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,892
I'll be right down.

456
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:51,541
- Mr. Mahone.
- Where are they?

457
00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:53,821
Had a hard time getting
my hands on these.

458
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:55,201
It'd be easier to
go to a doctor,

459
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:57,151
tell him you need something
to calm your nerves.

460
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:59,983
Doctors take notes.
That's why I have a deal with you.

461
00:34:00,076 --> 00:34:02,701
The way things been going,
I thought maybe our deal was over.

462
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:04,491
You don't ask me
about Shales no more.

463
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,033
That part of our deal is over.

464
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:08,242
I no longer need an
informant on the case.

465
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:11,211
Thought that's all you
cared about was finding him.

466
00:34:11,727 --> 00:34:13,032
You can't get them all.

467
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:14,782
If you want,
I can keep an ear out on the street.

468
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:16,493
Midazolam. 1,500
milligrams every 30 days.

469
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:21,643
That's all I want from you.
We understand each other?

470
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,543
You gonna pay me for it?

471
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,321
Right there.

472
00:34:34,817 --> 00:34:37,683
- What are you doing here?
- We had to come for you, buddy.

473
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,751
- How'd you know?
- T-Bag.

474
00:34:40,305 --> 00:34:42,423
- Hand over the map.
- What?

475
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,421
The map. Hand it over.

476
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:48,610
He told you I had it?

477
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:05,050
We are going to sort
this out right now.

478
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,380
Tell me that's not
what I know it is.

479
00:35:14,216 --> 00:35:15,242
It is.

480
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:17,781
But don't worry,
before I destroyed it.

481
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:20,221
I committed it to my
photographic memory.

482
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,823
Coming from a compulsive liar,

483
00:35:22,097 --> 00:35:23,571
I find that a little
hard to believe.

484
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:26,181
I'da tattooed it to my body
but I didn't have the time.

485
00:35:26,695 --> 00:35:28,333
Whenever you strip
search a lifer,

486
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:30,921
you should always
check his coin purse.

487
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:32,893
Tell us where the money is.

488
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:36,213
Now let's not dissolve into threats,
all right?

489
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:37,841
I'm going to take
the high road here

490
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,773
and suggest a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

491
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:43,203
I have the information,
you have the manual requirements

492
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:46,473
necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

493
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:48,681
- We're partners.
- And why is that?

494
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:52,782
'Cause as of this moment,
I'm your map.

495
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:00,831
So then, yo,
we split it four ways, right?

496
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,942
- Wrong.
- Get in.

497
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:05,811
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You're not worth 1.5.

498
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:08,021
- Get in.
- Okay.

499
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,902
Excuse me. Can I help you?

500
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:39,892
Oh. Yeah. Sorry, yeah.
Uh... whoo!

501
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:42,411
It's hot.

502
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:47,462
I was really wondering how
much you selling your RV for.

503
00:36:47,966 --> 00:36:49,842
Probably out of
your price range.

504
00:36:49,947 --> 00:36:53,900
- Come on, give me a shot.
- $40,000.

505
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:03,870
Look, I tell you what.
I'll be back in a couple days, okay?

506
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:08,020
- I can't hold it for you.
- I said I'll be back.

507
00:37:08,306 --> 00:37:09,802
With cash.

508
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:29,561
Nice bike.

509
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,470
The wedding's at
2:30, Fernando.

510
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:46,822
We just got confirmation
on Fernando Sucre.

511
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:48,881
He was in Las
Vegas around 2:00.

512
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,332
Then a gas station attendant

513
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:53,352
spotted a guy on a bike
matching his description

514
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:55,703
in Mesquite...

515
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:58,662
an hour later.

516
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,801
Out west,
just like Bagwell and Franklin.

517
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:03,490
Yeah, but he was heading east.

518
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,080
And Bagwell's in Nebraska
on I-80 heading west.

519
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:09,511
And Franklin's train was heading west,
but he jumped off to the...

520
00:38:09,616 --> 00:38:11,200
south...

521
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,330
- You know D.B. Cooper?
- Yeah, yeah, the hijacker.

522
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:19,790
But he was never found.

523
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:21,621
Yeah, but he's got to
be somewhere, right,

524
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,593
because someone hijacked
that plane in Portland

525
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,361
and jumped out over
the Pacific Northwest.

526
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:29,572
And someone was arrested two
days later in Bisbee, Arizona.

527
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,071
- Not the same guy.
- Same guy.

528
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:33,041
Same guy who was treated
for a broken knee

529
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:35,761
in a free clinic somewhere
around Salt Lake City.

530
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:39,161
Same guy whose Nova blew a head
gasket ten miles short of the border.

531
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:41,930
Same guy who almost got
away with a stolen car,

532
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:46,072
but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.
Vehicular manslaughter.

533
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:50,261
Arrested and booked as
Charles Westmoreland.

534
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:53,971
But he didn't have the money on him.
Which means...

535
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:56,681
He got rid of it
somewhere along the way.

536
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:59,271
Wait, wait, this is fact?
You figured all this out?

537
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:02,752
No. Scofield did. That's why he
was bringing the old man along.

538
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:05,760
The money's in Utah.
And they're all going to get it.

539
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:13,180
You know, in, uh,
Thailand they got a black market

540
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:15,290
where you can get any
kind of surgery you need,

541
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,881
- even a hand transplant.
- You're sick, you know that.

542
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:20,653
Keep going.
The turnoff's just up here somewhere.

543
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,750
Before or after Sheep Road?

544
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:26,500
What's the matter,
Theodore, did you forget?

545
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:29,342
How could I forget a road called Sheep?
It's after.

546
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:32,343
Don't you feel all warm inside
now that we're working together?

547
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,871
We aren't working together.
You're just here to lend a hand.

548
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:40,351
Slow down. That was it,
that little bitty road right back there.

549
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:05,272
How far is it from here?

550
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:08,652
Quarter mile if I remember
the scale properly.

551
00:40:08,746 --> 00:40:09,813
Start walking.

552
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:34,533
- Frank?
- Yeah, I'm almost ready.

553
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,362
What time did you
say the flight was?

554
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:37,343
8:00.

555
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,822
Listen, I hope you get this
nomination more than anyone, but...

556
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:43,790
be prepared.
This Burrows thing may steamroll.

557
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:46,043
Well, we'll wait it out,
just like you said.

558
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:48,103
Problem is too many headlines.

559
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,930
His lawyer Nick
Savrinn's already dead.

560
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,563
His kid's awaiting trial
for double homicide.

561
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:55,380
And now his lead counsel
is classified as missing.

562
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,592
Well, is she missing
or is she dead?

563
00:40:58,937 --> 00:41:02,003
I just thought you should know
before you go to Washington.

564
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:04,632
Bruce, is there something
connecting all of this?

565
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,971
It's probably best you don't
ask a whole lot of questions.

566
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:19,393
Where now?

567
00:41:22,586 --> 00:41:24,652
Right up there.

568
00:41:24,745 --> 00:41:27,051
The hill borders the property.

569
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,543
KK's on the other side.

570
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,413
First thing I'm gonna
do with the money?

571
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:33,052
Buy new shoes.

572
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:34,363
Second thing: tacos.

573
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:36,713
Third thing: ice cold beer.

574
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,760
Fourth thing:
a little toothpaste.

575
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:57,412
Mahone.

576
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:59,620
Agent Mahone,
your car's out front, sir.

577
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:01,370
The flight to Utah
leaves in an hour.

578
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,840
I'll be there. Thank you.

579
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:32,623
Ninth thing: a shower.

580
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:35,482
Tenth thing:
a good night's sleep.

581
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:38,311
A nice hotel. Clean sheets.

582
00:42:38,408 --> 00:42:40,842
Look, stakes marking
the property line.

583
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:45,271
Should be dead ahead.
Can you see the silo?

584
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:54,151
The bastards built over it.

585
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:57,732
It's gone.

586
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:03,840
