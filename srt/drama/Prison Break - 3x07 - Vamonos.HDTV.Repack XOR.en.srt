1
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,900
Explain something
to me, Blanco,

2
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,140
One minute you plead
for your friend's life,

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,190
and the next minute
you want to take it.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
This man...

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,860
this man is no
friend of mine!

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,840
What happened to your
girlfriend has nothing...

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,940
Her name was Sara!

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,400
And she was a good person.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,990
And she'd still be alive

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,150
if it wasn't for you.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,760
So it's revenge, eh, boy?

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,360
An eye for an eye?

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,670
Once you make such a
declaration there's no going back.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,210
There's nothing to go back to.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,400
Good.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,230
Then we have a fight.

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,390
Now, both of you,

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,910
go and assign your belongings,

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,510
and pray to
whatever god is yours.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,930
Come back here
in 15 minutes.

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,620
Fight, fight, fight, fight...

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:17,480
fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight fight...

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,280
You need anymore help?

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,770
You've done
more than enough.

25
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,270
Here, take that, man.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not a lot, but it's
enough to get you started.

27
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,490
Oh, no, no,
I can't take this.

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,350
I did this because I
wanted to help you guys.

29
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,810
Hey, buy a car,
get a bus ticket,

30
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,190
do whatever,
just get out of here.

31
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,590
Thanks.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm going to get
some gas, okay?

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,320
I'll meet you in the front.

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:06,930
All right.

35
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,920
Is she coming with you
to do the exchange?

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,390
Yeah.

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,320
You think that's a good idea?

38
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,800
I mean, what if
something goes wrong

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,300
- and she gets hurt?
- I need some incentive

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,980
just in case Whistler
doesn't want to go quietly.

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,240
You think any of this is
going to go down quiet?

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,540
They're just going
to give you LJ

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,470
- just like that?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,010
I know what these
people are capable of.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,610
I'm not going to
gamble with my son's life.

46
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,100
Maybe you don't have to.

47
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,740
Alex.

48
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,110
Alex.

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,330
Yeah.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,590
We'll be arriving at the
courthouse in about 15 minutes.

51
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,150
Then the hearing
will begin shortly.

52
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
All and all this whole thing will
be done within the hour.

53
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,060
Good.

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,130
That sounds good.

55
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,230
So with this deal...

56
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,800
what specifically are they
expecting from me?

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,280
They need to
know everything.

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,550
About the President,
about the company.

59
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,780
They want to
confirm that you have

60
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,970
viable incriminating information

61
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,720
and that you can be a
cooperative witness.

62
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,640
If I cooperate fully...

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,370
I won't just be incriminating them.

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,800
You're worried about all those
skeletons in your closet,

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
but you have full immunity.

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,550
Everything will be fine.

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,050
All you have to
do is tell the truth.

68
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,690
Stay calm.

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,250
Better knuckle up.

70
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,310
Look, I don't know
what you're thinking,

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,890
but killing me is not

72
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,300
- going to solve your problem.
- Relax.

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,090
I'm not going to kill you.

74
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,520
Then what the hell
was all that about?!

75
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,200
You want to make it out of
here without being seen,

76
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,800
you need a diversion.
Now we have one.

77
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,700
You're off your head. Do you
know that? They're waiting...

78
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,510
We don't have time for this.
It's almost 3:00,

79
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,680
and that means the tower
guard should be drugged by now.

80
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,280
At 3:13, the sun's going to hit
the other guard tower.

81
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,700
We'll have the cover we need.
It's now or never.

82
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,150
Listen, Michael, I, uh...

83
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,020
I meant what I said about Sara.

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,900
If I were you I wouldn't
mention that name again.

85
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,990
We're getting out of here now,
and then I'm trading you for my nephew.

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,880
And then I'm going to find out

87
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,790
who's responsible
for taking her life...

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,100
and I'm taking theirs.

89

Prison Break
Season 03 Episode 07
"Vamonos"

91
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,150
- Listen, Scofield...
- Not now.

92
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,490
I just... please.

93
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,840
I heard you out
there in the yard.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,530
Is that true

95
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,830
about Sara?

96
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,190
Yes.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,050
That's not... I mean it's...

98
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:31,940
What'd she...?

99
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,180
I'm sorry, Michael.

100
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,700
I mean it.

101
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,150
She was a good person.

102
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,790
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,760
Is something wrong?

104
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,885
If anyone asks,

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,400
just tell them your fuel
pump's leaking, all right?

106
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,360
No, no, no, I'm going to
the beach with you.

107
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,735
No. I need you to keep a lookout.

108
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,220
When they get here
I'll call you, all right?

109
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,130
If everything works out today,

110
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,000
You and me-we're both
going to get what we want.

111
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,740
Stay here.

112
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,360
Sorry about that.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,140
That's okay.

114
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,570
I know you're
just doing your job.

115
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,545
I bet you're as ready

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,830
for this to be over with as I am.

117
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,020
Hey, you know, once
we get out of Panama,

118
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,825
Me and my dad and my uncle

119
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,610
we're going to open up a
scuba shop somewhere.

120
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,300
- Build a house on the beach...
- Lovely.

121
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,280
go swimming every day.

122
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,220
- I never lived by the ocean...
- You can stop.

123
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,600
I always wanted to, you know?

124
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:25,220
I get it.

125
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,705
You're a human being

126
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,800
with dreams, plans for
the future, all that.

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,070
Whether you see it isn't
up to me anymore.

128
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,680
It's in your uncle's hands now.

129
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,350
So let's just hope that
he does his job.

130
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,990
What are you waiting for?

131
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,140
Where's Mahone?

132
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,640
He's gone.

133
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,060
What, just like that?

134
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,160
Why? I mean, how?

135
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,100
How about we worry a little bit
more about us, huh?

136
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,300
You know, he got out of
here kind of suddenly.

137
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,710
How do we know he's not
ratting us out right now?

138
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,080
Sullins.

139
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,140
When did this happen?

140
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,370
Are you sure? Yeah.

141
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,170
I'll handle it.

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,080
Something wrong?

143
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,920
A couple of the Panamanians
might have gotten cold feet.

144
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,760
Exactly how cold?

145
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,420
They just need
some convincing.

146
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,110
It's nothing to worry about.

147
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:47,730
It's all gonna work out.

148
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,460
Meantime, we're gonna take
you to a hotel room.

149
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,470
Up until an hour ago,

150
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:52,470
this was a done deal.

151
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,380
So... what's happening?

152
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,660
Relax.
This is still your best bet.

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,850
Unless someone's offering you

154
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,100
a "Get out of Sona free" card.

155
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,955
Now, remember, we'll only
have four minutes of cover,

156
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,080
so once you hit the ground you
run straight to the fence.

157
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't look up,
don't look back,

158
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,080
don't say a word.

159
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,320
What if they see us?

160
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,610
If someone yells stop,

161
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,530
you stop.

162
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,420
That's it?

163
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,040
That's it.

164
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,680
It's time.

165
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,480
Where's Sammy?

166
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,760
So, who goes first?

167
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,670
Right now my life isn't worth
a damn without yours.

168
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,760
If this doesn't go as
planned, the first guy

169
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,010
through that window's
gonna get shot.

170
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,340
That guy can't be you.

171
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,730
I'll go.

172
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:57,730
I got it.

173
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,740
Come on, come on, come on.

174
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,700
This is it.

175
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,810
Five...

176
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,860
Four...

177
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,740
Three...

178
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,930
Two... One.

179
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,120
The glare.

180
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,080
- Where's the glare?
- I don't know.

181
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,550
Come on

182
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:03,980
This is it.

183
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,780
Someone's coming.

184
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:03,670
Good luck.

185
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,550
You, too.

186
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,110
We're losing the light.

187
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,740
Go back. Go back!

188
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,900
Go back!

189
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,700
Come on! Come on!

190
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
That was our only chance.

191
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Damn it!

192
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Find out where they are.

193
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,100
Do you hear 'em out there?
They're waiting for us.

194
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,700
- It's only a matter of time.
- I know. Come on.

195
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
The damn thing's
not coming off!

196
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Hey, Gringos!

197
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Come out and play.

198
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Come on! Come on!

199
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Nowhere to hide, Malditos!

200
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,200
Gringos!

201
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,800
Come out and play!

202
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,400
We've got to go.
They can't find us here.

203
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,500
But what about this?

204
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,300
Stash it!

205
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,300
Come on!

206
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,100
Come on!

207
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
Go.Go...

208
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
Where are you off to, Backra?

209
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,800
Where you boys been?

210
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,500
The bathroom?

211
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,100
This has all been

212
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
a terrible mistake.

213
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Has it been?

214
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,900
We've, uh, we've worked it out.

215
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,700
There's no need to
take this any further.

216
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,700
You clearly don't understand

217
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,000
I can't have your foolishness
spread in this place.

218
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,100
I gave you every
chance to pull out.

219
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,100
Please.

220
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,400
We know the rules!

221
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,400
Two men go in,

222
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
one man comes out!

223
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,200
Now,

224
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,700
this quarrel must be settled.

225
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,300
Let's go.

226
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

227
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
What are you
gentlemen waiting for?

228
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
You two don't make this
more interesting, I will.

229
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Sorry, mate- if only
one of us is getting out...

230
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,800
How's it look?

231
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,500
They got LJ in
the back of the van.

232
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,600
- He seem all right to you?
- Yeah, I think so.

233
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
All right,
how many people they got?

234
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,000
She's got a driver and a
bodyguard- that's it.

235
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,900
All right. You know I appreciate
you hanging around, man

236
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,800
Hey, we started this together, bro.

237
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Let's finish it that way.

238
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,700
Come on, Michael.

239
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,600
Where are you?

240
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,500
What you doing here?

241
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
You're supposed to
be keeping watch.

242
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
Just checking, making sure
everything is all right.

243
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,700
They're running a bit late,
that's all.

244
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,900
So, what's the plan?

245
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,900
You gonna swim out, wait for
the police to pass, and...

246
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,700
meet with a boat somewhere?

247
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,600
Something like that.

248
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,100
And then what?

249
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
You know what,
you need to get back

250
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,200
- to the car...
- Don't move.

251
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,900
I'm impressed.

252
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,600
You've actually got the guts to
look me in the eye

253
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,500
as you stab me in the back.

254
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,100
What are you
going to do, shoot me?

255
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,900
Don't.
I can't let you hand over

256
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,800
James to those people.

257
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You need to think about
what you're doing.

258
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,900
I have!

259
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,400
Every since you told me what
they did to Sara.

260
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,800
When they get here,
James and I, we're leaving.

261
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,900
Where to?

262
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,500
I don't know.
Somewhere they won't find us.

263
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,100
So, this whole time,
you played me.

264
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,600
Like you've been playing me.

265
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Bringing me here to
be your lookout?

266
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
But it's okay.

267
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,300
We were both here
doing what we had to

268
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,300
for the people we love.

269
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,200
You do this, you may as well
be shooting my son yourself.

270
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,400
I'm sorry.

271
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,900
They should be out by now.
Any sign?

272
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,600
All quiet.

273
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
How much longer do you
want to give them?

274
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,300
I know you wanted to live

275
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,300
by an ocean your whole life.

276
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,700
Sad to think

277
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,290
the closest you'll get is
being buried under one.

278
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,420
You're not gonna kill me.

279
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,000
- Oh?
- You need me.

280
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,250
You already killed Sara.

281
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Anything happens to me,

282
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,065
you're out of bargaining chips.

283
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,600
If Michael doesn't get
Whistler out today,

284
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,600
I won't need to
bargain anymore.

285
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,200
You'll all be dead.

286
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,800
Hurtdo?

287
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,400
Kick him in the junk, Scofield!

288
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,300
What are you looking for, boy!
There are no draws here!

289
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,000
If this isn't finished
by one of you,

290
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm coming down
to finish both of you.

291
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,800
Hurtdo?

292
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,490
End it.

293
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
God! God forgive me.

294
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,500
They should have
been here by now.

295
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,100
Maybe they get out.
They should be on their way.

296
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,500
- They didn't make it.
- So what do we do now?

297
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,500
I don't care what you do,

298
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,400
but I'm taking the car.

299
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,700
What?

300
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,000
What the hell's going on?

301
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,600
Put your hands
up on your head!

302
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,100
You come down here.

303
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:37,600
Now!

304
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,700
We are going to find
out who is behind this.

305
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,500
What?

306
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,600
Were you going to let me know
what the hell's going on?

307
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Lincoln?

308
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,300
I'm here.

309
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,800
Good. Where are they?

310
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,300
They're in the car with me.

311
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,600
I heard the alarm.

312
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,600
They were long gone before
that thing went off.

313
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,100
Well, if they had such a head start,

314
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
why are you so far behind?

315
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Listen, do you want me
to talk to your drive?

316
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
I want you to put
Whistler on the phone.

317
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,100
What?

318
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Put him on.

319
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,900
He's in the trunk.

320
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,700
But, if you feel that
strongly about it,

321
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,900
I can pull over and you two
can have a nice little talk.

322
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
If we're real lucky, maybe
some cops will swing by.

323
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm sure they'd like a word, too.

324
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,100
You know what?
Just get LJ ready.

325
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,300
Whoever tried to escape
assaulted one of my men.

326
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
And, as you know,
any attempt on the life

327
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,600
of a Panamanian soldier

328
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
Warrants the death penalty.

329
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,800
This attempt was made
from cell #212.

330
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,500
And if memory serves,

331
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,900
that cell belongs to
members of your crew, no?

332
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,200
You.

333
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,000
You are one of
the Milkman's boys.

334
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,200
Is it your cell?

335
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm going to take
that as a "Yes".

336
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,200
I thought we were
compadres, you and I.

337
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,000
I let you run your business,
have your whores.

338
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
When you asked me for your own
personal supply of water

339
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,100
when the plumbing went down,
did I not provide it?

340
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,200
When you asked me to get rid

341
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,000
of the phones,
make them contraband,

342
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,300
so you could
control the trade in here,

343
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,800
did I not comply?

344
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,300
I do all this for you.

345
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,800
And in exchange,
you were to do one thing

346
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
for me.

347
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,900
Keep these men in line!

348
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,700
Maybe we just backed
the wrong horse.

349
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,500
Perhaps there is another in
here better suited for the job.

350
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Good luck, Bredda.

351
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,300
You know none of us tried

352
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,800
to break out of that cell.

353
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,200
I do.

354
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,900
Then you must know there's
only one guy here

355
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,300
foolish enough to try.

356
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,100
Nice to see
you back in form.

357
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,500
Thanks.

358
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Any news from Sullins?

359
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,900
He's working on it.

360
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
It doesn't matter
what people say.

361
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,900
What do they say?

362
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,800
You know people,
how they talk. About?

363
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,400
The men,
the ones they say you killed.

364
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:57,800
Is it true?

365
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Because, if it is, you
can talk to about it.

366
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,900
Is that a fact?

367
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,800
Yes. You can trust me.

368
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,800
So let me get this straight.

369
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Sullins sends you to be good cop?

370
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,400
That's not what this is.

371
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
There never was a deal,
was there?

372
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Sullins just wants me to confess

373
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,100
so he can bring me up on more
charges back in the States.

374
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
The deal is legit.

375
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,000
The hearing was supposed to be

376
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,000
an hour after we left the prison,

377
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
and I'm still waiting.

378
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,900
So why don't you just come
clean, Felicia, huh?

379
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,600
For old times' sake?
How about it?

380
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,300
How about you do me the
same courtesy, Alex?

381
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,100
I'm not blind.
My brother was a user.

382
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I can smell the stuff a mile away.

383
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,900
Don't you accuse me of being
the one who's hiding something.

384
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,700
Hey, I just got confirmation
from the radio.

385
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,300
The guards took a head count and
they secured the perimeter.

386
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,500
No one made it
out of there today.

387
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,600
Sucre, what's going on?

388
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,900
Looks like they're packing up.

389
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,700
Whatever you do

390
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,400
don't let them take LJ, all right?

391
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,400
Linc? Linc?

392
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,200
Sucre?

393
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,900
Get the hell
out of here now.

394
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,200
Look out!

395
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:54,800
Dad!

396
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,500
Let her go

397
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Drop it or I swear to
God I'll put a bullet in her head!

398
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,200
Now you let him go!
You let him go now! Dad!

399
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,100
LJ, I'm going to get you out of this,
I promise.

400
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,900
You sure you want to make
promises to your son you can't keep?

401
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,800
Watch your mouth.

402
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,200
I'll let you in on a little secret.

403
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,000
When you choose

404
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,500
this line of work, you know it's
all going to come down

405
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,400
to a moment like this.

406
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,300
So kill me.

407
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,200
Let him go.

408
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,700
- Let him go!
- Kill him.

409
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,500
Kill him.

410
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Dad!

411
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
It doesn't matter
what you do to me.

412
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,500
The operation failed.

413
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,100
So put your gun down, Linc.

414
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,800
Kill him.

415
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,500
Dad!

416
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
No!

417
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,700
No

418
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,000
Give me one more shot.

419
00:34:54,035 --> 00:34:54,900
To do what?

420
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Let me find out what
happened in Sona.

421
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:57,600
Let me talk to Michael.

422
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,800
We can still get Whistler.

423
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,100
We can make this happen.

424
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
We can make this happen.
We...

425
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,700
We can do this.

426
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Put him in the van.

427
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,000
Sucre!

428
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:39,900
You all right?

429
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,800
What happened?

430
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,500
Body bags.

431
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,850
Look, what happened out there...

432
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:04,400
Happened out there. It's over.

433
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,100
All right then.

434
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Right, just so you know,

435
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,465
I wouldn't have
gone through with it.

436
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,400
Lucky for us, we'll
never have to find out.

437
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
So what do we do now?

438
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,600
You know where are you, boy?

439
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,365
Well, I'm no doctor,
You but I'm just guessingboy.

440
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
your mother had a little bit too
much to drink one night

441
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,300
Keep talking

442
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,900
and you're going to be next.

443
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,300
How you want it, brother?

444
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,900
Fast or slow?

445
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,000
Think I like to
handle this one myself.

446
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,300
Do you have children, Mr. Scofield?

447
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Maybe someday.

448
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,200
That's very optimistic for a
man in your position.

449
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Myself, I have five.

450
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,100
Three boys, two girls.

451
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,800
Now I used to tell them a story-

452
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,465
I believe in your country

453
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,300
they call it,
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf. "

454
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,400
You know it?

455
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Well, then you know
the moral of that story

456
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:32,600
is even when liars tell the truth,

457
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,200
they can never be believed.

458
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,800
But your life's on the line, boy.

459
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,400
Are you trying to break out of
this prison, Mr. Scofield?

460
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,300
No.

461
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,900
Are you trying to break
out of this prison?

462
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,165
We both know
that's not possible.

463
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,565
Answer me!
What do you want me to say?

464
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,700
I want you to tell me the truth.
I want to hear it.

465
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:57,200
- You want a reason to kill me.
- No, boy...

466
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,300
I have good reason to kill you.

467
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
Because of you,
it's no longer possible

468
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:02,900
for me to effectively
govern this prison.

469
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,265
Justified or not,

470
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,500
the men no longer
have faith in me.

471
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
That leaves only one
thing for me to do

472
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:08,800
to guarantee my survival.

473
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,800
You are breaking out of this
prison, Mr. Scofield.

474
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,300
And you're taking
me with you.

475
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,900
Well, I've got
some good news

476
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,500
and I've got
some better news.

477
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,000
Let's start with the good.

478
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,500
Panamanians are back on board.

479
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,400
And the better news?

480
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,165
You're going to get to have

481
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,100
a really nice sleep on that bed.

482
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,500
I thought that I...

483
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
After the hearing I was going to
be on a plane back to the U.S.

484
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,965
You said...

485
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,265
I did, and you will be,

486
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
but it's just too late to do
the hearing now.

487
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:20,900
We'll get to it
first thing tomorrow.

488
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
- Tomorrow morning?
- Sounds about right.

489
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,100
Please... is there something,
is there anything

490
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,800
that we can do to
help speed things up?

491
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,500
When a genie
grants you a wish

492
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,400
you don't really tell him
to make it snappy.

493
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:36,565
This hearing

494
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
needs to happen today.

495
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,900
The hearing needs...
needs to happen right now!

496
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,600
Listen to you.

497
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,500
You know,
you are unbelievable.

498
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,700
I have dropped everything

499
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,765
to come down here

500
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,165
and drag your sorry ass

501
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,950
out of that hellhole...
- You don't understand.

502
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:52,700
- I've made you a deal.
- I can't... I can't wait.

503
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,300
I can't wait.

504
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,500
You know, I am so glad

505
00:39:58,535 --> 00:39:59,865
I have made this trip

506
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,200
to help your esteemed colleague.

507
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:03,100
I am just tickled.

508
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,300
Cuff him.

509
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,800
Is that necessary?

510
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:09,000
Cuff him.

511
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,300
I'm sorry.

512
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,200
I can't wait.

513
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,700
Hey, have you seen Whistler?

514
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,800
No.

515
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,565
I spent my whole career

516
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,500
trying to keep bad
people behind bars.

517
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,865
Like somehow by doing my job

518
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,600
I was making the world
a better place.

519
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,800
And then...

520
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,400
then you hear about what
happened to someone like Sara.

521
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Damn if it doesn't seem
like there's more bad people

522
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:52,600
out there than in here.

523
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,400
I warned the brothers what
would happen if they failed.

524
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,300
If I give them more time now,
I may as well hand them

525
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,100
a condom and
a cigarette to go with it.

526
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
You know, I came all
the way down here.

527
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,965
The least you could do is
offer me an opinion.

528
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,400
I thought we agreed it was best
for you to not come here.

529
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
And I thought you needed to
be out in seven days.

530
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
I need to know how this delay is
going to affect things.

531
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Well, it won't be comfortable,
but it will be possible.

532
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,765
Oh, well,
thank you, James,

533
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,300
but that doesn't exactly
ravage me with confidence.

534
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,400
And what would?

535
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,800
Your ass on a plane.

536
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
Four more days.

537
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,300
If I'm out of here by then,
I can still do it.

538
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,600
Trust me.
It'll be fine.

539
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,800
I'll let the brothers know.

540
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Gretchen.

541
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,500
About Sofia...

542
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,990
She's fine.

543
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,500
Burrows is taking real
good care of her.

544
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,730
Good luck, James.

545
