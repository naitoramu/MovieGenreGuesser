1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,559
This place is
under new management.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,719
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,639
Just write down "peace", right,

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,279
between the Jews and the Italians.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,119
And war against the gypsies.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,719
- I love him, Tom.
- I know.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,639
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,279
put him charge of the new.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,279
Some idiots
at the Marquis of Lorne.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,759
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,319
We fought them off.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,119
The Marquis?

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,439
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,839
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,639
a good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,439
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,919
I've made arrangements
with men I trust.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,959
If I should die, then you will die.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,280
Thanks.

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,479
Would you stop the noise?

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,279
You working tonight?

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,799
Not so much work as pleasure.

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,039
Others are doing my work
for me tonight.

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,999
Gentlemen, welcome!

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,239
Welcome!

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,519
Mr Solomon.

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,079
You must be Arthur.

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,959
- That is right.
- Arthur!

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,159
- Arthur!
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.

30
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,239
I've heard so much about you.

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,239
Shalom. Let me just say.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,399
Shalom.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,839
For luck.

34
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:54,363
<b>WwW.ZooCine.NeT
Watch Movies and Series!</b>

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,199
You understand I'm the commanding
officer on this operation.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,439
You're here purely as an observer.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,439
Just do your duty.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,719
Dear Lord,

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,599
for what we're about to receive
may the Lord make us truly grateful.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Amen.

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,319
Passover started off
way out there in the Far East,

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,039
out in the sand, out in the desert,
where me forefathers come from.

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
You know, the Jews, the brews,
whatever you want to call them.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,519
It started out
as a little speck on the horizon.

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,599
Arthur, this ain't right.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,559
Billy, don't worry, mate, you know
what I mean? If you want, you can leave.

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,039
If you need to go
to the little boys' room, you can leave.

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,239
We going to open 'em in a minute.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,399
He's all right, he's all right,
Billy boy.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,679
- Do you want to leave?
- No, you're all right.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,879
- You want to stay?
- I'll stay.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,759
You stay there, then, treacle.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,639
Okay, so the pharaoh.
Have you heard of him?

54
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,559
He kept my people,
the Jewish people, in slavery,

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,079
for thousands and thousands of years.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,799
Persecuted race.

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,959
He did, he persecuted my race.

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,279
The killing of the innocent, right?

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,519
Seder, this feast,
that what we is having here.

60
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,719
Seder is basically the day what
when the Jewish angels decided,

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,879
you know, that the evil
fucking Egyptians

62
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,759
had pushed their fucking luck!

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,999
Right.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,559
It is part of our tradition
to do with Seder, right,

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,719
that in order to make it good
with God to kill a king,

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,799
we have to carry out the Korban Pesach.

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,599
- Right.
- That,

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,119
is the ritual sacrifice
of the Passover goat.

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,559
- It's a goat.
- Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,799
Tonight. That's part of the reason
why we have to shut the doors as well.

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,719
But this year we thought
we'd give the fucking goat a name.

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,839
- You've named it?
- We fucking did, yeah.

73
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,159
- They named the fucking goat.
- The evil fucking Egyptian pharaoh,

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,759
- the fucking enemy.
- That's right.

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,679
- You know what we called it?
- What did ya call him?

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,119
Tommy Shelby.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,839
Stay where you are!

78
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,159
You're all fired.

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,519
Fuck you.

80
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,119
That's right, let's take a load off.

81
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,639
So...

82
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,879
And the evil Egyptian scum...

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,119
was finally cleansed,

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,519
with the blood
of the Passover goat, mate.

85
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,879
That's from Sabini.

86
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,119
And tell your gypsy king...

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,119
whoever comes
down south, shall return north

88
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,039
in many fucking pieces.

89
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,039
This fucking animal. He come in here,
right, with a fucking gun and razor

90
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,039
and he shot him in the face!

91
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,279
And my lads, they restrained him.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,639
Look at him. He's dead. Is he dead?

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,559
He's fucking dead!

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,679
He wants arresting or something, right?

95
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,679
Surely.

96
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,239
Michael! You can't take him away again,
you can't take my son away!

97
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
You come back here! No! No!

98
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,959
Don't you fucking touch him!
Get off him!

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,079
Don't say anything!
Tommy will get you out!

100
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,159
Fuck!

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,639
I'll be all right...

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,879
You should know, that as of this night,
Tommy Shelby is finished.

103
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,159
Mick? This is Thomas Shelby,
he's come to check up on his filly.

104
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,639
Yes, I've heard about you.

105
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,000
Mick is
the best horseman in England.

106
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,359
He likes to waste money, I know that.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,079
According to the reports
I've been given,

108
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,559
you're spending two pound a month
on worming powder.

109
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,239
What? You want a horse with worms?

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,519
Horses get worms from the water trough.

111
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,919
Put goldfish in them,
they eat the worm eggs.

112
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,399
Goldfish?

113
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,919
- It'll be a gypsy thing, is it?
- No.

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,799
It's an accounting thing.

115
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,719
- Goldfish cost a penny each.
- Or you can win them at the fair.

116
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,879
If you want, I'll dispense
with the vet altogether. Excuse me.

117
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,759
Did you ever consider
a career in diplomacy?

118
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,799
Hello, hello.

119
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,279
How are you?

120
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,759
Goldfish, seriously?

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,319
Yup.

122
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,559
You people have a lot to learn.

123
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,119
They asked me if I wanted a fire
in the guest bedroom.

124
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,719
I said no.

125
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,439
Just one fire tonight.

126
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,799
Bold and fearless?

127
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,519
Yes.

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,719
Though I'm not really fearless.

129
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,639
- Drink?
- Why not?

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,559
- Madam, there is a telephone call.
- I'll take it in the drawing room.

131
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,359
It's for Mr Shelby.

132
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,599
We had a deal.

133
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,039
Hey!

134
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,519
We had a fucking deal.

135
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,719
I would thank you to moderate
your language in a place of worship.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,519
We had a fucking deal.

137
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,959
Mr Shelby.

138
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,119
If you read the papers,

139
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,959
you might have seen that
the Home Secretary has got himself

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,359
into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

141
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,039
Prostitution.

142
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,399
Protection, racketeering, drinking,
cocaine and, of course,

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,799
gambling.

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,119
And he's demanded results.

145
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,719
You offered me protection.

146
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,999
You promised me protection.

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,919
Well, no, you see, it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,679
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

149
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,039
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

150
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,359
decides to go on some sort
of blood orgy during dinner.

151
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,559
Do not fucking lie to me.

152
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,439
Do not sit here
in your fucking church and lie to me!

153
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,919
You will need to contain your emotions
or this meeting is at an end.

154
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,279
Good.

155
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,399
That's better.

156
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,920
So...

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,799
Let us review the new situation.

158
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,959
I have your brother in a prison cell,

159
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,679
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

160
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,799
The case against him is strong.

161
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,039
And I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

162
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,039
And then there is Polly's son Michael.

163
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,159
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis Pub.

164
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,399
He was
a tough nut to crack, that boy.

165
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,919
But crack he did.

166
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,519
So I have your brother facing the noose.

167
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,399
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

168
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,079
And I have
your entire organisation in disarray

169
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,839
in Birmingham and in London.

170
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,399
What do you want?

171
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,079
What do I want?

172
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,679
I don't understand.

173
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,479
I've already agreed

174
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,039
to do your fucking killing for you.

175
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,639
Now what is it you want from me?

176
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,239
There you go, you see...

177
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,879
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

178
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,679
See, I found that

179
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,479
I wasn't sleeping so well.

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,519
And it wasn't just that...

181
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,559
the smell and the noise
in that room, no.

182
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,839
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge.

183
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,159
The knowledge that...

184
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,719
Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

185
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,559
And therefore,

186
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,239
the threat to your own life
might not be enough

187
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,479
to make it certain that
you will obey me on the given day.

188
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,999
I needed also the power
of life and death over your family

189
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,839
and that I now have.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,159
Your brother, your cousin
and your sister.

191
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,479
I've known her address in Primrose Hill
since the day she moved in.

192
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,999
Now she is safe only as long
as I want her to be.

193
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,479
I've been ahead of you,
every step of the way.

194
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,999
And, as my father used to say,

195
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
to make sure your dog obeys you,
you have to show it the stick

196
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,199
once in a while.

197
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,559
Tommy, Arthur's in solitary confinement.
Michael's in remand wing...

198
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,559
Yeah, I already know.
Get out, shut the doors.

199
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,639
Tommy?

200
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,559
It's me.

201
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,199
Tommy, can you hear me?

202
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,719
Yes, Grace.

203
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,279
I think you called.

204
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,239
I haven't slept.

205
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,879
Grace, this is not a good time.

206
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,519
I can call you back.

207
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,999
- No, no, it's fine. It's all right.
- Can we meet?

208
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,039
Yes, we'll meet.

209
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,039
When?

210
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,999
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

211
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,839
John?

212
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,359
Coppers have lifted
10 of our men in Camden town,

213
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,359
the rest of them on the run.

214
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,359
- Tom, they've taken Michael.
- Business first.

215
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,719
- They took Michael last night.
- Polly, business first!

216
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
John?

217
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,079
They took all our whisky.

218
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,960
So no doubt
they'll be supping that for Christmas.

219
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,559
They've impounded all our vans,

220
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,719
put their own locks on the warehouse.

221
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,079
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

222
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,039
and handed back to Sabini and Solomons.

223
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,319
The Black Country boys think
it was Arthur who killed Billy

224
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,559
because that's what
the coppers told them.

225
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,479
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

226
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,159
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

227
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,319
I don't give a fuck about Billy Kitchen.

228
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,439
I want my son out of prison now.

229
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,879
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

230
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,719
This meeting should just be family.

231
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,719
- I can help.
- It's family only, she's not blood.

232
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,799
- Let her speak.
- Tommy! Or is this a business...

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,239
Enough!

234
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,119
Enough, Polly.

235
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,999
Esme.

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,199
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

237
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,439
- The bloody Lees!
- They can give us men.

238
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,639
We don't need more fucking men.

239
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,159
It's men that have done
the damage. It's...

240
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,799
It is men fighting like cockerels that
have put us here in the first place.

241
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,519
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

242
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,079
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

243
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,399
I am taking him away
from this family, for good.

244
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,399
This life is bad.

245
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,359
This life is all bad.

246
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,079
- Aunt Pol, what are you doing?
- Shut up and walk.

247
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,479
Thomas.

248
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,600
Should I go and speak
to Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

249
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,039
Yes.

250
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,359
She can give us soldiers
for a few nights.

251
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,959
Good.

252
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,479
John, go bring up the car.

253
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,879
Imagine riding away, Thomas.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,319
Living the real life, you know?

255
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,479
Your gypsy half is the stronger.

256
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,159
You just want to ride away.

257
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,279
France is the new place
for us, they say.

258
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,799
Lot of metal lying around still.

259
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,879
Guns and trucks
and spent shells and things.

260
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,799
Then you go south.

261
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,399
Saintes Maries.

262
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,999
Where the Black Madonna is.

263
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,479
My brothers go sometimes for the fair.

264
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,239
It's like a home for us.

265
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,599
They still let you get lost there.

266
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,399
I've been to France, Esme.

267
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,759
So has John.

268
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,199
Now get your coat
and go with your husband.

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,519
If you ever talk about getting
lost again, I'll cut you

270
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,679
from this family.

271
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,959
What family?

272
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,599
Come in.

273
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,239
Polly.

274
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,039
I've come to see my son.

275
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,919
Close the door.

276
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,319
I've just been conducting
an interrogation.

277
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,599
It can be awfully hard on the hands.

278
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,639
My son. Michael. Where is he?

279
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,999
Do you think I need a shave?

280
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,879
It's been a long day.

281
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,199
I need a shave, don't you think?

282
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,999
Well, maybe it can wait till later.

283
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,439
Your son has been having
a hard time of it I'm told.

284
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,319
And that is why I thought
that you and I together,

285
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,879
we should do whatever we can
to get him freed.

286
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,159
Now, I have a form here, a release form.

287
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,719
With my signature,

288
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,159
he can be freed
by tomorrow morning at dawn.

289
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,719
So sign it.

290
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,839
- He didn't do anything.
- "Sign it,

291
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,119
"Mr Campbell. Please, sir."

292
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Something like that. That would be
a way to say that, wouldn't it?

293
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,479
Now,

294
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,599
what would prompt me
to do you such a favour?

295
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,679
What do you want?

296
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,439
Information?

297
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,639
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

298
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,919
With respect,

299
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,599
I would say I know more
about Tommy's dealings than you do.

300
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,359
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business for instance, does he?

301
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,799
No.

302
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,079
So, no.

303
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,879
It's not information I need.

304
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,879
What else could you give me

305
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,559
in return for my signature?

306
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,919
I'm talking about
a simple transaction here.

307
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,159
I have a great curiosity.

308
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,879
Like a magpie sees something,

309
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
something shining in the mud.

310
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,519
He has no need for the silver,

311
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,039
but he takes it anyway.

312
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,199
Sign the form.

313
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,759
- "Please, sir."
- Please, sir.

314
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,359
I will sign that form with this hand

315
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,839
when I am finished.

316
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,199
- It's a deal?
- It's a deal.

317
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,039
- Don't cry.
- I can cry.

318
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
So...

319
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,319
That is what I want.

320
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,719
I need you to cry.

321
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,959
I will try.

322
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,879
"I need a favour, Mr Campbell, sir."

323
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,079
"And I will do anything,
anything in return."

324
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,679
That's what you might have said.

325
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,559
I felt something

326
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,199
when I had you up against that car.

327
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,359
And you felt it too.

328
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,719
Don't tell me you didn't,
Polly, because...

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,079
And now you think you're...

330
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,199
You're so respectable,

331
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,199
with your son and your house

332
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,559
and your maid, but I know
what you are, gypsy Fenian slut.

333
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,079
Do you want to do it on the floor
or on the desk, Mr Campbell?

334
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,119
Now you cry.

335
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,039
You cry!

336
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,159
Get out.
Get out.

337
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,479
Get out!

338
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,959
No. No! I want him free.

339
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,799
I'll get him free.

340
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,399
You don't need to shave.

341
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,239
You don't need to do anything.

342
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,679
A victory is just doing nothing as well.

343
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,759
Doing it soft and gentle.

344
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,879
Should I talk or not talk?

345
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,839
Should it be like
I'm weak and small, yes?

346
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,239
Do you want me to talk or not to talk?

347
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,119
Talk.

348
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,159
You're small and weak.

349
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,359
That's what I am...

350
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,439
Small and weak.

351
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,199
Look.

352
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,999
You made me cry.

353
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,639
No!

354
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,159
We had an agreement, right?

355
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,319
Yes. Yes!

356
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,399
Where have you been?

357
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,599
Went to the Spotted Dog in Digbeth.

358
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,839
A glass or two of rum.

359
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,599
Was it one glass or two?

360
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,439
It was three.

361
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,239
Where's the baby?

362
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,959
Sleeping.

363
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,919
More like five.

364
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,919
It was more like six.

365
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,759
Did you meet the maid?

366
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,279
Talked politics with her and
she got bored and went to bed.

367
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,359
I phoned James.

368
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,639
He talked to the lawyer anyway.

369
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,999
Said he'd take Arthur's case for free,

370
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,959
so we don't need Tommy.

371
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,960
Pol?

372
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,399
We'll get Michael free
as well, I promise.

373
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,119
There's no need,
they'll let him out in the morning.

374
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,519
If the baby wants anything at night,
ring the bell by the bed.

375
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,839
She gets paid to work 24 hours,
that girl. She's getting lazy.

376
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,199
Well...

377
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,199
Take advantage if you're nice.

378
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,119
You need cream on them cuts
or they'll go bad.

379
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,719
The screws told me why I've been freed.

380
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,519
They told me what you did.

381
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,039
They thought it was funny.

382
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,760
Maybe it is.

383
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,239
What are you doing, Tommy?

384
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,279
Shovelling shit, Curly.

385
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,119
Just like you.

386
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,639
Why're you doing that, Tommy?

387
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,759
To remind meself what I'd be

388
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,919
if I wasn't who I am.

389
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,199
Tommy. What's going on?

390
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,239
I think Tommy's lost his mind, Charlie.

391
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,479
Well, it's honest work, Curly.

392
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,839
But I don't want to get used to it.

393
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,399
So I'll need six cans of petrol.

394
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,079
Bring them to the garage.

395
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,839
Put them in the back of the car.

396
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,759
Six cans?

397
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,079
Tommy.

398
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,119
If you ever want a job,
I'll get you your own shovel.

399
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,639
Petrol. Yes. Yeah.

400
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,079
You're far too gorgeous
for some half-blind auntie.

401
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,919
She's my harshest critic.

402
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,799
I have to be perfect.

403
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,319
She's not half-blind,
she's half-deaf.

404
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,399
So what time will you be back?

405
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,919
Before midnight.

406
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,079
I'll be awake.

407
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,319
Is this your house?

408
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,879
Yes.

409
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,879
Have a seat.

410
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,519
Do I not get a drink?

411
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,439
Please.

412
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,439
- You want one?
- Yes.

413
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,919
Still whisky?

414
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,519
Yes.

415
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,879
But other things have changed.

416
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,679
I saw vans with your name on
at the docks.

417
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,599
Yes, some things have changed.

418
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,199
Tommy, I really wasn't sure
about coming tonight.

419
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,639
I lit a fire in the bedroom upstairs.

420
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,399
My plan was

421
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,519
that we'd sit here for a while,

422
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,559
talk about old times,

423
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,319
drink some whisky.

424
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,359
And I was gonna tell you

425
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,679
I hadn't spent a day

426
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,359
without thinking about you.

427
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,599
And then we were gonna go upstairs

428
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,439
and sleep together.

429
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,079
But just now on the way
to opening the door,

430
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,919
I changed me mind.

431
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,639
So just have one drink

432
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,199
tell me how happy you are in New York

433
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,679
and then you can go.

434
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,919
You changed your mind?

435
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,119
So you can go.

436
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,519
Well...

437
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,479
As a matter of fact,

438
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,239
I am happy in New York.

439
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,879
And I am married.

440
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,679
Yeah, he's... He's rich. I know.

441
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,359
And he's sweet.

442
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,479
And he's kind to me.

443
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,759
So what makes you think that
I would have gone to bed with you

444
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,439
after one whisky and some conversation?

445
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,199
I was accounting for three whiskys.

446
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,959
How dare you?

447
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,959
It doesn't matter now,
'cause I've changed me mind.

448
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,599
I came here because you asked me.

449
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,519
Even though he's sweet
and he's kind to you?

450
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,039
And now I feel like an idiot.

451
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,439
Well, then, go.

452
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,039
Jesus.

453
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,319
Well, you're still here.

454
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,640
Are you so certain?

455
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,079
That you're still in love with me?

456
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,079
I was.

457
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,399
But I'm not any more.

458
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,279
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

459
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,199
No, I'm not armed.

460
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,719
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

461
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,799
You don't have a sense of humour
any more, either.

462
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,839
What are you talking about?

463
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,079
The thing is, I hate reunions.

464
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,679
I didn't want to sit here
for hours talking about nothing

465
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,879
and dancing around
what we really want to say.

466
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,239
So now,

467
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,159
I know you're happy in New York.

468
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,399
I know your husband's rich
and sweet and kind to you.

469
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,799
I know you're unarmed.

470
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,839
And you didn't come here for sex
because you don't love me any more.

471
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,119
And it's only three minutes past.

472
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,759
Another drink?

473
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,879
I'll take that as a yes.

474
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,159
It's good to see you, Grace.

475
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,279
So you didn't light the fire?

476
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,319
You see, my real plan

477
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,279
was that we go out.

478
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,559
I want to impress you.

479
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,759
Now,

480
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,199
do you like Charlie Chaplin?

481
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,359
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

482
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,919
Good.

483
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,439
I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

484
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,639
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

485
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,759
I am.

486
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,719
- This isn't a picture house.
- No, it's not a picture house.

487
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,879
So how will
I see Charlie Chaplin?

488
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,239
You will see him and you will hear him,
just like I promised.

489
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,799
There you go. There's Chaplin.

490
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,479
My God. That's him.

491
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,079
That's really Charlie Chaplin in person.

492
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,199
Yep. He's in England
promoting his film.

493
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,759
And how the hell
do you know Charlie Chaplin?

494
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,959
I don't.
I know his bodyguard, Wag McDonald.

495
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,039
It's that chap there.

496
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,119
Wag was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

497
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,439
You see, Wag is also Romani gypsy,

498
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,039
as is Chaplin, but he keeps it a secret.

499
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,879
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a gypsy camp in Birmingham.

500
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,439
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

501
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,119
Thank you.

502
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,839
Thank you.
See, we all have our secrets, Grace.

503
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,919
Come on. I'll introduce you.

504
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,319
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

505
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,959
Hello, Mr Chaplin.

506
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,759
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr Campbell.

507
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,559
You said you knew
my sister's address in Primrose Hill,

508
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,759
so I expect you have men
watching the house,

509
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,759
see who comes and goes.

510
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,879
Well, tonight your men
will see me return to the house

511
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,879
with a very beautiful woman.

512
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,039
She will stay
untiljust before midnight.

513
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,679
Of course, I'll close the curtains.

514
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,439
Can you guess who the woman is?

515
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,599
Liar!

516
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,679
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

517
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,199
Tommy.

518
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,599
Tommy, do you have someone?

519
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,519
It's too late, Tommy.

520
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,759
It's 11:00, Grace.

521
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,839
I mean, it's too late.

522
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,959
If you'd come with me to New York...

523
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,559
I have things to do.

524
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,359
You mean the coin landed the wrong way?

525
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,679
It couldn't have worked.

526
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,919
That was a question.

527
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,279
Hey.

528
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,799
Tommy, do you have someone?

529
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,799
I have a racehorse.

530
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,319
She's gonna win the derby.

531
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,679
I'll drive you.

532
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,919
When do you sail back?

533
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,079
We don't know yet.

534
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,399
You don't have a return ticket?

535
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,439
This wasn't right, Tommy.

536
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,799
When do you go back, Grace?

537
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,719
They're doing tests on us.

538
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,079
I don't know when they'll be finished.

539
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,239
We're having treatment.

540
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,079
A doctor on Harley Street.

541
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,959
Some new thing, a breakthrough.

542
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,199
We're trying for a baby.

543
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,959
Why did you come here tonight?

544
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,039
The doctor believes
it's surely me who's at fault.

545
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,119
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,719
It's no one's fault.

547
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,239
I'm tired of that, Tommy.

548
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,239
Can I see you again?

549
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,959
Grace.

550
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,479
You're used to working undercover?

551
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,839
I've never lied to him once.

552
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,439
So tell him the truth.

553
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,119
Put your arms up.

554
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,559
What've we got here then?

555
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,719
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

556
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,999
Here he is.

557
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,239
The King of London Town.

558
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,119
You been enjoying yourself?

559
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,959
Yeah, it's fucking great.

560
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,999
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

561
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,839
Rats everywhere.

562
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,239
Fucking cockneys.

563
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,759
Well, at least you're going
to get what you've always wanted.

564
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,839
And what's that?

565
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,079
Well, you tried to hang yourself twice.

566
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,079
Now the King is gonna do it for you.

567
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,639
- I've been a fuckin' idiot.
- Yeah.

568
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,999
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

569
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,559
Are you fucking repenting or something?

570
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,319
Drawing.

571
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,919
I used to be good at drawing.

572
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,559
Arthur, please, for God's sake,
I don't need this.

573
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,359
I should have listened more in class.

574
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,199
What fucking class?
You were never there.

575
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,359
I used to draw horses.

576
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,759
- Arthur...
- Stallions.

577
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,519
- Great big ones.
- Arthur.

578
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,359
- They looked real.
- Not stallions. Not now.

579
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,719
I should have done more
with me life, John.

580
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,719
- Good things.
- Arthur, for God's sake...

581
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,039
Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

582
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,439
Arthur, will you listen?

583
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,319
- They're gonna hang me, John.
- They're not gonna hang you.

584
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,039
Says who?

585
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,319
Tommy.

586
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,239
And how is Houdini
gonna get me out of this?

587
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,359
- Well, we...
- Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

588
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,679
But you don't know
what that plan is, do you, John?

589
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,839
I do...

590
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,959
'Cause we just can't be trusted.

591
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,639
All right.

592
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,439
If he's so fucking clever,
why am I in here?

593
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,639
Well, it's...

594
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,839
Why is all our men
and half our whisky been lifted?

595
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,239
The Jew and the cockney
have run rings round him.

596
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,359
- Will you shut up?
- Look at you. Look.

597
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,479
- A big fucking man...
- Fucking shut up!

598
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,159
He's already told me
what I've got to do.

599
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,839
What business have you got here?

600
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,279
I just pulled over.

601
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,759
I never smoke and drive, you know?

602
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,239
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Ireland,

603
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,879
the beautiful north
where the rocks sing in the wind.

604
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,879
Yeah, in the beautiful north.

605
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,359
You know,
I've just pulled over for a fag.

606
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,559
I want to see some identification!

607
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,239
Hey!

608
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,799
Look.

609
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,399
Come!

610
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,119
See?

611
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,439
Does it really stop the horses
from getting worms?

612
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,799
Yep. It really does.

613
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,759
Anyway, I thought
it would make you smile.

614
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,879
I'm sorry that you had
to drive through the night.

615
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,039
You must be exhausted.
You can go and sleep if you want.

616
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,319
May.

617
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,959
We have to stop.

618
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,759
This.

619
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,559
I came here
to tell you we have to stop.

620
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,120
Why?

621
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,399
Because I'm me and you're you,
that old thing?

622
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,799
There's someone.

623
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,599
For a long time.

624
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,119
And I didn't want you to think
anything about how

625
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,599
it's gonna be after the race.

626
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,879
Not many of your people know about me,

627
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,719
so I haven't done
the damage that would come.

628
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,319
"My people?"

629
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,799
Well, the damage isn't done,

630
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,279
is what I mean.

631
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,119
- Right.
- It's...

632
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,399
Even if it's like this,
I want the horse to stay here.

633
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,159
To stay? Yes, of course.

634
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,439
Epsom is close.

635
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,199
I haven't got my outfit yet
so it's all right.

636
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,159
You can still be
with me at the enclosure.

637
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,079
That's very gracious of you, sir.

638
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,799
You can wear something.

639
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,879
It's funny, isn't it?

640
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,039
Because you'll be up there
and I'll be down in the ring.

641
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,839
Sort of upside down, isn't it?

642
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,319
You can still be with me after
and you can still wear something.

643
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,599
I'll be covered in mud from the ring.

644
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,399
May, forget about men like me.

645
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,640
I was going to tell you
how much he's improved.

646
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,519
There are other men, May.

647
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,599
I think she stands
a chance of placing, so...

648
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,839
That's the silly part
of our business done.

649
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,440
Are you going to drive
straight off to Birmingham? Or...

650
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,359
And what if I said,

651
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,719
"All right, I'll stay,"
after what I just said?

652
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,999
Then that would be all right.

653
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,279
You talk about damage.

654
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,479
The damage not yet done.

655
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,799
You don't think that half
of London already thinks

656
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,519
that I'm fucking a racketeer?

657
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,879
Laughing about it. Laying on bets
about when you'll steal the silver.

658
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,319
You think your people are ruthless?
Try mine.

659
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,599
So that's why you carry on?

660
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,119
Because you can't back down.

661
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,759
Amongst many other illogical reasons.

662
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,479
So will you drive straight off or...

663
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,519
I haven't got any petrol in the garage.

664
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,119
Yeah. I have some cans
of petrol in the car.

665
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,239
Good. So you can go.

666
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,919
They look happy in there?

667
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,359
And why wouldn't they be?

668
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,199
Who is she?

669
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,399
Someone who's sailing away.

670
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,039
So let her sail.

671
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,839
You've told me about her
like a gentleman.

672
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,159
Now kindly behave like a gangster again.

673
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,599
Feel sorry for me. It's fine.

674
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,319
Because your horse
will come fifth or sixth.

675
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,919
But I will win you.

676
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,079
Mr Shelby's just parking his car.
He said for you to wait in here.

677
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,799
Isn't this impressive?

678
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,559
And what is it you exactly do here?

679
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,919
I exactly am a secretary to Mr Shelby.

680
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,599
A secretary? My, my, my.

681
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,479
All that paperwork.

682
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,239
Do you want tea?

683
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,920
No.

684
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,919
I keep everything locked up,
Mr Campbell.

685
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,839
Everything of value.

686
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,919
Take a seat.

687
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,159
How is your company treasurer, Polly?

688
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,439
- Why do you ask?
- Just give her my regards.

689
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,839
You like to play with fire,

690
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,839
don't you, Mr Shelby?

691
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,279
Yesterday in Belgravia,

692
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,959
Field Marshal Russell's
house was burnt out.

693
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,599
An incendiary device was
put through his letterbox,

694
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,279
which means

695
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,079
that he will have to find
somewhere else to live

696
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,159
for at least the next three months.

697
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,879
Which also means that your plan,

698
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,879
for me to break in
and shoot him in his bed,

699
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,199
is now no longer
an operational possibility.

700
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,759
Indeed.

701
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,799
But if you think a wee burn
frees you from your obligations,

702
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,079
- think again.
- I will keep my side of the bargain.

703
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,199
By God, you will.

704
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,719
I will shoot your field marshal,

705
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,399
but I will do it in a way
that serves my purpose.

706
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,399
The only purpose is my purpose.

707
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,839
I will carry out your assassination
at a place of my choosing.

708
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,479
Listen to me.

709
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,079
All operational detail
must be mutually agreed.

710
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,879
I'm a soldier. I've experience.
I will determine where and when he...

711
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,359
Now that man has 24-hour
armed police protection...

712
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,199
Your plan was full of holes.

713
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,879
My plan was mutually agreed!

714
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,159
Well, now your plan is up in smoke.

715
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,279
And I have formulated
the only viable alternative.

716
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,559
For God's sake, what do you mean?

717
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,839
How would you get to him?

718
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,599
I won't.
He will come to me.

719
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,079
Now, listen to me, Mr Shelby.

720
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,119
When this meeting is concluded,

721
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,839
I must report directly
to Mr Winston Churchill.

722
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,919
Your relationship with Mr Churchill
is not my concern.

723
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,919
And Mr Winston Churchill
will need to hear detail.

724
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,599
Well, you tell him
he'll have to trust me.

725
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,159
Look, Mr Campbell.

726
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,719
I will carry out my mission.

727
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,399
- Good.
- Good.

728
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,679
But I will do it in a place
where it will be impossible

729
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,199
for you or your men
to have me shot afterwards.

730
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,879
Because that was the plan.

731
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,919
Coppers front and back. No way out.

732
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,359
Me shot dead, dumped in the Thames.

733
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,279
I will do the killing,

734
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,999
but at a place
where that will not be an option.

735
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:56,159
I've recently become
a racehorse owner, Mr Campbell.

736
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,199
It's...

737
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,439
Well, perhaps you can guess
which one is my horse.

738
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,559
Where and when?

739
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,199
Epsom.

740
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,399
Derby Day.
