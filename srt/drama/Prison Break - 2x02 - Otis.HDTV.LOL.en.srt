1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:02,431
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:04,558
- What are the charges?
- Attempted murder.

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:07,521
He's also being arraigned for the murder
of his mother and his stepfather.

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:11,038
Don't look at me like some con.
You're as crooked as the scoliosis.

5
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,100
I don't get caught.

6
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:15,431
- This is as far as you go.
- Come on, bro.

7
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:18,412
You an we're not bros.

8
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,895
When were planning on telling
us about the money, man?

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:25,625
What money?

10
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:29,390
$5 million that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

11
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:32,950
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now Linc. He's alive.

12
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:34,718
What are talking about?
You found Steadman?

13
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,144
Oh my god!

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,672
My hand has been in that box
for hours now-- it is dying.

15
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:47,380
- I can promise you nothing.
- Story of my life.

16
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:48,542
These?

17
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,390
Keys to a car that's waiting for us
a couple hundred yards from here.

18
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,742
That's the two of
us or five of us?

19
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:55,082
That's the two of us.

20
00:00:55,177 --> 00:00:56,390
We got company.

21
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:58,723
How did he know?

22
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:01,871
It's only a matter of time
before we know everything

23
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,651
that is in Scofield's head--

24
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,200
where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.

25
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,823
So when the time comes
that he does get there,

26
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:10,702
we'll waiting for him.

27
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,831
Canadian and Mexican border
patrols have all the mug shots.

28
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,310
BORTAC is on high alert.

29
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:20,510
See if we can get the Mexican Border
Patrol to set up checkpoints 50
miles in.

30
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:23,580
The warden over at Fox River called,
asked to be kept in the loop.

31
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,483
- What should I tell him?
- That he's no longer in it.

32
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,413
That info that you asked for is
on your desk when you get in.

33
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:30,610
Thank you.

34
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,170
What's the plan, man?

35
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:48,940
No bars on these doors.
Do what you like.

36
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,462
With what?

37
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,730
We're supposed to be
in Mexico right now.

38
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:56,261
Sipping on margaritas, waiting for
the heat to dip. That was the plan.

39
00:02:57,355 --> 00:03:01,123
You see, they just used us to dig, man.
We're gophers, that's it.

40
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,090
- Where's Michael?
- He'll be here.

41
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:05,011
Okay. You know what, Sucre?

42
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,321
Maybe you and I should go and get that
$5 million, you know what I'm saying?

43
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:11,422
I mean, it's just sitting there in
Tooele, Utah ready to get some air.

44
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,280
You want to stay here?
Then shut your mouth!

45
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:14,881
You got one more time
to touch me, man!

46
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,230
- All right, guys, chill.
- What?

47
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,202
Hey!

48
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:21,932
Relax.

49
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,461
Honey, are you sure
you packed everything?

50
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:43,930
Yummy.

51
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:49,121
Mm.

52
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,920
Our photos are in the paper.
We're probably all over the news.

53
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,801
Yeah, and you didn't
see that coming?

54
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,520
What's so funny?

55
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,872
The two of you cracks me up.

56
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:08,633
Here's to amateur hour.
What do you say, saludo?

57
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,172
Yeah, yuck it up, funny man.

58
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,981
Last supper, boys.

59
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,871
This is the part
where we say good-bye.

60
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:24,002
It's not much.

61
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,620
It's enough to get you started.

62
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:30,282
Hey, uh...

63
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,253
No, I'm not telling
you where Fibonacci is.

64
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,133
Well, I didn't ask.

65
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,660
I only ask for a quarter
for a phone call.

66
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:41,760
Make four.

67
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,580
Thank you.

68
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,290
I wonder what happened
to the other guys.

69
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,772
They all had a head start,
except T-Bag.

70
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:55,472
Yeah, he was,
he was bleeding pretty bad.

71
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,460
Think he's dead?

72
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,092
Are you done?

73
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,042
No. I still have to clean it.

74
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:15,242
- But you're done?
- Yes.

75
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,671
It's time to move.

76
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,570
We got everything we need.

77
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:44,830
Just a quick stop in Utah
and then we're off to Mexico.

78
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,172
LJ has a hearing today to determine
if he gets tried as an adult.

79
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:50,491
I can get him.

80
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,573
It's not the right time.

81
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,701
- When will it be?
- After we go to Mexico.

82
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:56,983
After we're off the news.

83
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,592
They framed him for
a double homicide.

84
00:05:58,628 --> 00:05:59,862
As soon as he
loses his hearing,

85
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,592
they're going to ship him
out to an adult facility,

86
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:04,420
so today in the courthouse is
my only chance to get him.

87
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:08,330
They took Veronica,
they're not going to take my son.

88
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:10,913
I know. I know.

89
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:16,961
I would never leave LJ behind,
but we can't do this now.

90
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:19,071
There's no plan in place.

91
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,231
Believe me,
I know that courthouse.

92
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,350
I've been there more
times than I can remember.

93
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,893
The only person guarding
him's the bailiff.

94
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,712
He carries Mace
and a big stick.

95
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,900
So you're going to bum-rush the
courthouse, that's your plan.

96
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,721
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,021
Hey, yo, we're headed out, man.

98
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:41,621
Well, good luck to everyone.
Stay out of trouble.

99
00:06:46,716 --> 00:06:48,210
This is it, buddy.

100
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,522
I hope you find
the girl, buddy.

101
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,623
She's all I have.
I'll die trying.

102
00:06:58,658 --> 00:07:01,852
- Good luck.
- You be easy, man.

103
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,711
- Adios.
- See ya.

104
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,712
Maybe we'll see
each other again.

105
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,001
You never know, Michael.

106
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:16,862
Never know.

107
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,471
Tell me everything you
know about the courthouse.

108
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,431
- You get any sleep?
- A couple hours.

109
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,472
Eight of 'em,
I still can't believe it.

110
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:32,242
This is Exhibit "A" why you don't
let women work in the military,

111
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,921
the police force and especially
inside a male prison,

112
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,263
'cause look what you get.

113
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:40,121
Dr. Sweetcheeks leaves the door
open for Scofield and here we are.

114
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:42,021
Sounds like there's a
little bit more to the...

115
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:44,781
If Tancredi doesn't leave
her office door unlocked,

116
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:49,021
those eight dirtbags would in the
shoe right now, okay? Bottom line!

117
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:52,593
- Brad.
- Any updates?

118
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,821
None. They were last seen
at that cemetery in Oswego.

119
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,890
- We'll get 'em.
- They'll get 'em.

120
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,541
It's been handed
over to the FBI.

121
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:00,952
Well, that doesn't
mean we can't work it.

122
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:05,033
It does, actually. You and I have
been pulled off the pursuit.

123
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:05,823
Why?

124
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,513
We're going to
find out shortly.

125
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,200
We have to report to the DOC
headquarters. I will meet you there.

126
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,160
Sir, we can get these guys.

127
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,430
Just give me a couple more
days and I swear I'll get 'em.

128
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:15,303
Brad!

129
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:19,033
We've got to go.

130
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,402
No family with
Patoshik, nothing?

131
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:42,172
Yeah, until about 4 years
ago when he killed them all.

132
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:46,732
Updated rap sheet on Apolskis.
Take a look when you get a chance.

133
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:07,393
Oh...

134
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,953
Man, I'm so sorry. My bad.

135
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,971
My bad, bro. I'm sorry.

136
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:32,051
Scott Kolbrenner.

137
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,170
It's this one here.

138
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:47,653
Don't touch the radio.

139
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:00,241
Yeah. Hi.
I'm with the Des Moines Herald.

140
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,753
I'm covering the LJ Burrows hearing.
What time does that start today?

141
00:11:21,085 --> 00:11:21,973
Come on.

142
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:59,372
Thank you. 3:00.
The hearing lasts a half hour max.

143
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,580
He'll be taken down to transport bay
at ten till to catch the 4:00 van.

144
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:04,110
So how do we get close to him?

145
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:05,488
Well, when I was locked up,

146
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,824
I had nothing to do
except study the briefs.

147
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,980
Nick Savrinn's bar number is on
the front page of every one.

148
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,800
We want to talk to LJ,
we just...

149
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:15,662
- We pose as one of his attorneys.
- Yeah.

150
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:20,162
Hogwash. That is
absolute hogwash.

151
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:22,132
Please answer the question.

152
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,971
How was Scofield able to have
exclusive access to you,

153
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,363
pull a shank on you,
and bind you to your chair--

154
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,372
the warden of the penitentiary?

155
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,232
I trusted him.

156
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,422
Obviously, he
betrayed that trust.

157
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,830
Officer Bellick,

158
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:42,071
is it true that almost all
the inmates who either escaped

159
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:45,511
or tried to escape worked
in Prison Industries?

160
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:46,661
That's right.

161
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:50,051
Why did these inmates have so much
time to dig a hole in the floor

162
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:53,042
of the guard's break room while
working Prison Industries?

163
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,043
I can answer that.

164
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:56,831
With all due respect, if any of you
have ever worked a day in a prison,

165
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:59,600
you would know that, since an
inmate only gets 19 cents an hour,

166
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,973
some are bound to
drag their feet.

167
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,720
Officer Bellick,
is it true you sold the right

168
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:10,212
to run Prison Industries
to the highest bidder?

169
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:13,883
- No. Who the hell told you that?
- This is unbelievable.

170
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,763
While we're wasting
time in here,

171
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,723
there are eight escaped
convicts out there...

172
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,462
Were you employed at Fox River as
a correctional officer, Mr. Geary?

173
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:39,043
Yep.

174
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:42,012
Yeah, until he was fired
for shaking down inmates.

175
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,150
That will be your last
outburst, Officer.

176
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,513
Were you aware of
any arrangement

177
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:50,173
Officer Bellick had with any inmate
regarding Prison Industries?

178
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:52,191
Yeah, he sold it
to John Abruzzi.

179
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:55,820
John Abruzzi--
who was one of the escaped convicts?

180
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:56,800
Yep.

181
00:13:57,217 --> 00:14:00,661
We'll get other C.O.s to substantiate
this if we have to, Officer Bellick,

182
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:03,641
so I'm giving you one chance
to get in front of it.

183
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:08,432
Did you sell Prison
Industries to John Abruzzi?

184
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:12,222
Yes or no?

185
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:15,991
Yes, but at no time was I
aware of any talk of escape.

186
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,912
That'll be all, Officer Bellick.
That will be all!

187
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,630
Warden, you and Officer Bellick
can step out into the hallway.

188
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:24,303
We'll call for you when
we've reached a decision.

189
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,942
I'm going to get some coffee.

190
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,982
Well, I did my best
under the circumstances.

191
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,931
The good news, sir,
is you had the hand iced,

192
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,420
so I was able to restore
blood flow and...

193
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:04,920
The bones are bent.

194
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:08,601
However, I recommend you
get medical attention ASAP.

195
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:12,732
Meanwhile, some aspirin will help
thin the blood and avoid clotting.

196
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:15,932
Some antibiotics
and painkillers.

197
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:20,100
I usually tell the owner of the dog,
cat, whatever, to

198
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:23,250
coat them with peanut butter so they're
easier to chew but, obviously...

199
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:27,001
- You did one hell of a job, Doc.
- Well, thank you.

200
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:30,941
Well, uh...
it's okay for you to leave now.

201
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:34,943
Oh, I'm leaving. You're not.

202
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:36,861
- What?
- You heard me.

203
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:39,902
Look, sir, I haven't seen
anything and I won't tell anyone.

204
00:15:40,017 --> 00:15:40,991
Well, you know...

205
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:47,411
you know, I fell for that bill of
goods once before. Never again.

206
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:51,721
Sir, I swear to God
I will tell nobody.

207
00:15:51,815 --> 00:15:54,712
You would,
and I would die in prison.

208
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:02,013
Please, please, please.

209
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:02,753
Shh!

210
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:07,771
Now, you did me a solid,
so I'm going to return the favor.

211
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:11,011
This can go down humanely
if you don't fight,

212
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:12,761
but if you pull a
stunt like that again,

213
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,851
it's going to get
inhumane right quick.

214
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,971
Your call.

215
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:19,943
But, one way or another...

216
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:24,042
I am putting you down, Doc.

217
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,152
- Lincoln Burrows Junior?
- Yeah.

218
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,133
In here, you got a visitor.

219
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,152
You must be LJ.

220
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:57,050
Agent Mahone, FBI. Thank you.

221
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,030
Please.

222
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm assuming you've heard.

223
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:07,720
Yeah.

224
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:13,151
I have to tell you.
What your dad and uncle pulled off...

225
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,523
very impressive.

226
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,491
I've been doing
this 14 years, and

227
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:22,531
most escapes can be attributed
to dumb luck or brute force.

228
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:25,702
The level of planning and
sophistication that went into this one,

229
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:28,033
and eight guys got out.

230
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,551
I really do,
professionally speaking,

231
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:35,580
have a lot of admiration
for Lincoln and Michael.

232
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,931
Cool. Now we're buddies.

233
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,261
What do you need?

234
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:46,931
Help me bring them
in... peacefully.

235
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:50,362
I don't know where they are.
I don't know where they're going.

236
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,283
There's another
way you can help.

237
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:54,910
- How?
- Go on TV.

238
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:58,853
I can have a camera crew
down here in a half an hour.

239
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,460
You know what, man?

240
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:08,302
The murder charge
they put on my dad--

241
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,593
the two murder charges
they put on me--

242
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,460
Everything's been a setup
coming from way up top.

243
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:16,041
So the fact that you work
for the government--

244
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,223
I got nothing to say.

245
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,712
I'll give you the same advice

246
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,651
that you'd get from the guy
working at the deli downstairs.

247
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:33,070
Start thinking
about yourself now.

248
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:36,232
In fact, the sooner the better,
because no one--

249
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:41,510
not your father, LJ, not your uncle--
is going to do your time.

250
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:45,272
And, at 16 years old,
you're looking at a long stretch.

251
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,482
How much time you get,
where you serve it,

252
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:52,660
who your cell mate might be.

253
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:58,562
You need to start thinking
about yourself. Now.

254
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,600
I want your dad, I want your uncle,
and I'm willing to deal.

255
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:08,961
Don't wait and let someone
else get the reward.

256
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:25,213
What's up?

257
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,372
Hey, man, you look familiar.

258
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,273
Did you rush Sig
Ep last semester?

259
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:36,462
Sig what?
- Sig Ep.

260
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:40,491
Nah.

261
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:41,801
Next in line.

262
00:19:43,797 --> 00:19:46,690
- Where to?
- Utah.

263
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:03,051
How we doing here?

264
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:08,170
Nothing until tomorrow.

265
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:14,440
All right, yo, I got 45 bucks.
How far will that get me?

266
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:30,813
Nick Savrinn.
His bar number is 56437.

267
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,722
I've got a call time with my client,
an LJ Burrows.

268
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:42,192
- Hello.
- Know who this is?

269
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,353
Yeah.

270
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:47,532
- Yeah. Nick Savrinn.
- How you holding on?

271
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,583
Doing what I can do.
How about you?

272
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm worried about you. I'm sorry
about what you're going through.

273
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:58,013
Thanks. Word is, uh...

274
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:03,432
after this hearing, because of my
dad being so high profile, they're...

275
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:07,470
they're shipping me to an adult
facility in Kingman, Arizona.

276
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:10,480
Yeah, well, hopefully,
that ain't going to happen.

277
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:12,552
You hear from Veronica today?

278
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:16,261
She didn't show up.
They gave me some court-appointed clown.

279
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:20,300
No. I haven't heard from her.

280
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,563
Hey, this, uh...

281
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:24,341
this fed came by and
talked to me today.

282
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:25,270
Yeah?

283
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,041
He wanted me to help try in
getting my dad to turn himself in.

284
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:30,761
Well, knowing your dad,
I doubt that's going to happen.

285
00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:33,153
Listen up, LJ.
This is real important.

286
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,322
All right.

287
00:21:34,456 --> 00:21:37,561
On the third,
look out for Otis Wright.

288
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:41,940
You got that?
On the third, look out for Otis Wright.

289
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:43,631
Until then, keep you head up.

290
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,981
- What?
- Just remember that.

291
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,111
I'm going to do everything
I can to get you out.

292
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:51,773
Hey, Nick...
if you talk to my dad...

293
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:54,261
tell him no matter what,
I love him.

294
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,703
- Hey.
- Hey.

295
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:06,363
- Did you get him?
- Let's do this.

296
00:22:07,898 --> 00:22:09,860
Got one more stop.

297
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:23,633
There is a belief in my religion
which I know to be true

298
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:27,040
and it applies to everyone,
Hindu or not.

299
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:31,942
The acts we commit in this life
determine where we go in the next.

300
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,320
And he who commits evil can
never hope for eternal happiness.

301
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:42,230
Never been a goal of mine, doc.
I'm more a here and now type.

302
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,831
I'll tell you something
I know is true.

303
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:54,243
The Indians here, the Tomahawk variety,
some of them believe--

304
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:57,542
well, used to believe before
most of them were slaughtered--

305
00:22:57,635 --> 00:23:02,913
that when a warrior
kills another in battle,

306
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:08,882
he absorbs that fallen
warrior's spirit.

307
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:13,572
So this isn't the
end for you, Doc.

308
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,952
You're with me now.

309
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,102
And how are you
doing this fine day?

310
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:34,951
Uh, I'm great. How are you?

311
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:38,441
Couldn't be better. Anything in
particular I can help you find?

312
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,271
Just looking, thanks.

313
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:43,020
Well, if you need any assistance,
just give a holler.

314
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:12,990
- How are you this fine day?
- Great.

315
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:16,192
- Can I help you find anything?
- I'm good, thanks.

316
00:25:21,148 --> 00:25:23,110
- Hey.
- We gotta go.

317
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,460
- I just need to pay up.
- Now.

318
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:28,020
How are you today, officer?

319
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:33,841
Yeah, they were right, uh...

320
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,090
Well, they were--
they were right back here.

321
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:44,980
We can make it to the
courthouse on foot from here.

322
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:47,842
You don't understand--
everything is in that car.

323
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:51,463
Forget the damn car. We don't have time.
Come on, man, let's go.

324
00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:11,392
Hi.

325
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:53,193
It is the finding of this
panel that Warden Pope,

326
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:56,581
you'll be docked two weeks,
placed on three months probation.

327
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:03,063
Officer Brad Bellick will be
terminated-- effectively immediately.

328
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:06,412
Mr. Bellick, you can retrieve
whatever belongings you may have

329
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,891
from Fox River;
that will be all.

330
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:14,250
I've... I've worked at Fox
River since I was 18 years old.

331
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:18,350
- Being a C.O. is my life.
- And we appreciate that.

332
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:21,040
Look, you know, we could have saved
a lot of time if you would have

333
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:24,060
just told us in the beginning that
this was going to be a railroad.

334
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:24,851
That'll be all, Warden.

335
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:27,570
There is only one person responsible
for this escape out there.

336
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:31,373
His name is Michael Scofield.
It's not Officer Bellick. It's not me!

337
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:34,611
But you need a fall guy, fine.

338
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:37,490
But you're not gonna be just
taking Officer Bellick's job.

339
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,540
Because even though I am not
proud of many of his actions,

340
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:45,770
it will be a cold day in hell when
I turn my back on one of my own men.

341
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:50,661
I quit. That will be all.

342
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:56,741
If this thing doesn't work out and
you end up going back to Fox River,

343
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:59,140
I ain't coming to get ya.

344
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:03,142
I mean,
you are the brains and I am the brute.

345
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,942
Seriously, Michael,
you don't have to do this.

346
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:25,932
Let's go.

347
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,831
We're good.

348
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:02,682
You got a call from Nick
Savrinn earlier today.

349
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:04,120
What was that all about?

350
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,021
He's my attorney.
That's privileged.

351
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:09,892
Hmm, that's odd because
Nick Savrinn was found dead

352
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:13,312
in his apartment an hour before
that call came in to you.

353
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,980
Listen up, LJ,
this is real important.

354
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:16,630
All right.

355
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:20,631
On the third, look out for Otis Wright.
You got that?

356
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:22,302
You know for someone
who's so convinced that

357
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:24,510
the government is capable of
so many underhanded things,

358
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:27,361
you sure are playing
fast and loose with me.

359
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,290
What are you going to do,
throw another fake murder charge on me?

360
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:31,501
Who's Otis Wright?

361
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:34,212
- I have no idea.
- I think you do.

362
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,670
And if you don't tell me,
after you're convicted,

363
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,780
I will be in that courtroom
when you're sentenced

364
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,923
and I will hang you out to dry.
Take it to the bank.

365
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:34,581
Yeah, put me in touch with the
prosecutor in the LJ Burrows case.

366
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:38,632
I want a meeting.

367
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:47,241
On the third,
look out for Otis Wright.

368
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:54,120
Until then, keep your head up.

369
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,490
Otis Wright.

370
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:05,750
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

371
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:12,952
- Move it.
- Hold on.

372
00:31:44,406 --> 00:31:45,853
I'll escort the boy.

373
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:59,752
Otis Wright.
Otis elevator on the right.

374
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,950
What is he planning?

375
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:06,020
Keep it in the holster
and no one gets hurt.

376
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:09,651
Keep it in the holster.

377
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:13,270
All right, LJ, hit stop.

378
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:17,323
He's coming with us.

379
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,992
So just stay cool, stay cool.

380
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:24,971
Hey, buddy, give me his gun.

381
00:32:29,228 --> 00:32:30,680
Hey, hey...

382
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,081
LJ, give me your hand.

383
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:42,801
That a boy. Come on.

384
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:53,082
Hey, back off!
Back off! Back off!

385
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:55,160
You're not shooting anybody,
neither are you.

386
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:57,140
Give yourself up and
your kid can walk.

387
00:32:57,198 --> 00:32:59,020
It's the only way he's
getting out of this place.

388
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:01,262
It's the only way!

389
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:02,570
Dad!

390
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:10,181
Dad, you got to let me go.

391
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:11,902
- No.
- Dad...

392
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:17,240
You got to let me go!

393
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:30,471
Up there. Scofield is in the building.
Take him!

394
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:35,512
You guys go, cover that way. Scofield
and Burrows are in the building!

395
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,403
Freeze! Do not move!

396
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:44,763
The truck!

397
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:48,160
- Bradley?
- Yeah, Ma.

398
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,162
What are you doing
home so early?

399
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:53,712
I had to take...

400
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:58,221
my personal day, you know,
before they went away.

401
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:01,572
Shouldn't you be looking
for the convicts?

402
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:05,761
They got somebody
else doing that, Mom.

403
00:35:05,995 --> 00:35:07,111
You okay?

404
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:19,390
I'm good.

405
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,352
Okay.

406
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:32,361
Whoa. All right.

407
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:35,660
I think we should break a bottle
of champagne across its bow.

408
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:38,821
If you're intending to get this thing
home for your anniversary tonight,

409
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:40,963
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- No.

410
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:44,623
Listen, I want you to know I...

411
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:48,052
Well, I feel very
fortunate to have met you.

412
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,283
I'm breaking out.

413
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:58,291
And you're going to make sure
my brother goes with me.

414
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:20,933
Thank you for calling AutoStar,
Dr... Gudat?

415
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:22,710
Am I pronouncing
that correctly?

416
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:24,822
Uh... dead on.

417
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:26,741
How can I help you today?

418
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:31,262
I need, uh... directions.

419
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,781
- Where to, sir?
- Utah.

420
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:48,213
Excuse me.

421
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,870
I'm sorry.
Are you Scott Kolbrenner?

422
00:38:53,637 --> 00:38:55,840
I am. Yeah.

423
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:58,311
You must be Debra Jean.

424
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:00,453
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, same here.

425
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:02,883
It's so funny, 'cause I was almost
ready to leave when you called.

426
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:04,180
No one else responded.

427
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,571
I guess there's not a lot
of Utah people out here.

428
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:09,382
- Are you from there?
- No, I just, you know...

429
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm headed up there to, uh...
collect an inheritance.

430
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:15,611
My grandpa died.

431
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:17,391
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

432
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:20,122
It's all right.
He went out with his boots on.

433
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:24,363
- So where's your stuff?
- Uh, I mailed it yesterday.

434
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:27,600
Mailed it?
I've never heard of that.

435
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:29,760
You know,
you don't want to lug it around.

436
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:32,980
Plus, I got a boy who works for UPS,
so he hooked it up.

437
00:39:35,948 --> 00:39:38,953
So you want to bounce?

438
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:45,763
Okay. I'm parked out front.

439
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:59,060
- Bradley?
- Yeah, Ma.

440
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,813
They just announced
the rewards on the TV.

441
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:05,730
- What reward?
- The convicts.

442
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:08,412
For the convicts--
the ones who escaped.

443
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:12,270
- How much?
- $100,000 apiece.

444
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:17,033
$300,000 for the animal who killed
President Reynold's brother.

445
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:21,702
Every whacko in the country is going to
be after those bums now, wouldn't
you say?

446
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:29,932
Police!

447
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,001
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

448
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,301
- We got to move.
- I can't.

449
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:56,451
Oh, my God.

450
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:06,590
I failed him.

451
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:13,972
Sorry. Sorry.

452
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:17,742
I failed him.

453
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,812
I sure hope you packed a lunch.

454
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:27,490
It's going to be a
long ride to Arizona.

455
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:29,962
Move your ass.

456
00:41:56,585 --> 00:41:59,021
Get men at all the
area hospitals.

457
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,473
Wherever they are,
one of them's bleeding good.

458
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,732
Which means...

459
00:42:02,827 --> 00:42:06,120
they either come to us...
or they die.

460
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:11,823
