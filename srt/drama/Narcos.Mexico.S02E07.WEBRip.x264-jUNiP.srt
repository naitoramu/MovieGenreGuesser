1
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,811
Cochiloco was one of us.

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,480
Deserved better.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,358
We all do.

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,946
The time comes,

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,449
you open your eyes,

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,410
don't recognize home.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,916
You don't recognize this thing
'cause Félix changed it.

8
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,836
I keep telling you, Güero,

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,673
the old days are gone.

10
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,218
So how do I explain this, huh?

11
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,637
What do I tell my guys?

12
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,097
The truth.

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,976
Félix did it for Benjamín, Tijuana.

14
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,938
If the Federation were
to lose them now...

15
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,234
it goes down fast.

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:12,405
Only ourselves to blame.
We joined into this shit.

17
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,033
We allowed Félix to rule us.

18
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,498
Yeah, well...
didn't have a lot of choices.

19
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,418
Maybe didn't look for a better one.

20
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,295
Right.

21
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,589
So maybe it's time.

22
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,677
Time to find a better option.

23
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,810
Let Félix suck Benjamín's cock.

24
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:45,814
You and me, we gotta
worry about ourselves.

25
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,193
We start to do what Félix isn't.

26
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,030
Protect each other.

27
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,201
Break from the Federation?

28
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,455
Could work.

29
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,042
It would work, man.

30
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,046
No.

31
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,676
Lot of bullshit, starting over.

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,679
I'm looking to go the other way.

33
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,598
Still think you're getting out, huh?

34
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,435
You've been saying that shit
since I was working for you.

35
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,562
Oh, yeah?

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:30,692
Guess every day brings a new chance
to be a little less full of shit.

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,027
Yeah.

38
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,948
Look, this new deal with the Colombians,

39
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,868
it's more than Félix can handle.

40
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,662
The man is desperate.

41
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,582
And desperate men...

42
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,376
Not long for this earth.

43
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,920
You recognize the voice?

44
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,464
Fucking Acosta.

45
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,632
Trust me.

46
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,178
Keep your head down,
your footprint light...

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,640
And wait for Félix's time to run out.

48
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,768
- Make me a copy of this.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,469
Babe, the helicopter is on
the roof waiting for me.

50
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,099
Got to go to Mexico City
for important business.

51
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,560
Lots of money on the line.

52
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,316
- Sorry.
- Come on, you're not even trying.

53
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,818
I told you, this stuff turns me on.

54
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,698
I love what a big deal you are.

55
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,034
Bring that big deal over here.

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,205
No, love, I gotta go.

57
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,002
You were supposed to come last night.

58
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,174
I told you, Héctor came home early.

59
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,884
I couldn't get away.

60
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,636
Come on,

61
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,805
at least you had me all morning.

62
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,478
Fucking Palma,
who does he think he is?

63
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,688
The big boss?

64
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,733
Félix is the one telling him what to do.

65
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,028
Not everyone can be as
tough as you, baby.

66
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,530
So stay.

67
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,908
You have me all day.

68
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,790
No way. Félix finishes breakfast,
and I'm not there, he'll kill me.

69
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:17,001
And he tells my husband what to do.

70
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,131
Don't mess with me.

71
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,966
Call you later.

72
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,643
CÁRDENAS POPULARITY DECLINES

73
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,773
The fuck are you doing here?

74
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,822
I thought I made myself clear.

75
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,449
Just having coffee.

76
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,494
Is that so bad?

77
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,455
You think this is a game?

78
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,291
This is my life.
I told you to stay away.

79
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,127
Yeah.

80
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,131
From the house, from school.

81
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,800
This is a café.

82
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,596
Not sure it qualifies as yours.

83
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,725
Seem to remember it was me
that first brought you here.

84
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,437
Enjoy your coffee.

85
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,774
- Give my best to your old man.
- He's not interested in you either.

86
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,864
He told me about Cochiloco.

87
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,617
What you did.

88
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,208
Didn't remember your father
liking gossip so much.

89
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,338
We adapt, or everything goes to shit.

90
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,467
He made his choice.

91
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,889
You know, it takes someone
special to abandon everyone

92
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,267
and still find a reason to blame them.

93
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,146
You chose the wrong side, Miguel Ángel.

94
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,400
You fucked over anyone
who cared about you.

95
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,945
Now bad things are happening to you.

96
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,032
Because you're a bad guy.

97
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,120
A new day is coming.

98
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:22,251
Some will be punished,
and some will be rewarded.

99
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,254
What...

100
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,798
You find God or something?

101
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,720
Maybe something better.

102
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,767
Good luck with that.

103
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,484
It's your lucky day, Walt.

104
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,237
An anonymous call came in
to the embassy earlier.

105
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,615
Someone claiming to have
intel on Félix Gallardo.

106
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh, really?

107
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,409
He say how?

108
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,286
She wouldn't elaborate.

109
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,996
Said she'll only talk in person.

110
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,165
She?

111
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,042
Come on, sir, it sounds like bullshit.

112
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,712
She say what she wanted? You know,
cash, a visa for her boyfriend?

113
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,006
That's exactly what
you're gonna find out.

114
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,008
Look, she wants to meet.

115
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,969
She's based in Ojinaga.

116
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,971
Given that you're in Juárez...

117
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,891
Well, sir, I'm right in the
middle of something here.

118
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,978
Right.
The thing with the planes.

119
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,689
I thought you said you had nothing.

120
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,694
Look, this person has high-level
intel on Félix Gallardo,

121
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,280
and you're the agent in
charge of that operation.

122
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,699
What the fuck aren't you seeing?

123
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,450
Yep. Yep.

124
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,287
Fucking hell.

125
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,835
Making a habit of these visits.

126
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,964
Though, I must say I'm not
surprised, given the news.

127
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,426
What happened with the nomination?
You were so sure.

128
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,598
Gave my life to this party, and they
choose that fucking technocrat.

129
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,478
So the big-eared dwarf and his
brother didn't want your money?

130
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,940
Look, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas,

131
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,985
he was a governor in Michoacán.

132
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,528
A member of the PRI.

133
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,292
He was your colleague.
Don't you know him?

134
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,073
Yeah, and I know his father too.

135
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,868
They're a fucking institution.

136
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,537
Old man would win the presidency
again, if he were still around.

137
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,667
And privatization undoes
everything he created.

138
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,295
The farmland, the oil, all of it.

139
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,673
Did your homework. Congratulations.

140
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,135
The party plans to destroy
his father's legacy.

141
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,804
He needs us.

142
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,931
Make the introduction.

143
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,647
I have to admit the Italian
suits start to fool you.

144
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:52,109
Do you know why Cuauhtémoc
left the party?

145
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,612
Because of us.

146
00:10:55,905 --> 00:11:00,910
Says the party is in league with
traffickers and corrupt politicians.

147
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,872
He's got to need something.

148
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,797
Cárdenas takes office,

149
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,924
and you're in a jail cell the same day.

150
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,763
You think Cárdenas can actually win?

151
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,185
I don't think.

152
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
I know so.

153
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,939
They called it

154
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,085
the National System of Political
Election Information.

155
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,839
Better known in Mexico as SNIPE.

156
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,552
It was a system engineered
to compile election results,

157
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,263
based on voter registration data.

158
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,224
Basically, a way to figure
out who was voting,

159
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,893
where, and how.

160
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,603
Sound familiar?

161
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
Well, in 1988, in Mexico, it wasn't.

162
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,484
It was fucking unheard of.

163
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,654
Before '88, there had never
been any reason for it.

164
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,323
I guess that's the deal
with unchecked power.

165
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,785
A one-party system tends
to lead to a likely outcome.

166
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,706
But all it takes is once.

167
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,002
An earthquake and a recession
usually do the trick.

168
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,591
And then an idealist
starts to draws crowds.

169
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,267
The big surprise of the campaign

170
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,346
has been the leftist candidate
Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas.

171
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,891
Cárdenas is a former member of the PRI.

172
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,935
He left it last year, accusing
it of being undemocratic.

173
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,340
When hope catches on,

174
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,690
that shit spreads like a prairie fire.

175
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,220
Cárdenas has support
in the major cities,

176
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,822
educated centers.

177
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,160
The PRI's influence is
holding to the more rural,

178
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,870
less populated areas,

179
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,248
where ignorance and
illiteracy reign supreme.

180
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,001
Yeah, but these are just
projections, right?

181
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,881
A preview of what's to come.

182
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,885
Okay, but none of this is exact.

183
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,780
These projections aren't gonna change,

184
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,170
because a margin of error is built in.

185
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,476
Which brings us to the real problem.

186
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,770
Mexico City.

187
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:37,316
Cárdenas is projecting
a win at 54 percent.

188
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,194
A coin toss.

189
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,529
No.

190
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,781
A fucking tragedy.

191
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,036
What about the rest of
the country? Stop there.

192
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,288
León, Guanajuato... doing well there.

193
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,624
Yes, but it won't matter.

194
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:58,587
The first precincts to
report are all in the city.

195
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,340
They're the only ones
the media reports on.

196
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,763
Every six years,
on election day at 7:00 p.m.,

197
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,809
they report a landslide PRI victory.

198
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,480
If a PRI candidate
doesn't declare victory

199
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,150
after the first precincts report,

200
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,780
or worse, they can't...

201
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,448
It's gonna be fucked.

202
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,369
Cárdenas has given people
a reason to believe.

203
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,020
They see these numbers on election day?

204
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,833
They'll know change is coming.

205
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,296
And nothing will pull his
supporters out of the voting line.

206
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,465
The PRI is gonna be crushed.

207
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,386
It's time we meet again.

208
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,599
Can't imagine why.
We left very little unsaid.

209
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,559
Drop the act.

210
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,769
It's time for you to open your eyes.

211
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,022
I'm wide awake, my friend.

212
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,275
Quite content with the view.

213
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,152
I don't know what you're seeing.

214
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,779
Cárdenas has your brother beat.

215
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,323
Ah, so you've heard.

216
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,450
An exciting time.

217
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:14,330
Even the less fortunate
deserve a good thrill.

218
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,749
My brother will be their president too.

219
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,084
You don't understand.
Or maybe you don't want to.

220
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,962
My family has experience
with these things, Félix.

221
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,549
Stories like Cárdenas's, they come
and go. Fables, for children.

222
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,720
You hear the one about the Pope?
When he visited Mexico,

223
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,972
he went boating with Cárdenas.

224
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,641
They say the Pope's hat blew off,

225
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,935
and Cárdenas walked across
the water to get it back.

226
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,396
But you and me know the truth,
Cárdenas can't swim.

227
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,150
The PRI's gonna hold his
head down while he drowns.

228
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,361
Was there anything else?

229
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,574
All right, let's see...

230
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,535
Let's see what you think of this.

231
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,831
Zapopan, Cárdenas is up by 16 percent,

232
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,086
Puebla 12 percent, Zipolite
22 percent, want me to go on?

233
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,467
Ask yourself how I got these numbers.
Who else I can give them to.

234
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,762
Mexico's on the eve of change.

235
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,058
How badly does your
brother want to stop it?

236
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,690
Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, 4:00.

237
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,026
Good.

238
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,405
See you there.

239
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,183
Bye.

240
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,276
Good afternoon.

241
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,908
Another, sir.

242
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,917
What the fuck did you just do?

243
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,963
You had no right to tell that criminal.

244
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,920
Tell me something.

245
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
What the fuck were you
planning on doing with this?

246
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,554
Nothing. The party thinks
they don't need me?

247
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,223
Then they don't get to see this.

248
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,103
How's Cárdenas's
relationship with America?

249
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,606
'Cause the gringos know all about you.

250
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,192
Your dipshit nephew's made sure of it.

251
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:55,949
If the party loses, you're with me
on the next plane to the States.

252
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,494
So get your head out of your ass.

253
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,121
What's Cárdenas know about all this?

254
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,998
I told you, no one knows anything.

255
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,125
He doesn't know?

256
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,629
He doesn't know he's gonna win?

257
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,800
Good. Tell him.

258
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,675
You're joking.

259
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,764
I'm gonna use it as leverage.
So tell him.

260
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,267
I hope you know what you're doing.

261
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,932
Agent Breslin.

262
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,564
We know each other?

263
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,692
I called the embassy this morning.

264
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,487
You're the anonymous caller.

265
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,198
You're American.

266
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,662
- Care to take a seat?
- Prefer not to.

267
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,878
I'm gonna be honest with you.

268
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,882
I wasn't expecting... you.

269
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,390
See, I got this...
I got this radar in my head,

270
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,980
and it tells me when
things are off or...

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,437
you know, something ain't right.

272
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,023
Well, it's ringing in my
fucking ears right now.

273
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,903
I'd say if that radar was
worth much, Agent Breslin,

274
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,280
you wouldn't be sitting here,
looking the way you do.

275
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,500
So you know something about
Félix Gallardo, his operation.

276
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,836
You care to elaborate?

277
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,923
I just had to see you first.

278
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,634
Make sure you were alone.

279
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,438
Meet me behind the
restaurant in ten minutes.

280
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,845
I'll be in a brown truck.

281
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,223
Hang on there, sweetheart.

282
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,436
Let me explain to you how this works.

283
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:35,234
I got about, you know, three,
four bites left on this torta.

284
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,655
And when I'm finished, I'm gonna
walk my ass back out to my truck,

285
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,532
it's the Wagoneer parked outside,

286
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,576
and I'm gonna drive away.

287
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:50,123
And you and your boyfriend or whoever
the hell put you up to this,

288
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,126
they're gonna lose anything and
everything they were hoping to get.

289
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,839
Cash, visa... all of it goes with me.

290
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,219
Because, honey, I ain't coming back.

291
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,306
So don't waste my time with bullshit.

292
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,476
If you got something to say,
you better start fucking talking.

293
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,605
Well, aren't you just too sweet?

294
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,281
My boyfriend's name is Pablo Acosta.

295
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,410
He runs the Juárez plaza
for Félix Gallardo.

296
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,745
He wants to talk to you.

297
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:33,000
So long as it ain't a waste of
your precious fucking time.

298
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,810
We seem to have a problem, boss.

299
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,062
Azul is awaiting your call.

300
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,656
You ready?

301
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,910
Ready as I'm gonna get.

302
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,963
Fuck it.

303
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,766
Put this on.

304
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,485
Fuck it.

305
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,988
Hey, what's that radar telling
you now, Agent Breslin?

306
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,620
The issue with Acosta, it's not good.

307
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,081
I know, damn it! What else?

308
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,875
Aguilar played me the tapes.

309
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,044
How bad is it?

310
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,923
Acosta talks a lot of shit.

311
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,759
Says you're on the way out, going down.

312
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,263
But, Félix, Acosta's not the problem.

313
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,893
Héctor Palma made the call, reached out.

314
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,021
Told Acosta they don't need you.

315
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,858
Suggested they join together,
Sinaloa and Juárez.

316
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,236
That fucker is nothing without me.

317
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,656
Why is he coming up with this now?

318
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,992
Why doesn't matter.
The idea's out there.

319
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,371
Now would be a bad time
to appear weak, sir.

320
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,541
How the fuck did this happen?

321
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,712
What do you want to do, boss?

322
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
Kill him.

323
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,677
Palma was gifted Sinaloa,

324
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,971
and he's been a fucking
problem ever since.

325
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,932
What about Acosta?

326
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,331
You just gonna stand there?

327
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,711
Grab that tool box, bring it up here.

328
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,926
Hey. How about that sidearm?

329
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,187
You should listen to her.

330
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,516
She's tough, man. Believe me, I know.

331
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,072
Hey.

332
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,949
Have fun.

333
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,504
Welcome, sir.

334
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,585
Welcome, sir.

335
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,617
What's going on? Where is he?

336
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,995
Not one for pleasantries, I see.

337
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,122
I understand there's something
you need to tell me.

338
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,710
You have five minutes, Félix.

339
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,255
Would you like to take a seat?

340
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,808
Is Leavenworth as tough as they say?

341
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,690
You know something about me, huh?

342
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,194
I started in Customs in Laredo.

343
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,238
I know you pretty well, man.

344
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,075
Eight fucking years.

345
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,994
Good way to learn English.

346
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,501
Know anything about roofs?

347
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,672
Look, I prefer to ask
you some questions.

348
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,427
You drink?

349
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,637
Beer?

350
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,597
As much as I can.

351
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,710
I'm looking to take down Félix Gallardo.

352
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,004
You gonna help me?

353
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,175
The girl...

354
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,553
She's the reason you are here.

355
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,514
Wanted us to meet.

356
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,351
Been bugging me for a while now.

357
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,146
Hears me complaining.

358
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,941
Figures... time for me to move on.

359
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,694
Find something else.

360
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,073
You don't strike me as the
kind of guy that'd do that,

361
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,868
drop everything for some girl.

362
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,164
Do you like her? Mimi?

363
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,042
I want Félix.

364
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,670
That's all I'm interested in.

365
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,507
Are you gonna help me or not?

366
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,261
Why?

367
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,935
What's he to you?

368
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,730
He killed a federal agent.

369
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,945
You knew him? That agent who died?

370
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,200
Camarena?

371
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,036
No, I didn't.

372
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,130
You know why I like fixing roofs?

373
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,634
I grew up in a small house.

374
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,053
Lots of brothers and sisters.

375
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,431
Teaches you quick,
complaining won't get you far.

376
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,725
Easier to fix things yourself.

377
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,480
So when the girl starts telling
me all I do is complain...

378
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,191
Shit.

379
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,944
Must be bad.

380
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,323
Yeah, and you're out
of ways to fix them.

381
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,368
I guess that's life, right?

382
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,497
Sooner or later, everything turns
to shit no matter how hard we try.

383
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,833
That why you're here?

384
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,585
Everything go to shit?

385
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,880
I told you why I'm here.

386
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,676
Right.

387
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,263
That... dead agent.

388
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,684
Truth of it is...

389
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,646
look around this place...

390
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,192
it all feels different.

391
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,820
Colombians,

392
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,822
cocaine,

393
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,950
fucking politicians.

394
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,830
Not sure where I fit in anymore.

395
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,253
That's why I'm here.

396
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:26,342
Because the truth matters to me.

397
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,266
You expect me to trust you,
telling me all those lies?

398
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,369
Three years ago,

399
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,289
I was back home working a shift.

400
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,752
I got a call about a one-eighteen.

401
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,963
It was a gang-related shooting.

402
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,508
But it wasn't in my area.

403
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,262
It was in the town over from me.

404
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,642
So I knew something was wrong.

405
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,273
My brother had died.

406
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,363
He took three to the chest and bled out

407
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,699
with an eight-ball of cocaine on
the passenger seat next to him.

408
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,498
And no matter what anybody tells you,

409
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,293
I'm the reason why.

410
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,010
I believe the world's a bad place.

411
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,974
And I don't think I'm much better.

412
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,145
But we have to try.

413
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,318
So that's why I'm here.

414
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,072
I'm trying to do something.

415
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,968
What would it look like,

416
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,054
me and you helping each other out?

417
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,723
Well...

418
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,893
you cross that border
tomorrow with me,

419
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,522
tell me everything you know
about Félix.

420
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,482
His whole operation.

421
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,151
In return,

422
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:53,573
I can provide you with protection,
immunity, anything you want.

423
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,665
What about Mimi?

424
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,001
- She involved?
- No.

425
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,045
Not at all.

426
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,839
I don't want her near this.

427
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,718
I don't see any reason to involve her.

428
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,180
You have my word.

429
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,446
Got a card?
A way to reach you?

430
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,834
Motel Carrasco.
The only one in town.

431
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,295
I know the number there.

432
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,554
My brother was a junkie.

433
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,893
He died with a needle in his arm.

434
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,206
All of this data has been confirmed.

435
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,836
On July 6th, you're all going down.

436
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,589
What will that leave you?

437
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,096
Well, I think we can
survive this. Together.

438
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:48,062
These projections,
they're interesting...

439
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,983
but guarantee nothing.

440
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,820
How is Andrés anyway?

441
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:02,869
Still bitter about the
nomination, it seems.

442
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,660
What, you didn't expect me to believe

443
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,543
your associates put these together?

444
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,086
No.

445
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,424
It leads me to one conclusion...

446
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,427
only the party knows these exist.

447
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,183
And they have some experience in
the suppression of information.

448
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,271
No.

449
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,440
Cárdenas knows too.

450
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,277
I made sure of that.

451
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,697
When these projections get out,

452
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,908
it's going to create a ground
swell in this country.

453
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:45,077
And nothing the party
can do will stop it.

454
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,999
I see.

455
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,630
So I take it you have a cure?

456
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,050
For this disease, sure to kill us.

457
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,974
I'm listening.

458
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,770
Tell the people a different story.

459
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,900
Those projections came from
a new computer program,

460
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,278
capable of reporting election
day returns, in real time.

461
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,180
And the early results will show

462
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,117
the whole country Cárdenas is winning.

463
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,200
But there could be another program,

464
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,720
one capable of reporting the opposite.

465
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,030
And in time, when an official
hand-count is tallied

466
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,718
and Cárdenas has won?

467
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,804
What good will your bullshit
program have done us?

468
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,514
Will he have won?

469
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,210
You tell the masses Cárdenas is losing,

470
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,271
they won't leave the fucking house.

471
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,232
You'll have taken their hope away.

472
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,610
People only want to back a winner.

473
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,780
Who's going to vote for a loser?

474
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,074
- Well, sure.
- So the party loses Mexico City,

475
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,245
but it makes up the
difference everywhere else.

476
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,208
And people have to wait six years
before they can get back in line.

477
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,879
Because you'll have won the
election legitimately.

478
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,923
Without tampering with a single ballot.

479
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,600
And in return?

480
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,938
I get a direct relationship
with the new administration.

481
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,567
My interests are protected.

482
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,277
Always.

483
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,574
I must say, I'm impressed.

484
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:52,872
I'd heard stories about you,
but this...

485
00:38:55,166 --> 00:39:00,546
Quite a rise for a piece
of trash like yourself.

486
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,175
You should know something.

487
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,386
These men I speak for, Félix?

488
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,016
They make wonderful friends,
but intolerable enemies.

489
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,688
I find out you're lying, what
you've told me today isn't true?

490
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,067
The fall is swift.

491
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,071
You don't survive it.

492
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,668
You'll hear from me.

493
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:31,220
You can take that stupid
thing off. We're close.

494
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,727
So how do you think it went?

495
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,063
You offer him a deal?

496
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,564
I did.

497
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,110
You think he'll take it?

498
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,612
I think he should.

499
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,451
Tell me something.

500
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,415
How's a girl like you end up...
a girl like you?

501
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,626
Just lucky, I guess.

502
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,628
Bullshit.

503
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,839
Out here in the middle of nowhere?

504
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,925
Where I don't belong?

505
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,137
I was born where I belong,
Agent Breslin, believe me.

506
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,973
And it never meant shit.

507
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,184
And Acosta?

508
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,145
I love him.

509
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,815
That's a good enough reason, ain't it?

510
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,402
To want to see someone change?

511
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,072
Honestly, after today, I wouldn't know.

512
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,618
I'm not quite sure what
to think about anything.

513
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,369
Yeah.

514
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,997
Gets tough, don't it?

515
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,876
Making heads and tails of this life.

516
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,962
I guess so.

517
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,797
I hope it works out for you.

518
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,097
How about that sidearm?

519
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,151
I'm pregnant.

520
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,117
That's why it's gotta be now.

521
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,079
Does he know that?

522
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,750
Have you considered telling him?

523
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,423
I think if he wants this,
it's gotta be for him.

524
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,135
Well...

525
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,682
Well, I hope I see you again.

526
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,392
All three of you.

527
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,006
- You hungry?
- Yeah!

528
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,385
- Where's your mom?
- Don't know.

529
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,930
- You don't know?
- No.

530
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,809
Lupita, come on.

531
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,185
Dinner's ready.

532
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,273
Lupita!

533
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,622
Lupita, you up here?

534
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,628
Baby, what's wrong?

535
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,171
What's going on?

536
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm so sorry, Héctor.

537
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,763
Tell me.

538
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,704
Palma, you in here?

539
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,335
Félix called.

540
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:34,129
Needs us at the office.

541
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,287
Guys!

542
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,011
Fuck your mother, you asshole!

543
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,015
Yours too, motherfucker!

544
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,730
Come out, you fuck!

545
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,990
Fucking thing's beautiful.

546
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,912
What's with you?

547
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,082
What's up?

548
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,001
Talked to Aguilar?

549
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,128
No, what happened?

550
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,923
Some shit's going down.

551
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,758
What shit?

552
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,055
- Talk to Aguilar, man.
- Fuck that, what happened?

553
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,276
What the fuck?

554
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,079
What the fuck are you doing here?

555
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,832
I could ask you the same.

556
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,960
I haven't heard much
since the Amado tip.

557
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,796
I didn't know I was
supposed to check in.

558
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,049
I put my ass on the line,
I expect to hear something.

559
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,680
Put us on a runway outside of Juárez.

560
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,893
But you are all the way out here.

561
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,480
You following me again?

562
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:27,112
I spoke to your boy Sal.
He mentioned you were here.

563
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,743
I didn't tell Sal where I was staying.

564
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,914
One motel in Ojinaga.

565
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,957
I guess I got lucky.

566
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,419
This runway...

567
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,839
anything else about it?

568
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,347
Figure it's where Félix plans
to bring in his shipment.

569
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,682
That's why we're on it.

570
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,104
We good here?

571
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,485
Hey, Walt.

572
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,612
You would tell me...

573
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,198
if anything else came up?

574
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,659
Yeah.

575
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,453
Absolutely.

576
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,568
Come on, Moreño,

577
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,644
please tell me you have something.

578
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,854
I don't.

579
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,441
Son of a... Do you know what happens
if we don't figure this out?

580
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,860
This shit is complicated.

581
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,239
You know how much data
I need to manipulate

582
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,616
to make your dummy
program look legitimate?

583
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,327
Why did you tell them
we have it, if it isn't true?

584
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,622
Because I'm dead if we
don't, you moron. Fix it.

585
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,839
Pablo.

586
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,563
The hell have you been?

587
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,151
Belize. Chiapas.

588
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,280
That thing with the planes,
remember? I told you.

589
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,662
Shit's pretty cool, man.

590
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,456
In Chiapas.

591
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:47,294
Some country shit, just how
you like it. We should go.

592
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,378
So go then.

593
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,548
I mean it. Both of us. Let's go.

594
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,676
You think I'm getting on
one of your little planes,

595
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,054
you're out of your fucking mind.

596
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,600
Think I don't know why you're here?

597
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,063
Félix tried to kill Palma.

598
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,943
That what has you so spooked?
You figure I'm next?

599
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,406
I can fix this shit, Pablo.

600
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,410
I'll talk to Félix.

601
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,870
He needs me right now.

602
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,997
Fuck Félix.

603
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:31,171
Just listen to me for once
in your fucking life.

604
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,589
No.

605
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,593
I already know what I'm gonna do.

606
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,250
Finally got yourself killed.

607
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,361
That's what you've
always wanted, isn't it?

608
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:02,285
Go out with your pride,
like a real fucking bandit.

609
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,415
But it doesn't have to be that way.

610
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,919
You could keep your pride and your
life if you'd just listen to me.

611
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:17,008
Close the door when you leave.
Don't want a draft coming in.

612
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,179
Pablo...

613
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,438
Okay.

614
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,317
Hey, Dopey.

615
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,115
Fake as shit, but...

616
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,367
I've always liked it.

617
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,126
Even tells the date and everything.

618
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,468
At some point...

619
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,558
you're gonna need to stab this
motherfucker in the back.

620
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,230
I just hope you'll know
when that time has come.

621
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,448
Door!

622
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,337
We have a problem.

623
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:23,843
One of the agents from Leyenda,
he's way out in Ojinaga.

624
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,055
I'll give you one guess as to why.

625
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,725
Stay on it.

626
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,145
And no more mistakes.
