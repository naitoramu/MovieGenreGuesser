1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,549
I am awake.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,514
You are not how I remember you
from class. Like, not at all.

3
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:25,538
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
My guy wants 85.

4
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,925
This is all the money I have
in the world.

5
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:33,135
You are a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

6
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:37,203
Buy the RV.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,420
We start tomorrow.

8
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:51,761
Work it, work it, baby.

9
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,636
This is sick, brother.

10
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:54,887
Totally.

11
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:00,192
I got these two fine ladies
want to participate.

12
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:02,281
You got the funds?

13
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:03,896
I got the funds.

14
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,566
Would you ladies
like to meet my fat stack?

15
00:01:09,226 --> 00:01:10,069
Get in here.

16
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:12,134
Come on.

17
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:18,234
You got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

18
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,164
I want the expensive shit.
Don Perig-non.

19
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:22,707
It's 400 a bottle.

20
00:01:24,195 --> 00:01:26,326
In that case, I'll only have two.

21
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:29,213
And I want the tall, skinny glasses.

22
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,197
I like those skinny glasses.

23
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,268
That's what James Bond drinks.

24
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,106
Mofos, I'm all about that.

25
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,022
I gotta ask.

26
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,559
Where'd you get all the cheddar?

27
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,701
Must be moving mad volume.

28
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:45,183
It's totally funny.

29
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:47,236
- You want to know what's funny?
- What's funny?

30
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,968
- This old dude, he gave it to me.
- What?

31
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,493
He gave it to me.
It's, like, his entire life savings.

32
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:53,657
What? Why?

33
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:55,945
Because he's a dumb-ass.
That's why.

34
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,560
All right, living large, players.

35
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,770
Thank you.

36
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:15,716
That was...

37
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,783
... awesome, bro.

38
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,225
Later.

39
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,731
I'm so dead.

40
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:32,964
I only got...

41
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,214
damn.

42
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,464
I only got, like, 1,400.

43
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,888
Waffle House.

44
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:46,231
No, man.

45
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,313
I'm supposed to use
that dude's money to buy an RV.

46
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:53,147
What you want with an RV for?

47
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,235
'Cause it's like...

48
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,334
It's like...

49
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,396
never mind.

50
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,833
Now I've got to, like,

51
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,203
leave town or change my identity
or something.

52
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,696
Guy's blackmailing me.

53
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:11,850
He's got, like,

54
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,546
a criminal mind.

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,653
RV?

56
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:19,753
I can hook you up, bro.

57
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:21,853
I can totally get you an RV.

58
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,489
No, I need it today...

59
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,132
- now.
- No problem. Let's go.

60
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,690
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

61
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,064
For 1,400 at 6 in the morning?

62
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:17,630
Right on.

63
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,175
So do I need to sign something?

64
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,541
It's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

65
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:29,757
Pleasure doing business with you.

66
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:33,641
Come on, we gotta bounce.

67
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,918
- What?
- For real. Get it out of here.

70
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,087
My God,

71
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:30,556
I love this floor.

72
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,491
This feels fantastic.

73
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,650
{\pos(192,225)}Can you control the temperature?

74
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:43,902
{\pos(192,225)}There should be a switch right next
to you there. It's a thermostat.

75
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,705
{\pos(192,225)}This has got to be

76
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,973
{\pos(192,225)}the most amazing invention...

77
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:56,980
{\pos(192,225)}ever.

78
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,465
{\pos(192,225)}I know.
Contractor talked me into it.

79
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,517
{\pos(192,225)}Seemed

80
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,829
{\pos(192,225)}kind of extravagant, but

81
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:08,802
{\pos(192,225)}I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

82
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,940
{\pos(192,225)}I can never find
anything in this Buick.

83
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,276
{\pos(192,225)}You know, you

84
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:20,289
could leave a few things
here if you want.

85
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,340
Why don't you go get your dad?

86
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,134
Sure.

87
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:56,978
Dad.

88
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:04,576
{\pos(192,225)}Mom's asking,

89
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,707
{\pos(192,225)}want to come to dinner?

90
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,082
{\pos(192,225)}I'll be right there.

91
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,330
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

92
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:20,499
<i>Yeah, right, like you don't know.</i>

93
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:23,388
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

94
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,645
{\pos(192,210)}Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

95
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,382
{\pos(192,210)}<i>Correct.
I did not.</i>

96
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,737
I was sitting at a stoplight,

97
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:33,012
minding my own business,
when the man th...

98
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:34,164
the man...

99
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,081
the kid

100
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,003
threw a bag of money
through my window.

101
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:39,284
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

102
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,020
- Let me talk to him.
- <i>I owe you...</i>

103
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,141
I owe you nothing,

104
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,570
and I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

105
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,877
Trust you?
Trust you? That's a good one.

106
00:08:48,413 --> 00:08:49,743
That's what I'm going to do.

107
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:52,710
{\pos(192,210)}You want to talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

108
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,962
{\pos(192,210)}I told you not to cook my formula,

109
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:56,285
and you did it anyway.

110
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,178
'Cause I never said I wouldn't
cook it 'cause it ain't yours.

111
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:01,248
It's ours. Plural, bitch.

112
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,251
You did not have my permission.

113
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:07,364
All I know is I got half
the money I'm due,

114
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:08,962
and you got the rest.

115
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,814
Escalating... You're escalating.

116
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,511
Escalate this.

117
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,261
My meth, my money!

118
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,908
<i>I will be a one-man glass factory.
I will rock that RV</i>

119
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,033
<i>24...</i>

120
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:24,703
It's buttoned up tight.

121
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,250
Can't see a damn thing.

122
00:10:27,302 --> 00:10:28,752
I ain't feeling it.

123
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,168
No smoke, no smell, no waste.

124
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:33,498
There's no cook.

125
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,516
Could be they're setting up.

126
00:10:35,864 --> 00:10:37,302
I heard movement inside.

127
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:39,570
I say we call it a night,

128
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:41,311
come back with a search warrant.

129
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,356
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

130
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,270
There's got to be a way.

131
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:49,086
There's got to be a way.

132
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,252
What are you doing?

133
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,774
What the hell you doing up there?
You some kind of a pervert?

134
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,418
{\pos(192,210)}Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

135
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,069
{\pos(192,210)}Guy's VFW. He's cool.

136
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:28,552
{\pos(192,210)}I'll tell you what. We're gonna
check out more and call it a morning.

137
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,963
{\pos(192,210)}- What do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

138
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,544
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

139
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,141
Gotta pack.

140
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:39,800
Where you headed?

141
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,820
Texas.

142
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:04,741
{\pos(192,210)}There.

143
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,395
Can I come in?

144
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,359
Babe.

145
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,107
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

146
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,970
Catch the bad guys?

147
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,528
Want me to make you some breakfast?

148
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,317
I'm heading back out after this.

149
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:47,594
Now?

150
00:13:48,406 --> 00:13:49,870
You worked all night.

151
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,954
Get some sleep.

152
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:55,111
- Those RVs aren't going anywhere.
- They're recreational vehicles.

153
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,655
That's what they do.

154
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:58,423
You know what I mean.

155
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:02,735
I spoke with Blanca.

156
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,396
She said that

157
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:06,931
Steven's going to El Paso?

158
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:15,843
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

159
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,191
I turned it down.
End of story.

160
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,280
Good.

161
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,792
God knows I'm relieved.

162
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,696
I needed some time here

163
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,145
because I'm deep
into this investigation and

164
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,604
couldn't do both,
so I made a judgment call.

165
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:41,088
You know that you can talk
to me about things, right?

166
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,696
You don't have
to go through this alone.

167
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:50,072
Do you ask me which lead bib to put
on someone before you nuke them?

168
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:56,003
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

169
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,289
I'm doing my job.

170
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:00,941
I would like...

171
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:03,196
A condo in Georgetown.
I know.

172
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:06,686
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say

173
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,518
I'd like to be included.

174
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:10,834
That's all.

175
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,700
Don't you worry about my career.

176
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:15,789
My career is just fine.

177
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,129
Did you not want to go?

178
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,688
- I don't blame you. I just...
- Aren't you late for work or something?

179
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:27,992
I mean, what happened last time,

180
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:30,630
it would make perfect sense
for you to not want to go back.

181
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,287
I'm on to some important
stuff right here, right now,

182
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:36,805
and Mexico doesn't have a damn thing
to do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

183
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,933
I'm doing some actual good out here,

184
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,024
and all I get are
these bullshit accusations!

185
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,915
What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off
on this thing? Fine.

186
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,200
But I'm onto something.
I know it.

187
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:49,718
You understand me?

188
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,618
You hear me?

189
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,412


190
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,732
What exactly is this?

191
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,516
I'll tell you what I think it is.

192
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,599
A ploy.

193
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:17,072
A ploy to get me cooking again...

194
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,145
And an obvious one at that.

195
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,920
How do you mean?

196
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,124
As if I would seriously believe

197
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,290
you would hire an addict.

198
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:28,544
Jesse Pinkman?

199
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:32,032
- Recovering or not...
- You vouched for him previously.

200
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,484
I took you at your word.

201
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:35,120
No. Let me be clear.

202
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:37,269
Let me be perfectly clear.

203
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,548
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

204
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:46,065
Trusting him with a solo venture,

205
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:48,717
that's quite another matter.

206
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:55,495
How he could possibly produce anything
other than a mediocre product

207
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,426
at best.

208
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,804
I am told his product
was more or less consistent

209
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,992
with the quality
I had come to expect.

210
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,045
More or less?

211
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,790
More or less?

212
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,202
Really?

213
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,052
Boy, that is the...

214
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:15,785
Talk about setting the bar low.

215
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,300
Except you don't do that...

216
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,292
set the bar low.

217
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:27,839
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

218
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,422
That you believe

219
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:34,943
I have some proprietary
kind of selfishness

220
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:36,618
about my own formula.

221
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:41,936
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose,

222
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,266
that you think

223
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,164
simply overwhelms me,

224
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,628
clouds my judgment.

225
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:52,113
But it doesn't.

226
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,871
Absolutely not.

227
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:57,119
I simply respect the chemistry.

228
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:02,336
The chemistry must be respected.

229
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,915
I apologize for being
so transparent.

230
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:13,802
Would you take a drive with me?

231
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,401
I'd like to show you something.

232
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,766
Hi. Is everything okay?

233
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,519
She's already finished
an entire bottle,

234
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,210
but she still seemed hungry.
Then she fell asleep.

235
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:10,108
I was thinking I'd give her
another when she wakes up.

236
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:13,975
Yeah, absolutely.
Fatten that baby up.

237
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,398
<i>Will do.</i>

238
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:22,495
Was that it?

239
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:25,463
So where are you.
Are you at work?

240
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,024
<i>Yeah, I'm at work.
I shouldn't be much longer.</i>

241
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:30,295
<i>Is that okay?</i>

242
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,436
You know I love my little Pookums.

243
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:34,799
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years

244
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,667
as far as I'm concerned.

245
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:38,484
Great.

246
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,191
Thanks, Marie.

247
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:46,137
Are you sure you're okay?

248
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:49,503
<i>Sweetie, what is it?</i>

249
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:51,507
<i>Come on.</i>

250
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,013
It's Hank.

251
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,911
<i>What about him?</i>

252
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:57,323
I don't know...

253
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:00,422
how to talk to him.

254
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:04,631
I don't know what to say to him anymore.
I don't know how to...

255
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:07,105
Ever since El Paso...

256
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,749
<i>Maybe before...</i>

257
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,875
God knows
he went through a lot down there.

258
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,713
People blown up
right in front of him,

259
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:19,188
blood everywhere,

260
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:22,696
and last week

261
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,593
El Paso said they want him back.

262
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,014
He's not going. Steve Gomez is going
in his place, and...

263
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,245
I don't know how I feel about that.

264
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:37,440
Well, he's certainly
a lot safer up here, isn't he?

265
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:40,446
<i>Of course, and I want him safe.</i>

266
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,417
But I can't tell what he wants.

267
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,299
He won't talk to me.

268
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,996
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

269
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,614
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

270
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:54,712
<i>It's like something's
eating him away from inside.</i>

271
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:56,871
He's just not the same.

272
00:20:57,217 --> 00:20:58,217
He's not.

273
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:04,061
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

274
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,685
I guess
you've notice a change in Walt.

275
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,179
Please.

276
00:22:58,405 --> 00:22:59,555
What is this?

277
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,783
Your new lab.

278
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,593
Thorium oxide...

279
00:23:57,889 --> 00:23:59,339
for a catalyst bed.

280
00:24:02,787 --> 00:24:05,506
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

281
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:07,568
Why, that's got...

282
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:09,693
that's got to be 1,200 liters.

283
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,876
Where...
How did you

284
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:18,595
know how to put this all together?

285
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:20,712
I had excellent help,

286
00:24:21,069 --> 00:24:22,169
as will you.

287
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,132
Quite a lot of planning
went into this.

288
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:30,157
I would say so.

289
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:35,098
The laundry upstairs...
I've owned it for years.

290
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,235
It receives large chemical
deliveries on a weekly basis...

291
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,746
detergents and such.

292
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,543
There is nothing suspicious
about it,

293
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:46,914
and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

294
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,612
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

295
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:54,637
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam,

296
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,942
just as the laundry does,

297
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:59,217
and through the very same stacks.

298
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
I need...

299
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,147
200 pounds per week

300
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:06,714
to make this economically viable.

301
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:12,123
You would choose your own hours,
of course, come and go as you please

302
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:15,181
so long as the quota is met.

303
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:36,912
Sorry.

304
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,130
The answer is still no.

305
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:49,155
I have made a series of...

306
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:53,760
very bad decisions,
and I cannot make another one.

307
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,972
Why did you make these decisions?

308
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,189
For the good of my family.

309
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:01,735
Then they weren't bad decisions.

310
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:07,194
What does a man do, Walter?

311
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:13,698
A man provides for his family.

312
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:16,287
This cost me my family.

313
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:19,725
When you have children,
you always have family.

314
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,528
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility,

315
00:26:23,393 --> 00:26:24,493
and a man...

316
00:26:25,861 --> 00:26:27,382
a man provides.

317
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:33,177
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated

318
00:26:34,513 --> 00:26:35,469
or respected

319
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,245
or even loved.

320
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,862
He simply bears up,
and he does it...

321
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:46,607
because he's a man.

322
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:56,472


323
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:09,767
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

324
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:13,210
Thai place
around the corner's pretty good.

325
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:16,316
I really gotta head home.

326
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,434
All right, rain check, then.

327
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:42,579
She said it was the tofu.

328
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:49,478
Whatever.
She's still cute anyways.

329
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,596
Great dinner, Mom.

330
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,976
Can I be excused?

331
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,959
To do homework
or to play videogames?

332
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:09,603
I can multitask.

333
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,152
Go ahead.

334
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:03,490
You want to take her?

335
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,180
Give me something, Andy.

336
00:30:25,316 --> 00:30:28,216
Welded onto the back of a house.
That's classy.

337
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:30,672
Christ.

338
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:49,057
Hey, Janice. Janice.

339
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:53,603
The last one?

340
00:30:54,942 --> 00:30:56,830
Sorry, Hank.
That's all DMV had...

341
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,064
29 early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

342
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,112
Could you check again?

343
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:04,316
Now?

344
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,867
Can I do it after the party?

345
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,235
Janice, I'm...

346
00:31:09,293 --> 00:31:10,620
I'm dead in the water here.

347
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,266
Okay, I'll check.

348
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:32,876
Gomie,

349
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:36,811
time for the little bird
to fly the nest, huh?

350
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:39,560
They got the right guy for the job,

351
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:41,860
especially since
the bean-speak comes natural.

352
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,687
Wanna know how to say
"Get bent" in Spanish?

353
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,190
Just don't go native on me,
all right?

354
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:56,605
Here.

355
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,867
Know your enemy and all.

356
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,264
Fight the good fight.

357
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,363
I will.

358
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,708
What have we got to drink
around here?

359
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:28,531
Your hunch was right.

360
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,633
One more RV.

361
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:33,803
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed,

362
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:37,781
but then they realized it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

363
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,875
No police report, either.

364
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:10,117
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

365
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,133
It's like I'm paralyzed,

366
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:17,076
like if I take a step in any direction,
I'm going to make

367
00:34:17,834 --> 00:34:19,737
a spectacular mistake.

368
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:25,137
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

369
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:28,013
You want to go to...

370
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:29,736
Sorry, never mind.

371
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:33,722
Anyway,

372
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:38,787
breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss,

373
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,188
and I don't know why.

374
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:43,632
- Wow.
- Yep.

375
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,408
That's a lie.

376
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:51,974
I do know why.

377
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:57,879
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

378
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:01,014
He's a really good person,

379
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:04,163
but, I mean, it's not like
we're ever gonna...

380
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,088
Somehow, and I can't
actually believe it, but

381
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,820
my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

382
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,249
My own sister,

383
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:20,927
my brother-in-law.

384
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,531
My teenage son

385
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:25,228
tells me I'm a bitch.

386
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:30,443
And you say tell him the truth.

387
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,717
Tell him about his father,

388
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:36,943
but I can't...

389
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:38,854
ever.

390
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:41,758
How could I?

391
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:44,335
And this man that I'm seeing,
you know,

392
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,939
as wrong as I know it is,

393
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:50,382
as much as I know I'm probably doing it
just to make Walt leave me,

394
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:54,410
it is the only thing in my day

395
00:35:54,942 --> 00:35:56,492
where I don't feel...

396
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:00,732
like I'm...

397
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:04,664
drowning.

398
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,960
So he knows about this other man?

399
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:16,030
So then he'll sign?

400
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:21,242
Walt says he's not going anywhere,

401
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:25,832
so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part.

402
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:26,749
Yep.

403
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:28,681
Genius.

404
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:40,664
He keeps money in the house.

405
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,583
Your husband, the drug dealer?

406
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:47,145
How much money?

407
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:50,381
I didn't count it.

408
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:51,859
It's heavy.

409
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:56,296
The bag where he keeps it.

410
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:02,535
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

411
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:04,779
God, no.

412
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,022
No, I'm just, you know...

413
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,853
I'm just trying to just
talk it through. That's...

414
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,513
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified

415
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:15,501
and twice the price of a therapist.

416
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,526
There is nothing
to discuss here, Skyler.

417
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:18,992
I'm just saying, you know?

418
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,928
We have a history.

419
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,539
He's the father of my children,

420
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,698
and maybe what he did, he...

421
00:37:27,823 --> 00:37:29,785
He did it for the family.
Right?

422
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:31,998
Guess what.

423
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:34,733
That is one enormous load
of horse shit.

424
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:36,090
Okay.

425
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,339
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

426
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,246
You are a fool

427
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:44,098
to stay in that house
one minute longer.

428
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,113
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

429
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:49,749
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

430
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:50,995
You are culpable.

431
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:54,354
You, your children,
you could lose everything you own.

432
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,879
Do you understand?

433
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,559
All courtesy of this criminal

434
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:01,422
you refuse to divorce.

435
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:03,973
I didn't marry a criminal.

436
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,284
You're married to one now.

437
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,346
Let's run through
this thing one more time,

438
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,492
especially the part where I do all
the talking and you don't say jack?

439
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:33,215
Oh, I'm going to say jack.

440
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,685
I'm going to say plenty.

441
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,121
What did we say about escalating, huh?
Who's got your back here?

442
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,506
Me. All right?
I'm going to take care of things.

443
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:43,927
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

444
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:46,193
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

445
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:47,988
'Cause I got a drawer full of them.

446
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,441
I get them from my "chiropractor."

447
00:39:52,276 --> 00:39:54,104
Vietnamese, 5 foot tall,

448
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:56,806
she adjusts you to completion.

449
00:39:58,223 --> 00:39:59,825
Her name's Kim Nu Suong,

450
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:03,127
as delicious as it sounds.

451
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,310
I should give you her card.

452
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,096
To hell with this.
I'm outta here.

453
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:10,631
<i>He's here.</i>

454
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:14,029
Send him in.

455
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,990
Hello, Walt.

456
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,779
Good to see you.

457
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,034
Please, have a seat...

458
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:25,466
here.

459
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:27,981
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

460
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:31,973
You're late.

461
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,121
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here.

462
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,212
There's always a way to oil
everyone's lock.

463
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:39,381
This young man

464
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:41,900
is prepared to offer you
a sweetheart of a deal

465
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,196
doing precisely nothing.

466
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:45,766
Really?

467
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:49,674
10 percent of all future profits
from his solo venture

468
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,971
is money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

469
00:40:55,054 --> 00:40:57,157
Consider it a gesture of respect

470
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,849
for your valuable contributions
to the business thus far.

471
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:02,214
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

472
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:05,418
That's charity, is what that is.

473
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:07,548
I do all the work.

474
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,388
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

475
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:12,615
Escalating.

476
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:13,850
Stop.

477
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:18,027
Here's that,
but then there's one small detail.

478
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:21,860
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate

479
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:24,262
when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

480
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:27,310
He must not have realized that you two
had come to a parting of the ways.

481
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:29,072
Take it.

482
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:30,909
It belongs to you.

483
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:33,488
You're damn right it belongs to me.

484
00:41:33,613 --> 00:41:36,124
I knew I could count
on you boys to play nice.

485
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:38,737
That almost brings a tear to my eye.

486
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:41,112
Enjoy it.
Spend it in good health.

487
00:41:42,364 --> 00:41:46,245
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

488
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,666
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

489
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:55,665
I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate

490
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:58,469
was only using you

491
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:00,491
to get to me.

492
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:02,427
What are you talking about?

493
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:06,207
You see, he needs someone
with expertise,

494
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:09,955
someone who knows what he's doing.

495
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,529
In other words,

496
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:13,386
he needs me.

497
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,378
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

498
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,457
Yeah, uh...

499
00:42:18,826 --> 00:42:20,105
How should I put this?

500
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:23,288
I'm in.

501
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:26,269
You're out.

502
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,805
Walt, hold on there.

503
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,255
What was the offer, if I may ask?

504
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,668
It's, uh, 3 million

505
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:41,370
for three months of my time.

506
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:44,976
You're gonna need that money laundered,
right? I mean, of course.

507
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,561
What was our deal before?
17 percent. That's a shade high.

508
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:51,917
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

509
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,178
5 percent.

510
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,157
- 14's fair.
- 5.

511
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,344
- 13.
- 5.

512
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:57,868
12.
For old time's sake, 12.

513
00:42:58,693 --> 00:42:59,488
5.

514
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:02,460
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

515
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:05,809
10 even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

516
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:06,958
5.

517
00:43:07,242 --> 00:43:10,989
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his!

518
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:13,062
That's the way of the world, kid.

519
00:43:13,187 --> 00:43:14,768
You go with the winner.

520
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,391
You think this'll stop me
from cooking?

521
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,134
Cook whatever you like...

522
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:22,898
As long as it's that ridiculous
"Chili P" or some other dreck,

523
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:26,020
but don't even think
about using my formula.

524
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,452
Just try and stop me, bitch.

525
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:21,389
Yes?

526
00:44:21,514 --> 00:44:23,112
Hi, there, Mrs. Ortega?

527
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:24,029
Yes.

528
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:27,085
Hi, I'm Hank Schrader. I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

529
00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:29,294
We're interested in an RV

530
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,580
that's registered
to your name and address.

531
00:44:32,874 --> 00:44:34,274
Do you have an RV?

532
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:35,428
I did.

533
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:37,532
It was stolen months ago.

534
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,688
Stolen, huh?

535
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:44,545
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

536
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,720
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

537
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:50,451
I just...
didn't get around to it.

538
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,591
May I ask why?

539
00:44:54,078 --> 00:44:55,935
I mean, it's a great way to get

540
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:58,538
the family together
for an affordable vacation.

541
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,882
It must've been quite a blow
when it went missing.

542
00:45:01,007 --> 00:45:01,857
It was.

543
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:06,825
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

544
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,310
I didn't want him arrested.

545
00:45:12,153 --> 00:45:13,853
He ran with a bad crowd,

546
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:16,322
but he was never a bad person.

547
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,163
I thought he could
turn his life around.

548
00:45:19,288 --> 00:45:20,970
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

549
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:22,484
My son.

550
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,387
I'd really like to speak with him.

551
00:45:27,523 --> 00:45:28,825
He's passed away.

552
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,782
He was shot two months ago.

553
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:35,847
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

554
00:45:35,972 --> 00:45:37,322
Christian Ortega.

555
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:41,813
Was his nickname "Combo"?

556
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:53,981
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.
