1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,319
I want you to see this as me
introducing myself to you.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,999
He said Mr Churchill sent him
to Birmingham.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,519
Something about a robbery.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,319
Thomas, you are a bookmaker,
not a fool...

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,519
You sell those guns to anyone who
has use for them,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,319
you will hang.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,719
I am just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,519
I'm with you cos you're the only man
round here not scared of them.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,839
The only difference between you
and me, Freddie, is that

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,759
sometimes my horses stand
a chance of winning.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,399
Tommy!

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,600
You fixing races now?

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,680
I'm here about the job as barmaid.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,440
Are you in position?

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
I am, sir.

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,080
I thought you said we were going to
the fair.

17
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,599
We have business first. Come on.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,959
Bring your wits.

19
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,840
What business?
That's the Lee family.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,199
Tommy!

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,799
Johnny Dogs.

22
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,399
Tommy, how the hell are you?

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,039
All the better for getting the city
smoke out of me lungs.

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,359
I thought you became a bit
too grand for us.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,639
I've been busy.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,159
I'm riding with the Lee family now.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,679
I heard.

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,799
Myself, I'd rather live among pigs.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,319
Come on, Tommy. No disputing.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,599
So, your first fair since France...?

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,800
What do you know about France, you
war-shy Gypsy bastard?

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,959
So this is the horse.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
And that's the car.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,439
Hang on a minute.

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,479
You are not swapping the family car
for a bloody horse.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,599
Of course we're not swapping it.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,759
Huh?

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,719
That would be mad.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
We're going to play two-up.

40
00:02:57,526 --> 00:03:03,888
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,759
Here you are.

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,620
I knew it. I knew it.

43
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,333
Tommy, you bloody idiot.

44
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:21,293
Shut up, Arthur, I won.

45
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:25,453
I promised Johnny I'd let him have a
spin in the car if he lost.

46
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,694
All right.

47
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,974
Are you Lee boys
laughing at my brother?

48
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,454
Are you?

49
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,373
Eh? Tommy...

50
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,133
Tommy.
I asked you a question!

51
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,293
Tommy, come on, it's just the
craic...

52
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:47,053
Get your family out of here and go
and enjoy yourselves at the fair

53
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:48,734
before they start a war. Huh?

54
00:03:57,374 --> 00:03:59,654
Yeah, but his mother was
a Didicoy whore.

55
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:30,093
We will take them before last night's
beer turns to piss

56
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:33,253
and wakes the devils up.

57
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,893
We will leave no stone unturned.

58
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:39,733
Every gun, every bullet will
be brought to me for inspection.

59
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,733
Now...

60
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:42,934
take your positions.

61
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:13,854
Don't hit me! Get off me!

62
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,214
Freddie!

63
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:28,653
You're sure your
brothers are at the fair?

64
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,773
If it was them they wouldn't knock.

65
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:31,894
Mr Thorne...

66
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,173
What is it?

67
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,134
The police are rounding up
the communists.

68
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:40,213
Come on, Ada, if the cops find me
we are screwed.

69
00:06:40,214 --> 00:06:41,534
Fuck...

70
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:45,214
Freddie Thorne, open up!
Ada...

71
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,373
You have to jump, Ada.
I'll catch you.

72
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:07,654
Come on.

73
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:16,893
Look at this.

74
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,813
A prescription for iron tablets...

75
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,774
for Ada fucking Shelby.

76
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,253
Mrs Donovan, I need that favour.

77
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,253
Come in and be quick.
I'm not coming in. She is.

78
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:30,893
Holy Jesus, it's the Shelby girl.

79
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:32,693
You have not seen her with me,
Mrs Donovan.

80
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:35,413
Give her a cup of tea and let her
stay until the police have gone.

81
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:38,373
She's the sister of those
Peaky Blinder devils...

82
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,093
And yet she is an angel.

83
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:41,773
Come on, Ada.

84
00:07:41,774 --> 00:07:43,373
What are you going to do, Freddie?

85
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,494
Me? I'm going to have to leave town
for a bit.

86
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,934
A gentleman would take off his hat...

87
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:08,374
and put out his pipe.

88
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,173
I see you Specials
only dare to come here

89
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,974
when you know the boys
are away at the fair.

90
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:23,454
You mean your nephews...

91
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,413
with their guns and their razors?

92
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,334
Is it them
you're lighting candles for?

93
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,693
No.

94
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,213
I am lighting candles for the boys
from the Garrison who

95
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,854
lost their lives in France.

96
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:38,374
There's a list there.

97
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:41,734
Look...

98
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,854
I hear you didn't make it to
France, Inspector Campbell.

99
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,454
You've heard of me.

100
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,574
I've heard of you.

101
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,813
Is it the Holy Grail you're
looking for...?

102
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:06,973
As a matter of fact...

103
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:09,973
it is the Holy Grail
I'm looking for.

104
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:12,933
Something precious.
Something stolen.

105
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,854
Perhaps you know what I'm
talking about.

106
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:20,813
Sorry, I misunderstood
your intention

107
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:22,094
when you pushed me to the wall.

108
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,534
Turn the place upside down.

109
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:43,213
Arthur Shelby said
you people would help us.

110
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,853
If we don't know what you've lost,
how can we help you find it?

111
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,933
But I've found out subsequently that
I was speaking to the wrong man.

112
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:51,494
Next time I want to
talk to the boss.

113
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:57,013
The Lickey Tea Rooms.
Friday. Ten o'clock.

114
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,454
And when I say the boss,
I mean Thomas.

115
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,054
Come on.

116
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,294
The scum of the Earth...

117
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,974
Now what the
bloody hell's been going on here?

118
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:38,653
Jesus Christ.

119
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,853
The coppers told everyone
Arthur had agreed to it

120
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:42,173
when he was arrested.

121
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,693
They said the Peaky Blinders had

122
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:46,493
cleared out to the fair
to let them do it.

123
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:50,533
I never said nothing to that copper
about smashing up bloody houses...

124
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,933
All right... which pubs did they do?

125
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:55,133
The Guns, the Chain, the Marquis.

126
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,893
All the ones that pay you
to protect them.

127
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,934
The only one they didn't touch
was the Garrison.

128
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:02,774
Make sure people think
we were in on it.

129
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:05,214
He's smart, this copper.

130
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:08,333
So, go on.

131
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,333
Drink your beers, get out.

132
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:12,853
You'd better show people you're
still the cocks of the walk.

133
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,373
Hand out some cash to the
landlords of the pubs.

134
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,573
Pay some veterans to fix
the places up.

135
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:19,453
Oi, Nipper. Give us the bag.

136
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,293
So, what about you, Tommy?

137
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:24,293
I have to go to Charlie's to
stable the horse.

138
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,774
She looked foot-sore in the box.

139
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:31,334
Let them see your faces.

140
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,214
So we both know what
they were looking for.

141
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,213
You don't read the papers.

142
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:52,213
Racing papers.

143
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:54,493
So let me tell you the odds.

144
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:57,493
I reckon it's three to one
there'll be a revolution.

145
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,173
I wouldn't bet on that.

146
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:01,533
That copper's betting on it.

147
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,894
He's not going to let it rest till
he gets those guns back.

148
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,534
Did he talk to you, Pol?

149
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:16,374
In the church.

150
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,534
Did he try to find our Ada?

151
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:23,174
She was sleeping.

152
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,374
Where was she sleeping, Pol?

153
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:31,694
I thought you didn't care for
women's business.

154
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:39,893
He knows you're the boss.

155
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:41,014
He wants to meet you.

156
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:49,173
Will you talk to him?

157
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:50,214
No...

158
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,854
you don't parley
when you're on the back foot.

159
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:58,174
We'll strike a blow back first.

160
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,933
Finn, lad? What are you doing?

161
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,054
We're having a fire.

162
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:22,213
Two bob for your picture
of the King.

163
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,373
What?

164
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:24,374
Bring it to Watery Lane.

165
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:27,653
All right, Finn, lad.
All right, Scud.

166
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:29,174
We are blocking the entrance, mate.

167
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:33,213
Come on, keep making your way
through. Come on.

168
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:35,333
Come on, gentlemen.

169
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:37,214
Now come on...

170
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,574
Chuck them on, boys.

171
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:55,814
Well, I hope to God
you know what you're doing.

172
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:19,973
I'm a reporter with
the Birmingham Evening Despatch.

173
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:21,054
I had a phone call.

174
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:24,853
Someone called Thomas Shelby.

175
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:25,774
Come with me.

176
00:14:28,294 --> 00:14:30,733
Come on, folks,
give us a bit of room.

177
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,533
Tommy.

178
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:35,293
Move back for us, please, folks.
You're Mr Shelby?

179
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:36,854
All the way back, please.
I am.

180
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,133
You said I would be protected.

181
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:43,214
You're protected.

182
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,573
What's going on?

183
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:48,774
There are some things
I want you to write down.

184
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,333
Now, first of all...

185
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:55,573
it's not that people round here are
disloyal to the King.

186
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,693
It's the opposite.

187
00:14:57,694 --> 00:15:00,093
You see, we don't want our beloved
King looking down

188
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,693
and seeing the things
that are being done to us.

189
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,493
So we are taking down his pictures.

190
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:05,894
But why are you burning them?

191
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:10,213
We went through hell for our King.

192
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:13,293
Walked through the flames of war.
Write all this down...

193
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,814
And now we're being
attacked in our own homes.

194
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:20,373
These new coppers over from Belfast,
breaking into our homes

195
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:21,973
and interfering with our women.

196
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:25,573
We don't think our King would
want to see that happening.

197
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:28,933
So, we're lighting fires to
raise the alarm.

198
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:32,333
May I ask you, in what capacity
do you speak?

199
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:33,214
No capacity.

200
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,013
I am an ordinary man.

201
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:38,054
I won gallantry medals at the Somme.

202
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,934
I want you to write in your paper
what's going on here.

203
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:44,814
Go on, go.

204
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:55,974
Come in.

205
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:00,573
Here, eh...

206
00:16:00,574 --> 00:16:04,293
there's a telephone call for you,
sir, on the London line.

207
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,933
There is? It's almost midnight.

208
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,294
It's Mr Winston Churchill, sir.

209
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,373
Yes, sir?

210
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:25,053
Inspector Campbell?

211
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,653
I hear there has been
a bonfire in your city.

212
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,213
There was a small fire reported
around nine o'clock on Watery Lane.

213
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:33,893
But it was certainly nothing to
trouble you about, sir.

214
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:36,773
Ah,
but I'm afraid it has troubled me.

215
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:40,213
Half an hour ago I received a
wire communication

216
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:43,374
from the editor
of the Birmingham Evening Despatch.

217
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:48,253
It seems one of his reporters was
invited to the fire

218
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:51,413
and discovered that they were
burning pictures of the King.

219
00:16:51,414 --> 00:16:52,414
Of the King?

220
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:57,693
Any newspaper report which may cause
embarrassment to His Majesty

221
00:16:57,694 --> 00:16:59,573
is always referred first

222
00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:02,213
and as a matter of routine to the
Home Office.

223
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:05,853
I will go down there immediately
and arrest those involved.

224
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:09,333
No, you most certainly will
not make arrests.

225
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:11,693
If there are arrests
there will be trials,

226
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:15,413
if there are trials there will be
more newspaper reports,

227
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:19,493
which will necessarily mention the
burning of the King's likeness.

228
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:24,933
I put you in Birmingham for one
very specific reason.

229
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:28,613
Are you any nearer to finding
those stolen guns?

230
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,213
We are making steady progress...

231
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:34,013
We need results.
Good night, Mr Campbell. Sir...

232
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:37,133
Could I at least ask,
does this report

233
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:39,573
name any of those involved?

234
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,053
It names a Mr Thomas Shelby.

235
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:45,014
The report mentions
he is a war hero.

236
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:56,574
Good of you to join us.

237
00:17:57,814 --> 00:17:59,774
Where have you been all day?
In bed.

238
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:02,653
I couldn't sleep.

239
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:04,773
Then I couldn't wake up.

240
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,974
Then I was cold
and then I had to go for a wee.

241
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:11,213
Then I was with this bear on a boat,

242
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:13,013
but that was a dream.

243
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:14,014
Then I was hungry.

244
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,934
Why are you reading the paper?

245
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:19,773
Why wouldn't I be?

246
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:21,493
I've never seen you read the paper.

247
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:23,853
I've only ever seen you light
fires with them.

248
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,133
The BSA are on strike.

249
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,213
The miners are on strike.

250
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:31,014
IRA are killing our boys ten a day.

251
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:36,893
What?

252
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:38,493
Stand up.

253
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:39,773
Why?

254
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:40,894
Just stand up.

255
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,454
Side on.

256
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,693
Hoi! What are you doing?

257
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:53,814
Ada...

258
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:56,734
how late are you?

259
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:01,094
One week.

260
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:04,694
Five weeks.

261
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,614
Seven if you count weekends.
I think it's a lack of iron.

262
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:12,053
I got some tablets.

263
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:13,054
But they didn't work?

264
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:17,894
No.

265
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:29,294
You can get dressed now, love.

266
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,174
So, am I or not?

267
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,973
Keep bloody walking, Ada. If anybody
sees us here they'll know.

268
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:43,613
I'm not getting rid of it, Aunt Pol.

269
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:45,333
Just come home
and we'll talk about it.

270
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:47,214
You get off me or I'll scream out,
I swear.

271
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:54,693
All right, if you want to do
this on the street, let's do it.

272
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,293
Whose is it?

273
00:19:56,294 --> 00:20:00,053
If I tell you, you'll tell them
and they'll cut him to pieces.

274
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,614
Not if he marries you they won't.

275
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:05,654
Will he marry you?

276
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,173
I don't know.
I don't know where he is.

277
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,893
Jesus Christ, Ada. He's gone away,
but he said he'd come back.

278
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,813
Yeah, but they all say
they'll come back.

279
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,414
He's not like that. He's a good man.
He promised.

280
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,334
He will come back,
Aunt Pol, I know he will.

281
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:30,933
Get me down a Spanish saddle, Curly.

282
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,333
Yes, Tom, a Spanish saddle.

283
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:36,534
He's a beauty, Tom.
Yeah, yeah, a beauty, Tom.

284
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,614
A fine beast you got there, Thomas.

285
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:49,294
But is he worth falling out with
the Lee family over?

286
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:02,934
Just passing it on...

287
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:07,334
a declaration of war -
the whole Lee clan.

288
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:14,894
The guns and now this.

289
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:19,974
The guns are not spoken of.

290
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:22,814
Right?

291
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,614
Tommy...

292
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:33,493
you mind how you speak to me.

293
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:34,574
Forgive me, Uncle.

294
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,214
It's Thomas Shelby against the
whole bloody world, right?

295
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:12,054
Easy...

296
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:15,454
Easy, easy.

297
00:22:16,694 --> 00:22:18,773
Whoa.

298
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:20,333
Easy, boy.

299
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:21,654
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

300
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,213
Shh.

301
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:26,973
In France we used to say...
Shh...

302
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:30,493
In France we used to say it's
just the music hall band turning up.

303
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:33,453
Shh. It's just trombones and tubas,
that's all.

304
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:35,654
It's just noise. Shh. Shh. Shh.

305
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:40,094
It's just noise.
Hey. It's just noise.

306
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,413
You get used to it.

307
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,053
It's just noise. Good boy.

308
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:47,214
Good boy.

309
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:02,094
You have some pain there, boy, hey?

310
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,734
I'm so sorry, Mr Shelby.

311
00:23:11,654 --> 00:23:13,333
I'm Grace, by the way.

312
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,334
I know who you are.

313
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,573
What's his name?

314
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:19,894
He doesn't have a name.

315
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:22,294
Poor boy deserves a name.

316
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:25,534
You have something to say to me?

317
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:31,334
The other night you came
into the pub and I was singing...

318
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:34,694
You said singing wasn't allowed.

319
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:39,934
I'd like there to be one night a week
when there's singing.

320
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:44,173
I think it would be good for
everyone...

321
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,174
Saturday nights.

322
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,294
Harry was too afraid to ask you,
so...

323
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:51,854
But you're not.

324
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,334
I am.

325
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,094
But I love to sing.

326
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,773
You sound like one of those
rich girls who comes over

327
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,214
from Dublin for the races.

328
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:08,694
Do you like horses?

329
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:13,933
How do you fancy earning
some extra money?

330
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:14,814
Doing what?

331
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:18,614
Dig out a nice dress.

332
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:21,814
I want to take you to the races.

333
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:32,693
Monaghan Boy two to one.

334
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:35,093
Get your bets in now before
he goes evens.

335
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:38,853
We've got a couple of changes coming
in, John. Rock Ferry down to eight.

336
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,453
That's for you. Thanks, mate.

337
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:43,133
Get your bets in now.

338
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,133
20-1.

339
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:47,653
There you go, take that to
the twins, yeah? Yeah.

340
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,773
Down to tens. That's right.

341
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:51,333
Doubles?

342
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:54,413
OK, friend, Monaghan Boy.
You want to push out, mate,

343
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:56,373
cos it's going to go evens soon.

344
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:59,134
Good one. Change of £35...

345
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:06,133
I've told you...
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

346
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:07,534
Go on!

347
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,773
All right, Mr Shelby, how's it going?

348
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:19,973
Hello, Frank, how's the leg?
Not bad. Not bad.

349
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:22,054
Good. Nice to see you, son.

350
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:26,493
Morning, Charlie.

351
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:28,413
All right, Scudboat,
how are we looking?

352
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:30,253
Looking good, Tommy.
Grand stuff.

353
00:25:30,254 --> 00:25:32,973
Tommy,
they are all here for Monaghan Boy.

354
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:34,973
That's what
I like to hear, Johnny Boy.

355
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,334
And Aunt Pol wants to see you.

356
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:44,054
Tell me the man's name, Ada.

357
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,254
Rudolph Valentino.

358
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,933
Get out! All of you!

359
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:12,654
Go on! Now!

360
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:18,094
I said, tell me his fucking name.

361
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:24,374
Freddie fucking Thorne!

362
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,333
Yeah.

363
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:29,933
Your best mate since school!

364
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:32,733
The man who saved your life
in France!

365
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,493
So go on!

366
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:35,653
Go on, cut him!

367
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,574
Cut him up and chuck him in the cut.

368
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,453
Oi! I'm a Shelby too, you know.

369
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,374
Put my fucking film back on!

370
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:21,214
So Monaghan Boy finally lost.

371
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:24,614
Third time unlucky.

372
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,253
We took money
from all over the city.

373
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:30,494
Yeah, but you'll pay it back
to people round here.

374
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,693
Buy your popularity back.

375
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:35,693
Already done.

376
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:36,534
I taught you well.

377
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:41,054
And you fixed this race without
the permission of Billy Kimber.

378
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,813
Obviously, I didn't teach
you well enough.

379
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:48,213
Rule one,
you don't punch above your weight.

380
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:50,013
Billy Kimber is
there for the taking...

381
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:53,773
Says who? Says Tommy
and his parliament of one.

382
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,853
I ran this business for five
years...

383
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:58,773
Yeah, while I was away fighting,
remember,

384
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:00,693
where I learnt some things,
such as

385
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:02,334
you strike when your enemy is weak.

386
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:06,814
I thought you came here
to talk family business.

387
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,533
I'll deal with it.

388
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:12,094
You're too busy taking over the
world... Polly...

389
00:29:13,494 --> 00:29:15,374
If it's about Ada, I need to know.

390
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:25,174
Ada wants you to give
Freddie this letter.

391
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:29,333
She wants Freddie to know she's
having his baby.

392
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,534
He deserves an opportunity to
do the right thing.

393
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:33,974
I say we give them a chance.

394
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:42,853
For a woman who's had a
hard life with men,

395
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:44,414
you're still full of romance, eh?

396
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,653
What do you think Freddie
sees in our Ada?

397
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,293
That's Freddie's business...
No.

398
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:52,253
No. I'll tell you what he sees.

399
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:56,333
He sees machine guns, and rifles,
and ammunition,

400
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:58,173
and some glorious revolution.

401
00:29:58,174 --> 00:30:01,013
What is it you really
don't like about Freddie?

402
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,973
She'll have no life with
a man on the run.

403
00:30:02,974 --> 00:30:05,094
If you can't see that,
you can't see much.

404
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,934
Damn them for what
they did to you in France.

405
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:18,534
Tell Ada Freddie went to America.

406
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:21,773
Or Russia.

407
00:30:21,774 --> 00:30:23,293
Polly, it would do no good for Ada

408
00:30:23,294 --> 00:30:25,413
to bring a baby into the world
alone.

409
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:26,573
Pol, listen.

410
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,933
The truth is you would have hit me
with that thing

411
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:31,054
if it weren't for the fact
that you know I'm right.

412
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:40,373
I thought I heard someone knocking.

413
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,694
Couldn't get back to sleep.

414
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:46,974
The longer you leave it...

415
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:49,334
the worse it gets.

416
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:59,453
Believe me...

417
00:30:59,454 --> 00:31:00,534
I know.

418
00:31:03,014 --> 00:31:04,214
I was 16.

419
00:31:07,494 --> 00:31:08,894
And I didn't dare tell anyone.

420
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:12,533
Polly, Freddie will come back...

421
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:14,334
In the end I did it myself.

422
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:19,093
I did it to myself...

423
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:20,414
and I almost died.

424
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:24,413
And he didn't come back.

425
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:26,134
They don't. Why should they?

426
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,213
You know the words.

427
00:31:29,214 --> 00:31:30,373
You're a whore,

428
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:32,413
the baby's a bastard...

429
00:31:32,414 --> 00:31:34,854
but there's no word for the man
who doesn't come back.

430
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:40,733
One day...

431
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,054
on your wedding day...

432
00:31:43,254 --> 00:31:45,054
you'll have a good man
on your arm...

433
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:48,653
and you'll say, "Polly...

434
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:51,094
"thank you for common sense."

435
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:01,934
This woman is in Cardiff.

436
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:05,054
We'll take the train tomorrow.

437
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:11,774
Go to the castle
afterwards for a treat.

438
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:10,694
I chose this place because it is
outside both our jurisdictions.

439
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:13,734
Do you want tea?

440
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:18,093
Inspector, I responded
to your invitation

441
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:21,333
because I want us
to understand each other.

442
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,814
I am a businessman.

443
00:33:23,894 --> 00:33:26,214
I want to make my business
successful.

444
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:30,893
And I want my city
to run peacefully.

445
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:33,974
Well, if the city is peaceful,
business can thrive.

446
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,694
So we are on the same side?

447
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:41,174
I think perhaps we could be.

448
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:57,054
How can we be on the same side
when I see things like this?

449
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:06,133
My men found this in the bedroom
of a known communist.

450
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:08,854
It has your sister's name on it.

451
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:14,093
It was obvious she had been
sleeping in his bed.

452
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:19,333
Are you also in bed with
the communists, Mr Shelby?

453
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:22,373
I do not share their fantasy.

454
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:27,453
And, as for my sister, I have
already dealt with the situation.

455
00:34:27,454 --> 00:34:30,814
Freddie Thorne is at the very
top of my list. So cross him off.

456
00:34:32,054 --> 00:34:34,254
He won't be returning to the city.

457
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:37,974
I'll make him part of our deal.

458
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,094
What "deal"?

459
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:49,453
You and your Specials will leave
my businesses alone from now on.

460
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,013
No more raids into our territory,
no more smashing up pubs

461
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,773
and no more lifting my runners.

462
00:34:54,774 --> 00:34:58,093
You will turn a blind eye to
all my gambling operations.

463
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:01,773
Also, I am planning an expansion.

464
00:35:01,774 --> 00:35:03,773
Onto the racetracks.

465
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:07,013
I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.

466
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:10,693
He runs most of the legal track-side
betting outside of London.

467
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,093
He has policemen on his payroll.

468
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:16,413
I want you to put in a word with
the Chief Inspector at

469
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:21,814
Gloucestershire that his men should
leave me alone when I make my move.

470
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,173
Forgive me.

471
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:26,773
I don't seem to have a pen

472
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,494
to write down this rather
long list of demands.

473
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,534
And what do I get in return?

474
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,134
I have what you're looking for.

475
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:46,614
I have the guns.

476
00:35:48,414 --> 00:35:50,053
What guns?

477
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:52,374
I'm not here to play games...
Wait, wait.

478
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:05,533
25 Lewis machine guns,

479
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:09,173
50 carbines,
10,000 rounds of ammunition -

480
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:11,613
all in a crate bound for Libya,

481
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:14,734
stolen from the BSA
factory proofing bay.

482
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:19,253
I'm guessing they sent you to
Birmingham to get those guns back.

483
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:22,254
Well, it's me that has them.

484
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:28,333
I have left word with men I trust
that if I am taken into police

485
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:32,413
custody for whatever reason, those
guns will be shipped to Liverpool.

486
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:35,093
From there they will be sent
directly to Belfast

487
00:36:35,094 --> 00:36:39,253
and sold to the
Irish Republican Army.

488
00:36:39,254 --> 00:36:42,093
All your good work in Ireland
would be undone.

489
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:44,653
Each stolen weapon is
numbered and marked.

490
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:46,933
If I sell them to the IRA,
it won't be long

491
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:49,053
before Mr Churchill finds out.

492
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,053
I imagine you got into enough
trouble over

493
00:36:51,054 --> 00:36:53,573
the burning of
the King's photographs.

494
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:55,853
That was just a taster.

495
00:36:55,854 --> 00:37:01,374
If those guns reach Belfast,
your life in the force is over.

496
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,813
When I have achieved what
I have set out to achieve,

497
00:37:05,814 --> 00:37:08,533
I will let you know
where to find the guns.

498
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:12,134
You'll be a hero.
You'll probably get a medal.

499
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:16,653
I'm a fair man.

500
00:37:16,654 --> 00:37:18,654
It's a fair offer.

501
00:37:20,454 --> 00:37:22,014
Do we have a deal?

502
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:32,653
I need an answer.

503
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:33,694
Right now.

504
00:37:38,694 --> 00:37:40,374
Very well.

505
00:37:42,454 --> 00:37:45,734
But I'd prefer
if we don't shake hands on it.

506
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:02,533
Now why would I shake
the hand of a man who didn't even

507
00:38:02,534 --> 00:38:04,134
fight for his country?

508
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:49,054
Grace.

509
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:57,974
I have new information.

510
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:04,333
'Thomas Shelby is now
the beginning, the middle'

511
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,934
and the end of your mission.

512
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:19,974
So what shall I do?

513
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:26,253
It hurts me as much as it
would a father sending his own

514
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:28,814
daughter into a whorehouse but...

515
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:36,213
no matter how repugnant it may be,
you must do everything

516
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:41,853
you can to get close to him and...

517
00:39:41,854 --> 00:39:44,054
find out where the guns are hidden.

518
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:50,214
Of course, when I say everything,
I don't mean...

519
00:39:51,694 --> 00:39:55,014
You underestimate me in every way.

520
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,294
Here.

521
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:19,333
'You are now active
in a military operation'

522
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,334
on behalf of the Crown.

523
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:26,534
I wish to God
circumstance hadn't chosen you.

524
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:31,053
It's what I'm trained for.

525
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,054
I'm late for my shift.

526
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,014
Grace...

527
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,254
my heart is with you.

528
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:43,893
Tom. Tom!

529
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:48,214
Tom, you better come quick. Tom!

530
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:16,733
Curly, tell me.

531
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,134
It's a curse, Tom.

532
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:23,053
Curly, Curly, shh, shh.

533
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:24,973
Curly, Curly.

534
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:26,253
Tell me.

535
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:29,133
Tell me, Curly, what's
wrong with your horse?

536
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:31,213
You bought her at the fair
in bad feeling.

537
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:33,173
The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof,

538
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:35,574
got an old woman to put a spell...

539
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,334
So those Lee bastards cursed her.

540
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:47,213
Whatever it is, he says
it's spread to the other feet.

541
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:50,213
It's going to his heart
by tomorrow, I'd say.

542
00:42:50,214 --> 00:42:54,414
Seen curses like this twice.
Can't take them back, Tom. No.

543
00:42:55,454 --> 00:42:57,533
I told you, Tommy.

544
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,694
Better enemies to have than
black-blood Gypsies.

545
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:05,494
Get out.

546
00:43:07,014 --> 00:43:08,894
Get out, Curly.

547
00:43:14,494 --> 00:43:15,934
I'm sorry.

548
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:56,933
We're closed, Mr Shelby.

549
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,934
Just get me a drink.

550
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,294
Should I leave you alone?

551
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:18,533
I came here for company.

552
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,333
Where's Harry?

553
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:21,814
He took the night off.

554
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:26,534
He went to the pictures.

555
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:34,974
How's your beautiful horse?

556
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,934
I just put a bullet in his head.

557
00:44:51,134 --> 00:44:52,414
Was he lame?

558
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:58,014
He looked at me the wrong way.

559
00:44:59,214 --> 00:45:02,814
It's not a good idea to look at
Tommy Shelby the wrong way.

560
00:45:07,694 --> 00:45:10,053
What a waste. Yeah.

561
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:12,334
A waste is what it is.

562
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:20,054
You know, in France...

563
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:27,694
In France,
I got used to seeing men die.

564
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:31,974
I never got used to
seeing horses die.

565
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:35,454
They die badly.

566
00:45:41,854 --> 00:45:45,053
I dug out a dress like you asked.

567
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:46,534
Thanks.

568
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:51,254
Is it Cheltenham
you're talking about?

569
00:45:58,414 --> 00:46:01,013
Cheltenham's a grand affair,
is it not?

570
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:02,493
The King will be there.

571
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:03,893
King George?

572
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:04,854
No.

573
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:07,933
King Billy Kimber...

574
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:09,574
and all his men.

575
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:14,013
And what must I do?

576
00:46:14,014 --> 00:46:16,574
For two pounds, you'll do
what I ask you to do.

577
00:46:18,014 --> 00:46:19,734
I want three.

578
00:46:21,174 --> 00:46:24,494
If I'm meeting a King,
I won't be wearing a cheap dress.

579
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:30,173
And I asked you to let me sing.

580
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:31,774
That's part of the deal now too.

581
00:46:33,054 --> 00:46:34,454
Since when?

582
00:46:36,414 --> 00:46:38,454
Since you nearly smiled.

583
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45,653
Saturday nights, open and easy.

584
00:46:45,654 --> 00:46:48,093
Everyone gets to sing their song
just like we did in Dublin.

585
00:46:48,094 --> 00:46:50,453
You never worked in Dublin...

586
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:52,973
so don't lie to me.

587
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:56,773
I asked around about that pub
you said you used to work in.

588
00:46:56,774 --> 00:46:59,293
I have friends over there.

589
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:01,494
No-one has heard of you.

590
00:47:07,614 --> 00:47:10,013
My guess is...

591
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:14,054
you're a girl from a good family
who got herself pregnant.

592
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:19,533
It's not something I want known.

593
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:24,173
And bringing a child into the world
alone ruined your life.

594
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,374
Right?

595
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:31,293
So I'm right...

596
00:47:31,294 --> 00:47:33,973
and Polly is wrong.

597
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:36,293
Right about what?

598
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:37,934
It doesn't matter.

599
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:41,773
It looks like it matters to you.

600
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:44,214
Family business.

601
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:49,294
You won't tell anyone my secret.

602
00:47:50,574 --> 00:47:53,214
Do you think I tell people things?

603
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:58,494
So what do you sing?

604
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,454
Anything you want. Right.

605
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:05,174
Get up on a chair.

606
00:48:14,454 --> 00:48:16,134
Happy or sad?

607
00:48:19,494 --> 00:48:20,894
Sad.

608
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:23,613
OK.

609
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:27,853
But I warn you,
I'll break your heart.

610
00:48:27,854 --> 00:48:29,734
Already broken.

611
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:40,213
# In a neat little town
they call Belfast

612
00:48:40,214 --> 00:48:43,894
# Apprentice to trade I was bound

613
00:48:44,934 --> 00:48:50,933
# Many an hour's sweet happiness

614
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:56,973
# Had I spent in that
neat little town

615
00:48:56,974 --> 00:49:02,413
# A sad misfortune came over me

616
00:49:02,414 --> 00:49:06,734
# Which caused me to stray
from the land

617
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:15,854
# Far away from my
friends and relations

618
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:24,733
# Betrayed by the black velvet band

619
00:49:24,734 --> 00:49:29,573
# Her eyes, they shone like diamonds

620
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:33,734
# I thought her the queen
of the land

621
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:41,573
# And her hair,
it hung over her shoulder

622
00:49:41,574 --> 00:49:48,214
# Tied up with
a black velvet band. #

623
00:50:07,494 --> 00:50:10,653
You OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

624
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:14,613
I think there are some carriages over
there that are going to be empty but...

625
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:16,214
Jesus.

626
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:19,493
Freddie?

627
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,174
You came back?

628
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:25,493
I got a tip-off.

629
00:50:25,494 --> 00:50:27,093
Freddie, Tommy will kill you.

630
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:29,173
It was Tommy who tipped me off.

631
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:32,213
Maybe he's got half a heart
after all.

632
00:50:32,214 --> 00:50:34,573
Tommy got a message to me.

633
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:39,213
It said "Get out of town
and take her with you."

634
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:40,814
So...

635
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,894
Ada Shelby...

636
00:50:48,574 --> 00:50:50,014
will you marry me?

637
00:50:51,454 --> 00:50:54,574
Yes.

638
00:50:56,174 --> 00:50:57,574
Yes.

639
00:51:12,854 --> 00:51:16,213
Right, get on that bloody train
and get out of here.

640
00:51:16,214 --> 00:51:18,733
Come on, both of you.
Freddie, come on.

641
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:23,173
Freddie, Cardiff's OK.
Anywhere but here's OK.

642
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:25,454
We're not going anywhere, Ada!

643
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:31,093
We're going to stay here
and we're going to marry here.

644
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:33,254
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby!

645
00:51:42,814 --> 00:51:47,053
# Give me your smile

646
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:52,293
# The love light in your eyes

647
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:55,813
# Life could not hold... #

648
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:58,493
Shuffle these cards... Terms of
play, John boy, terms of play.

649
00:51:58,494 --> 00:52:00,253
Go and play snap with Finn.

650
00:52:00,254 --> 00:52:01,653
Did you want whiskey as well?

651
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:03,733
No, just beer.

652
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:06,854
Why no whiskey, Tommy?
Are you expecting trouble?

653
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:13,053
Jesus Christ, Tommy, what the
hell made you let them sing?

654
00:52:13,054 --> 00:52:15,493
They sound like they're
strangling cats out there.

655
00:52:15,494 --> 00:52:18,573
All right, 20 to play. Come on.

656
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:22,613
What did make you
change your mind though, Tommy? Mmm?

657
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:25,813
Yeah, I mean,
it's about time, Tommy.

658
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:27,853
Time for what?

659
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,413
Time you took yourself a woman.

660
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,573
Just play the bloody hands.

661
00:52:32,574 --> 00:52:36,533
You stay the way you are, Tommy.
Remember what Dad used to say -

662
00:52:36,534 --> 00:52:38,493
"Fast women and slow horses...

663
00:52:38,494 --> 00:52:41,493
"..will ruin your life."

664
00:52:41,494 --> 00:52:43,133
Coppers.

665
00:52:43,134 --> 00:52:44,454
No.

666
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:48,813
# Come, Josephine,
in my flying machine

667
00:52:48,814 --> 00:52:52,933
# Up she goes

668
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:55,054
# Balance yourself like a bird... #

669
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:08,653
Holy shit.

670
00:53:08,654 --> 00:53:10,134
It's Billy Kimber.

671
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:22,134
Is there any man here named Shelby?

672
00:53:29,014 --> 00:53:33,374
I said,
is there any man here named Shelby?

673
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:41,293
Harry, get these men a drink.

674
00:53:41,294 --> 00:53:43,494
Everyone else, go home.

675
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:58,013
You, go home.

676
00:53:58,014 --> 00:54:00,774
But Mr Fenton said...
I said go home.

677
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:07,053
I've never approved of women in pubs
but when they look like that...

678
00:54:07,054 --> 00:54:12,013
You said you wanted men called
Shelby. You've got three of them.

679
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:15,013
Right, I'd never heard of you,
then I did hear of you,

680
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:18,454
some little Didicoy razor gang.
I thought to myself, so what?

681
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,813
But then you fuck me over

682
00:54:21,814 --> 00:54:24,534
so now you have my
undivided attention.

683
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:30,173
By the way, which one am I
talking to? Who's the boss?

684
00:54:30,174 --> 00:54:31,613
Well, I'm the oldest.

685
00:54:31,614 --> 00:54:34,333
Ha... clearly.

686
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:35,934
Are you laughing at my brother?

687
00:54:38,614 --> 00:54:41,133
Right, he's the oldest,
you're the thickest.

688
00:54:41,134 --> 00:54:43,773
I'm told the boss is called Tommy
and I'm guessing that's you

689
00:54:43,774 --> 00:54:46,934
cos you're looking me up and down
like I'm a fucking tart.

690
00:54:48,414 --> 00:54:50,294
I want to know what you want.

691
00:54:51,494 --> 00:54:53,933
There were suspicious betting
patterns at Kempton Park.

692
00:54:53,934 --> 00:54:56,613
A horse called Monaghan Boy.

693
00:54:56,614 --> 00:54:59,853
He won by a length twice
and then finished last

694
00:54:59,854 --> 00:55:02,013
with £3,000 bet on him.

695
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:03,854
Which one am I talking to?

696
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,173
Which one of you is the boss?

697
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:07,933
I am Mr Kimber's advisor
and accountant.

698
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,813
And I'm the fucking boss, OK?

699
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:14,413
Right, end of parley, you fixed
a race without my permission.

700
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:19,293
You fucking Gypsy scum what
live off the war pensions of these

701
00:55:19,294 --> 00:55:21,373
poor old Garrison Lane widows!

702
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:22,773
That's your level!

703
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:26,333
I am Billy Kimber, I run the races

704
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:27,493
and you fixed one of them

705
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:30,014
so I'm going to have you shot
against a post.

706
00:55:31,414 --> 00:55:33,294
Mr Kimber.

707
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:38,454
Look at it.

708
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:42,933
That is my name on it.

709
00:55:42,934 --> 00:55:44,294
It's from the Lee family.

710
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:48,854
You are also at war with the Lees,
Mr Kimber, am I right?

711
00:55:52,774 --> 00:55:55,613
The Lees are attacking your bookies
and taking your money.

712
00:55:55,614 --> 00:55:57,613
Your men can't control them.

713
00:55:57,614 --> 00:55:59,054
You need help.

714
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:04,133
Perhaps we should listen to what
Mr Shelby has to say.

715
00:56:04,134 --> 00:56:06,893
Before we make our decisions.

716
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:10,973
Right, the Lees are doing
a lot of talking at the fairs.

717
00:56:10,974 --> 00:56:12,413
They have a lot of kin.

718
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:14,533
They're saying the racetracks are
easy meat

719
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:16,573
because the police are
busy with strikes.

720
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:20,533
Now, we have connections.
We know how they operate.

721
00:56:20,534 --> 00:56:23,573
You have muscle.

722
00:56:23,574 --> 00:56:26,694
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

723
00:56:28,854 --> 00:56:32,973
Mr Kimber, perhaps we should take
some time for reflection.

724
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:36,573
Possibly make arrangements
for a second meeting.

725
00:56:36,574 --> 00:56:39,213
I admire you, Mr Kimber.

726
00:56:39,214 --> 00:56:44,213
You started with nothing
and built a legitimate business.

727
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:48,334
It would be an honour to work
with you, Mr Kimber.

728
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,413
Nobody works with me.

729
00:56:52,414 --> 00:56:54,814
People work for me.

730
00:56:59,414 --> 00:57:01,494
Pick it up, pikey.

731
00:57:11,614 --> 00:57:14,054
Sit. Sit down.

732
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:23,653
That's for your ceiling.

733
00:57:23,654 --> 00:57:25,534
Thank you, Mr Kimber.

734
00:57:29,414 --> 00:57:31,773
We will be at Cheltenham.

735
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:33,334
As will I.

736
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:57,013
So you picked a fight with
the Lees on purpose.

737
00:57:57,014 --> 00:58:01,253
Tommy, we can't mess with
Billy fucking Kimber.

738
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:03,573
Get yourself a decent haircut, man.

739
00:58:03,574 --> 00:58:05,414
We're going to the races.

740
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:41,323
