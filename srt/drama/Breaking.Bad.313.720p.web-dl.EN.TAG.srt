1
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,070
- Hello again.
- Hi!

2
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,575
I hope we're not too late.

3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,045
No, no.
Perfect timing.

4
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,679
Stan, this is my husband Walt.

5
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:52,414
- Hi. Good to meet you, Walt.
- Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,749
- Sandia Laboratories?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:57,472
I hear some pretty fascinating
stuff goes on out there.

8
00:00:58,031 --> 00:00:59,421
You know...

9
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:01,269
Working on anything
you can talk about?

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,755
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,993
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

12
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:10,074
But giant space lasers?
Now, that sounds cool.

13
00:01:10,673 --> 00:01:12,668
I'll have to bring it up
at our next staff meeting.

14
00:01:12,793 --> 00:01:15,298
- Just remember I get a cut.
- All right, that's a deal.

15
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,732
So this is it, honey.
What do you say?

16
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,953
- Do you want to take a tour?
- Sure.

17
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:25,017
Look, how about I give
y'all some privacy?

18
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:28,042
I'll go out to the car
and make a few calls.

19
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,579
Take as much time as you need.

20
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,269
- All right. Good.
- Okay. Thanks.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,793
He's actually a nice guy.
He doesn't push.

22
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:41,486
So, as you can see, there's...

23
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,389
there's a kind of flow
going on here.

24
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:45,103
It's a nice big living room.

25
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:49,010
And this is the dining area.

26
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,394
- The dining area. Right.
- Yes.

27
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:52,793
And...

28
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,899
- It's got a pool.
- Oh, pool is nice.

29
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,969
Backyard could be a little bigger.

30
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,328
And...
there's a breakfast bar

31
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,873
kind of dealie here which is nice.

32
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,877
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious

33
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:12,898
and, you know,
got good appliances, and...

34
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,582
How many bedrooms?

35
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,117
Three.

36
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,118
Told you.

37
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,981
There'll all pretty good size,
and...

38
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,426
this is the first one here.

39
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,873
And then there's
two more at the back.

40
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,143
Only three bedrooms?

41
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:29,161
I think we're gonna need at least five.
Don't you think?

42
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:30,034
Five?

43
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:31,922
What?

44
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:35,133
Do I look like I'm about
to drop a litter? Dude.

45
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,317
No, we'll have three kids
total, eventually.

46
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,957
But we'll need
a spare room for a study

47
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:44,982
so that I could work at home
and you can write.

48
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:47,618
I don't...

49
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,370
I don't think this
is gonna be enough.

50
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,585
Okay.

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,151
What about a wine cellar?

52
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:56,553
I mean, we certainly
cannot be expected

53
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:58,374
to live without a wine cellar.

54
00:02:58,499 --> 00:02:59,714
Very funny.

55
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,717
I just think we need to set
our sights high is all.

56
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,294
At least higher than here.

57
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,597
This is a good neighborhood.

58
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:11,083
It's got a good elementary
and supposedly a very good high school.

59
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,284
And believe me... 'cause I have

60
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,974
definitely looked everywhere...

61
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:19,096
for our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

62
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:21,609
Then let's stretch our price range.

63
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,354
Truly.
I mean, why

64
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,097
why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

65
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,685
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

66
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,054
I'm serious.

67
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:34,705
Come on.

68
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,857
Why be cautious?

69
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,032
We've got nowhere to go but up.

And then what?

77
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:06,724
I'm gonna need some...

78
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:09,588
some kind of assurance.

79
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:13,920

81
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,679
Walter,

82
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:13,753
you've been busy.

83
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,891
You want to put your arms out
to the sides for me, if you would?

84
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,039
{\pos(192,210)}You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

85
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,840
{\pos(192,210)}I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

86
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,077
{\pos(192,210)}I need my sleep.

87
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,084
{\pos(192,210)}You said no half measures.

88
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:51,138
{\pos(192,210)}Funny how words can be
so open to interpretation.

89
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:55,494
You get your car fixed?

90
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,643
Not yet.

91
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,097
You're gonna want
to get your car fixed.

92
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,289
Let's see how this goes first.

93
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,485
Has your condition worsened?

94
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:42,319
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition,

95
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:44,862
- has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

96
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,667
Is there a ringing in your ears?

97
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:50,695
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

98
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:53,714
{\pos(192,210)}I'm quite well, thank you.

99
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,588
{\pos(192,210)}Clearly you are not.

100
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,771
{\pos(192,210)}No rational person
would do as you have done.

101
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:02,835
Explain yourself.

102
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,497
{\pos(192,210)}My partner was about
to get himself shot.

103
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,671
{\pos(192,210)}I intervened.

104
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,506
{\pos(192,210)}Some worthless junkie...

105
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:17,534
For him you intervene
and put us all at risk?

106
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:21,287
{\pos(192,210)}Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours?

107
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,131
{\pos(192,210)}That's right.
He couldn't.

108
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:27,318
He was angry because
those two dealers of yours

109
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,538
had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

110
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,252
I heard about it.

111
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:34,393
He should have let me
take care of them.

112
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:35,854
Maybe.

113
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:39,956
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

114
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,807
Are you asking me

115
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:48,357
if I ordered the murder of a child?

116
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,985
I would never ask you that.

117
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,099
Where is Pinkman now?

118
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:04,648
I wouldn't know.

119
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,202
A couple of time zones
away, at least.

120
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:11,805
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

121
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,664
He has enough money to last forever.

122
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,709
He knows he needs to keep moving.

123
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,135
You'll never find him.

124
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:20,793
I don't know, Walt.

125
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,596
It's what I do, after all.

126
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,360
He's out of the picture.

127
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,779
I saved his life.
I owed him that.

128
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,847
But now he and I are done,

129
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:35,541
which is exactly what
you wanted, isn't it?

130
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,292
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man,

131
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:47,399
so if I may, I would like
to review options with you

132
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:50,755
of which it seems
to me you have two.

133
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,225
Option A...

134
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:55,971
you kill me right here and now.

135
00:10:56,649 --> 00:10:58,774
Apparently, I have made
that very easy for you.

136
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,391
You can kill me... no witnesses...

137
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,518
and then spend the next
few weeks or months

138
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,724
tracking down Jesse Pinkman,
and you kill him too.

139
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:11,637
A pointless exercise,
it seems to me.

140
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,312
But that is Option A.

141
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,424
What is Option B?

142
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,893
I continue cooking.

143
00:11:17,686 --> 00:11:19,698
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

144
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,297
We forget this ever happened.

145
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:25,300
We consider this a lone hiccup

146
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:26,976
in an otherwise

147
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,905
long and fruitful

148
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,313
business arrangement.

149
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,667
I prefer Option B.

150
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,893
You'd need a new assistant.

151
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:46,245
I could get right on that.

152
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,562
This time, I choose.

153
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:06,283
Your car.

154
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,494
Get it fixed.

155
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,815
Really?

156
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:20,965
It's good to see you.

157
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:23,655
Thanks.

158
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,361
It's good to be back.

159
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,999
- Shall we?
- By all means, Gale,

160
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:34,018
let's cook.

161
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,846
What about that rhinoceros?

162
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,538
You think he'd make a good pet?

163
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,901
Don't you think if you called to him,
he'd come running for his supper?

164
00:13:52,203 --> 00:13:54,438
I'll bet he would.
I bet he'd come running.

165
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,458
You're silly, Pop Pop.

166
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,826
Well, a little.

167
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,628
But he'd probably
knock everything over.

168
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,397
Plus, there's that big nose of his.

169
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,799
That's not a nose.
That's a horn.

170
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:06,638
Is that so?

171
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,436
His real nose is little.

172
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:12,909
I learn all kinds of
things being with you.

173
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,542
Okay, June Bug, these are for you.

174
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,949
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

175
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,719
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

176
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,023
You're never too old for balloons.

177
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,312
Give me a hug.

178
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,648
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

179
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:34,821
- Bye, Pop Pop.
- Bye, baby.

180
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:42,916
Please. Please, no.

181
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,709
Chow, do you have anything
you want to tell me?

182
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:06,409
Thank God you're here.

183
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,979
They keep me prisoner.

184
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:09,314
They keep you prisoner.

185
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:11,716
I don't do nothing for them ever.

186
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,745
They try and make me.

187
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:14,952
I say no.

188
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,160
They steal my chemicals.

189
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:18,990
I can't stop them.

190
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,258
- I am businessman.
- You're a businessman...

191
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,027
The lady out front...

192
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:25,271
Lady, are you still there?

193
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,920
Ask her if she's still there.

194
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,164
She says yes.

195
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:45,834
How's her driving?

196
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,120
Driving. Is she good
behind the wheel?

197
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,556
Good. She's good driver.

198
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,492
Licensed? Dependable?

199
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,093
She has a Camry.

200
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:56,845
Good.

201
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:03,903
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

202
00:19:04,193 --> 00:19:07,697
I strongly recommend that you
return our calls next time.

203
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:10,275
So have her drive you
to the hospital.

204
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:16,664
She's gonna need her shoe.

205
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,326
Where did they cross?

206
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:30,901
Laredo, looks like.

207
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,725
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

208
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:36,620
But like you said,
it's cartel, all right.

209
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:40,950
Probing for weakness.

210
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:44,487
Well, they didn't find any.

211
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,549
What about Pinkman?

212
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:52,733
I'm making inquiries.

213
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:10,689
Done. That's two?

214
00:20:10,814 --> 00:20:12,814
All right.
Let's close it up.

215
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:22,472
Bring it down.

216
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:24,586
Ready?

217
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,811
Okay. We're good.

218
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,894
You can take your mask off now.

219
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,221
Does that guy ever leave?

220
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:57,568
When exactly did that start?

221
00:20:58,461 --> 00:20:59,704
It's new.

222
00:21:01,212 --> 00:21:02,262
We had a...

223
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:07,439
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

224
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:09,954
I'm sorry to hear that.

225
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:11,737
No, it'll be fine.

226
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,557
Things will continue to smooth out.

227
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:16,925
Yeah, it'll be fine.

228
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,969
By the way,

229
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:24,696
if you're at all worried
about working with me...

230
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,921
No, I'm not.

231
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:28,736
Because whatever
my shortcomings last time,

232
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:32,246
I intend for things to go
perfectly from here on out.

233
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:34,099
So, if there is...

234
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:35,807
Gale, you're great.

235
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:37,354
Seriously.

236
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:38,742
I just...

237
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:41,677
However you like things to be done

238
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,340
is exactly how we are gonna do them.

239
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:45,464
Period.

240
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:48,187
From here on out.

241
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:49,104
So...

242
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,510
please teach me.

243
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:01,207
Okay.

244
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:24,904
Gale.

245
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,587
It's good to see you.

246
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:27,712
Mr. Fring.

247
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:29,187
Wow.

248
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:31,339
- This is...
- I should have called first.

249
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:33,363
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

250
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:37,125
No, not at all.
Please come in.

251
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,064
Can I offer you something?
Crème de Menthe?

252
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,008
No, thank you.

253
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:47,889
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

254
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,239
It's no inconvenience.

255
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:56,201
I need to talk to you
about something...

256
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:58,455
something rather pressing.

257
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:05,290
If push came to shove,
I was wondering

258
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:09,248
how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

259
00:24:10,026 --> 00:24:11,995
You and an assistant.

260
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,990
Why would...

261
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,203
Why would push come to shove?

262
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:22,694
Has Walter ever talked to you about why
he got into this{\*particular} line of work?

263
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,275
I guess I assumed it was
because it pays so well.

264
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,691
Oh, it is, but specifically.

265
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:34,197
Has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

266
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,745
Oh. I'm not surprised.

267
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:40,720
He's a very private person.

268
00:24:41,954 --> 00:24:44,639
What exactly are
his health problems?

269
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,766
He's dying of cancer.

270
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,211
It is why he does this,

271
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:52,610
to provide for his family,
which he has accomplished.

272
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:55,175
They will never want for anything.

273
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,700
He's seen to that.

274
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:00,368
Well...

275
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:02,836
How long does he have?

276
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:06,712
That is very much the question.

277
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,310
He does not want to talk about it,
and every time I bring it up with him...

278
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:16,697
I don't know
that he's fully accepted

279
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:18,311
the reality of it.

280
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:21,366
And not to sound cold-blooded,

281
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:23,279
but I am running a business here.

282
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,490
No, I understand.

283
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:28,855
I have...
a very large investment in this.

284
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,927
There is so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down,

285
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:33,552
not even for a week.

286
00:25:33,922 --> 00:25:36,557
So you understand my concern

287
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:40,234
and my desire for continuity?

288
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:41,864
I do, absolutely.

289
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:45,736
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants,

290
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:49,673
assuming he's physically up to it.

291
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,458
But as he cannot or will not

292
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,310
tell me how long that might be,

293
00:25:56,749 --> 00:26:00,584
I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

294
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:04,065
The worst-case scenario.

295
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,163
I suppose if we had...

296
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:17,215
at least a few more
cooks together...

297
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,980
You don't think you're ready now?

298
00:26:21,502 --> 00:26:22,294
Well,

299
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:24,973
he is such a...

300
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,115
a master.

301
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,725
There's always more for me to learn.

302
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:37,959
But I'm thinking that if we had...

303
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:42,747
say, one or two more cooks?

304
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:49,301
One more...

305
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:52,923
I guess, would do it.
I suppose.

306
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,060
I believe in you, Gale.

307
00:26:58,396 --> 00:26:59,994
I know that when the time comes,

308
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,910
you will be ready.

309
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:18,016
What's up?

310
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:27,293
Walt?
Is there...

311
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,870
any particular trick

312
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:36,895
to purging the catalyst bed?

313
00:27:39,373 --> 00:27:41,523
No, it's pretty straightforward.

314
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,798
I'll show you when we get there.

315
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,872
Yeah.

316
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,939
Tell him I'm in conference.

317
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:25,153
- Can't you see I'm in conference?
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

318
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:27,996
I was hoping you could
help me out with an address.

319
00:28:28,469 --> 00:28:29,465
Which client?

320
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,790
Jesse Pinkman.

321
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:34,484
Jesse Pinkman in the phone
book Jesse Pinkman.

322
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:37,628
How would one track him down?
I wonder.

323
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,458
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

324
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:46,982
Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts.

325
00:28:47,107 --> 00:28:50,986
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you can get back to whatever{\*the hell} this is{\*exactly}.

326
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:54,461
What am I, eight-grade hall monitor?
"Current whereabouts."

327
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:56,024
Let me tell you something...

328
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:58,622
You are good right there.

329
00:29:00,223 --> 00:29:02,373
Now, let's both get comfortable.

330
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,134
Now, when I say
I'm looking for Pinkman,

331
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,109
we both know why, don't we?

332
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,488
And you pretending otherwise
only wastes my time

333
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:16,263
and serves to annoy me.

334
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,571
Mike, uh,

335
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,616
there are rules
to this lawyer thing.

336
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:23,018
Is that right?

337
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:23,935
Yeah.

338
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,822
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

339
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,088
And that's something
I provide for you.

340
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:31,094
So if I give up Pinkman, well,

341
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,961
then you're gonna be asking

342
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:36,793
"Old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy.
What's to keep him from giving me up?"

343
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,332
You see?
So then where's the trust?

344
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:43,492
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

345
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:47,918
Yeah, it's an argument.

346
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,042
So...

347
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:54,429
don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

348
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,586
Now tell me where to find him.

349
00:29:57,711 --> 00:29:59,711
You know it's the right thing.

350
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,409
I can't tell you, Mike.

351
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,070
All right, I...

352
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,492
Look, if I was to tell you,

353
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,329
I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

354
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:15,997
I'm sorry.

355
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:20,542
But who's to say I didn't write

356
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:22,679
the address down in my day planner?

357
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:25,999
Or on a scratch piece
of paper somewhere?

358
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,147
Who's to say I didn't
write down a location

359
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:32,078
strictly for my own
professional use?

360
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:37,549
Do not touch anything on my desk.

361
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:41,487
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

362
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:01,149
I'm just looking out for you,
that's all.

363
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:02,674
Like a mother hen.

364
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:06,906
Believe me, money laundering
ain't what it used to be.

365
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,420
God, do I miss the '80s.

366
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,425
Wasting your time.

367
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,856
I'm buying the car wash.
End of story.

368
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:16,822
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

369
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,831
Huh?

370
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:34,447
Was I right?

371
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:37,791
Where else are you gonna find
a {\*cash-only}business that's this much fun?

372
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:40,316
Unless we're talking
massage parlors,

373
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:41,976
and I don't see it.

374
00:31:42,587 --> 00:31:43,537
Shall we?

375
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:52,473
You ever actually play laser tag?

376
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,628
It's good cardio.
Plus you get to shoot at kids.

377
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:08,684
You got your bumper cars
over there down that way.

378
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:11,758
Got your arcade right here.
All the latest video games.

379
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:13,386
Snack bar is over there.

380
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,824
Nothing stopping you
from selling beer to the parents.

381
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,468
That's a whole new revenue stream.

382
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,365
All right, we're...

383
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,540
We're good.

384
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,600
Holy Christ.

385
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,225
We're good?

386
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,380
This constitutes good
where you're from?

387
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,855
My car is bugged.

388
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,339
I said maybe... maybe...

389
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,570
I'm being followed.

390
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:33,775
What the hell have
you gotten me into?

391
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,271
My very own P.I.
is threatening to break my legs.

392
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:38,465
That's like Thomas Magnum
threatening

393
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,825
that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

394
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:42,417
Over and above.

395
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,696
Service-wise,
this is over and above.

396
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,471
You and I survive this,

397
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:48,842
oh, I'm seriously
rethinking my pricing.

398
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:52,099
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

399
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,763
My guy's no dummy.
Right?

400
00:32:54,888 --> 00:32:56,911
So I give us maybe 24 hours before

401
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:59,524
he figures out
that address goes nowhere.

402
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,149
You guys do your thing.
Make it snappy.

403
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,238
I'll go see if they have Tetris
or something.

404
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,090
How are you holding up?

405
00:33:18,378 --> 00:33:19,170
You?

406
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:22,268
I got my old job back.

407
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,742
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

408
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,962
He's their boy, huh?

409
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,196
He's their boy.

410
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:33,219
How long you think you've got?

411
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:37,013
Well, he asks a lot of questions

412
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:38,620
about the cooking process.

413
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:41,748
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got

414
00:33:41,873 --> 00:33:45,370
that guy Victor watching me,
listening to every word I say.

415
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:48,583
Maybe the only thing
that's saving me

416
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,044
is Gale's fastidiousness.

417
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,288
Once he feels confident

418
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:55,613
that he knows my entire method...

419
00:34:02,088 --> 00:34:03,438
So what do we do?

420
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:09,324
You know what we do.

421
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:20,488
There's got to be some other way.

422
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:25,999
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

423
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,719
All right?

424
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:31,024
I mean, I can't believe
I'm saying that at all,

425
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:33,546
but for your family?

426
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,880
The DEA would love you.

427
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,161
All the shit you could tell them?

428
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:41,319
Federal Witness Protection,
that's a good deal.

429
00:34:41,738 --> 00:34:43,938
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.

430
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,079
I'll make it.

431
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:50,335
We had a...
We had a good run.

432
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:53,806
But it's over.

433
00:34:57,402 --> 00:34:58,602
Never the DEA.

434
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:05,486
The cook can't stop.
That's the one thing I'm certain of.

435
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:08,082
Production cannot stop.

436
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:10,055
Gus can't afford to.

437
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,875
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got,

438
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:17,679
then I've got leverage.

439
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,619
And leverage keeps me alive.
It keeps

440
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:22,527
you alive, too.
I think I can see to that.

441
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:27,306
If I'm the only chemist
that he's got.

442
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,769
I can't do it, Mr. White.

443
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:44,905
Like you said, I'm...

444
00:35:46,593 --> 00:35:47,693
I'm not a...

445
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:51,363
I can't do it.

446
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:59,059
I'll do it.

447
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,790
I'm gonna...

448
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,024
I'm gonna need your help.

449
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:08,449
I mean, they're watching me
day and night.

450
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,961
They never leave me alone
with Gale, not for a moment.

451
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:14,543
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

452
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,651
He's not in the phone book.
I can't find him on the Internet.

453
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,001
I can't do it in the lab.

454
00:36:20,126 --> 00:36:21,726
Victor's always there.

455
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,030
But if I could just...

456
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:29,520
shake Victor for even
an hour one night,

457
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,411
I think then that...

458
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:34,189
I may be able to...

459
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:40,111
make it look like an accident.

460
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,099
There's got to be some other way.

461
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:48,158
I'm all ears.

462
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:52,500
But when it comes down
to you and me versus him...

463
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,625
I'm sorry,

464
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:56,075
I'm truly sorry...

465
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:59,527
but it's gonna be him.

466
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,796
You are the only edge that I've got,

467
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:07,713
as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

468
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,618
But I need you to track him.

469
00:37:09,743 --> 00:37:11,193
Get me his address,

470
00:37:11,745 --> 00:37:13,295
and I'll do the rest.

471
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,655
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

472
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:30,829
Are you gonna save mine?

473
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:43,338
<i>Yeah.</i>

474
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:46,978
Please tell me you found him.

475
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:49,998
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard,</i>

476
00:38:50,574 --> 00:38:51,674
<i>Apartment 6.</i>

477
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:56,941
<i>You there?</i>

478
00:38:57,217 --> 00:38:58,009
Yeah.

479
00:38:59,084 --> 00:39:02,200
6353 Juan Tabo, Number 6.
Got it.

480
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:06,824
He's home?

481
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:08,326
<i>Yep.</i>

482
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,024
Anyone watching the place?

483
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:14,097
<i>No. Looks pretty much wide open.</i>

484
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:17,501
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

485
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:22,929
Tonight.

486
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,393
Once it gets dark.

487
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,539
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

488
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,487
<i>Please.</i>

489
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:35,786
<i>Go to the cops.</i>

490
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:09,814
We got a problem.

491
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:12,972
Some kind of chemical
leaking in your lab.

492
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:14,581
You gotta come with me.

493
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:19,998
I'll, uh... I'll follow you.

494
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:23,972
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

495
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:32,515
I don't know
if it's a barrel leak or what,

496
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:35,677
but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

497
00:41:39,724 --> 00:41:40,724
After you.

498
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,510
Walter, the sooner
you figure out what this is,

499
00:41:46,635 --> 00:41:48,435
the sooner we all go home.

500
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,292
Please don't do this.

501
00:41:56,345 --> 00:41:57,195
Mike...

502
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,292
You don't have to do this.

503
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:04,434
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do, Walter.

504
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:06,407
Downstairs.

505
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,098
I'll cook...

506
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:10,901
I'll cook for free.
And there won't be any more trouble.

507
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:11,936
I promise you.

508
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:15,078
If I could just talk to Gus,
I know I can make him understand.

509
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:16,741
If I can talk to Gus...

510
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,710
I can convince him, okay?
Just let me, please...

511
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:21,627
- Please let me talk to him!
- Shut up!

512
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:22,652
Shut up.

513
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:26,887
I can't do it.

514
00:42:27,362 --> 00:42:28,362
I'm sorry.

515
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,924
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

516
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:34,999
Okay?

517
00:42:35,124 --> 00:42:37,537
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been{\*the problem}.

518
00:42:37,842 --> 00:42:39,296
Without him, we would...

519
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:41,766
And he's in town, all right?

520
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:44,430
He's not in Virginia or wherever
the hell you're looking for him.

521
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:46,337
He's right here in Albuquerque,

522
00:42:46,462 --> 00:42:47,938
and I can take you to him.

523
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:50,201
I'll take you right to him.

524
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:55,312
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

525
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:56,847
{\*Right now.}You give me an address.

526
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,718
I don't... He moves.

527
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:01,185
He moves around,
but if you let me call him...

528
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:02,299
Please.

529
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:03,757
No, I just...

530
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,116
My phone. I'll just...

531
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:07,540
It's just my phone.
I'll call him,

532
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:09,641
and I'll have him meet me.

533
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:11,066
All right? Okay?

534
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:12,946
Okay?

535
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:54,408
Did you do it?

536
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,281
<i>Mr. White?</i>

537
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:00,802
<i>Did you do it?</i>

538
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:03,493
No, I didn't do it.

539
00:44:04,484 --> 00:44:05,922
<i>I can't now.</i>

540
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,906
- <i>It's gonna have to be you.</i>
- What?

541
00:44:10,568 --> 00:44:13,624
- No way, man.
- <i>Listen{\to me}. You're closer than we are.</i>

542
00:44:13,896 --> 00:44:15,259
You'll have {\*about}a 20-minute lead.

543
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:17,328
They've got me{\*at the laundry},
{\*and}they're going to kill me.

544
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:19,650
- Jesse, do it now! Do it fast!
- Bitch!

545
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,198
<i>Do it! Jesse!</i>

546
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:32,443
Just what the hell was that exactly?

547
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:34,111
You might want to hold off.

548
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,167
Yeah?

549
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:36,784
Why?

550
00:44:37,086 --> 00:44:39,638
Because your boss is gonna need me.

551
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:44,431
6353 Juan Tabo,

552
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,917
Apartment 6.

553
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,111
Yeah.

554
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:40,193
Hi.
How can I help you?

555
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,733
Take whatever you want.

556
00:45:50,451 --> 00:45:52,474
I have money.
I have...

557
00:45:52,995 --> 00:45:54,745
I got a lot of money.

558
00:45:56,168 --> 00:45:57,286
I have...

559
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,737
Please don't do this.

560
00:46:10,577 --> 00:46:12,239
You don't... You...

561
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:15,838
You...

562
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:18,748
You don't have to do this.
