Previously on <i>Prison break...</i>

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,900
MICHAEL:
We're losing the light! Go back!

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,900
You.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Is it your cell?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
<i>You are breaking out
of this prison, Mr. Scofield.</i>

6
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,450
And you're taking me with you.

7
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,965
So with this deal

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
what specifically are they
expecting from me?

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,400
They need to know everything.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,400
They want to confirm
that you have viable,

11
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,865
incriminating information

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
and that you can be
a cooperative witness.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,065
Show me the pictures.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,700
I can't show you
the pictures, man.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,300
She's dead, Michael.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,300
I thought we agreed it was best
for you to not come here.

17
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:49,600
I need to know how this delay
is going to affect things.

18
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,900
Four more days.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,300
If I'm out of here
by then,

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,300
I can still do it.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,100
I'll let the brothers know.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Michael.

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,600
You like this?

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,300
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,600
It's a special occasion.

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,165
My dad's coming today,

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,300
so I'm just gonna wait here
till he shows up.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,700
You look sharp.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Thanks.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
- LJ. Is he...?
- Alive.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,500
Giving us four more days.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, good.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
Listen, back at
the exchange point,

34
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,100
I saw three body bags.

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,265
You, me and LJ,

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,000
we weren't getting
out of there alive.

37
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,500
That's the last time
I get caught flatfooted.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
You do what you gotta do Linc,

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,700
As long as I take
care of my end, right?

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,900
Michael, I know you're angry
with me about Sara, but...

41
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:18,800
You lied.

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,000
I had to lie.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
Your son is my nephew,

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,400
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,165
But apparently...

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,300
...apparently you only think I
only care about myself.

47
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:38,800
I know you don't care
about yourself,

48
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:40,900
but you cared
about Sara.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,000
You loved her.

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
And I'm sorry.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,365
But LJ's my son.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,100
I- I couldn't
let anything happen to him.

53
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:48,100
You know that.

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,400
You used me, Linc.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,800
So I guess you and the Company
have something in common.

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,565
I don't know where he is.

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,700
I have tried every
number I have.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,300
Well, listen, I will check back with
Headquarters and see what they say.

59
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Never mind.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
I found him.

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,400
"Carter Blue Label".

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,765
You always had such...

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,700
...High-end taste
for a girl from Wheeling.

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,700
Since I paid for it...

65
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,500
You know how much I hate
to travel, Gretchen...

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,400
...but considering the mess
down here, I made an exception.

67
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,500
It was a mess before I got here.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
And it's time to clean it up.

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,100
We're ending this today.

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
Bang and burn.

71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,200
General, that was analyzed.

72
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:01,200
What you're asking for

73
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,265
is too dangerous,
not to mention

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
next to impossible
with the given time frame.

75
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:06,265
I remember

76
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,800
a substantial wire transfer
to an offshore account

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,800
that took the word
"impossible"

78
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,800
out of the equation-
or tell me,

79
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,400
did I hire the wrong person?

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,800
I am doing my job when I tell
you to seriously reconsider.

81
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,100
And now, I have to do my job.

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,200
I don't pay you to
be my advisor.

83
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:33,565
You're my operative.

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,900
You have your instructions,
now get it done.

85
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,065
Because if you don't,

86
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll make what happened
to you in Mosul

87
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:43,700
feel like a massage.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
WHISTLER: This was a
big mistake, Gretchen.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,900
You can't make a habit
of coming to Sona.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,300
I won't.

91
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Because we're going
with the bang and burn.

92
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,650
That's suicide.

93
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,865
We have more time.

94
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,500
My boss wants things
to move a bit faster.

95
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,200
Well- tell him
you can't pull it off.

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,250
I might get killed
if we do this.

97
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,200
And I might get killed
if we don't.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,365
Between you and me,

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
who do you think
I care about more?

100
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,300
Look at me, James.

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,800
See if you can tell
how serious I am.

102
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,900
If you don't play ball,

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,500
I will leave you in Sona to rot.

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,400
I promise.

105
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,665
Be ready by 5:00.

106
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,100
That's when it happens.

107
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
Everybody goes.

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,100
What about Scofield?

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,500
Kill him

110
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,900

Prison break
Season 03 Episode 08
"Bang and Burn"

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,800
MICHAEL (whispering):
Hey.

113
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,400
You know the consequences
if I'm seen talking to you?

114
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,800
The military's reinforcing
the bars on all the windows.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,965
Can you talk to the colonel,

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
get him to postpone
that for a few days? No.

117
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:46,565
After your performance
yesterday,

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,300
I have no further sway
with the colonel.

119
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, then I'm afraid
you've brokered your way

120
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,200
into an escape plan
that no longer exists.

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,800
I have an idea.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,100
SAMMY:
Lechero...!

123
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,800
Wait to hear from me.

124
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,300
What?

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Some of the men don't feel the
need to pay their debts anymore.

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,100
It's been one week, man,

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
and we lost three men.

128
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,600
Now, if we gonna keep Sona,
we're gonna need numbers.

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,900
I don't trust nobody here
right now, especially now.

130
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,500
I work with the men I have.

131
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,500
Really, brother?

132
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,365
You, me

133
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,500
and the gimp over there,
we gonna run this place?

134
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,100
I want to bring on
Cristobal.

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
He's solid, man.

136
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
One of them Darrien
ghetto boys.

137
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Bring him up.

138
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,800
But I promise you nothing.

139
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,400
Find me anything that can
sustain heavy RPGs

140
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:56,465
and small arms.

141
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,800
A Cougar, a Striker.

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Not gonna happen.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,200
I do have a call in to
a Sergeant York, but...

144
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:02,617
Yeah, that's not going
to cut it.

145
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,000
Call Suezamel,
put him on standby,

146
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,500
tell him we might need him.

147
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:07,400
Is there a problem?

148
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,900
We're doing this
at 5:00?

149
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Well, we could
wait until tonight

150
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,165
when our guys are
moving too fast

151
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
for our night vision
to work properly.

152
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:14,200
You could even tag along
if you want.

153
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,100
Get it done.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,800
Hello.

155
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,000
MAN: Yes, I'm trying to locate
the family of Mr. James Whistler.

156
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,000
I- I am his- I'm his wife.

157
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
Who's calling?

158
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,765
My name is Tommy Day.

159
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,300
I own the apartment building
Mr. Whistler rents from.

160
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,200
There's been a busted pipe
in his unit that's caused

161
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:56,600
some damage
to the apartment next door.

162
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,165
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,600
I think you have confused James
with someone else.

164
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,165
He's not renting
another apartment.

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,565
Oh, I assure you
Mr. Whistler is my tenant.

166
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,400
I couldn't find anyone
to contact after his conviction,

167
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:11,500
but when the mail came,
I checked his phone bill.

168
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,500
There were numerous calls
to this number.

169
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,010
If you could please come
to the apartment-

170
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,500
the address is 40 Abel Bravo
in Obarrio,

171
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:20,700
Unit 4.

172
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
(phone ringing) Tell
your men the Intel says

173
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,300
the Panamanians have
no access to SAM.

174
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah.

175
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,100
MAN:
There's been a development.

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,865
Hey.

177
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,000
The Company's giving us
four more days.

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,665
- Okay.
- Problem is

179
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,000
I, uh, I don't know
how we're getting out of here.

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,000
Lechero might have some ideas,
but I'm still waiting

181
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:06,200
to hear from him.

182
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,300
I'm sorry,
is this a bad time for you?

183
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,900
It's been an intense 24 hours.

184
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:13,965
I have things on my mind.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Yeah, like your last trip
to visitation maybe.

186
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,965
What, you're a spy now?

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,100
Forgive me if I'm wrong,
but she didn't really strike me

188
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,600
as the girlfriend type.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,300
She was Company.

190
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,000
After your failed escape,
she came to remind me

191
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:29,800
that I have a stake
in this, too,

192
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,500
which you seem to
have forgotten.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,050
So forgive me
if I don't jump for joy

194
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:36,100
when you say you're
working on a plan

195
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,100
that may very well fail again.

196
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,965
I've got to
get out of here,

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
and it's getting to the
point where I don't care how

198
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,000
Got what we
talked about?

199
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,300
You never met me.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,465
Oh, my God.

201
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
What the hell
is going on?

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,265
Shales...

203
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,600
What about Oscar Shales?

204
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,800
He... raped, killed, tortured.

205
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,565
I couldn't turn, turn him over

206
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,700
to some scumbag lawyer who 
was just gonna get him off or...

207
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,900
or... no, no, I just...

208
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,100
so I killed him.

209
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
And I felt... good.

210
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
I felt- I felt really good.

211
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,500
But then, you know,
came the visions

212
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,567
of Shales begging
for his life-

213
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,565
and I couldn't
get rid of them,

214
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
so I, I got these drugs
that kept me on an even keel.

215
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,700
And then when I got
to Sona,

216
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,600
I couldn't get my pills,
so I had to...

217
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,400
improvise.

218
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,100
Did you want me to
get drugs for you?

219
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,300
I assume that whoever
set this up must think

220
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:28,000
that I might have some value.

221
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,200
It's why you came back
for me.

222
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,500
me I came here to help a man
that I respect and care about.

223
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,500
And I appreciate that.

224
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
But I can't testify like this.

225
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,800
Please...

226
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,000
Please.

227
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,200
One inch of reinforced steel
on every window.

228
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Nothing would get
through those.

229
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,300
I'll figure
something out.

230
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
I know you will.

231
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,300
Listen, man, I'm sorry
about before.

232
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,100
Like I said, things
have been intense.

233
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,000
So much depends
on this working out.

234
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,800
My nephew's life depends
on this working.

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,065
I know it does.

236
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,800
I never asked-
how old is he?

237
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,700
Sixteen.

238
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, hell.

239
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
T- BAG:
Knocka knocka.

240
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
What do you want?

241
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,500
Me? I just came by
to slip something

242
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:42,665
into your mail slot.

243
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,465
It's from El Patron
himself,

244
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
but it was made
for your eyes only.

245
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,800
Grabby.

246
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,700
That don't look
like no invitation

247
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,465
to the Sona-Hawkins Dance.

248
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,200
What do you got cooking up
with Lechero, huh?

249
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:56,200
It's none of your business,
Theodore.

250
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,500
You want to keep secrets?

251
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,700
You want to treat me
like a pesky insect? Fine.

252
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,665
Just remember,
information, like crumbs,

253
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
always trickles down
to the vermin on the floor.

254
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,700
4:00?

255
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
It's a sketch of
Lechero's quarters.

256
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,700
To be honest, when a tenant
pays a year's rent in advance

257
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,100
and then gets locked up,

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,300
I normally rent
the place out

259
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,000
and double my
money, but, uh,

260
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,565
James was a good man.

261
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,500
I was hoping things would
turn out well for him.

262
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,400
Look, uh, Miss...

263
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,300
a lot of guys have a little
something on the side.

264
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,200
This apartment, I mean,
whoever he brought here,

265
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,100
doesn't mean
he didn't love ya.

266
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,200
You said you have James'
insurance paper?

267
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,465
Right on. Right on...

268
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,200
I'll, uh, I'll go get them.

269
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,300
Oh, God.

270
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,200
There's another door in here.

271
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,700
"4413."

272
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
4413, huh?

273
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
<i>What about Scofield?</i>

274
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,600
<i>Kill him.</i>

275
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,600
You know, if Lechero
didn't send this,

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,200
T- Bag might be setting
me up for someone.

277
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,265
I say we get
out of here.

278
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,100
I'm truly sorry that you got
caught up with my troubles, Michael.

279
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,900
Scofield

280
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,100
I take it there's
another code.

281
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,665
I'm the only one that knows it.

282
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,200
For a man who likes
keeping a secret,

283
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:06,567
choosing T-Bag as a go-between

284
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:07,865
might not be the smartest move.

285
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,400
Yeah, by the time he figures
it out, we'll be long gone.

286
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,700
Sammy's on his way back.
Let's go.

287
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,700
What the hell is this?

288
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,500
Underground tunnel.

289
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,165
The old administration
used it

290
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,200
to travel between cellblocks
A and B.

291
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,000
After the riots,
they moved us all to B.

292
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
And then the soldiers
came in,

293
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,700
blew this tunnel up.

294
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,200
MICHAEL:
Looks like someone already
tried to get through the debris.

295
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,200
I never planned to spend
my whole life in Sona.

296
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:09,900
Just didn't expect
it to end so soon.

297
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,700
You're the engineer,
though, right?

298
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,900
You can dig
our way out of this?

299
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah, me and a couple
of payloaders.

300
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,200
LECHERO:
Now, you listen.

301
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,900
You're gonna dig
out of this place.

302
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,500
We're not digging out,
but we might be diggin up.

303
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,500
Hello, Sofia.

304
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
Hello. Who are you?

305
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,200
Friend of James.

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Old friend.

307
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,600
Well, he isn't here.

308
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,100
I know where he is.

309
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
I can see why James loves you.

310
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,500
You are beautiful.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
If you keep sticking
your nose where

312
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:04,865
it doesn't belong,

313
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,800
I'm gonna make him miss you
very, very much.

314
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,900
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

315
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,400
Good

316
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,600
You don't need to
worry about this.

317
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
Now listen very carefully to me,
Sofia, and you won't get hurt.

318
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,000
I want you to go home
and do your hair

319
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:25,900
and paint your nails
and get all ready

320
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,665
for when James comes home.

321
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,200
You two will live
happily ever after.

322
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,000
What do you want from him?

323
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,000
See? You're not
listening already.

324
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:36,965
Don't get in
the way,

325
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,400
or I promise you things
will get very bad for you.

326
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
You are truly beautiful.

327
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,100
I hope you can stay that way.

328
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,500
Get the hell out of here.

329
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,665
<i>MICHAEL: All right,
if we can get through</i>

330
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,200
the ceiling, the foundation and
the earth on top of that,

331
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:18,000
we can make it out
into the middle of no-man's-land

332
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:19,900
and maybe hit the fence
before we get shot.

333
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,300
Yeah.
Well, we wouldn't want that.

334
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,700
Yes, but you can
dig out, though, right?

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,500
Based on gravity and the kind
of sand that Sona's built on,

336
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:30,100
we're gonna need some kind
of support brace for the tunnel.

337
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Or...

338
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
Or what?

339
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,500
The whole thing collapses
and we're buried alive.

340
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
Go on and relax, huh?

341
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,100
I'll get some rum.

342
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,700
<i>LECHERO:
How long will this take?</i>

343
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,000
Maybe two days.

344
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,450
I got to get upstairs,
estimate exactly where

345
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,300
in no-man's land
that tunnel's gonna let out.

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Where you going?
I'm meditating.

347
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,400
Just getting rum
for Cristobal and his boys.

348
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:08,600
Rum?! His boys?!

349
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,800
No, I said I'd meet
with Cristobal,

350
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,100
not every half-breed in Sona.

351
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,200
Well, they up there right now.

352
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:15,100
So, let's go.

353
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
- Let me just get some rum, now.
- No, man.

354
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
Them drink beer
like everyone else.

355
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:21,200
Look, man, offer
them something good.

356
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Don't make me look the fool.

357
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,200
The rum is for me, Sammy.

358
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,100
No

359
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700
You have a problem with that?

360
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,500
No, Sir.

361
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,900
Good Let's go.

362
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,300
Let's get back to work.

363
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,600
Hey, only Lechero has the code.

364
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,900
We don't need
a code.

365
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,600
Now, get inside

366
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
before Sammy comes back.

367
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,200
Alex?

368
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,100
Where's Agent Lang?

369
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
Agent... I don't know.

370
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,300
But what the hell's wrong
with you? What's going on?

371
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,765
I have a right to be nervous.

372
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,400
My life is on the line,
you know?

373
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,400
What are you
talking about?

374
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,500
You have given live press
conferences your entire life.

375
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:32,400
I've see you many times.
You're an old pro.

376
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,200
Now, splash some water
on your face.

377
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,200
The panel wants us there
right now, immediately.

378
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,900
- What?
- Get dressed.

379
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,650
Or would you rather
have me

380
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:40,700
drag your ass
back to Sona?

381
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,600
Water on the face.
Get your suit on. We're going.

382
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,065
Yeah, it's Sullins.

383
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,500
Uh, we're almost ready
to move here.

384
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:52,700
Where the hell is Lang?

385
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,100
No.

386
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,100
Where are we at?

387
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,050
Everything's in place.

388
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,565
Good. We've done our part.

389
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
Now it's time for Whistler
to step up and do his.

390
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Come 5:00 o'clock,
he better be ready.

391
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Tired feet
of concrete and rebar,

392
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,400
plus ten feet
of dirt and sand,

393
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,900
before we see sky.

394
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Are you all right?

395
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,400
To be completely honest...

396
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,200
No,

397
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,900
I have this thing
for, uh, confined spaces.

398
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Are you telling me
you're claustrophobic?

399
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:29,900
Ever since I was a...

400
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:30,500
boy.

401
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,750
Um, you know,
I need to be upstairs.

402
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:34,700
That's not really
an option right now.

403
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,500
Well, staying here is not
really an option for me, either.

404
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:39,400
I suggest you get
yourself together.

405
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:40,600
I just need some air.

406
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,065
What the hell's the
matter with you?

407
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,865
I need to get out of here;
I need air. Hey, you walk

408
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,300
through that door with Sammy on the
other side, you'll never need air again.

409
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:55,000
You don't understand-
I need to get out of here now.

410
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Why don't you tell me what's
really going on here, Whistler?

411
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:58,900
Why do you keep
looking at your watch?

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
What are you really up to?

413
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Scofield, the men are gone-
let's move.

414
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,665
I need your cell phone.

415
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,065
No, Sammy's on his way-
get out of here.

416
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,100
I have to call my brother. No, cell
phone stays with me. Now, get out of here!

417
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,350
<i>Well, just so that
we're clear, Americano,</i>

418
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:25,165
she's got no electricity
and no running water.

419
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,500
Septic's out, too, but there's
an outhouse in the woods.

420
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,300
- It's perfect. A hundred
bucks a month. - $200.

421
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,200
A hundred bucks a month.

422
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,100
Deal.

423
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
But I don't want growing
no drugs on the land.

424
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
No marijuana.

425
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,000
You got that?

426
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,500
- Welcome home, my friend.
- Thanks.

427
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,465
LINCOLN:
Listen, man, if you want

428
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,000
to get out of here, I'd get
it and Michael would, too.

429
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,700
- You've done more than
enough. - If I had a kid

430
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,800
in the same situation
as your son,

431
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,900
would you and your brother
walk out on me?

432
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,500
Yeah.

433
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,100
(laughs)
Here, this is good.

434
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Put it down there.

435
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,600
Okay, hold on.

436
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,400
You ready?

437
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Yeah.

438
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
<i>I hope this works, papi.</i>

439
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,100
All right, let's go.

440
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,400
McGrady.

441
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
I need your help.

442
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,000
Not now, bro- my father finally
got here; I'm gonna go see him.

443
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:44,500
Actually, uh,
I need his help, too.

444
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,050
What you want
from my old man?

445
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,165
I just need
someone to deliver

446
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,950
a message on the outside,
someone I can trust.

447
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,192
Hell, no. My papa's
straight as razor blade.

448
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:56,400
He don't get into kind
of trouble like you do.

449
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:58,100
- It's not trouble-it's just a phone call.
- No.

450
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
I love my father.

451
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,065
And I love my brother-
and if he doesn't

452
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,500
get this message, something
horrible's gonna happen to him.

453
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Something really
bad is going on.

454
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:09,100
Please.

455
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,200
Hello, son.

456
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,800
Papa.

457
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
You look very handsome.

458
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,100
Like your school picture.

459
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,000
<i>Gracias.</i>

460
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
I cleaned a guy's cell
for this shirt.

461
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,165
You should be in school now...

462
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,900
It's okay, Papa.
with your friends.

463
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
Papa, please,
don't get upset.

464
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,300
I- I have friends in here.

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,550
The American?

466
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:43,100
Yes. He's nice.

467
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,600
He keeps his word-
it's very rare in Sona.

468
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,900
And, uh...

469
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,100
he needs my help.

470
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
Thank God you're here.

471
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,200
Thought you might have
come a little earlier,

472
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,600
just to make sure I was okay.

473
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,900
I read the newspaper;
I knew you were safe.

474
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,000
I am for now-
but you might not be.

475
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,900
Now, listen
to me carefully.

476
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Promise me you won't go anywhere
near Lincoln Burrows today.

477
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:12,365
- Lincoln?
- It's just too dangerous

478
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,600
to be around him,
to be with him, to be near him.

479
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,300
Just go home
and stay there,

480
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,300
and I will call you tonight.

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's all I can say.

482
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:23,000
Do you understand?

483
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,350
Call me from where?

484
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:26,900
Do you understand me?

485
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,200
Yeah.

486
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Promise me.

487
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,000
Say it out loud.

488
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,700
I promise.

489
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,100
Why are you
so scared?

490
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,200
Because I can't
have you get hurt.

491
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,700
Because I love you...
more than anything in the world.

492
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,500
Do you?

493
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,400
Yeah.

494
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
James I got a call today

495
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
from a man who said
he's your landlord.

496
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,600
Talking about another apartment.

497
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Should I call him back?

498
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,900
Must have been
a wrong number.

499
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,467
He asked for you by name.

500
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,000
The man is clearly confused.

501
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,300
I don't know anything
about another apartment.

502
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:13,365
Sofia,

503
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,400
all I know is that you've got
to stay away from Lincoln.

504
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,800
Please.

505
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,300
(whispering):
Okay, James.

506
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,200
I'll wait for your call.

507
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,700
<i>McGRADY'S FATHER:
Here.</i>

508
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:33,700
I have this.

509
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I don't want to see it.

510
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,600
I'll... put it with the others.

511
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm not coming home.

512
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,300
Accept that.

513
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
You should go.

514
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,800
Make that call for my friend.

515
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,600
Happy birthday, son.

516
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,865
Maybe we should
pick up some locks

517
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,800
and secure the house.
- It can't have anything new on it.

518
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:18,700
(phone ringing) The place
needs to look abandoned.

519
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,600
Yeah?

520
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,200
McGRADY'S FATHER:
I have a message for you.

521
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,200
Don't come home for dinner.

522
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:26,900
Who is this?

523
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm supposed to tell you,

524
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,200
don't come home for dinner.

525
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,800
What?

526
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,100
When me and
Mikey were kids,

527
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,900
we had a code when
Social Services

528
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
were trying to get me
into juvie.

529
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,400
He's telling me
to watch my back.

530
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,865
What the hell
are you doing here?

531
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
SOFIA: Why haven't you
returned my calls or my car?

532
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:49,800
SUSAN B. (over phone):
You have him?

533
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,200
MAN: Yeah, he just
arrived back at his hotel.

534
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:54,900
But Whistler's girl
tracked him down.

535
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,065
And she's talking

536
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,700
to Lincoln and the Mexican.

537
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
After what she saw today, she
could be complicating things.

538
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,400
You have a directive?

539
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
<i>SUSAN B:
I warned her.</i>

540
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,765
Take them all out.

541
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,000
What will Whistler say?

542
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,300
I said take them all out!

543
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
<i>i don't care about
your boyfriend's apartment</i>

544
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:15,700
on the side,
I just don't care.

545
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
SOFIA:
No, I went there.

546
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,300
And a woman showed up;

547
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,900
she threatened me.

548
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,500
She knows James.

549
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,765
Susan.

550
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,965
You know her?

551
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,500
She's the one who has LJ.

552
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,000
Well, she took
something I found,

553
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,700
a passport.

554
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,100
It had James' picture
and birthday

555
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,400
but his name said Gary Miller.

556
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,300
Lincoln, I don't know
what's going on.

557
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll tell you
what's going on-

558
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:39,965
your boyfriend's a liar.

559
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,465
I told you that from the start.

560
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,900
James told me to stay away
from you today,

561
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:45,300
that it was dangerous.

562
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Let's go.

563
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,000
Pronto.

564
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,900
LINCOLN: I need to speak
to Michael Scofield.

565
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm his brother.

566
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,400
How you get this number?

567
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,300
He called me a few days back.

568
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,565
I- I didn't answer.

569
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,900
But, listen,
I need to speak to him now

570
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,700
Let's go.

571
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,800
You'll never guess
who that was-

572
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,900
Michael Scofield's brother.

573
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:30,900
Who calls me...

574
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,900
and who I call,

575
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,800
is my business.

576
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,000
Where are your friends?

577
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:42,600
I don't know.

578
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,965
Where are your friends?

579
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
I don't know,
Please don't shoot. Please.

580
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,600
Drop it.

581
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Why are you coming after us?

582
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Different day,
same problem, huh, Lincoln?

583
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,300
You know how it turned out
when LJ was in this position,

584
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:15,600
and today
is no different...

585
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,400
so be a good boy
and put down the gun.

586
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,165
Come on, Linc.

587
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
I know you've learned
your lesson.

588
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,300
You're right, I have.

589
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,665
<i>MAN:
For the record,</i>

590
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,365
this is an
international hearing,

591
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,500
requested by the
United States government,

592
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,300
for the purpose of hearing
testimony from one

593
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:00,900
Mr. Alexander Mahone.

594
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
You gotta be kidding me.

595
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So, Mr. Mahone,

596
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,450
when were you first contacted
by anyone

597
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:11,200
from the group referred to
as the Company?

598
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,100
They told me...

599
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,500
that if I didn't kill every one
of the Fox River Eight,

600
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,100
that they would
come after me.

601
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,500
They had all worked
with-with Scofield

602
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:23,765
on-on-on the escape,

603
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,500
so the Company wasn't sure
what they knew.

604
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,565
Mr. Mahone, I'm
going to ask you

605
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,700
to please keep your answer
related to the question.

606
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,400
It's-it's
all connected.

607
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:34,900
It's just... it's-it's a web.

608
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,100
And-and it's a web
that I got caught in.

609
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,650
And-and Lincoln Burrows
got caught in,

610
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,400
and Michael Scofield
got caught in.

611
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
SULLINS:
I, if I may,

612
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,965
I think what Mr. Mahone...

613
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,500
We're all just like
flies... was trying to say...

614
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:47,465
Thank you, Mr. Sullins,

615
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,800
but we're here to hear
from Mr. Mahone.

616
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,100
Now, we're going
to try this again.

617
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
When were you
first contacted

618
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:55,200
by the Company?

619
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
I cannot say.

620
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,700
You know...

621
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,700
they could be in contact
with you or-or-or...

622
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,100
you could be in contact
with them, you'd never know.

623
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:11,100
It's-it's... they could be
in contact with us right now.

624
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,065
I know...

625
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,300
it sounds crazy, right?

626
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,565
It's craz...
and...

627
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,200
and it would be, except for
the simple fact that...

628
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,500
it's true.

629
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,300
The government that I had
dedicated my life to

630
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,800
manipulate
and extorted me.

631
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,000
Blackmailed me.

632
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,700
So that I would kill for them.

633
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,700
And I did the things
that they made me do

634
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:37,100
so I could protect my family.

635
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,500
And so...

636
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,100
I would like to go home.

637
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,000
So can I do that, please?

638
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,300
Hey.

639
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,700
Where have you been?

640
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,665
I came looking

641
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,700
for scrap metal for the support
brace for the tunnel.

642
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:07,400
Really?

643
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,700
Looks like a pretty
tight squeeze up there.

644
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,965
You sure there's
enough fresh air,

645
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,965
or does the claustrophobia
come and go?

646
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,800
What's it like going, through
life always distrustful?

647
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,265
You tell me, James.

648
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,800
Hate to break up
the brouhaha, gentlemen,

649
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:24,800
but Lechero
would like to see you.

650
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Says it has something to do
with your big brother.

651
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,500
Give us a moment,
will you, Teodoro?

652
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,300
If your brother should ever
call my cell phone again,

653
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,900
you tell him you're
the one that's gonna pay.

654
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,500
(Lincoln): Yeah?

655
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,200
- You got the message.
- Yeah, you were right.

656
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:18,400
They just tried to
take us out.

657
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,800
I know.

658
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,900
Whistler got a visit
from the Company.

659
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:23,300
He's been acting
strange ever since.

660
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm telling you, Linc,
something's up.

661
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:26,100
Doing more than
acting strange, man.

662
00:36:26,135 --> 00:36:27,517
He just told Sofia
not to be

663
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,900
near me 'cause it's dangerous.

664
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,700
The Company's coming after us.

665
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,100
They don't need us anymore.

666
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,000
Here we go.

667
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600
They're breaking him out
on their own.

668
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,450
(over radio):
We're 100 yards from the target.

669
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,300
Keep your eyes open.
Let's get in and out fast.

670
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Come on

671
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,200
Damn!

672
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,800
Come on!

673
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,200
Come on!
Keep it coming!

674
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,300
Come on!
Hey!

675
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,500
Come on!

676
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,300
MAN:
Can't get a clean shot!

677
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,700
I'll get lower,
take 'em out!

678
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:37,227
Is that Scofield on the
roof with Whistler?

679
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,728
Is that really a question?

680
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,694
He's supposed to be dead.

681
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,200
(over radio):
Man down. Man down.

682
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,900
Let go!
I'm slipping.

683
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
(over radio):
We lost Whistler. Abort. Abort.

684
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,865
Mission failure.

685
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,500
Return to Base One immediately!

686
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,100
Alex...

687
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
I'm so sorry.

688
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,700
I'm going to have to
take you back to Sona.

689
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
You, get up.

690
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,400
<i>Vamos!</i>

691
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,400
Mr. Scofield,

692
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,200
there have been two escape
attempts in the past two days.

693
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,565
Somehow I don't think
it's a coincidence

694
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,300
that you arrived shortly
before they happened.

695
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,100
I had nothing
to do with that.

696
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,800
You've caused too many
problems here in Sona,

697
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,300
so maybe you shouldn't
be here in Sona.

698
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
<i>Llevenlo!</i>

699
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,400
Say good-bye to
Sona, Mr. Scofield.

700
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,700
<i>Vamos.</i>
