1
00:00:01,308 --> 00:00:02,589
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:03,909
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,329
The evidence says you did.

4
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,542
No, I was set up.

5
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,944
Put down your weapon.

6
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:12,894
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,110
I'm looking for someone, guy named Lincoln Burrows.

8
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:16,674
Man killed the vice-president's brother.

9
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,381
Why do you wanna see Burrows so bad anyhow?

10
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:19,469
Because he's my brother.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,551
I'm getting you out of here.

12
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:21,738
Impossible.

13
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,345
Not if you designed the place it isn't.

14
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:25,039
You've seen the blueprints.

15
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:26,600
Better that that.

16
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:27,830
I've got them on me.

17
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:29,863
You find out who's trying to bury him.

18
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:31,332
Nobody's trying to bury him.

19
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:32,610
The evidence was cooked.

20
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:33,983
There's a lawyer poking around.

21
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,313
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

22
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,400
Scofield!

23
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:39,873
Found you a new cellie. Haywire, get in here.

24
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,438
Someone found Fibonacci.

25
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,620
Who was this someone?

26
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,424
Now where is Fibonacci?

27
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:46,992
I give you that information, I'm a dead man.

28
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:47,697
Three.

29
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:10,879
On your feet!

30
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:13,601
What time is it?

31
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:15,664
Get up!

32
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,599
What's going on?

33
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:19,897
Bellick!

34
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,871
Bellick!

35
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,625
Bellick! No!

36
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:30,641
Bellick! Where are you taking me?!

37
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,157
Bellick! Bellick! No!

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,039
No! Bellick, don't!

39
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,891
Bellick, no! I got a month left!

40
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:38,789
Please! No! Bellick!

41
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,173
Bellick, no!

42
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,403
Bellick, please!

43
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:45,019
No! No! I got a month left!

44
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,991
Please!

45
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,769
No! Bellick!

46
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:23,874
Make your peace, Lincoln.

47
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:32,999
Let's get on with it.

48
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:22,104
Open 40!

49
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,416
Close 40.

50
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:47,101
Haywire. You ever thought of breaking out?

51
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:50,504
What the hell would I do out there?

52
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,442
Not be here.

53
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,289
Halfway houses,

54
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:57,570
psych visits, meds, checking in with a P.O.,

55
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,424
urine tests, keeping a job...

56
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:02,414
No.

57
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:04,769
Why you ask?

58
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:08,766
This guy was talking about it in the yard yesterday. I didn't know what to say.

59
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,849
Tell officer Bellick.

60
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,417
He'll make life easy for you, if, uh...

61
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:20,609
If what?

62
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:22,636
Your tattoos.

63
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,853
What about them?

64
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,390
What are they of?

65
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,333
What are they? Like, some kind of a...

66
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:31,880
They're just tattoos.

67
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:33,683
It's candy time, Haywire.

68
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,732
They think I have schizo-affective disorder with bipolar tendencies.

69
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,249
Think you got it?

70
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,409
Whatever.

71
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,639
Ah!

72
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,623
I take the pills, keep the quacks off my back.

73
00:05:02,472 --> 00:05:03,304
Bye, now.

74
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,186
Get out of the way.

75
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,313
You know, maybe they give you those things for a reason.

76
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,034
Yeah.

77
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,971
To keep me dull.

78
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:23,390
To keep me in their invisible freakin' handcuffs.

79
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:27,022
Seriously, though, those tattoos, they're beautiful.

80
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:30,357
You mind if I, you know, look at the whole thing?

81
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:32,442
I do, actually.

82
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,610
Why?

83
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,698
Yo! Stand clear!

84
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,738
Does there need to be a reason?

85
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:47,874
Sucre!

86
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,045
I ain't even talking to you, man.

87
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:31,060
What's the problem?

88
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:33,632
Nothing I can't handle.

89
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:35,620
Well, I knew there was a problem.

90
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,666
I could tell by looking at you from across the yard.

91
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,367
Hey, guys, didn't I say there was a problem?

92
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,401
So what's the problem?

93
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,663
You're looking at it.

94
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,529
What? Haywire?

95
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:51,724
Yep. That's my new cellmate.

96
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,582
That's a problem.

97
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,715
He doesn't sleep.

98
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:57,042
So, when do you dig?

99
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,461
I don't.

100
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:02,285
Hey, you and I are in bed now.

101
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,559
You  made me promise.

102
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,511
You said that we were going to get out of here.

103
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:09,510
You renege now, and I'm going to gut you.

104
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,359
So, you better take care of your business,

105
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,724
or I will take care of you.

106
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,236
Have a nice day.

107
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:04,915
It's really coming together, isn't it?

108
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,266
Yep.

109
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,049
You  think it'll be done in time?

110
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,286
Well, I figure, we still have the interior alcoves

111
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,045
and pilasters to do, which is no small task.

112
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:18,427
But, yes, I think so.

113
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,682
Listen, I have to say, I...

114
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:25,158
I really appreciate all the effort that you put into this.

115
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:31,618
I wish there was some way I could, you know, pay you or something.

116
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:33,994
There is one thing you could do for me.

117
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,338
My cellmate.

118
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:40,076
Ah, the inimitable Charles Patoshick.

119
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:41,048
Haywire?

120
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,422
Then you know.

121
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:43,884
Hold it right there.

122
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:46,684
Officer Bellick is in charge of cell transfers.

123
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:49,148
You're gonna have to talk to him about that.

124
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,194
I tried, but he seems to think we're a good match.

125
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:53,614
Has he threatened you?

126
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:56,083
Who, Haywire or Bellick?

127
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:56,973
Hmm.

128
00:08:57,492 --> 00:09:00,966
Unfortunately, unless there's some evidence of violence

129
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:04,456
or sexual predation between cellmates,

130
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:08,252
those kinds of requests fall on deaf ears around here.

131
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:12,962
Prison system's a little too crowded for requests based on personality.

132
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:16,135
It's not exactly Sandals out there.

133
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:20,824
Warden?

134
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,863
Sorry. Your wife is here.

135
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,165
What?

136
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,859
She's not supposed to be here till 4:00.

137
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,312
Becky, do not let her come in here under any circumstances.

138
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,738
She's not supposed to see this until our anniversary.

139
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:34,873
I'll be right out.

140
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,637
Hi, sweetheart.

141
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:45,193
You're early.

142
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,995
Uh... let's go eat.

143
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,703
You're acting funny.

144
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,591
I am?

145
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:52,188
What's going on in there?

146
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:54,565
Um... just going over some files.

147
00:09:55,313 --> 00:09:57,071
Becky said you were in a meeting.

148
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,345
This isn't Toledo all over again, is it?

149
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,276
Toledo?

150
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:05,028
How can you say that?

151
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:07,155
Then, you won't mind if I look.

152
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,194
Judy...

153
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:13,015
Warden, I'm not going to be able to cooperate.

154
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,629
I'd get killed if I did.

155
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,937
Johnson's still deciding.

156
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,716
Then, you and I are done.

157
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,598
You should have just told me.

158
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:29,786
Well, you know how anxious I get when you come around the inmates.

159
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:32,827
Becky, have a guard escort Johnson back to his cell.

160
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,697
I'll deal with him later. Come on, let's go eat.

161
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:53,342
What you doing here?

162
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:54,476
I'm  your attorney.

163
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:58,442
I'm representing you now.

164
00:10:58,721 --> 00:10:59,380
Hmm.

165
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,594
If that's all right with you.

166
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:07,364
Last time I saw you, you called me a liar.

167
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:09,212
Things have changed.

168
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,095
I believe you now.

169
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:29,162
I got in touch with Crab Simmons's ex-girlfriend Leticia.

170
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,007
She corroborated your story.

171
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,224
Will she testify?

172
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:36,836
She's missing.

173
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,222
I don't know. I think the Secret Service got to her.

174
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:41,401
Secret Service?

175
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,001
They've been poking around.

176
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,848
Soon as they show up, she disappears. What do you think happened?

177
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:50,291
Um... I didn't realize it was that high up, you know.

178
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,149
Do you know what we're up against?

179
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,100
I know it's a lot more than either of us can handle on our own.

180
00:11:58,381 --> 00:11:59,818
Project Justice.

181
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,894
Why have I heard of them?

182
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,762
All they handle is death penalty cases.

183
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:06,360
There's a guy there, Ben Forsik, I sent him copies of everything I had.

184
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,354
You can go there, tell him what you found.

185
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:11,255
Maybe we'll get enough to bring him on board.

186
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,436
Okay.

187
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,594
So, uh... how's Sebastian?

188
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,555
What do you mean?

189
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:26,794
Well, you being here. I mean... is he cool with it?

190
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,287
I haven't talked to him.

191
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,143
The, um...

192
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,836
The engagement's off.

193
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,107
Oh. I'm sorry.

194
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:44,462
You could at least say that like you mean it.

195
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:45,683
I do.

196
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:51,404
God, you always were a lousy liar.

197
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:52,829
Hmm.

198
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:54,267
Yeah.

199
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:00,457
I better get to Project Justice.

200
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,024
Veronica?

201
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:15,396
Thank you.

202
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:18,416
I didn't have a whole lot left.

203
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,888
You can thank me when I get you out of here.

204
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,112
Baby, it's me. Are you there?

205
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,157
Hello? Are you there?

206
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,625
Hey, if she is, she obviously don't want to talk to you.

207
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,183
It's Wednesday, babe.

208
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,706
You're gonna come around today, right?

209
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:55,575
Okay, I got to hang up now.

210
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:57,293
I got to go back in the block, but

211
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,464
you're gonna be here today, right?

212
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,724
I'm your man, baby, and I love you.

213
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,856
I do.

214
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,714
It's a pattern.

215
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:24,537
What did you say?

216
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,488
Your-Your tattoo-- it's a pattern.

217
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,518
You're seeing things.

218
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:39,325
Putting him in with Haywire is a low blow, Deputy.

219
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:42,227
What? The shrinks cleared Haywire for reentry into gen pop.

220
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,477
Besides, he's so doped up on meds, he's like a kitten these days.

221
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,506
A kitten who murdered both his parents.

222
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:48,906
Well, all due respect, sir.

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,340
If you give Scofield preferential treatment, it'll undermine your credibility.

224
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,425
I know you got a soft spot for the guy because he's got brains in his head,

225
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:59,898
and he's helping you with that contraption in there,

226
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,893
but the guy's a violent criminal.

227
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,604
He deserves punishment just as much as the rest of these guys.

228
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:06,170
You have been here long enough to know

229
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:09,176
that I'm less interested in punishment than I am in rehabilitation.

230
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:12,791
And sticking him in with Haywire is not rehabilitation in my book.

231
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,696
You delegated authority over gen pop to me, boss.

232
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:16,634
I know I did.

233
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,298
Then, you either got to let me do my job, or pass it on to somebody else.

234
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,734
Now, Brian, go easy.

235
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:25,200
There's a reason I'm giving you more and more responsibility.

236
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:32,506
When I retire, I'm recommending you to take my place.

237
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,643
Don't make me regret it.

238
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:38,507
All  I'm saying is, take another look at the Scofield situation.

239
00:15:38,582 --> 00:15:40,359
I trust your judgment.

240
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:43,036
Yes, sir.

241
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:56,905
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, hold up.

242
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:59,090
This is supposed to be an open visitation. Why are we doing it in here?

243
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,577
Ask your visitor.

244
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,318
What are you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

245
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:12,194
She's not going to be coming around here anymore.

246
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:13,231
Is she hurt?

247
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,115
No, no. She's fine, she's fine. She's just, uh...

248
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:21,713
She's with me now.

249
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:23,651
She's with you now?

250
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:25,347
It's a joke, right?

251
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:27,006
No, she made a decision, man.

252
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,147
She decided she needed stability.

253
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,253
Is she going to get that from you?

254
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,948
Look, look, you can think whatever you want about me. But, uh...

255
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:37,492
I'm not the one who's in prison.

256
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:38,389
See,

257
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:42,463
I actually can do something for her.

258
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:45,881
And she wanted me to stop by here and talk to you first, you know, in case you got mad...

259
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:58,058
You just proved my point.

260
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:04,243
You're a con, and that's all you'll ever be.

261
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,838
Make it quick.

262
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,513
Yeah. He's, uh, right in here.

263
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:57,851
Take a walk, Choppy.

264
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,683
Scofield.

265
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,641
You're in a restricted area.

266
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:12,113
I'm doing yard work for P.I. We need some fertilizer.

267
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,347
Why are you in the masonry section?

268
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,440
Oh, by the way, how's the foot?

269
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:40,046
Don't ever go around me to The Pope again.

270
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:44,928
Now, move.

271
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,015
You know what, Haywire?

272
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,609
I don't think we're gonna work out.

273
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:12,565
And, since I was here first, I think you should go.

274
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:17,332
I crapped myself once in junior high.

275
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,325
It  was during... during P.E.

276
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,412
We were... We were playing badminton,

277
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:26,165
and I knew I was gonna have to walk past a bunch of the other students to,

278
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:28,447
you know, get back to the locker room.

279
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:30,431
And so...

280
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,369
I just started walking.

281
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:37,370
And I tried to make fun of it, you know, before anyone else did.

282
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,404
So, I turned around behind me, and...

283
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,732
and I said, "Look, I have a tail!"

284
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,408
I just shared a secret with you.

285
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:54,126
Now, it's your turn.

286
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,145
Want to know what the tattoos mean?

287
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,662
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

288
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:03,756
Hey, Fish.

289
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:07,717
Making any progress?

290
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:12,498
With Sleeping Beauty back there, or with the digging?

291
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:13,494
Either.

292
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:14,754
No.

293
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,477
But I know what to do.

294
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,085
Oh, yeah?

295
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:25,398
Problem is, you don't got the stugots to do it.

296
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:31,633
Abruzzi, let's go.

297
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:34,576
See you.

298
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,035
Yeah?

299
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,901
Really?

300
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,672
Well, tell the crazy son of a bitch I said hi.

301
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:50,306
Wrap it up.

302
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:52,224
How about Aunt Ruth? She out of the hospital yet?

303
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,106
- Wrap it up.
- Hold on, Ma.

304
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,660
Bite me!

305
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:00,334
Okay, we got a problem now, man.

306
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,111
Let's handle it, then.

307
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:05,554
That's what I thought.

308
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,175
   

309
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:13,947
Hello?

310
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:17,401
Maricruz, it's me. Baby, what the hell is going on?

311
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:18,792
What's the deal with you and Hector?

312
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,241
When were you gonna tell me?

313
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,067
Tell you what?

314
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,209
That Rita Saldana's been visiting you?

315
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:25,760
- What?!
- Yeah. Hector told me.

316
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:27,888
Hector told you. Hector told you.

317
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:30,409
Of course he told you. Baby, that guy's a snake. He's a liar.

318
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,044
Why would he lie?

319
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,173
Well, why would he lie? Because he's been trying to get into your pants

320
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,912
since the minute we started dating, that's why.

321
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,372
You know what?

322
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:40,872
I don't know what to believe.

323
00:21:41,078 --> 00:21:42,915
Me, Mami, believe me.

324
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:44,809
Yeah, well I wait by the phone twice a week.

325
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,766
Baby,  where is this coming from?

326
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:49,889
I don't know.

327
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:54,692
Look, there's just so many things.

328
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:59,179
Yesterday, I went to Teresa's house,

329
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:01,427
and I saw her baby.

330
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:05,288
Is that what this is about? You think your clock is ticking?

331
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,998
Well, I am going to be 30 in a few years!

332
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:09,658
Baby, you're 25.

333
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:12,120
You want to get pregnant? Let's get pregnant right now.

334
00:22:12,192 --> 00:22:14,017
Baby, you know I can't get pregnant till I'm married.

335
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:16,095
We're gonna get married...

336
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,789
in 16 months.

337
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,528
Yeah, well, Hector says that if something goes wrong in there,

338
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:28,838
that you could serve your full sentence.

339
00:22:30,102 --> 00:22:31,718
I can't wait ten years.

340
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:34,463
I can't wait ten years, baby.

341
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:37,928
I'm going to be out in 16 months.

342
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,545
Okay, well, what if something does happen, huh?

343
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,301
Baby, I can't wait that long.

344
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,622
I can't.

345
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm sorry, I got to go.

346
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:56,056
Hello? Ba... Wait. Hello? Hel...

347
00:23:07,382 --> 00:23:08,760
Even if Leticia Barris turned up again,

348
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,611
her testimony would be worthless.

349
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:14,615
By and large, most junkies with criminal records don't shine on the stand.

350
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,561
Maybe, but I just found all this out in the past couple of days.

351
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,662
I'm confident that I can find out a whole lot more

352
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:22,097
now that I'm devoting all my time to the case.

353
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:25,475
The Secret Service agent who came to visit you when Leticia was in your office--

354
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:26,609
what did he want?

355
00:23:26,726 --> 00:23:29,106
Nick, please. You've got to understand, Ms. Donovan.

356
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:31,507
Unless there's new information you can provide for us,

357
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:34,789
we've already reviewed Mr. Burrows's case thoroughly.

358
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:36,981
Do you have any new evidence?

359
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:37,960
No, but I...

360
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,742
But...

361
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:41,190
that is effectively what you're telling us, right?

362
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:42,513
I need to clarify here.

363
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,970
Yes, that is what I'm telling you.

364
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:47,537
But look, Mr. Forsik, you don't need to point out what I don't have.

365
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,591
I'm well aware of that.

366
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,146
I'm here asking for your help

367
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:54,892
because I don't think an innocent man should be killed for something he didn't do.

368
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:58,326
And I believe that's what it says on your mission statement in the lobby.

369
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,790
We get thousands of requests for representation.

370
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:01,659
I'm sure you do.

371
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,111
And I have to decide which cases we're going to devote

372
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,939
our very limited resources to.

373
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,269
I will do all of the legwork, Mr. Forsik.

374
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:10,587
But since I don't have any experience in death penalty cases,

375
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:13,815
I'm just asking you to point me in the right direction.

376
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,044
Please.

377
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:21,727
I'm sorry.

378
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,681
We just don't have the manpower.

379
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:32,729
Thank you for your time.

380
00:24:44,602 --> 00:24:45,166
  

381
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,898
She's just leaving now.

382
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,894
Figure it'll take her at least a half hour to get across town in this traffic.

383
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,530
I'm not going to need nearly that much time.

384
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:03,433
I've turned up quite a bit already.

385
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,182
Hey, have you seen my toothpaste?

386
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:16,251
It was right here!

387
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,765
Haven't seen it.

388
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:19,678
I always put it in the same place.

389
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:21,992
I'm sure it'll turn up.

390
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:06,340
The tattoos, there's a maze.

391
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:08,183
Get away from me.

392
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:12,325
I need to see them. Just... you got to show them to me. It's pulling me in.

393
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:15,513
I said... get away from me.

394
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:21,410
Okay.

395
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,495
He's got a maze on his skin.

396
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:29,119
Yeah, he's got a maze on his skin.

397
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,232
Why?

398
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:36,536
Why would he do that? Why?

399
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,953
Why has he put a maze on his skin? Um...

400
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:44,111
I don't... Ow!

401
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:06,486
How are your contacts in Chemical Lockup?

402
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:07,934
Depends who's asking.

403
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,723
I need a bottle of drain line root control, sooner than later.

404
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,564
Got weeds growing in your cell?

405
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:16,949
Just one.

406
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,790
You the one who was looking for me?

407
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:26,352
Yeah, I wanted to ask you some questions about the Lincoln Burrows case.

408
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:27,084
Yeah?

409
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:30,436
I'm Veronica Donovan. I'm representing Lincoln on his appeal.

410
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:31,810
What about it?

411
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:33,921
You were the first one to respond

412
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,916
to Lincoln's apartment the night of the murder, right?

413
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:36,773
That's right.

414
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:39,814
Look, I'd really appreciate if you could just tell me exactly what you saw.

415
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:43,337
Dispatch called in with a tip that Burrows was seen running

416
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:45,493
from the garage where they found Terrence Steadman.

417
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,217
So, we went over to Burrows's place.

418
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:49,401
We spread out.

419
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:50,843
Entered he bathroom,

420
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,714
that's where I saw your client washing out the bloody pants.

421
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,712
Police! Hands up!

422
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,222
I don't need to tell you it was Steadman's blood, do I?

423
00:27:57,363 --> 00:27:59,217
In the report that you typed up that night,

424
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,200
you said that you saw Lincoln standing in the bathroom, that's all.

425
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:06,429
Later, you testified that you saw him washing the pants-- which one is it?

426
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:07,776
Does it matter?

427
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,469
Did you actually see him washing the pants, or not?

428
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:11,539
Yes.

429
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,055
He stood up, turned around,

430
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:15,841
his hands were all wet, looking guilty as hell.

431
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:19,506
Your testimony factored into his conviction. You know that, right?

432
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:23,284
You know, lady, if you got any other questions,

433
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:25,776
just go through the department.

434
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:39,470
Miss Donovan.

435
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:42,382
I didn't mean to scare you.

436
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:44,633
What are you doing here?

437
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:47,100
Nick Savrinn with Project Justice.

438
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:49,812
I know who you are, but what are you doing here?

439
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:55,588
Look, my boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into, but I do.

440
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:14,353
There's a quicker way to take care of your problem.

441
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:23,008
There's smarter ways, too.

442
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,903
What stood out for me was that most death penalty cases

443
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:13,966
take ten years to exhaust all appeals.

444
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:15,821
Lincoln got there in three.

445
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:18,079
So, for it to be expedited,

446
00:30:18,142 --> 00:30:20,660
there had to have been some sort of political influence, right?

447
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,537
Well... given that Terrence Steadman is the vice president's brother,

448
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,001
that's not too hard to believe.

449
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:27,998
How, though? They got to every judge that rejected Lincoln's appeal?

450
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,524
Doesn't take a judge.

451
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:34,313
All it takes is a little special attention from one of his clerks.

452
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:37,812
But how Lincoln got fast-tracked doesn't interest me. It's why.

453
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,763
If he was set up, then why?

454
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:42,878
I think the answer to that might lie in the victim.

455
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,129
What do we know? He was the CEO of EcoField, right?

456
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:48,834
He was pushing alternative energy.

457
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,321
Successfully pushing alternative energy.

458
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:54,543
So, oil companies, the Saudis, even our own government...

459
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:57,656
a lot of people stood to benefit with Steadman out of the picture.

460
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:03,080
Why'd you wait till now to take up this case?

461
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:05,859
I thought he did it, like everybody else.

462
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:09,086
I just hope it's not too late.

463
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:10,996
Very well may be.

464
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:12,879
You need to prepare yourself for that.

465
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,352
What about you?

466
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:20,124
Why death penalty work?

467
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:25,170
My father did 15 years for a crime he didn't commit.

468
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:27,951
I know first-hand that when the government gets you in their crosshairs,

469
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,875
you stand very little chance.

470
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:31,363
That's why.

471
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:39,485
Now... do you want my help?

472
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:03,851
- I want back in.
- Too late.

473
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:05,608
I'll do anything you need. You see these hands?

474
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,791
They're digging machines.

475
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,374
You want to go to China? I'll get you to China.

476
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:10,638
I'll dig like a psychotic rodent if I have to.

477
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:12,871
Fish... I gotta be back in.

478
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,819
As of right now, there is no "in."

479
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:17,098
Van Gogh over there is my new cellmate.

480
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:18,564
But you're going to do something about it, right?

481
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:20,847
- You're gonna get rid of him.
- I'll do what's necessary.

482
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,625
You're my boy!

483
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,070
So how you gonna do that?

484
00:32:27,135 --> 00:32:29,019
Well, let's just put it this way--

485
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:30,762
someone's going to get hurt.

486
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:41,337
How'd we miss this, guys?

487
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:44,532
Scofield's father was out of the picture by the time he was born.

488
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,105
Took his mother's maiden name.

489
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:50,398
All right, Scofield had no priors and a full-time job as an engineer.

490
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:51,075
Correct.

491
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:55,507
Then he goes and robs a bank, discharging a gun in the process.

492
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,702
So that in sentencing, he maneuvers his way to Fox River

493
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:02,115
where his brother's scheduled to die in less than a month.

494
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:03,836
Obviously, something is up.

495
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:08,127
All due respect, brothers are incarcerated together all over the country.

496
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,835
It may just be a coincidence.

497
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,893
Move on the younger brother.

498
00:33:12,044 --> 00:33:16,890
Do it preemptively before anything rises up, bites any of us in the ass.

499
00:33:30,596 --> 00:33:31,830
It's a pathway...

500
00:33:33,186 --> 00:33:34,201
where does it lead?

501
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:38,269
Where are you taking me?

502
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,462
What, are you nuts?

503
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,209
Officer!

504
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,248
I need an officer!

505
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:54,496
What the hell's the problem down here?

506
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,567
What... son of a bitch!

507
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,019
Open up on 40!

508
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:01,954
He's got the pathway on his body. It leads somewhere.

509
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:03,280
Back off, Haywire!

510
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:06,231
No, look... Look... look at his tattoos. It's a pathway.

511
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:08,704
Haywire, I said "back off." You want a hot shot?

512
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,041
I'm telling you, look at his...

513
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:12,709
Back off, man! Get in over here!

514
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:13,484
Let's go!

515
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:15,368
It leads to hell!

516
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,084
It leads to hell!

517
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:19,486
It's a pathway to hell!

518
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,369
He's taking us all to hell!

519
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,063
So, the gang's all back together again. Well, ain't that swell?

520
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:45,160
Told you not to go around me to The Pope.

521
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:47,630
But you just keep making waves, don't you?

522
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:59,802
- Good to be back, man.
- Good to have you back.

523
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:07,685
So when do we get started?

524
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,488
Good afternoon, Mr. Scofield.

525
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,330
Hello.

526
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:40,990
How you feeling today?

527
00:35:41,827 --> 00:35:42,677
We're good.

528
00:35:45,147 --> 00:35:46,582
What happened?

529
00:35:47,518 --> 00:35:50,892
Um, caught an elbow playing basketball.

530
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,064
Uh-huh.

531
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:56,808
Mind if I take a look?

532
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:57,973
By all means.

533
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:09,146
You know you're going to get killed in here, right?

534
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,975
If you're not careful.

535
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:14,599
I'll make you a bet.

536
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,786
When I get out of here, alive,

537
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:20,428
I'll take you to dinner.

538
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,127
Lunch? Cup of coffee?

539
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:28,039
Michael, this, um... this charm act

540
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:32,347
could be exactly what's getting you into trouble out in the yard.

541
00:36:37,874 --> 00:36:38,943
Lean forward.

542
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:51,758
All right...

543
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:52,987
you went to the parking garage,

544
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,212
Terrence Steadman is already dead.

545
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:56,480
That's right.

546
00:36:56,662 --> 00:36:59,098
You saw that and you ran... took the gun.

547
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,797
- Dumped the gun.
- Where?

548
00:37:00,878 --> 00:37:02,938
Storm drain, Van Buren and Wells.

549
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,659
Nobody ever found it.

550
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,789
All right, well, what do you do after that?

551
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,299
You go back to your apartment?

552
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,279
Yeah.

553
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,882
I was freaking out, trying to figure out what happened.

554
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:18,673
Then, I saw the bloody pants in the tub.

555
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:24,749
The cops, they busted in a minute after I got there.

556
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:27,922
The pants-- the ones with Steadman's blood on them--

557
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:31,387
first cop on the scene says he saw you washing them in the bathtub.

558
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,176
He's lying.

559
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:35,022
My hands were wet after splashing water on my face.

560
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:38,038
Police! Let's see your hands! Hands up!

561
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,934
I never touched those pants.

562
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,108
Which brings us back to the gun,

563
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,347
the one you said you dumped.

564
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:45,145
It was planted.

565
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:46,876
It's the only way it could have got there.

566
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:48,727
Ballistics matched to a slug...

567
00:37:48,742 --> 00:37:51,042
The gun was planted! It was planted!

568
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,596
Just like the pants.

569
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:54,949
Your fingerprints were all over the gun.

570
00:37:58,838 --> 00:37:59,653
Bo...

571
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:05,470
Who's Bo?

572
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:07,721
He's the guy who arranged everything.

573
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,362
Had me come around the night before,

574
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,190
tried a few guns, see which one felt right.

575
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:16,006
That was the setup right there.

576
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:17,871
One of those must have been the murder weapon.

577
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:20,080
That's how they got my fingerprints on the gun.

578
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,718
Had to be.

579
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:24,788
All right, so this, this... this Bo--

580
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:28,883
uh, he coerces you into doing this, all to clear a $90,000 debt.

581
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,201
He was going to kill my son.

582
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:34,188
Well?

583
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:36,889
A lot of "I didn't do it," and those don't count for much.

584
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:39,409
Security tape, the one that shows Lincoln pulling the trigger...

585
00:38:39,494 --> 00:38:40,889
- you got it, right?
- Yeah.

586
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:43,371
Well, if Lincoln's telling the truth, then that tape is lying.

587
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:46,088
Think we should have a look, decide for ourselves.

588
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:54,374
You're clear.

589
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:14,752
If the chemicals can eat through the iron pipes,

590
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,452
how come they can't eat through the toothpaste tube?

591
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:21,133
It's only when the chemicals are combined that they become a corrosive.

592
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,217
You study chemistry or something?

593
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,449
Not in school.

594
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,065
But what you're doing up there in the infirmary,

595
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,686
what does it got to do with what we're doing here?

596
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:48,567
Getting through this wall is just the beginning.

597
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,213
There's a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls.

598
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:56,796
Infirmary's the closest building to those walls...

599
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:04,850
...and the weakest link in the security chain.

600
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:06,254
Cool.

601
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,542
I think I've got enough grout out to bust through.

602
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,479
I'm going to need you to make some noise.

603
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:31,384
Is that the best you can do?

604
00:40:32,953 --> 00:40:34,304
Have some faith, Papi.

605
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,801
Have some faith.

606
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:40,258
Shut up!

607
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,883
You suck!

608
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:27,921
Not one more word!

609
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:31,938
Next inmate that opens his mouth goes in the hole!

610
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:47,141
We're good.

611
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:16,082
You okay?

612
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:20,948
Work.

613
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:23,503
It's fine.

614
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:28,243
I got it.

615
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:34,124
Everything all right?

616
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:35,394
Couldn't be better.

617
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:38,634
You want to come in? We just sat down to eat.

618
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:42,013
No, I just wanted to stop by to tell you in person.

619
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:45,972
Problem solved.

620
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,816
What's this?

621
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:50,045
That is a transfer request.

622
00:42:50,455 --> 00:42:54,072
Michael Scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow.

623
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:00,302
Have a good night.

624
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:08,302
