00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,161
Came up from Devon on the first
available train this morning.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,242
You had a disappointing breakfast
and a cup of black coffee.

153
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,004
The girl in the seat across
the aisle fancied you.

154
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,128
Although you were initially keen,
you've now changed your mind.

155
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,965
You are, however, extremely anxious
to have your first cigarette of the day.

156
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,761
Sit down, Mr. Knight.
And do please smoke, I'd be delighted.

- It's not important...

159
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,406
Punched-out holes
where your ticket's been checked.

160
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,084
- Not now, Sherlock.
- Oh, please?

161
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,730
- I've been cooped up in here for ages.
- You're just showing off.

162
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,326
Of course. I am a show-off.
That's what we do.

163
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,289
Train napkin you used
to mop up the spilled coffee,

164
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,442
strength of the stain shows
that you didn't take milk.

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,887
There are traces of ketchup on it and
round your lips and on your sleeve.

166
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,088
Cooked breakfast. Or the nearest
thing those trains can manage,

167
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,246
- probably a sandwich.
- How did you know it was disappointing?

168
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,245
Is there any other type
of breakfast on a train?

169
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,687
The girl,
female handwriting's quite distinctive,

170
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,091
wrote her phone number down
on the napkin.

171
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,322
I can tell from the angle she wrote at
that she was sat across from you

172
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,404
on the other side of the aisle.
Later, after she'd got off, I imagine,

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,289
you used the napkin to
mop up your spilled coffee,

174
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,646
accidentally smudging the numbers.

175
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,848
You've been over the last four digits
yourself with another pen

176
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,763
so you wanted to keep the number.
Just now, though, you used the napkin

177
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,525
to blow your nose. Maybe
you're not that into her after all.

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,125
Then there's the nicotine stains
on your fingers,

179
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,851
your shaking fingers. I know the signs.

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,207
No chance to smoke one on the train,
no time to roll one

181
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,285
before you got a cab here.
It's just after 9:15, you're desperate.

182
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,966
The first train from Exeter to London
leaves at 5:46 a.m.

183
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,849
You got the first one possible,
so something important

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,207
must have happened last night.

You went there

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,166
Ta, I'll remember.

300
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,768
Aye. No, it buggers up tourism a bit,
so thank God for the demon hound!

301
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,202
- Did you see that show? The documentary?
- Quite recently, yeah.

302
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,647
God bless Henry Knight
and his monster from hell.

303
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,291
- You ever seen it? The Hound?
- Me? No, no.

304
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,126
Eh, Fletcher has.
He runs the walks, the monster walks,

305
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,168
for the tourists, you know?
He's seen it.

306
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,402
That's handy. For trade.

307
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,608
I'm just saying
we've been rushed off our feet, Billy.

308
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,207
Yeah, lots of monster hunters.
Doesn't take much these days.

309
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,931
One mention on Twitter and woomph!

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,968
- We're out of WKD.
- All right.

311
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,327

and the ruddy prisoner,

312

sleep nights, do you, Gary?

313

- That's not true. He's a snorer.

- No. Nothing like that just curious.

- Have you seen it?
- Maybe.

- Why would I tell you if I did?

- I called Henry...

half an hour of light...

327

Oh, I bet John here 50 quid that you
couldn't prove you'd seen the Hound

I seen it. Only about a month ago.

332
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,245
Up at the Hollow. It was foggy, mind.
Couldn't make much out.

People don't like going up there,
you know. To the Hollow.

339
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,529
- Gives them a bad sort of feeling.
- Ooh, is it haunted?

there is something out there.

Something from Baskerville. Escaped

343
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,410
- A clone? A super-dog?
- Maybe.

spraying on us all these years.

Is that the best you've got?

00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,801
I had a mate once
who worked for the MOD.

348
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,087
One weekend we were meant to
go fishing, but he never showed up.

349
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,686
Well, not till late. When he did,

350
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,845
he was white as a sheet.
I can see him now.

351
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,048
"I've seen things today, Fletch," he
said, "I ain't never want to see again.

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,323
"Terrible things."

353
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,446
He'd been sent to some secret
army place. Porton Down, maybe?

354
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,649
Maybe Baskerville? Or somewhere else.

355
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,883
In the labs there,
the really secret labs,

356
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,571
he said he'd seen... terrible things.

357
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,481
Rats as big as dogs, he said.

358
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,043
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.

359

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,167
I thought so.
I knew he wanted help but...

493
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,244
I didn't realise he was going to
contact Sherlock Holmes.

Don't worry, I know who you really are.

That wasn't my hat.

- I hardly recognise him without the hat.
- It wasn't my hat.

You know Henry Knight?

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,330
Well, I knew his dad better.

503
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,609
He had all sorts of
mad theories about this place.

504
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,402
Still, he was a good friend.

What exactly is it that you do here?

509
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,326
Mr. Holmes, I would love to tell you,

516

- Any time.

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,970
Oh, please.
Can we not do this this time?

520
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,448
- Do what?
- You being all mysterious with your...

521

your coat collar up so you look cool.

522

- I don't do that.
- Yeah, you do.

523

specialises in genetic manipulation.

526
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,489
She made her daughter's rabbit
glow in the dark?

527
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,048
Probably a fluorescent gene.

528

Removed and spliced into the specimen,
simple enough these days.

529

So...

530
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,563
So we know that Dr. Stapleton performs
secret genetic experiments on animals.

531
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,486
The question is has she been working
on something deadlier than a rabbit?

To be fair, that is quite a wide field.

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,404
I didn't see anything!

597
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,240
Look, he must have seen it!
I saw it. He must have.

598
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,648
He must have. I...

599
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,202
Why? Why? Why would he say that?

600
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,170
It-it-it was there. It was.

601
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,766
Henry? Henry, I need you to sit down.

602
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,490
- Try and relax, please.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

603
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,562
I'm going to give you something
to help you sleep.

604
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,490
- All right?
- This is good news, John.

605
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,291
It's... it's... it's good.

606
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,130
I'm not crazy.

607
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,886
There is a Hound. There is...

608
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,087
And Sherlock, he saw it too.
No matter what he says. He saw it.

609
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,602
Well, he is in a pretty bad way.
He's manic.

610
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,607
Totally convinced there's some
mutant super-dog roaming the moors.

611
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,491
And there isn't, though, is there?

612
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,689
'Cause if people knew how to make
a mutant super-dog, we'd know.

613
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,730
They'd be for sale.
I mean, that's how it works.

614
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,929
Listen, on the moor,
I saw someone signalling.

615
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,401
Morse. I guess it's Morse.

616
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,486
Doesn't seem to make much sense.

617
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,800
U-M-Q-R-A. Does that mean anything?

618
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,522
So, okay. What have we got?

619
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,927
We know there's footprints,
'cause Henry found them.

620
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,971
So did the tour guide.
But we all heard something.

621
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,408
Maybe we should just
look for whoever's got a big dog.

622
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,289
- Henry's right.
- What?

623
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,008
I saw it, too.

624
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,851
- What?
- I saw it, too, John.

625
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,322
- Just... just a minute. You saw what?
- A hound.

626
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,208
Out there in the Hollow.

627
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,771
A gigantic hound!

628
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,561
Um...

629
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,409
Look, Sherlock.
We have to be rational about this. Okay?

630
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,883
Now, you, of all people, can't just...

631
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,728
Let's just stick to what we know, yes?
Stick to the facts.

632
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,166
Once you've ruled out the impossible,

633
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,528
whatever remains,
however improbable, must be true.

634
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,724
What does that mean?

635
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,441
Huh.

636
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,882
Look at me, I'm afraid, John.

637
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,968
Afraid.

638
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,246
Sherlock...

639
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,802
I've always been able
to keep myself distant.

640
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,564
Divorce myself from feelings.

641
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,484
But, look, you see?
My body's betraying me.

642
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,162
Interesting, yes? Emotions.

643
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,288
The grit on the lens,
the fly in the ointment!

644
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,045
Yeah, all right, Spock.

645
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,044
Just take it easy.

646
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,883
You've been pretty wired lately.
You know you have.

647
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,009
I think you've just gone out there
and got yourself a bit worked up.

648
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,411
Worked up?

649
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,926
- It was dark and scary...
- Me?

650
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,287
There's nothing wrong with me.

651
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,769
<font color="#DF01D7">(BREATHING HEAVILY)</font>

652
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,564
Sherlock?

653
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,364
- Sherlock?
- There is nothing wrong with me!

654
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,124
Do you understand?

655
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,161
You want me to prove it, yes?

656
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,120
We're looking for a dog, yes?
A great big dog.

657
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,850
That's your brilliant theory.
Cherchez le chien!

658
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,321
Good. Excellent. Yes!
Where shall we start?

659
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,640
How about them?

660
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,121
The sentimental widow and her son,
the unemployed fisherman?

661
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,406
- The answer's yes.
- Yes?

662
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,686
She's got a West Highland terrier
called Whisky.

663
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,206
- Not exactly what we're looking for.
- Sherlock, for God's sake.

664
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,850
Look at the jumper he's wearing,
hardly worn.

665
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,206
Clearly he's uncomfortable in it.

666
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,169
Maybe it's because of the material,
more likely the hideous pattern.

667
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,924
Suggests it's a present.
Probably Christmas.

668
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,606
So, he wants into his Mother's good
books. Why? Almost certainly money.

669
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,047
He's treating her to a meal,
but his own portion is small.

670
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,451
That means he wants to impress her,

671
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,885
but he's trying to economise
on his own food.

672
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,203
- Well, maybe he's just not hungry.
- No. Small plate. A starter.

673
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,726
He's practically licked it clean.
She's nearly finished her pavlova.

674
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,121
If she'd treated him,
he'd have had as much as he wanted.

675
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,440
He's hungry, all right.
And not well off.

676
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,965
You can tell that from
the state of his cuffs and shoes.

677
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,121
"How do you know she's his mother?"

678
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,725
Who else would give him
a Christmas present like that?

679
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,768
Well, it could be an aunt or an
older sister, but mother's more likely.

680
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,001
Now, he was a fisherman.

681
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,560
The scarring pattern on his hands
is very distinctive, fish-hooks.

682
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,687
They're all quite old now,

683
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,205
which suggests he's been unemployed
for some time.

684
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,725
Not much industry
in this part of the world,

685
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,165
so he's turned
to his widowed mother for help.

686
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,685
"Widowed?" Yes! Obviously.

687
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,569
She's got a man's wedding ring
on a chain around her neck,

688
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,802
clearly her late husband's
and too big for her finger.

689
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,245
She's well-dressed
but her jewellery's cheap.

690
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,721
She could afford better,
but she's kept it. Sentimental.

691
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,802
Now, the dog.
Tiny little hairs all over the leg

692
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,405
from where it gets a little bit
too friendly.

693
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,448
But no hairs above the knee,
suggesting it's a small dog,

694
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,682
probably a terrier. In fact, it is
a West Highland terrier called Whisky.

695
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,091
"How the hell do you know that,
Sherlock?"

696
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,162
Because she was on the same train
as us and I heard her calling its name.

697
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,651
And that's not cheating,
that's listening.

698
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,609
I use my senses, John,
unlike some people.

699
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,489
So, you see, I am fine.
In fact, I've never been better.

700
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,767
So just leave me alone.

701
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,370
Yeah, okay.

702
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,040
Okay.

703
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,446
Why would you listen to me?
I'm just your friend.

704
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,410
- I don't have friends.
- No.

00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,806
and because I have
another friend who...

747
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,241
might be having the same problem.

748
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,764
- Dr. Watson!
- Hi.

749
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,490
Hello.

750
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,289
How's the investigation going?

751
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,362
- Hello.
- What investigation?

752
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,442
Didn't you know?
Don't you read the blog?

753
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,682
- Sherlock Holmes!
- Sherlock who?

754
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,808
<font color="#DF01D7">(SCOFFS)</font> Private detective.

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,804
- This is his PA.
- PA?

756
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,923
- Well, live-in PA.
- Perfect.

757
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,764
- Live-in.
- Uh, this is Dr. Mortimer.

758
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,171
Henry's therapist.

759
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,607
Oh, hello. Bob Frankland.

760
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,885
Listen, tell Sherlock I've been
keeping an eye on Stapleton.

761
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,008
Any time he wants a little chat...

762
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,605
All right?

- Ah.

765
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,647
Why don't you buy him a drink?

766
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,049
I think he likes you.

768
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,768
Morning! Oh, how are you feeling?

769
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,283
I'm... I didn't sleep very well.

770
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,328
That's a shame.
Shall I make you some coffee?

771
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,368
Oh, look. You've got damp.

772
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,049
Listen.

773
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,565
Last night...

774
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,248
Why did you say
you hadn't seen anything?

775
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,163
I mean, I only saw the Hound
for a minute but...

776
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,561
- Hound.
- What?

777
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,325
Why do you call it a hound?
Why a hound?

778
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,409
- Why? What do you mean?
- It's odd, isn't it?

779
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,290
Strange choice of words, archaic.
That's why I took the case.

780
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,887
"Mr. Holmes, they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound."

781
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,724
Why say "hound"?

782
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:10,250
- I don't know, I've never...
- Actually, let's skip the coffee.

783
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,366
You, uh, getting anywhere
with that Morse Code?

784
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,968
- No.
- U-M-Q-R-A, wasn't it?

785
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,724
- UMQRA.
- Nothing.

786
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,484
- UMQ...
- Look, forget it.

787
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,722
I thought I was onto something,
I wasn't.

788
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,211
- Sure?
- Yeah.

789
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,689
How about Louise Mortimer?
Did you get anywhere with her?

790
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,171
- No.
- Too bad.

791
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,730
Did you get any information?

792
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,121
Hmm. You're being funny now?

793
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,885
Thought it might break the ice a bit.

794
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,726
Funny doesn't suit you.
I'd stick to ice.

795
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,449
- John...
- It's fine.

796
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,091
No, wait. What happened last night,
something happened to me,

797
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,491
something I've not really
experienced before.

798
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,291
Yes, you said. Fear.
"Sherlock Holmes got scared," you said.

799
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,490
No, no, no. It was more than that, John.
It was doubt. I felt doubt.

800
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,130
Always been able to trust my senses,

801
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,362
the evidence of my own eyes,
until last night.

802
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,962
You can't actually believe that
you saw some kind of monster?

803
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,042
No, I can't believe that.

804
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,006
But I did see it.
So the question is how? How?

805
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,521
Yes.

806
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,883
Yeah, right, good.
So, you got something to go on, then?

807
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,564
Good luck with that.

808
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,970
Listen, what I said before, John,
I meant it.

809
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,126
I don't have friends.

810
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,964
I've just got one.

811
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,326
Right.

812
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,646
John?

813
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,606
John!

814
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,720
- You are amazing! You are fantastic!
- Yes, all right.

815
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,040
You don't have to overdo it.

816
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,565
You've never been the most
luminous of people

817
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,007
but as a conductor of light,
you are unbeatable.

818
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,241
- Cheers.
- What?

819
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,401
Some people who aren't geniuses

820
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,050
have an amazing ability
to stimulate it in others.

821
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,885
Hang on, you were saying sorry
a minute ago, don't spoil it.

822
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,328
Go on. What have I done
that's so bloody stimulating?

823
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,045
Yeah?

824
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,727
What if it's not a word?
What if it is individual letters?

825
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,284
- You think it's an acronym?
- Absolutely no idea.

826
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,330
What the hell are you doing here?

827
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,370
Oh, nice to see you, too.
I'm on holiday, would you believe?

828
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,131
No. I wouldn't.

829
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,531
- Hello, John.
- Greg.

830
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,331
I heard you were in the area.
What are you up to?

831
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,324
You after this Hound of Hell,
like on the telly?

832
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,006
I'm waiting for an explanation,
Inspector. Why are you here?

833
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,326
I've told you, I'm on holiday.

834
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,529
You're brown as a nut. You're clearly
just back from your holidays.

835
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,931
Maybe I fancied another one.

836
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,968
- Oh, this is Mycroft, isn't it?
- Now, look...

837
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,849
Of course it is.
One mention of Baskerville

838
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,925
and he sends down my handler
to spy on me, incognito.

839
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,571
Is that why you're
calling yourself Greg?

840
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,846
- That's his name.
- Is it?

841
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,241
Yes, if you'd ever bothered to find out.

842
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,402
Look, I'm not your handler.

843
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,482
And I don't just do
what your brother tells me

844
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,006
Actually, you could be
just the man we want.

845
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,560
- Why?
- I've not been idle, Sherlock.

846
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,610
I think I might have
found something. Here.

847
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,930
Didn't know if it was relevant,
it's starting to look like it might be.

848
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,685
That is an awful lot of meat
for a vegetarian restaurant.

849
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,764
- Excellent.
- A nice, scary inspector

850
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,842
from Scotland Yard
who can put in a few calls

851
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,126
might come in very handy.

852
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,486
Shop!

853
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,128
- What's this?
- Coffee. I made coffee.

854
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,770
- You never make coffee.
- I just did. Don't you want it?

855
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,320
You don't have to keep apologising.

856
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,731

things a bit of a boost, you know?

866

A great big dog run wild up on the moor,
it was heaven sent.

867
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,491
It was like us having our own
Loch Ness Monster.

- Where do you keep it?
- There's an old mine shaft.

It was vicious.

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,564
And then a month ago,
Billy took him to the vet

874

- and, you know...
- It's dead?

- Put down.
- Yeah.

876

No choice. So it's over.

877

- It was just a joke, you know?
- Yeah. Hilarious.

a man out of his mind.

879
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,884
You know he's actually pleased
you're here? Secretly pleased.

880
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,884
Is he? That's nice.

881
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,649

all the same faces back together.

- Asperger's?

about having the dog destroyed?

- No reason not to.
- Well, hopefully there's no harm done.

Not quite sure what
I'd charge them with anyway.

that people saw out on the moor?

- Looks like it.
- But that wasn't what you saw.

- That wasn't just an ordinary dog.
- No.

It was immense, had burning red eyes
and it was glowing, John,

- Right.
- Which means you'll have to start

903
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,684
- the search for the Hound.
- Okay.

Could be dangerous.

Of course I can walk.

Refined, cold-blooded murder.

Will you tell little Kirsty
what happened to Bluebell or shall I?

No, I'm all right.

My daughter ended up
with one of the lab specimens,

- Why not?

1009
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,571
And what about animals? Not sheep.

1010
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,487
- Big animals.
- Size isn't a problem. Not at all.

1011

The only limits are ethics and the law.
And both those things can be

1012
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,681
very flexible.
But not here, not at Baskerville.

1013

- It's not there!
- <font color="#404040">JOHN:</font> Jesus!

1014
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,447

It doesn't make any sense.

1015
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,081

- A drug, of course! It has to be a drug.

1016
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,845
A hallucinogenic or a deliriant
of some kind.

1017
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,968
There's no trace of anything
in the sugar.

1018
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,166
- Sugar?
- The sugar, yes.

1019
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,446
It's a simple process of elimination.

1020
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,241
I saw the Hound, saw it as my
imagination expected me to see it.

1021
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,164
A genetically engineered monster.

1022
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,969
But I knew I couldn't believe
the evidence of my own eyes,

1023
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,371
so there were
seven possible reasons for it,

1024
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,920
the most possible being narcotics.

1025
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,847
Henry Knight, he saw it, too.
But you didn't, John. You didn't see it.

1026
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,321
Now, we have eaten and drunk exactly
the same things since we got to Grimpen,

1027
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,007
apart from one thing!
You don't take sugar in your coffee.

1028
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,081
I see. So...

1029
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,050
I took it from Henry's kitchen.
His sugar.

1030
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,840
- But it's perfectly all right.
- But maybe it's not a drug.

1031
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,161
No, it has to be a drug.

1032
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,086
How did it get into our systems? How?

1033
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,446
There must be something. Something...

1034
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,525
Something...

1035
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,443
Something buried deep. Get out.

1036
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,326
- What?
- Get out.

1037
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,324

- Your what?

1038

He's not going to be doing much
talking for a while, we may as well go.

1039
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,561
- His what?
- Oh, his mind palace.

1040
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,610
It's a memory technique.
A sort of mental map.

1041
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,208
You plot a map with a location.
It doesn't have to be a real place.

1042
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,009
And then you deposit memories there.

1043
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,684
Theoretically,
you can never forget anything.

1094

Because of what it did to the subjects
they tested it on?

1098

And what they did to others.
Prolonged exposure drove them insane.

1099
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,048
Made them almost
uncontrollably aggressive.

Because dead men get listened to.

This means that my dad was right.

He'd found something out, hadn't he?

And that's why you killed him,

So they didn't have it put down, then?
The dog.

Obviously. Suppose they just

in the lab?

- I hadn't been to the Hollows.

When you went to the lab, maybe.

1243
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,049
You saw those pipes.
Pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.

1244
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,804
And they were carrying the gas, so...

1245
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,565
- Um, ketchup, was it, or brown?
- Hang on.

You thought it was in the sugar.
You were convinced it was in the sugar.

Better get going, actually.

- Shh.

I was scared to death!

I thought the drug was in the sugar
so I put the sugar in your coffee.
