1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,340
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,720
The bracing is going to be tricky.

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,680
Unless the tunnel gets the proper support, it's
all going to come down on our heads.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,170
Listen, I want you to call her up,tell
her you've got some information.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,150
Make sure she picks you up,and
get in the car,all right?

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,870
Lincoln bought a gun.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,560
Just thought you'd want to know.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,830
If you're really leaving,take
me with you. Please?

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,150
I don't want to be here anymore.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,860
You don't want any part of this.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,050
There's a part of me that doesn't
want to believe he works for them

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,860
'cause he's the man I loved,the man
who was going to take me to mparis.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,730
If he doesn't take you,I will.

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,350
Impressive,blanco.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,500
How long is this going to set us back?

17
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,490
All right. We got 24 hours
to dig out that tunnel.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,070
You mean the one it took you guys
three days to dig the first time?

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,590
Let's just say, by some miracle
we are able to part the dirt sea, Moses.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,220
Then what?

21
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,080
How you plan on getting
around the guards tower?

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,130
Michael, Mr. Whistler here says that,you
know, you got stopped last time by a cloud.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,580
I'm still working on that.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,020
I'd like to know if this girl's gonna put out
before I spend any more time buying her drinks!

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,370
I agree,Michael.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,950
You know as well as I
do what's riding on this.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,280
I'd say I know better.

28
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,750
I don't care who knows what so long as somebody
knows how the hell we getting out of here by tomorrow.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,080
You coming?

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,060
Not today.

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,290
James and I have a lot
of things to clear up,

32
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,480
but I'm done trying to
do it through a fence.

33
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,710
You ever wish you could go back in time?

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,670
Just to remember how it was
like when things made sense?

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,460
Every day for the last three years.

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,450
Is that Whistler's girlfriend?

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,400
Why is she staying in the car?

38
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,870
Guess she thinks she'll see him tomorrow.

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,390
You've been spending a
lot of time together,huh?

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,010
And?

41
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,290
You sure that's wise?

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,480
Where are we?

43
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,660
Behind schedule.

44
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,500
But we should be on the same side
of the fence by tomorrow afternoon.

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,450
What do you mean,"should"?

46
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,320
The tunnel gets us
into no-man's-land.

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,850
To get to the fence,we're going to need
a new diversion of the tower guards.

48
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,410
What time?

49
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,320
Daytime's still our best option.

50
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,530
They double the guards at night.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,550
- And the jeep patrols?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,210
And,uh...there's something else.

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,340
What?

54
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,380
T-bag's coming.And mahone.Bellick.

55
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh,yeah,there's a drug lord,too.

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,660
You know what?It's not about
them.It's about whistler.

57
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,690
- We got to do whatever...
- you don't need to know who whistler is.

58
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,360
What about what he's worth?

59
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,550
My son's life.

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,710
I just wish there was
another way to do this.

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,080
To save lj without
handing whistler over.

62
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,510
Look,man,that's it. There isn't.

63
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,760
I know.

64
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,920
Listen,you worry about the
tunnel,I worry about the guards.

65
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,770
- See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,460
Hey,now,don't skimp
on the braces up there.

67
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,460
In fact,if you want to
add a little extra,just...

68
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,260
you know,we can work on this
railroad all...the livelong day,

69
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,740
but it don't matter if scofield doesn't
know what happens once we get off the train.

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,960
Once we get out of here,it's
every man for himself.

71
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,510
Scofield's not
responsible for any of us.

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Is that so?

73
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,960
You obviously don't know
him very well,shakespeare.

74
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,690
When we broke out of fox river,he
tried to screw every one of us.

75
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,740
Half the men ended up either
dead,captured or worse.

76
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,010
The guys who are easiest to catch

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,450
are the one's who spend more time pissing
and moaning at each other than running.

78
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,680
My only advice to you,ecclesiastes 6:13.

79
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,150
"Separate thyself from thy
enemies,and take heed of thy friends."

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,470
How we doing,alex?

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,640
Well,if those braces hold,we could
be to the surface sometime tomorrow.

82
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,630
Let's rotate.

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,100
Keep everybody fresh.

84
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,390
Welcome to the coal mine,canary.

85
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,230
*******

86
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,530
Cho!

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,880
Don't drop your body-water
upon me like that!

88
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,470
Hey,it ain't coming from me,I swear.

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,120
Engineer,come. Look at this.

90
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,650
- We hit a pipe or something?
- Oh,no.

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,660
That's right above our tunnel.

92
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,360
That's not going to hold till tomorrow.

93
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,480
So what do we do?

94
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,410
We leave tonight.

95
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:46,720

98
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,210
tonight?

99
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,450
I thought you said a nighttime
escape was impossible.

100
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,130
S up,the tunnel will collapse
again,and that'll be the end of it.

101
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,720
It'll be the end for you.

102
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,220
You're the one on a deadline.

103
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,660
What if it gives out while we're inside?

104
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,170
- We end up like buried treasure.
- You want out,get out!

105
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,450
Look,you're not pulling this off tonight
without all of us working around the clock.

106
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,190
And none of us are ever making
it out of here without his plan,

107
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,050
so if you tell me that you can figure
out a way how to do this at night,

108
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,490
then I-- we-- can figure out a way
how to get that tunnel dug in time.

109
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,030
Let's start digging.

110
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,540
I think you dropped something.

111
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,140
I've read in old newspapers
that make it to sona

112
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,300
how americans hold others
to standards they ignore.

113
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,110
How they think no one
should have power but them.

114
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,900
I tell everyone it's a
lie,but I see it's true.

115
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,580
*******Aving.

116
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,110
And I think that after
everything I've done to help,

117
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,520
I think it sucks you're
not taking me with you!

118
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,600
I know it doesn't seem like it
now,but I'm doing you a favor.

119
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,160
I'm giving you a gift.

120
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,460
Oh,wow,life in prison. Thank you.

121
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,310
I've always wanted one of those.

122
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,440
It's better than a life on the run.

123
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,150
I don't belong here.

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,780
- All I did was give a guy...
- you're not going!

125
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,340
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,690
It's for the best.

127
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,240
How do you know what's best for me?

128
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,740
Y cuanto me va costar?

129
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,060
Okay,muchas gracias.

130
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,830
It's good to go.

131
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,720
You know where and when to be,right?

132
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,900
If you're not there,we're screwed.

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
You all right?

134
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,890
I'm fine.

135
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,630
- I'm just going to grab my stuff.
- Yeah.

136
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,940
Probably best if you
and james disappear.

137
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,520
I know. I know.

138
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,810
You know where to meet us,right?

139
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,970
Playa blanca.

140
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,560
You'll be on the...

141
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,950
- 3-12.
- 3-12.

142
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,070
We'll see you tomorrow then.

143
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,310
Good luck.

144
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
You,too.

145
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,610
hey,it's that susan chick.
She wants to meet again.

146
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,720
Good.

147
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,190
Let her know everything's on track.

148
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,840
We want to make her feel
as comfortable as possible.

149
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,590
Why shouldn't she be?

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,820
She's going to get
her guy tomorrow,right?

151
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,110
Well,if Michael's conscience
doesn't get in the way.

152
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,740
What do you mean?

153
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,190
He's having doubts.

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,460
About if he can pull it off?

155
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,590
About if he should.

156
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,520
But he's going to go
through with it,right?

157
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,430
What are you looking for?

158
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,450
Where the power lines connect
to sona's exterior lights.

159
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,440
If cutting the power out there was an
option,why didn't we do that in the first place?

160
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,300
One,the power out there
isn't controlled from in here.

161
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,770
And,two,there's that.

162
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,530
Every prison has a backup generator.

163
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,030
Even if we cut the lights,they'll
just come back on again immediately.

164
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,690
Well,that's a big,bloody problem.

165
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,630
Tell lechero I need his phone.

166
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,930
Change of plans,linc.

167
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,450
We're doing this tonight.

168
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,700
Tonight?

169
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,980
What happened,Michael?

170
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,850
Rain,dirt,tunnel,problem.

171
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,360
How long can it hold?

172
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,400
That depends.

173
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,400
Depends on what?

174
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,890
When the rain stops.

175
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,290
You said breaking out
at night was impossible.

176
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,520
Yeah,well...

177
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,030
you want to tell me how
you're going to pull this off?

178
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,200
For starters,I need
to get ahold of sucre.

179
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,890
Sucre,do you know
what I do for a living?

180
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,480
I have a pretty good idea.

181
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,670
I read people.

182
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,570
And you,my friend,are a coloring book.

183
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,410
I think you left this imy car.

184
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,450
Look. That...that was just...I mean...

185
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,830
no. No,no,no,no.

186
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,470
My fault.

187
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,430
I guess I just didn't make myself clr when
I laid out the terms of our arrangement.

188
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,290
So I'm going to try again
as simply as I know how.

189
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,040
Anything happens-- anything
at all i wasn't expecting--

190
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,700
and there will be one less
pregnant girl in chicago.

191
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,660
Look, Michael and Lincoln
don't tell me everything.

192
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,540
Fernando,this is your last chance.

193
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,610
I want a yes or a no.

194
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,420
Are the brothers gonna
break whistler out of sona?

195
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,040
Yes.

196
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,500
Are they planning on
handing him over to me?

197
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,910
Yes.

198
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,400
Where do you want me to shoot maricruz
first,in the bun or in the oven?

199
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,840
Okay!

200
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,210
There's one thing I heard.

201
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,990
It's Michael.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,420
He's,he's having some
concerns about whistler.

203
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,970
What kind of concerns?

204
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,460
About handing him over.

205
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,790
You got to understand,he broke
out some pretty bad guys last time.

206
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,360
I think he's never
forgiven himself for that.

207
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,460
He's planning on leaving him behind?

208
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,790
Maybe. I don't know.

209
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,360
Hello,Lincoln.

210
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,770
It's going down tonight.

211
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,580
Tonight?

212
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,720
Should I be worried?

213
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,480
I called you first thing.

214
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,610
I'm being straight up with you.

215
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,420
That's refreshing.

216
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,900
So I'll see you tonight.

217
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,280
You show me yours and
I'll show you mine.

218
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,660
It's going down tonight.

219
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,560
Do you know about that?

220
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,340
I didn't know,I swear.

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,450
Get out of here.

222
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,770
How'd it go?

223
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,390
She found the bomb,linc.

224
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,370
The one we put in her car.

225
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,120
How did she find the bomb,sucre?

226
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,020
I don't know,bro. I'm sorry.

227
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,700
It's not your fault.

228
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,290
Look,I'll make it up to you,I swear.

229
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,930
You can start now. Michael's
in a bit of trouble in sona.

230
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,240
What kind of trouble?

231
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,740
The rain stopped.

232
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,310
- Does that mean...
- No.

233
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,530
The damage is done.

234
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,300
We can't risk waiting.

235
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,120
anything interesting?

236
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,970
Like some coordinates the company
might want to get their hands on?

237
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,020
If they didn't want me out of
here and your nephew was safe,

238
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,240
would you still be doing this?

239
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,270
Breaking out?

240
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,720
No.

241
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,010
Why would you choose to stay if
there was a chance at freedom?

242
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,910
Well,I guess that's the
difference between us.

243
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,190
I'm wiing to pay for my sins.

244
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,940
And I'm not?

245
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,500
That's a good question.

246
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,320
water's coming down pretty
fast up in here,patron.

247
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,590
Yeah. We have to dig faster.

248
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,610
You know,I've been thinking.

249
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,040
It doesn't have to be
every man for himself.

250
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,190
You and I can help each other.

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,110
If i need a hand,I'll
find someone with a spare.

252
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,520
while it's true I may be
lacking something in the west,

253
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,150
I more than make up for it in the north.

254
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,280
Think about it.

255
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,050
Scofield's got us down here
doing manual labor; slave labor.

256
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,580
I ain't no slave.

257
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,930
I'm doing this for me.

258
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,290
Why do you think scofield's
up there and we're down here?

259
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,920
He's planning something.

260
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,460
Who among us isn't?

261
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,850
what the hell is that?

262
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,920
OK,let's unload here

263
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,550
Make the animals walk through the filth

264
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,030
Come here

265
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,740
Let's go

266
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,570
Good.Good!Keep going!

267
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,210
- we're good.
- Yeah.

268
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,790
We're all right. Okay.

269
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,630
yeah.

270
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,810
Hello,Lincoln.

271
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,650
Long time no see.

272
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,850
Not long enough.

273
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,070
I was thinking that we could
have a little chat in person.

274
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,010
Make sure we're all on the same page
about what's gonna happen tonight.

275
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,600
All right.

276
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,680
30 minutes,this location. I'm
sending a text. Can't we just...

277
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,730
Jorge!

278
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,500
Jorge!

279
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,010
Sorry.What's up?

280
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,420
It's payday

281
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,590
You're first

282
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,380
You need to pick up your check

283
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,830
**gracias.

284
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,060
See you later.

285
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,420
hello.

286
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,760
Hey,papi,it's me.

287
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,260
Lincoln said you needed some help.

288
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,200
How much do you know about electricity?

289
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,780
Hey,you're back.

290
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm not real comfortable being
alone down here with those...

291
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,430
what's that?

292
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,130
Syrup; honey.

293
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,810
Make a little pile of
dirt. Gather some dirt.

294
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,000
Scofield said we got to make something
to cover the hole once we get out.

295
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,680
So when the lights go back on it's
gonna look like nobody ever left.

296
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,140
Go ahead. Spread it around.

297
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,180
I was thinking...

298
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,150
we should be a team,you know?

299
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,120
Not just during the escape,but after.

300
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,720
Like,like butch and sundance.

301
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,150
Butch and sundance died.

302
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,130
Well,I mean in the other parts.

303
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,290
Here's an idea.

304
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,880
We go along with scofield's plan,and
then when everyone stops to take a breath,

305
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,200
we grab 'em,burroughs,scofield,bagwell.

306
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,980
We take 'em back home to face charges.

307
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,180
Hell,we'd be heroes.

308
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,640
Might even get a book deal.

309
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,780
We could write it
together,alex. How'd that be?

310
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,110
- A book deal?
- Yeah.

311
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,930
Gonna make you happy,brad?

312
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,210
You got a better idea?

313
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,860
Yeah,I do.

314
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,470
Something to do with a wife and kid?

315
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,460
Yeah,something like that.

316
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,040
You got room for one more?

317
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,380
Come on,alex.

318
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,700
What's a guy like me gonna do?

319
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,270
Let's just let scofield get us out of here,and
then we'll worry about everything else,all right?

320
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:57,780
All right.

321
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,800
Come on. A little more dirt.

322
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,980
Listen very carefully and
do exactly as I tell you.

323
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,270
You sure you don't want linc to do this?

324
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
He knows more about this than I do.

325
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,400
It's not about what you know.

326
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,590
It's about where you work.

327
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,140
And as a sona employee,my friend,you have the
unique ability of not getting shot for being here.

328
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,120
You see the admin building?

329
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,890
I see it.

330
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,450
Go to it and make a left.

331
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,230
To it and left. Got it.

332
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,750
On the other side is a berm.

333
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,190
There should be a metal cage.

334
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,490
That's the backup generator.

335
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,530
Okay,I see it.

336
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,640
Don't let the tower guard
see you get too close.

337
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,860
Just act casual.

338
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,150
When I say now,you
run and duck behind it.

339
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,720
Almost.

340
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,630
Hold on.

341
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,520
Now!

342
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay. Okay.

343
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,610
There should be some
writing near the bottom.

344
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,190
I need the name of the manufacturer,make
and model number,anything.

345
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,330
Yeah,yeah,yeah,I got it,I got it.

346
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,820
It's,uh,it's,uh,prana industrial.

347
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,810
Model number 3210.

348
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,440

1-800-555-1212.

349
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,490
All right. Thanks.

350
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,730
That's all I need.

351
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,620
You really think you can
pull this off tonight?

352
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,100
You want to know the truth?

353
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,020
No,I just want all of it go down smooth.

354
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,780
For everyone to get what they want.

355
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,520
Yeah,I do.

356
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,250
Listen,even if you get this
worked out with the lights,

357
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,180
what are you gonna do
about the jeep patrols?

358
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,460
We're just gonna have
to take our chances.

359
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,740
Maybe you don't.

360
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,090
You all right?

361
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,330
Yeah,I'm fine.

362
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,440
Where's lj?

363
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,070
Somewhere safe.

364
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,630
Take a load off.

365
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,020
Can I offer you a drink?

366
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,360
What's going on,susan?

367
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,710
I just wanted to get everyone together
so we can discuss tonight's agenda.

368
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,410
Maybe nail down a few guidelines.

369
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,890
It's the same as
before,nothing has changed.

370
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Actually,I was thinking we should
probably include all the players.

371
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,190
Don't you?

372
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,280
What are you doing in here?

373
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,040
Just keeping watch.

374
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,160
Make sure nobody tries
to get down to the tunnel.

375
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,420
Who are you calling?

376
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,320
Yeah,hi. Is this,uh,customer service?

377
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah,I'm,uh...

378
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,550
I'm a sub working,building down here in
panama,and,um,we got a client on-site.

379
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,650
They're asking questions about the
3210 generator we're installing.

380
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,040
Yeah. Exactly.

381
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,780
anyway,they want to know,if
the main power shuts down,

382
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,700
how long are they gonna be in the
dark,um,before the generator kicks in?

383
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,070
Yeah. Thanks.I'll hold.

384
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,190
You're a very good liar.

385
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,820
That's the timing?

386
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,060
No,that's,uh... that's it.

387
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,030
Appreciate it.

388
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Well? We gonna make it?

389
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,180
We should have just
enough dark to make it out.

390
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,790
With everyone?

391
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,520
You with whistler?

392
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,010
Yes.

393
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,940
Susan has got a message.

394
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,140
Why?

395
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,450
Put him on.

396
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,720
It's for you.

397
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,520
Yes?

398
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,050
All right,I got him. What now?

399
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,980
Tell him I want him to listen very
carefully to the following instructions.

400
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,500
- She wants you to listen real care...
- I can hear.

401
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,410
Instructions about what?

402
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,610
James?

403
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,840
Was that sofia?

404
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,330
Is she there?

405
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,510
Yeah.

406
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,970
What's going on?

407
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,510
He wants to know what this is about.

408
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,320
All right. I'll tell him.

409
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,220
no!

410
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,970
Was... was that just...

411
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,140
is that sofia?

412
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,370
Is that sofia?

413
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,020
Have you figured out the
coordinates yet,james?

414
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,260
Please.

415
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,390
Almost.

416
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,080
Wrong answer.

417
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,750
- No!
- No!

418
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,870
I'll get them for you when
we get out of here,I swear.

419
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,270
All your promises,your
guarantees-- they mean nothing.

420
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,190
I'm pretty sick of waiting around
for you boys to screw me over.

421
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,580
I want those coordinates
by the end of the day.

422
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,310
we gotta figure this out.

423
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,660
Gotta do something.

424
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,580
Gotta do something.

425
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:44,130
We both know that you can't
just hand over that information.

426
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,130
Why?

427
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,150
Why can't I?

428
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,420
Once they get what they want,they'll have no reason
to keep you or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.

429
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,290
So what do I do?

430
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,710
I,I just,I just let them torture sofia?

431
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,870
We'll work something out.

432
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,750
We'll think it through.

433
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,910
I already have.

434
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,380
Whistler...

435
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,470
whistler.

436
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,310
What is so special about him anyway,huh?

437
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,710
You think he has anything to do with why them
people wanted scofield down here in the first place?

438
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,520
It's really none of my business.

439
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,300
What exactly is your business,alex?

440
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,670
Something on your mind?

441
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,160
I'm just saying...

442
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,680
if we needed a bargaining
chip,do you think...

443
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,870
a sharp stick in that dull
limey would help us out?

444
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,490
There is no "us."

445
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,830
You and me are a lot more
alike than you think,alex.

446
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,480
We both know how it feels
to lose a great love.

447
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,370
How it feels to kill a man.

448
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,360
And we both ended up in here
because of Michael scofield.

449
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,410
Wouldn't it be poetic
justice if we could just...

450
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,140
return the favor?

451
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,140
Justice,huh?

452
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,590
If there was an ounce of
it left in this world...

453
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,670
you'd be lying face down in the same unmarked
grave as the rest of your inbred family.

454
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,030
The only difference between me and you,alex,is
a badge,and the last time I checked,

455
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,090
you didn't even have that,so you can just
keep on hoping for your happy endings,

456
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,810
alex,you just keep on plowing
ahead with them blinders on,

457
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,290
you know,but the thing
about them blinders is...

458
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,350
it makes it really
hard to watch youback.

459
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,210
It's gonna be better soon,I promise.

460
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,600
He's right,you know.

461
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,050
If james loves you the way he says
he does,he'll give us what we want,

462
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,700
and then you and your white knight
can ride off into the sunset.

463
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,170
Unless you're already with him.

464
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,560
You scared,susan?

465
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,460
Do I look scared,Lincoln?

466
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,120
To pull something like this...

467
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,680
you desperate?

468
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,770
You need to stop fighting with me.

469
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,770
If you really understood what was going
on,you would know that we're not the bad guys.

470
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,990
Could've fooled me.

471
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,520
Haven't you ever done the
wrthings for the right reason?

472
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,630
What are the right reasons,susan?

473
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,090
What is it about whistler
that's so important.

474
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,530
I could tell you.

475
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,140
But then I'd have to kill you.

476
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,340
You're gonna do that anyway.

477
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,160
Whistler gives us what we
want,maybe I won't have to.

478
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,760
Linc called.

479
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,070
They're on their way.

480
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,140
I figured them out.

481
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,580
The coordinates.

482
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,490
I'm gonna hand them over.

483
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,320
I thought you should know so you can
take whatever precautions you can.

484
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,600
What if,uh...

485
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,170
what if you give them
the wrong coordinates.

486
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,750
It might buy us some more time.

487
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,720
Maybe linc can get sofia to safety.

488
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,370
Like he did with sara?

489
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,950
I'm sorry. I...

490
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,170
I didn't mean to. I,uh...

491
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,150
I just don't know what else to do.

492
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,060
I'm damned if I do.
I'm damned if I don't.

493
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,210
There's no way to win.

494
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,350
It's not about winning anymore.

495
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,480
It's about surviving-- which
is not the same as giving up.

496
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,930
But you can go gracefully.

497
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,010
There's honor.

498
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,840
Protecting the ones you love.

499
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,610
Honor's a luxury men
like us can't afford.

500
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,230
Can you promise me we'll
make it out of here tonight?

501
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,060
No games.

502
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,070
Can you honestly promise me?

503
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,260
I can promise you I'll
do everything in my power.

504
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,340
I wish that were good enough.

505
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,890
If you do this...

506
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,610
if you give them what they want...

507
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,860
everything that's been lost
will have been for nothing.

508
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,080
Monjares.

509
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,750
What's up?

510
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,790
Take it easy.

511
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,480
Yes,I'd like to speak to
Officer Monjares,plesae

512
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,700
Hey Arturo.phone for you!

513
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,230
Can I talk to you for a minute?

514
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,510
I'm kind of in a hurry

515
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,460
I got some place to be

516
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,690
What's that?

517
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,140
Friends of mine are moving tonight

518
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,650
And they need my help

519
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,190
Tell them you're gonna be late

520
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,220
Let's go

521
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,060
Walk

522
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,440
linc,he's gonna...

523
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,590
he's gonna give it to them.

524
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,280
Relax.

525
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,450
I'll see you in a minute.

526
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,560
What are you talking about?

527
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,650
All clear.

528
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,490
I suppose introductions are
unnecessary at this point.

529
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,050
What are we doing here,gretchen?

530
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,650
We're here to say good-bye.

531
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,260
I promise you,sweetheart,they're
not going to hurt you anymore.

532
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,100
Do you have the coordinates,james?

533
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,990
Yes.

534
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,710
I'm sorry.

535
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,370
- I tried to run away...
- this is not your fault.

536
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,620
It's mine.

537
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,810
When I took this job,I knew
they weren't good people.

538
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,410
I just didn't know how bad they were.

539
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,270
And everything that's happened...

540
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,360
it's all because of me.

541
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,610
And for that I'm truly sorry.

542
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,180
The coordinates.

543
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,670
Just pass them through.

544
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,130
What the hell are you doing?

545
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm buying some goodwill.

546
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,940
You're buying her funeral.

547
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,430
You know I have what you need.

548
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,350
And I'll give you the rest.

549
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,410
But only after I know
that sofia,that lj,

550
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,650
and that these men here...

551
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,600
they're all safe.

552
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,080
Do you understand me?

553
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,860
James...

554
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,970
everything's gonna be all right.

555
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm impressed.

556
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,320
It seems our fisherman grew
himself a set of oysters.

557
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,850
Can you really trust
these men with her life?

558
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,950
Yeah.

559
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,130
Yeah,I believe I can.

560
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,340
All right,james.

561
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:27,710
But there's been some confusion about the
timing of things-- last-minute changes,et cetera.

562
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,520
I'm gonna make this clear
for everyone involved.

563
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,860
If time runs out and I don't have
the second half of those coordinates,

564
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,190
lj and the senorita stop breathing.

565
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,800
Say good-bye,sweetheart.

566
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,470
Lincoln! Linc...

567
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,910
don't be stupid, Lincoln.

568
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,430
I've helped you.

569
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,320
Now you help me.

570
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,220
Please.

571
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,470
Just get us out of here.

572
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,010
- Bout the timing on the backup generator?
- Yeah.

573
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,350
All we got to do now is cut the
power to the exterior lights.

574
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,280
How are you gonna do that?

575
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,770
I'm not-- it can't be
accessed from the inside.

576
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,010
How much time have I got?

577
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,760
Let's say,uh,5:15 tomorrow morning.

578
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,750
That should give us enough time to dig
out the tunnel before the sun comes up.

579
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,090
All right. What about whistler?

580
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,930
What about him?

581
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,660
Well,he manned up-- he could've handed
over the information, but he didn't.

582
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,260
Still concerned about handing him over?

583
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,310
I've got my concerns about
pretty much everybody,linc.

584
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,330
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

585
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,890
Mostly, I'm just tired.

586
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,760
Tired of choices...

587
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,930
consequences.

588
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,130
I just want this to be over... tonight.

589
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,050
Let's do it.

590
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,490
When you're on the run,

591
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,830
you're always looking over your
shoulder,listening for the sirens,

592
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,650
wondering if that pretty girl across the street
is staring at you because she wants you,or...

593
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,540
because you're wanted.

594
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,560
You change your name, the way you look...

595
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,480
and leave everything you ever knew behind.

596
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,220
And the ones you love,they're
the ones who have to pay.

597
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,620
That's what's waiting
for you on the outside.

598
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,540
That's why I couldn't bring you on.

599
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,450
Because nothing good can come of this.

600
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,890
Can anything good come from staying in?

601
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,640
It has to be your decision. I...

602
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,460
I cannot be responsible for you.

603
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,050
You won't have to be.

604
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,350
Does your father still have
that phone number I gave you?

605
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,400
I think so.

606
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,650
Well, tell him to call my brother if he wants
to find out where to pick you up tomorrow.

607
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,930
Does that mean...

608
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,250
it means if a million
things fall into place...

609
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,730
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.

610
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,960
Don't let anyone see
you with that phone.

611
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,250
I think we did it,Michael.

612
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,410
I believe we're ready.

613
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,610
She's a little wet, but she's ready.

614
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,550
Makes me think of the first thing
I'll do when we're gonna get out.

615
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,300
Just,does anybody know what's
spanish for "don't shoot"?

616
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,570
No dispare.

617
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,560
No dis what?

618
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,090
Just relax. Nobody's gonna get shot.

619
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,150
Just don't panic.

620
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,660
As soon as linc cuts the power,we go.

621
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,940
What about the jeep patrol?

622
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,910
Taken care of.

623
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,250
What about the backup generator?

624
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
Backup generator?

625
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,030
Nobody said anything about...

626
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,730
there's a lag from when the power cuts
out to when the generator kicks back in.

627
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,680
Well,how long a lag are
we talking about here?

628
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,930
30 seconds.

629
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,290
You expect us to run in 30 seconds?

630
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,930
As soon as the lights go out, I'm gone.

631
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,240
With or without you.

632
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,320
Please,my friends

633
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,620
They're
expecting me and--

634
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,480
I have some bad news,Jorge

635
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,810
We won't be able to pay you today

636
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,350
That's fine,I-I
can wait until-

637
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,240
When we ran your identification
through processing...

638
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,200
We found a slight problem

639
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,640
What..kind of a problem

640
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,200
You have a warrant out for your arrest

641
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,870
noW.

642
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,260
Let's go.

643
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,840
Off the bus! Now!

644
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,660
As soon as the lights go
out, we got to be ready to move.

645
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,710
You want to tell us what the hell
the taquito's doing down here?

646
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,590
He's coming with us.

647
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,730
I don't think so.

648
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,410
That's not up to you.

649
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,600
******

650
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,370
Oh,you got to be kidding me.

651
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,360
See,we made up our own decision here.

652
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,990
Well, with the time frame
being so short and all,

653
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,610
we'd feel a whole lot better
about things if we go first.

654
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,770
What are you gonna do,kill me?

655
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,600
T-bag: No,no.

656
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,780
- See,if we ain't first,he's not ***
- All right! All right! Just...

657
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,660
Look, I think I can explain all this

658
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,810
If I could just get some
paperwork from my car

659
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,560
You're not going anywhere

660
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,750
Understand?

661
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,680
all right.

662
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,450
All right,go. Just go.

663
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,720
Just go.

664
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,490
Every man for himself, right?

665
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,120
You want to move up in line, too?

666
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,430
No,I think I'm gonna stay back here.

667
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,970
I just don't want to turn my back on anybody.
