young. Will there be cocaine?

Sweetheart, I am young,
informed and very well equipped.

You chose your man wisely.

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,400
I just wish Tommy was here.

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,710
- Where are they?
- I don't know, Tom.

90
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,030
Arthur, John, where are they?

91
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,550
- I don't know.
- I am telling you now, we got lost.

be no bloody uniforms.

Nevertheless. Nevertheless, John.

98
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,070
Despite the bad blood,

99
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,830
I'll have none of it on my carpet.

100
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,030
Now, for Grace's sake,
nothing will go wrong.

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,510
Those bastards out there are her family.

102
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,270
And if you fuckers do anything
to embarrass her, your kin,

103
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,550
your cousins, your horses, your
fucking kids, you do anything...

104
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,630
Tom?

105
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,950
- .. to... What?
- What about snow?

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,750
Yeah, their women are
sports, I'll say that.

107
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,470
No. No. No.

108
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,150
No cocaine.

109
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,990
No cocaine.

110
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,470
No sport. No telling fortunes.

111
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,480
No racing. No fucking sucking
petrol out of their fucking cars.

112
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,510
And you, Charlie, stop
spinning yarns about me, eh?

113
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,830
I'm just trying to sell you to them, Tom.

114
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,150
But the main thing is,
you bunch of fuckers,

115
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,390
despite the provocation from the cavalry,

116
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,110
no fighting!

117
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160
Oi!

118
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,750
No fighting.

119
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,550
No fucking fighting.

120
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,310
No fighting.

121
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,160
NO FUCKING FIGHTING!

122
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,670
Good.

123
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,000
Get the fuck off me!

124
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,990
You're needed downstairs.

125
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,790
Grace, you're needed
downstairs. People are hungry.

126
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,310
I was putting Charles to sleep.

127
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,430
I'll come down, but not
with you like this.

128
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,420
All right, fine.

129
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,470
Tommy.

130
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,710
I thought today was the reason for
the way you've been acting lately.

131
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,760
I know there's business on your mind.

132
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,190
And I know there always will be.

133
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,230
- Yeah. - Look. I am sorry
they wore their uniforms.

134
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,230
Yeah, they fucking did,
eh? They fucking did.

135
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,280
But I can tell it's more than that.

136
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,350
You've been like this for weeks.

137
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,230
I need you to tell me that it's
business making you like this...

138
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,620
and not regret over me.

139
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,580
Say it out loud and
I'll know if it's true.

140
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,960
It's business, Grace.

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,100
And bad, bad business it is, all round.

142
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,270
And I'm scared, Grace.

143
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,510
I'm scared for you.

144
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,390
I'm scared for the baby.

145
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,350
And this is how I am when I'm scared.

146
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,110
It is unfamiliar to you but not to me.

147
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,600
I can fucking be scared and carry on.

148
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,160
And it's not pleasant to look
at and no joy to be around.

149
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,200
All right?

150
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,560
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,060
We just made vows to share everything.

152
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,460
Tell me what it is you're afraid of.

153
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,430
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

154
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,340
Arthur's speech.

155
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,420
I'm scared of fucking Arthur's speech.

156
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,960
All right?

157
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
Me too.

158
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,710
Tommy, what are you doing?

159
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,230
Tommy, there's half the British
Army waiting for us downstairs.

160
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,440
They're King's Irish. We waited
two weeks in the mud for them.

161
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,350
Tommy.

162
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,230
There are things that if I take them off

163
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,750
I won't be able to put back on.

164
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,470
That's good.

165
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,990
Hello, Mrs Shelby.

166
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm sorry for being busy in my head.

167
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,790
Let us complete the ceremony.

168
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,870
Hey, listen. Listen. Listen.

169
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,790
What do you call an animal with
a prick halfway up its back?

170
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,780
A cavalry horse.

171
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,950
He gets it.

172
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,030
Fuck it. Fuck it.

173
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,310
Where the bloody hell are they?

174
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,760
You're best man, Arthur. Go and find them.

175
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,270
Yeah.

176
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,990
That's completely nonsense.

177
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,230
You know, we're part of a serious
political movement and organisation.

178
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,670
They're not "secret little
meetings", they're just meetings.

179
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,830
We talk about the world,
about the people in it,

180
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,510
about our current political
landscape and what's going on.

181
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,710
You know, we really need to re-evaluate

182
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,430
the way our government has...

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,110
- Very strange indeed.
- Polly, he's looking over.

184
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,830
But, erm...

185
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,220
He's coming. He bloody is.

186
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,950
Fuck. It's the wrong one.

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,070
What do you mean the wrong
one? How many are there?

188
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,830
There's two giving me the
eye. I prefer the other one.

189
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,020
He looked harmless.

190
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,830
It must be that bloody lipstick

191
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Tommy brought you back from New York.

192
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,350
I couldn't help noticing
you are unaccompanied.

193
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,340
I also am alone.

194
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,990
May I join you?

195
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,670
Tommy?

196
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,390
Oh. Didn't see a thing.

197
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,150
Not see a thing. Sorry, brother.

198
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,310
I need you downstairs.

199
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,510
That's all right, we're
done. Are you good?

200
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,590
- Yeah. Never been better.
- Yeah.

201
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,480
- Are you drunk?
- No. No.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,270
Here.

203
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,950
All right, just one drink, then.

204
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,670
Linda's a good woman, Arthur.

205
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,070
Good whisky.

206
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,700
A good man needs to
hold out sometimes, eh?

207
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,950
I won't mention this
in my speech, then, eh?

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,470
Not unless you want to get cut, Arthur.

209
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,320
Sorry, sister.

210
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,990
Right. Look. Tell the maids
to break out the champagne.

211
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,510
I'll be down in a minute.

212
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,390
Champagne, yeah. OK.

213
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,440
- Got it right here.
- Good. - I'm ready. - Good.

214
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,340
Where are you from?

215
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm a refugee.

216
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,750
From where?

217
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,120
Russia.

218
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,350
In the past few months
Thomas has developed some

219
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,200
business interests with Russia.

220
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,870
I see he has confided in you.

221
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,670
Hm.

222
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,320
You need his permission
to even speak to me.

223
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,750
My senior position within
the Shelby company means

224
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,510
I don't often have to ask permission
from anyone to do anything.

225
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,190
So perhaps you'll just tell me

226
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,520
why the fuck you're talking Russian
business on Thomas's wedding day.

227
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,190
Hold on, wait a second.

228
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,230
- So you're saying I'm not allowed a man.
- It's about your choice of man.

229
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm not allowed a man on my arm?

230
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,990
Fucking bastard.

231
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,670
Michael, speeches. Come on.

232
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,310
Arthur. You know why he
didn't come, don't you?

233
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,790
Why who didn't come?

234
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,070
My bloody man.

235
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,310
Oh, you mean the wop?

236
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,950
I just heard there was a
fire at his restaurant.

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,190
Midnight last night.

238
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,310
And a smashed back window
and a smell of petrol.

239
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,270
Lizzie, we tried to
talk some sense into you.

240
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,710
We did checks on him.

241
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,910
He's had five different
names in the last six years

242
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,670
- and he's got connections with the
Naples boys. - Come on, Michael.

243
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,830
What do you know about love,
about when lightning strikes?

244
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,310
So, it was lightning, hmm? Not petrol.

245
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,990
- I thought you were off the
whisky, Arthur. - Yeah, I am.

246
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,670
I'm having a couple now and again

247
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,110
to remind myself why I don't drink it.

248
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,310
You set fire to his
restaurant to stop him coming.

249
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,720
You have no right to choose who
I step out with in my own time!

250
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,720
Lizzie, you now have an important
position in this company.

251
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,300
You got the order the same as us.

252
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,120
You can do it.

253
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,790
Until further notice...

254
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,940
no fraternising with the foreigners.

255
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,030
Yeah, well, you can tell Tommy from me

256
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,440
all the girls in the office think
he's losing his fucking mind.

257
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,910
To the bride.

258
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,560
The bride.

259
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,190
And now, according to tradition,

260
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,790
my best man will say a few words.

261
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,440
Go on! Here he goes! Go on, Arthur!

262
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,230
I'd like to, erm... I'm
not one for speeches.

263
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,510
Sing, then!

264
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,030
I will later, John.

265
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,200
But I do, erm...

266
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,980
I do have some words written down here...

267
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,620
.. on this piece of paper.

268
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,030
This doesn't include
everything that I want to say...

269
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,390
(Arthur, just read what
we wrote down, eh?)

270
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,230
I will.

271
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,190
I will, mm-hmm.

272
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,910
But first...

273
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,280
First a few words from the heart.

274
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,500
Erm...

275
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,430
This man here, my brother, Tommy,

276
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,670
helped me survive through
some of the worst times.

277
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,750
It's a wedding, Arthur, tell a joke.

278
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,390
Yeah. Tell a joke.

279
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,310
What I am trying to say is this.

280
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,350
My brother,

281
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,200
and the love of a good woman...

282
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,160
.. pulled me through that time.

283
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,520
Now Tommy also has the
love of a good woman.

284
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Her name's Grace.

285
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,950
Like the grace of the good Lord.

286
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,270
And even though the circumstances
of their union was tragic...

287
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,830
Right, let's... Arthur,
let's raise a toast, eh?

288
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,350
To love, to peace, to marriage.

289
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,340
And to marriage.

290
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,310
Well done, Arthur. Beautiful speech.

291
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,030
Really nice.

292
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,260
Really, really nice.

293
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,390
Where's he fucking going now?

294
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,590
I think I messed it up.

295
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,750
No, not a bit.

296
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,430
You spoke with such truth.

297
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,550
And God heard you.

298
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,110
Can I have a word with
my brother, please, Linda?

299
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,260
What he was going to say was beautiful.

300
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,640
Alone, please.

301
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,480
All right. Come here.

302
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,320
Come here.

303
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,510
We talked about this, Arthur.

304
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,430
That's why we wrote it all down.

305
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,270
Most of Grace's side don't even
know her husband killed himself.

306
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,350
They think it was an accident.

307
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,950
- I know.
- You know.

308
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,390
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

309
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,040
What do you think I am, hm?

310
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,190
What do you think I am, Tommy, eh?

311
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,870
You think I'm a fucking idiot...

312
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,990
- All right, boys? - Yep. - Don't you?

313
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,390
Come on. Having a good night.

314
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,950
- You think I would say it?
- That's it. Right.

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,070
Yeah. Keep walking. You nosy bastards.

316
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,110
- Hey, you stay away from me, Tommy.
- Fucking hell.

317
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,160
You stay away from me, I've had it.

318
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,760
Ah, shit.

319
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,420
- Yeah. - Argh! - Yeah.

320
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,120
Argh.

321
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,910
Argh!

322
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,220
Ah, shit.

323
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,150
Three shots I've had, that's it.

324
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,590
- I know. - I drew the line. - I know.

325
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,590
I know you've turned a corner.

326
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,630
- Arthur. - Yeah. - I know.

327
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,950
- Yeah. I'm your best man.
- I know.

328
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,590
I wasn't going to tell no-one.

329
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,990
It's all right. It's done.

330
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,150
Get up. Get up.

331
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,600
Get up.

332
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,150
Right...

333
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,310
The Russians have made contact.

334
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,110
We have to get used to how
these bastards operate.

335
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,630
For them, family is a weakness
and they go after them.

336
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,750
For me, family is my strength.
And there's business to be done

337
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,070
and I need you.

338
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,870
Now, fuck speeches, fuck weddings.

339
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,920
You're my best man every fucking day.

340
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,870
OK.

341
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,070
Yeah?

342
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,550
Now go and get John, get him sobered up.

343
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,480
Find Johnny Dogs. It's the
Russians through the smoke tonight.

344
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,480
- All right.
- Good.

345
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,240
Oh, and, Arthur...

346
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,910
In future, it's not always
right to listen to Linda.

347
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,670
It's full of gypsies and blacks.

349
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,800
Grace says he exports
automobiles to the colonies.

350
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,140
Pol, now.

351
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,230
So, what does he say?

352
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,030
He won't meet you unless
you give us the name.

353
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,630
What name?

354
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,800
We were told to ask for a code
name when contact was made.

355
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,190
Constantine.

356
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,640
The code is Constantine.

357
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,870
Tommy said no racing, no gambling.

358
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,230
Yeah, he's changed his mind. Right!

359
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,510
Don't worry, Finn, OK?

360
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,790
Cavalry boys ride like a sack of stones.

361
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,710
John, there's an awful lot of
King's shillings around here today.

362
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,910
Now, out of loyalty to the regiment,

363
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,950
they'll all be putting their money
on this bad boy that I filled up

364
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,950
with morphine and water.

365
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,270
Here, Tommy's all right
if I do the book, is he?

366
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,710
He said betting's OK,

367
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,670
but all proceeds go to the
Shelby Foundation charity.

368
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,750
This charity of his for real, then?

369
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,870
He says he wants to be seen giving
back to the poor of Birmingham.

370
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,910
That'll be me, John. Myself, if I
can't earn a shilling here tonight.

371
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,150
- Huh? - They'll make him
fucking Lord Mayor next.

372
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,990
- That's the idea, Charlie boy.
- Fucking hell.

373
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,630
Right. All you lot make as
much noise and fuss as you can.

374
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,110
Especially fucking you.

375
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,190
Ah. So, we're a fucking
distraction, John, is it?

376
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,190
Tommy's doing business on a
night he should be just fucking.

377
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,270
Right, place your bets with me.
Your favourites. Your favourites.

378
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,710
Come on, boys.

379
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,510
Cos I hope my wife's friend doesn't
fall off the fucking horse.

380
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,990
Come on!

381
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,510
For charity?!

382
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,030
Shut up.

383
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,270
Ah, you found it.

384
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
We nearly gave up.

385
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,900
Did he tell you what
my business with him is?

386
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,590
The same shit the Turks used to smoke.

387
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,600
I wonder, why does he trust his
aunt more than his brothers?

388
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,760
Go and watch the race, boys.

389
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,040
The Turk's clean.

390
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,000
- I am Russian.
- Same fucking thing.

391
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,550
So you make contact on my wedding day.

392
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,510
You now have very powerful enemies,

393
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,310
at the Soviet Embassy and
within your own government.

394
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,950
You are being watched --

395
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,710
at your house, your office,

396
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,030
your clubs, your bars.

397
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,750
You best be quick or I'll be
missed. Where's the money?

398
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,400
The Duke's niece is
bringing it from London.

399
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,550
I was told money on contact.

400
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,800
10,000 in US dollars.

401
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,150
My employer only trusts members
of his family with cash.

402
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,280
She will be at Snow Hill
Station at ten o'clock.

403
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,750
A woman alone in Birmingham
with 10,000 in cash.

404
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,590
She also has a revolver.

405
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,110
- Oh, I see.
- I thought you trusted women.

406
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,470
I don't trust Birmingham.
I'll have her picked up.

407
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,390
- By who?
- By the police, pal.

408
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
This is our city.

409
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,190
Fucking beautiful horse, Tom.

410
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,830
Beautiful.

411
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,630
- He's a natural, that boy.
- Yeah. Good posture.

412
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,110
- Rides like Dad.
- Right, listen to me.

413
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,150
Tell Johnny Dogs and his boys
to light a fire in the woods.

414
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,600
A big one, to take meat.

415
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,400
Send Finn to watch the gates.
Moss is bringing someone.

416
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,720
You don't?

417
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,510
I just needed to bring you
somewhere nobody could see.

418
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,390
But your friend gave this to
me. He said you all did it.

419
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,150
Not me. But it's all right.

420
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,540
Go on.

421
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,060
I see you don't either.

422
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,230
Don't be silly. Everyone does.

423
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,190
- So go on, then. Cut the snow.
- We call it Tokyo.

424
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,390
We call it whatever the customer calls it.

425
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,560
In London we were told
you were all gangsters.

426
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,870
So that's why you got on the
train to dirty old Birmingham.

427
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,190
For a dirty old night.

428
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,190
- You don't look like the others.
- That's the idea.

429
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,640
I put it all together but I don't partake.

430
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,060
See, I've got a bright future, you see?

431
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,070
Mapped out.

432
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,220
But you want me to be
like them, don't you?

433
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,150
There's a cavalry officer
stationed in Ceylon.

434
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
When his tour of duty ends
in March, we will be engaged.

435
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,710
So I have a bright future too.

436
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,430
Mapped out.

437
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,220
But you want to try things first.

438
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,600
No. Keep it.

439
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,080
As if I were a whore.

440
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,180
If that's the game you want to play...

441
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,150
Polly.

442
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,040
Hello, Grace.

443
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,500
You look absolutely beautiful.

444
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,350
Welcome to the family.

445
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,980
Oh, I see. Tommy's orders.

446
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,710
No upsets tonight.

447
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,700
Your hair, everything. Beautiful.

448
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,910
Do you know where he is?

449
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,070
Yes.

450
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,720
Yes, I do.

451
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,560
You know, Tommy really wants to
keep certain things a secret from me.

452
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,950
But it's very hard when
you're man and wife.

453
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,190
We were late coming down
because we were having sex.

454
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,180
Afterwards he told me everything.

455
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,480
Royalist Russians buying weapons
to fight the Bolsheviks in Georgia.

456
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,350
A lost cause, Tommy says.

457
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,990
Churchill is the go-between but
it's against government policy

458
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,140
so everything must be kept a secret.

459
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,660
You know it's begun.

460
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,040
They started the business tonight.

461
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,840
No.

462
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,140
I didn't.

463
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,680
But you just told me, so thank you.

464
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Let's not forget, I used
to do this for a living.

465
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,380
Oh, I haven't forgotten, sweetheart.

466
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,870
It's only Thomas that's
forgotten what you are.

467
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,630
Ladies and gentlemen.

468
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,470
The bride and the groom
will now dance alone.

469
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,340
Polly just told me there's
business being done.

470
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,300
I didn't ask them to come.

471
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
Tommy, please don't let
anything happen tonight.

472
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,280
Just get this business done and
get away from things like this.

473
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,790
I'll run the foundation,

474
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,780
you run the tracks and sell cars.

475
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,800
Promise me. Hm?

476
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,540
A wedding vowel.

477
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,000
I promise.

478
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,920
No guns in the house and
Charles will never see one.

479
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,140
I love you, Thomas Shelby.

480
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,710
You keep us safe.

481
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,870
I love you.

482
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,320
And I promise I will make us safe.

483
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,700
Ladies and gentlemen, you may now join.

484
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,500
Gatehouse. Come on.

485
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,070
Tommy, Arthur, Collins,

486
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,640
may I introduce you to the Grand
Duchess Tatiana Petrovna...

487
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,750
.. from Tbilisi, Georgia?

488
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,230
Grand Duchess, may I introduce
you to the Shelby brothers?

489
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,680
Small Heath, Birmingham.

490
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,420
And, erm, good luck with this one, Tom.

491
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,070
Give me the money.

492
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,870
I was told to give it to Mr Kaledin.

493
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,820
Whoever it is up there,
he gave the wrong name.

494
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,910
We asked him the name and
he gave the wrong one.

495
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,760
- What name did he give?
- No.

496
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,230
I don't trust any of you.

497
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,980
Now you give me the money.

498
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,270
I know Mr Kaledin by sight
from Tbilisi. Is his hair dark?

499
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,790
The instructions I was given
was anyone using the wrong

500
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,080
code name was an infiltrator
for the Soviet Embassy.

501
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,030
Just let me go to the house.

502
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,580
I do not want this shit
anywhere near my fucking house.

503
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,870
All I know is no variations.

504
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,710
That's from Churchill himself.

505
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,840
Whoever is up at the house, he
gave the wrong fucking name.

506
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,840
And you do this to me on
my fucking wedding day.

507
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
The money is in the car, Mr Shelby.

508
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,020
Fetch it out and count it.

509
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,840
Good. Finn.

510
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,560
Yeah. We're good.

511
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,150
You can go. Moss.

512
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,000
Can you do it?

513
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,020
Can you kill?

514
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,800
Moss, you take the Duchess
back to Birmingham.

515
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,310
Righto, Tom.

516
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,030
Go on, love.

517
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,880
That's right.

518
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,830
You've got to tell me the reason,

519
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,280
otherwise I'll never be able to trust you.

520
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,630
The truth is...

521
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,790
.. that I slept with the wife of
one of the colonels who sat for me.

522
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,440
But that was 12 years ago...

523
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,620
.. and the aristocracy don't
believe in forgiveness.

524
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,940
Neither do the Shelbys.

525
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,150
So we kill him?

526
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,870
He's a Red.

527
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,990
We're being paid by the Whites.
It's part of the contract.

528
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,580
Contract!

529
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,030
We should never have got into this, Tom.

530
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,220
There was no choice.

531
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,870
A factory break-in, that's what you said.

532
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,320
Yeah, that's what it is.

533
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,060
There's some shit that goes with it.

534
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,920
And who shovels it? Hm?

535
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,080
Who fucking shovels it? Eh?

536
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,230
- I fucking know.
- Arthur.

537
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,020
- I fucking know.
- Arthur...

538
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,990
There's ten times where
that's coming from, ten times,

539
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,550
for lifting vehicles off
a fucking shop floor.

540
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,990
Vehicles, Tommy. Fucking vehicles.

541
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,350
Nothing about tanks.

542
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,750
Arthur, you listen to me.

543
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,790
You listen to me, all right?

544
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,830
There are powerful people in this country

545
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,870
who want to help these mad bastards,

546
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,390
including the King, Churchill
and half the fucking Tory party.

547
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,390
And if we refuse, Arthur,
if we fucking refuse,

548
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,830
they will see to it that we
hang for all of our many sins.

549
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,270
Now, we've never earned
money like this. Never.

550
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,870
We'll use it to buy the
wharf at Boston docks.

551
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,920
That's why I've asked for dollars.

552
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,400
And when it's done it's business as usual.

553
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Come on, brother. It's my wedding night.

554
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,670
- Where's John? - Looking
for Esme. - Right.

555
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,950
Ruben Oliver. Portrait artist.

556
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,320
I really enjoyed the depiction
of you in the dining room.

557
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,280
Nice to meet you, Mr Oliver.

558
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,640
Danny, ragtime.

559
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,350
So, where were we?

560
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,110
- Crimea. - I mean before
I bored you with war.

561
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,640
- Politics.
- Yes.

562
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,070
You are the only one in your
family who is a communist.

563
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,520
Some of them are, they just don't know it.

564
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,590
And you are very close family, yes?

565
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,740
Mm, always within punching distance.

566
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,270
What does that mean?

567
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,420
It means yeah, we're a close family.

568
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,640
Arthur?

569
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,540
I do apologise for the interruption.

570
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,110
There is a woman here
to see you, Mr Kaledin.

571
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
She just arrived.

572
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,070
- So Tatiana made it from
London safely? - Yes.

573
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,220
- Where is she?
- Out by the stables.

574
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,580
Can I use the lavatory?

575
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,620
You can piss outside...

576
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,510
.. by the stables.

577
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,590
Very sensible idea, Mr Shelby.

578
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,640
Clear the air away from the ladies.

579
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,710
We are rather like
generals here, aren't we?

580
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,870
Watching our men do battle.

581
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,280
We are a bit too close to the
fighting to be generals, surely.

582
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,670
You know, Mr Shelby, some of
us only agreed to come today

583
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,990
to bless this union because
of your exemplary war record.

584
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,080
But as Grace's uncle, and a kind
of father to her for many years...

585
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:49,550
.. I am still deeply uneasy about
the many stories of corruption

586
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,340
and violence.

587
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,380
Drink the fucking wine and smile.

588
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,310
That's what I'm doing.

589
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,380
Oh, you got me good there.

590
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,480
Oh, you fucking bastard.

591
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,470
- Don't shoot.
- No!

592
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,870
- For the love of
God. Don't shoot. - No!

593
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,190
- No! - For the love of
God! - No! No! No! No! No!

594
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,910
- No!
- For the love of God!

595
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,960
- What was that?
- Probably just a car backfiring.

596
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,120
It wasn't the day I was expecting.

597
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,240
Nor me.

598
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,030
But it's over now.

599
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,620
Tomorrow it'll be just us.

600
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,440
Come here.

601
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,060
The water froze in my car.

602
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,780
They said I could stay.

603
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,960
I know this is preposterous.

604
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,940
Plenty of other rooms to stay in.

605
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,230
- Goodnight, Mr Oliver.
- You have my card.

606
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,480
Any time you're in
London we could have tea.

607
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,780
I went looking for you.

608
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,200
I thought you'd be in here.

609
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
I knew it.

610
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,100
I wanted to end with a bit of peace.

611
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,590
Look what I found.

612
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,440
It's beautiful. Thanks.

613
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,520
Arthur, you mustn't worry about
what happened with the speech.

614
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,400
What was in your heart was beautiful.

615
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,940
God hears all the speeches
that don't get said.

616
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,880
And isn't it nice to still be
yourself at this time of night?

617
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,880
Close your eyes, Arthur, and spend
a minute thinking about that.
