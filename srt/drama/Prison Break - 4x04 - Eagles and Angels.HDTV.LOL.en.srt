<i>Previously on Prison Break</i>

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,260
They refer to it as Scylla.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,660
It's like the company's black book.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
- What's that?
- Wireless hard drive that swallows up

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,930
any electronic data
within ten feet of it.

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,960
And the information
embedded in Scylla?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,700
If we can get close enough...

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,460
it's ours.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,160
If Scylla was like a pizza,

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,530
all we got is a slice.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,330
So Scylla isn't one card,

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,630
it's six.

13
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,000
They killed my boy.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,500
I need to find out who did it.

15
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:29,404
Rise and shine, bitch!

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,430
Breakfast.

17
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,730
Hello?

18
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,630
Cole Pfeiffer, Gregory White here.

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,800
I'll see you at Gate
first thing tomorrow.

20
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,100
And I will personally
hand you...

21
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,460
your bonus check.

22
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,231
Sara Tancredi's somewhere
safe, isn't she, Bruce?

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,700
So tell me, where is Sara?

24
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,400
Los Angeles?

25
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,300
Good job.

26
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,510
It wasn't a meeting between two
Scylla cardholders, Agent Self.

27
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,233
It was a meeting between
all six cardholders.

28
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,038
So now we know who has the other five cards.

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,384
Hey. You got anything
off the video?

30
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,000
Ah, it's a camera
phone 50 feet away.

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,762
So, it's pretty grainy.
Still printing.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,430
You ever been on
one of those?

33
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,360
Yeah.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,430
I was still drinking at the time,

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,830
so I don't remember much.

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,000
Told I was a lot of fun.

37
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:39,030
You?

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,930
No.

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,130
Not a lot of yachts
where I'm from.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,960
I always kind of wanted
to live on one.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,800
I thought it'd be nice to have
the ocean as my front yard.

42
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,609
The ocean is your front yard.

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,600
What's wrong with the
SS Minnow back there?

44
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,830
Nothing.

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,760
You really want to drop
that thing in the water someday

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,860
and sail off to parts unknown?

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah, why not?

48
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,930
As long as it's you and me.

49
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,530
I like the sound of that.

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,230
Yo, Papi.

51
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,300
We got something.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,053
One day.

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,130
What's up?

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,930
Uh, we got a,
we got a license plate.

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,900
It's a printout from
the camera phone.

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,320
The numbers
are fuzzy, though.

57
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:41,230
The whole damn thing's fuzzy.

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,160
Forget the numbers.

59
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,360
What's that next to the plate?

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,330
Looks like a sticker.

61
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,800
- DMV?
- That's a flag.

62
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,491
It's a diplomatic plate.

63
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,130
The Six Ps, guys.
When I supervised 32 COs

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,830
back at Fox River...
it was the Six Ps made it happen.

65
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,100
Can you blow it up?

66
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,530
I need to see more detail.

67
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm already on it.

68
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,141
Prior, Planning, Prevents,
Piss-Poor, Performance.

69
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,926
How about you quit shaking your ass
and say what's on your mind?

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,130
The second step.
Deciphering the cards, the break-in.

71
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,830
We need to plan.

72
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,160
Agent Self will provide
that information.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,020
You worked with Whistler.

74
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,600
Didn't he say anything
about a location?

75
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,660
Wasn't that in his bird book?

76
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,030
Which T-Bag has.

77
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,530
If he made it out of Sona alive.

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,330
Finding where the break-in
is doesn't mean anything

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,600
if we don't have the cards.

80
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,130
Here's your flag.

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,930
- Algeria?
- Turkey.

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,000
Find out where the
Turkish Consul is in town.

83
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,930
You know what?
Get with the program.

84
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,030
You're up.

85
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,139
The guy's name is Erol Tabak.
Consulate is downtown.

86
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,900
Yeah but we can't get
into the consulate.

87
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,330
We can follow him from there.

88
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,160
Michael.

89
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,362
I'm gonna stay back
and work on the video.

90
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,130
Okay.

91
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,000
- One day.
- One day.

92
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,782
Cole Pfeiffer, how are ya?

93
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,900
Cole.

94
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,960
Pfeiffer.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,822
P-f-e-i-f-e...
Damn it!

96
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,218
Cole Pfeiffer,
how are ya?

97
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,800
No.

98
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,300
No.

99
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,330
Call me Cole, please.

100
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,530
P-f-e-i-f... e...

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
Damn!

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,100
Breaking down...

103
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,563
the captivity of negativity.
That's what we're doing here.

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
That's what we're
doing here at Gate.

105
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,500
And I would encourage all of you to...

106
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,200
Huh.

107
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,960
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,960
...f-e-r.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,300
P-f-e-i-f...

110
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,430
P-f-e-i-f-f-e-r.

111
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,030
What do diplomats usually do?

112
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,660
Not a whole lot, but they
park anywhere they want.

113
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,501
Put this on the dash.

114
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,066
Can we get any closer?

115
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,230
That's our guy.

116
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,100
Yeah?

117
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,500
We're copying.

118
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,800
He's got the card on him.

119
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,060
<i>Hell, yes.</i>

120
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,200
That's his wife?

121
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,560
Sign me up.

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,430
You lost it.

123
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,100
How?

124
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,502
Dude, I don't know what to tell you
other than you lost it. It's gone man.

125
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,130
We lost it.

126
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,700
What?!

127
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,737
How did we lose him?
We're right next to him.

128
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,760
He's not the cardholder.

129
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,218
She is.

130
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,260
We gotta get out of here
now before we get made.

131
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,400
Come on, go! Go!

133
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,600
You know what we've
got in common, right?

134
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,660
What?

135
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,972
We both live in the real world as
opposed to these other knuckleheads.

136
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:49,524
So that whole prior planning
thing you were talking about,

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
if you got something
on your mind

138
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,160
and no one else is interested,
you just run it by me, okay?

139
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:55,397
And we'll just leave it at that.
All right?

140
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,860
Hello?

141
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:09,702
<i>Sara.</i>

142
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,760
Hey, it's Don Self.

143
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
<i>Listen, um,</i>

144
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,300
I have some bad news.

145
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,401
Bruce Bennett was found dead
in his apartment this morning.

146
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,097
Lisa, come in.
This will be quick.

148
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,230
I know you're on a schedule.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,970
The value of the kip
is at ten right now.

150
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,600
I'll let you know as
soon as it reaches 15.

151
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,930
At that point, you'll
have to leave immediately.

152
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,787
I have my bags with me.
I could go now.

153
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,800
Don't you have that event tonight?

154
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:54,600
Yes.

155
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,730
But I--

156
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,100
It's important to keep up appearances.

157
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,600
Not arouse suspicion.

158
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
Fine.

159
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,903
I have no doubt in your
leadership abilities, Lisa, but--

160
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,900
Good. Nor do I.

161
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,460
So I won't keep you any longer.

162
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,260
Please...

163
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,443
be safe.

164
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,500
There she is.

165
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,400
All right, do what you gotta do.

166
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,760
Be next to her for two minutes
so the device can copy the card.

167
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,860
I'll get it.

168
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,500
Take a seat.
Take a seat.

169
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,260
See the three suits?

170
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,860
Forming a triangle around her?

171
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,600
Those are private contractors.

172
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,023
The Company would only do that
for the inner circle.

173
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,600
We're not getting
anywhere near that lady.

174
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,000
- Not today.
- Great.

175
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,860
What's wrong?

176
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,495
Hey, Teddy.

177
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,160
Well, if it ain't the Brothers Grim.

178
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,660
Easy, Linc! Remember,
we need him.

179
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,730
Now what are you
doing in Los Angeles?

180
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,830
I was thinking about maybe
getting me a career in pictures.

181
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,340
If anyone's got a right
to be pissed, it's me.

182
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,300
You put me out to
pasture back in Panama.

183
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,060
Left me for dead.

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,430
Which makes it the third time,
I believe. So, congratulations!

185
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,560
- You got yourself a turkey.
- Where's the bird book?

186
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,500
Bird book?

187
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,530
Where's the book?!

188
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,430
Ooh, look who's looking, pretty.

189
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,530
Look who's looking.

190
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,530
I don't think the two of you are
supposed to be carousing around

191
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,000
the Angel City any more than I am.

192
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,500
You don't know what you've
gotten yourself into, Teddy.

193
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,960
But you don't want to find out,

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,630
and you're gonna tell us
where that bird book is.

195
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,260
You're gonna let me go right now,

196
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,230
or all of us are
going down together.

197
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:34,560
Your choice.

198
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,160
Linc, come on.

199
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,400
WYATT: Tancredi. T-A-N...

200
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,200
C-R-E-D-I.

201
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,500
Make it a buckshot across the grid.

202
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,530
35-mile radius.

203
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,837
If she or any of those
other names come up, call me.

204
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,260
<i>FEMALE VOICE: Confirmed.</i>

205
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,530
Where are you?

206
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,630
Los Angeles.

207
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,330
Trailing Dr. Sara Tancredi.

208
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,430
I ask for the knights,
you're chasing a pawn.

209
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,200
She's irrelevant.

210
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,600
Not to Scofield.

211
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,659
<i>If anyone knows what rock
he's hiding under, it's her.</i>

212
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,905
What about Gretchen?

213
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm having her softened up,

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but I question the merit
of keeping her alive.

215
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,800
I don't think you should allow--

216
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,130
She must know something.

217
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,960
She lives until she talks.

218
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,460
Now, I have something else
I need you to do for me.

219
00:11:51,232 --> 00:11:53,560
It seems a former employee...

220
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
is looking into Scylla.

221
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,530
T-Bag's in town?

222
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,200
Yeah, but we lost him.

223
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,560
He could be anywhere by now.

224
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,660
It's not where he is.
It's what he's doing.

225
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,028
He blew this whole
thing for all of us.

226
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:10,500
- Where's Sara?
- The boat.

227
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:17,036
Of course it's my fault
that he's dead.

228
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,630
- That's not true.
- We both know it is.

229
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,830
I shouldn't have called him.

230
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,600
I knew that. I should never
have reached out to him.

231
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,660
I shouldn't have
involved him in any--

232
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,100
Bennett chose to help you.

233
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,260
The Company killed him...
not you.

234
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,460
Listen to me, Sara. This is...

235
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,200
This is not your fault.

236
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,260
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,030
I'm really sorry.

238
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,798
Hi. Can I help you?

239
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,008
With that smile
you already have.

240
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,096
I'm Cole Pfeiffer.

241
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,445
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh,
welcome to Los Angeles.

242
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:24,995
No, please! Call me Cole.

243
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,862
Uh, Mr. White is looking forward
to meeting with you,

244
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,700
uh, Cole, but he's just
running a few minutes late.

245
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,100
Precisely how few minutes
are we talking about?

246
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,800
Oh, it shouldn't take long.

247
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,600
You can have a seat
right over there.

248
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh. Ooh, I almost forgot.

249
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,660
You already have a message.

250
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,930
I do?

251
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,500
Mm-hmm. Mr. Xing called.
Twice.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,390
I guess your reputation
precedes you.

253
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,883
I guess so.

254
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,730
Don Self.

255
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,055
When did they find the body?

256
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,830
This morning.

257
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,443
They're saying it was a suicide,
but you and I know better.

258
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,060
So I need to ask you
something very important, okay?

259
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,900
Did Bruce Bennet
know where you are now?

260
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,060
I don't know.

261
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,076
Because if he did,
there's a damn good chance

262
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,600
that the Company
does now too. Okay?

263
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,230
So you need to work double time.

264
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,460
Get some eyes in the back
of your head, you understand?

265
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,527
Look, I appreciate the
motivational speech,

266
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,422
but how about you figure out
where we have to break-in

267
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,979
so we can decode those cards?

268
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:41,221
I've, I've got...

269
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,025
<i>other guys doing
some digging, okay?</i>

270
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:45,530
Actually, you might have two.

271
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,530
Well, what are you...
what are you talking about?

272
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,500
His name is Theodore Bagwell.

273
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,836
He was with us in Panama,
and now he's here in Los Angeles,

274
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:56,285
and he has a book that used to belong
to Whistler, and Mahone thinks...

275
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,300
Mahone thinks this book
has a plan for the break-in.

276
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,860
You've got to be kidding me.

277
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,229
I wish I were.

278
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,804
<i>You've reached Jasper Potts.
Leave a message.</i>

279
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,230
Hey, it's me. Listen,
I need that information

280
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,360
we talked about, like yesterday,
you understand?

281
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,830
Call me back. Call... me... back,
as soon as possible.

282
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,030
Lisa Tabak.

283
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,300
Wife of the Turkish Consul.

284
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,360
Married four years,
children... none.

285
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,379
Listed as the logistician in
the executive profile for SENSA,

286
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,530
a privately funded think tank
with offices in D.C,

287
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,100
New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles.

288
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,547
Yeah, and the only thing I want to
know about this chick is her schedule.

289
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,060
What she's doing,
where she's going.

290
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,500
We might not have that kind of time.

291
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,600
This morning, when she
first got out of the car,

292
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,300
she had a suitcase.

293
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,167
Well, let's check the airlines, match
her name against any departing flights.

294
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,560
Maybe she's already gone.

295
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,730
I don't think so.

296
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,975
If she's going anywhere today,
it's gonna be on the red eye.

297
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,760
According to this press release,
Lisa Tabak is being honored

298
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
at some charity shindig Downtown.

299
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,400
Well, that's great.
That's where we'll get her.

300
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,600
What's the benefit for?

301
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,061
She's the top donor of an
organization called Eagles and Angels.

302
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,630
Eagles and Angels?

303
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,900
You've heard of it?

304
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,300
When a police officer dies
in the line of duty,

305
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,060
he's an Eagle.

306
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,730
The ones he leaves behind are Angels.

307
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,230
That's a benefit for the
Association of Law Enforcement.

308
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,160
If you're gonna get near her,

309
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,830
it's gonna be with about
half the cops in L.A.

310
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,060
Jasper, where the hell you been?

311
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,030
- Thinking.
- Thinking?

312
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,560
Come on, the only thing
you should be thinking about

313
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,960
is what I asked you to get for me.

314
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,460
Did you find the location?

315
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,330
Yes, yes, and don't
say anything else, okay?

316
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,000
I heard clicks yesterday on my phone.

317
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,960
All right, settle down, all right?
I'm coming to you.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,660
It doesn't matter, you know,
cause you're never gonna

319
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,560
be able to get in, not
where they're keeping it.

320
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,760
I should have never
helped you out. I--

321
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,125
Just relax, okay?
I'm coming to you right now.

322
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,083
Think they're strong enough?

323
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,300
Together they should be.

324
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,930
There's everything on the list.

325
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,605
You sure we have to steal them?

326
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,348
It's the one thing we need that
we can't get at a store,

327
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,330
buddy, so yes,
we got to steal them.

328
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,100
We'll get everything else
and meet you there.

329
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,100
All right.

330
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,260
Look, um,

331
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,760
you gonna be okay?

332
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,560
Yeah. I just need time.

333
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,900
All right.

334
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,300
I'll be back as soon as I can.

335
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,430
Okay.

336
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,500
I am so sorry I'm not
going to be around next week

337
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,700
to see you in action, Cole.

338
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,830
But you'll be in good
hands with Andy here.

339
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,160
I have to catch a
flight to San Francisco,

340
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,613
but I just wanted to
say how thrilled we are

341
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:19,700
to have you here,
and hopefully, some of the rest

342
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,000
of the sales force can
learn a thing or two.

343
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,200
Uh, we'll settle up that check
when I get back, all right?

344
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,900
Uh, remember,
don't call it Frisco.

345
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,260
They hate that up there.

346
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,900
True.

347
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,600
Well, why don't I show
you to your office, Cole?

348
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,360
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,230
I didn't see anywhere
in your paperwork

350
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,630
that you were...
handicapped.

351
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,800
Otherwise, I would have made
the necessary adjustments

352
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,360
to your work space.

353
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,600
Andy, I like to think of myself as...

354
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,930
handicapable.

355
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,330
- Right!
- Yeah.

356
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,030
Well, here you are.

357
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,000
Right, right.

358
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,900
So this is where I'm
gonna be doing my, uh...

359
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,960
my work,
right here in this, uh...

360
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,030
...office.

361
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,630
That's right.

362
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,460
So, I'd better be rolling my sleeves, then.

363
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,730
You know, Cole,
I-I got to tell you.

364
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,531
I'm still a little amazed at somebody
I've never even seen at a convention

365
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,802
or seminar just falls from the sky
and shatters all of our sales records.

366
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,754
When you believe in Gate like I do,
it ain't that hard to sell.

367
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,903
There you go.

368
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,003
Well.

369
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,800
And here's your corner
office as requested.

370
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,800
Welcome to the team.

371
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,130
All rightly, then.
Thank you.

372
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,760
One...

373
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,930
22...

374
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,830
...B.

375
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,930
Oh.

376
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,430
Hello, Sara.

377
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,960
Hey, Sara,
where you going?

378
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,800
What can I get you?

379
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,960
Club soda, please.

380
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,360
How many years?

381
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,760
Sorry?

382
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,430
In the program.
How many years

383
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,660
have you been sober?

384
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,460
About three years
and three months.

385
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,400
Good for you.

386
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,060
Yeah, it doesn't feel good today.

387
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,398
But I'll take the high five
for cracking the big question.

388
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,300
Which is?

389
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,900
Is life a tragedy,

390
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,660
or is there...

391
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,630
...hope?

392
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,500
You tell me.

393
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,830
Double bourbon, neat.

394
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,360
Just pour it.

395
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,360
Cheers, honey!

396
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,500
Over here.

397
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,926
Eagles and Angels,
with contributions from the Company.

398
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,800
This thing's supposed
to start in five minutes.

399
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,600
- Excuse me, sorry.
- No problem.

400
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,100
Where do you work out of?

401
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,500
That's one of my guys up there.

402
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,860
I'm sorry, I just--

403
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,500
Oh, sure, sure.

404
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,160
Of course.

405
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,538
Okay, I've known
him my whole life.

406
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,000
He was a very close
person to my family.

407
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,360
It's always the good ones.

408
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,130
You ain't gonna drink that?

409
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,100
Honey, the Good Shepard
is here to ease your pain.

410
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:49,660
Ronald Winston Shepard...
you can call me Shep.

411
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,230
Shep, I really don't feel
like talking right now.

412
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,200
You've been talking to her.

413
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,960
Leave her alone, okay?

414
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,730
Pardon me.

415
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,130
Go on.

416
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,530
When I was 13,
I had to go see Annie, the musical,

417
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,272
but my mom had passed away earlier that
year and my dad had agreed to take me in.

418
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,660
I was all ready in my new dress,

419
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,600
and, uh, and I knew
every word of this thing.

420
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,083
And my dad called from work, and
he said he wasn't going to make it.

421
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,360
That wasn't the first time.

422
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,260
And I remember feeling
like I was floating...

423
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,777
like I was the only person
in the whole world.

424
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,072
And Bruce came.

425
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,360
He showed up to take me in, uh...

426
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,430
And after,
he took me home, and he said

427
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,700
that if I ever needed him,
he'd be there for me.

428
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:18,800
And a month ago,
I needed him, and I called him.

429
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,430
And he died for it.

430
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:28,404
Hey!

431
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:30,030
Just a sec.

432
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,060
What would he want you to do?

433
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,941
Let me do you a favor.

434
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:48,686
A settle-up here.

435
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,018
Uh, before we sit down to eat,
I'd like to welcome everyone

436
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,730
to the 15th Annual Eagles
and Angels Benefit.

437
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,630
We all know why we're here tonight,

438
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,330
so I'd like to begin
with a moment of silence

439
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,730
to renew our dedication to the law

440
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,400
and to honor those
whose lives were cut short

441
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,260
by their fearless pursuit of justice.

442
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,630
They will truly be missed.

443
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,000
Thank you!

444
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:05,803
Enjoy your dinner.

445
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,530
I've been made, guys.

446
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,830
Just get the card copy.

447
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,160
Here we go.

448
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,938
We're copying!

449
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,830
Hi, my condolences.

450
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,400
Yes?

451
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,860
The kip's at 15.

452
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,200
I understand.

453
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,660
I'm very sorry, but I'm
going to have to leave.

454
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,711
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

455
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,300
What's she doing?

456
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,900
She's leaving.

457
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,865
I'm... so sorry.

458
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:21,376
No, no, not again.

459
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,801
Yeah?

460
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,700
I've been made.
Meet me out back.

461
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,560
Go.

462
00:30:41,627 --> 00:30:42,434
Hey!

463
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Lincoln Burrows.

464
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,159
I don't know who
you think I am.

465
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:56,200
I know who you are.
Now put the gun, slowly.

466
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,830
Three. Copy?

467
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,660
<i>Three. Copy?</i>

468
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,360
Move.

469
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,774
Move it.

470
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,530
Let's get the device.

471
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,930
That's far enough.

472
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,030
Why don't you just
call one of the cops?

473
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,330
We work for the Company,
Burrows. We don't need cops.

474
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,896
Got any last words?

475
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah?

476
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,030
We got a problem. I just
killed one of the guards.

477
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,030
Let's go now!

478
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,430
No. We don't have it yet.

479
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,430
Do what you got to do.

480
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
We got to get rid of the body.

481
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,530
Let them find him.

482
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,400
What?

483
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,060
Wait for Mahone.

484
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,200
Gretchen.

485
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,960
How's my girl?

486
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,952
It seems your friend Whistler wasn't
the only one looking into Scylla.

487
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,330
You know anything about that?

488
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,000
No!

489
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,646
No.

490
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,960
You never know anything, do you?

491
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,030
You have nothing to
do with any of this.

492
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,200
Scofield, Burrows...

493
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,100
You don't know who--

494
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,400
No.

495
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,100
You can't keep lying to me.

496
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,830
No!

497
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,000
I don't know!

498
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,200
I don't know!

499
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,430
You look so...

500
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,730
...damn easy.

501
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,500
I can make this a lot harder.

502
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,960
Yes.

503
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,351
<i>A credit card belonging to Bruce Bennett
was just used at a bar in San Pedro.</i>

504
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,600
Thank you. It's lovely.

505
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,730
Excuse me.

506
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
Uh, we have a DOA outside,

507
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,630
I believe it's one of your men.

508
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,260
You need to come with me.

509
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,930
Excuse me?

510
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,860
No one's leaving here
until you make an ID.

511
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,560
Please.

512
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,400
Mathers.

513
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,500
Stay with Mrs. Tabak.

514
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,360
Uh, what happened?
I have a plane to catch.

515
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,160
I understand.
We'll make this fast.

516
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,060
Officer Mathers,
he'll wait with you.

517
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,860
Please. Stay with her.

518
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,500
If you could just wait
with me, ma'am.

519
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:43,800
Thank you.

520
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,930
What's going on?

521
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,330
Should only take a few minutes.

522
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,300
This is a nice memorial.

523
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,519
I very much respect the
sacrifices you men make.

524
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,530
There's a lot of bad people out there.

525
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,330
Officer Mathers, you, um...

526
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,700
you have something.

527
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,760
Your, your nose is bleeding.

528
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
One day...

529
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,700
Excuse me.

530
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,008
I'm looking for this woman.

531
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:06,555
Sara Tancredi?

532
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,230
- Here, take that.
- Thank you.

533
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,630
You okay?

534
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,052
Here we go.
Here we go!

535
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,273
Here we go!

536
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,000
Hell, yes.

537
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,360
It's nothing.
Travel safely.

538
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,260
Mrs. Tabak, we've got to leave.

539
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,860
Ma'am, now.

540
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,160
I'm telling you,
I haven't seen her.

541
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,630
You're sure?

542
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,200
Oh, look out, fellas!

543
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,630
It's the pigs! Run!

544
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,560
Shut up, wiseass.

545
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,530
You're sure you got
the whole thing?

546
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,960
A hundred percent.

547
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,060
Where's Sara?

548
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,230
It's not my turn to watch her.

549
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,860
What the hell are we gonna do?
Someone must've seen us.

550
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,730
SELF: Don't worry, it's handled.

551
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:39,700
PAD: Politically motivated?

552
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,544
Possibly an Armenian.

553
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,800
Tip came in to LAPD.

554
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,183
The assailant thought the
consul was at the event.

555
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,617
Lisa's bodyguard got in the way.

556
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,000
Did Lisa make her flight?

557
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,760
Yes, General.

558
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,860
What do you got?

559
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,730
I had a guy.

560
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,960
I did. I had a guy.

561
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
He, uh, was an informant.

562
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,918
Actually, he used to work for the
Company for about 11 years until

563
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,960
he turned against them
and decided to help me.

564
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,900
He said he had the
location we needed.

565
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,060
But I, uh...

566
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,960
found him dead in
his apartment today.

567
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,218
I'm sorry.

568
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,860
First Bennett,
now your guy, huh?

569
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,138
Yup.

570
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,200
They're closing in on us.

571
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,397
There's no doubt about it,
and now, I'm, uh...

572
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,500
empty-handed.

573
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,560
And now I have no idea
where we need to break into.

574
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,830
We keep moving forward, Agent Self.

575
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,430
Nothing changes.

576
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,160
- No matter what.
- Right.

577
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,226
Okay.

578
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,500
Regardless of what happens, I, uh,

579
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,660
I like your style, Scofield.

580
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,230
You need anything else, Mr. Cole?

581
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm all right, little lady.

582
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,000
What was your plan,
Mr. Whistler?

583
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,530
What was your plan?

584
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:50,577
Shan Xing.

585
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:54,493
You're wasting my mail, now.

586
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,160
Cole Pfeiffer did not
arrive for our meeting.

587
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,730
So you don't have Scylla?

588
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,600
Next time, Shan Xing.

589
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,900
I'll be in Los Angeles
if anyone needs me.

590
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,330
Number two down,
on to number three.

591
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,900
We manage to get anything
off Lisa Tabak's phone?

592
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,200
I don't know.

593
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,430
I didn't pick up anything but the card.

594
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,829
I want to thank you for
what you did back there.

595
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,430
I need you to do
something for me.

596
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, doesn't everybody.

597
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,960
I'm looking for the man
who killed my son.

598
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,060
What do you need?

599
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,460
Here's the police report.

600
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,700
I need you to get into
the FBI database...

601
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,900
and find a profile.

602
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,800
This man is a professional assassin.

603
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,800
He's African-American,
six foot, four.

604
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,060
About 220 pounds.

605
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,660
That's for your eyes only.

606
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:08,433
Hey.

607
00:42:08,816 --> 00:42:10,700
Hey, are you all right?

608
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

609
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,260
Well, I was worried.
Where are you?

610
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Let me come get you.

611
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,500
No, it's okay.
I'm almost home.

612
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,330
Um, listen...

613
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,200
You're what's keeping
me going right now.

614
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,730
And you're all I have left,
and that scares me.

615
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,930
I just want to be together.

616
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,800
I know the circumstances are
a little less than ideal, but...

617
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,200
We are together.

618
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,360
You're here, I'm here.

619
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,630
It's not "one day"
anymore, it's, um...

620
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,760
it's today.

621
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,588
Well, why don't you come back and
uh, we'll make some dinner, and...

622
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,360
maybe find a little
time for ourselves.

623
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,060
Okay, I'll be right there.
