1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,794
- Where is it ?
- Go to hell.

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,630
You did this to yourself.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,716
Sara, if you're listening,
I only hope, by now,{y}

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,427
you've found your safe haven.
I took advantage of you,{y}

5
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,930
and put you in a place
that's every doctor's nightmare.{y}

6
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,015
- Sara Tancredi.
- You know her well ?

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,351
I'd know her a lot better
if you can get my ass moved.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,062
- I'll talk to the warden.
- "Another Chance" and "Safe Haven."

9
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,980
Those are the names
of some of the chapters

10
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,440
in the book they use an AA.

11
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,360
So make no mistake about it.

12
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:27,908
We will be a family

13
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,654
if it kills us.

14
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,241
That's your map ?

15
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,452
- What happened to your arm ?
- My dad drinks, too.

16
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,991
My tummy hurts.

17
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,870
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

18
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,832
Kacee's going into the system now.
Aiding an escaped con.

19
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,712
- Tell her lawyer I'll turn myself in.
- Kacee said you need to run.

20
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:49,422
If you get busted
or turn yourself in,

21
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:50,920
Dede won't have either of you.

22
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,550
- Michael, I want for this to be over.
- That makes two of us.

23
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,233
It's just a question of looking at
whatever it is your father gave you.

24
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,763
It's just a key.

25
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,642
If I may, sir, the president...
she could be useful.

26
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,181
Madam President ?

27
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,180
{y:i}I want you to
come home, Paul.{y}

28
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,523
{y:i}but not with
those brothers{y}

29
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,562
- running around the country.
- Caroline...

30
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,440
{y:i}Please, bring
them in, Paul,{y}

31
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,441
and everything can go back
to the way it was.{y}

32
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:39,601
Agent Kellerman.

33
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:41,473
{y:i}Paul, where are you ?{y}

34
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:43,271
Out in the cold. Remember ?

35
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,683
{y:i}I'm speaking in
Chicago tonight.{y}

36
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,283
Yeah, well...

37
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:01,623
Lincoln.

38
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:02,870
Sara.

39
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:06,791
It's funny how you only call me
when you need me.

40
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,170
- Maybe "funny" is not the right word.
{y:i}- All of this can go away, Paul.{y}

41
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,132
- Can it ?
{y:i}- Yes.{y}

42
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,591
I'm the President
of the United States.{y}

43
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:17,631
{y:i}Please just come
back to Chicago{y}

44
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:20,142
{y:i}and turn Burrows
and Scofield in.{y}

45
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:22,553
I promise you that I will make
everything go back{y}

46
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,563
{y:i}to the way it was.{y}

47
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:26,023
I have to go.

48
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:28,272
{y:i}Just come back, Paul.{y}

49
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,603
{y:i}I need you.{y}

50
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:34,021
You actually think
we have a shot ?

51
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,491
It depends on what
your father gave you.

52
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:40,240
This fell out of his pocket
when I found him.

53
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,820
I don't recognize
the insignia, do you ?

54
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,371
No.

55
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,371
But, uh...

56
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,541
Sara, we've got someone
working with us now.

57
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,772
Good morning, sunshine.

58
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,362
How did you sleep ?

59
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,822
I'll tell you what.

60
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:23,201
I'll go unlock the kids
and make us all breakfast.

61
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,912
No. I'll get the kids.

62
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,621
- No !
- I insist.

63
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,411
No.

64
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:48,521
I'll get the kids.

65
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,353
Some hand cream will make them

66
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:55,440
rope burns feel better.

67
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,941
It won't work.

68
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:58,360
'Course it will.

69
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:01,360
Says right here on the bottle :
"Soothes skin irritations

70
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,282
- and..."
- No. This.

71
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:06,162
It won't work. I've got a job.
The kids have school.

72
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,873
We're all going to get back
to our normal routines

73
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,291
once this little

74
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:13,423
- adjustment period is over.
- There's someone coming over today.

75
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,133
- Who ?
- This woman, Patty,

76
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:17,713
- from the Welcome Wagon Committee.
- Call her and cancel.

77
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,251
I don't have her number.

78
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:22,170
And, if she shows up,
and I don't answer the door,

79
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,260
she's going to know
something's wrong.

80
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,352
Teddy...

81
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,443
Teddy Bear...

82
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,360
you need to go.

83
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:43,280
If she recognizes you...

84
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't want you
to get in trouble.

85
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,711
That's nonsense.

86
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,592
It's no trouble.

87
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,842
No trouble at all.

88
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,893
Wakey wakey, Jones !

89
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:15,813
Hi, Sara.

90
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:19,152
What's done is done.
We all want the same thing.

91
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,150
You didn't tell us
you left her to die.

92
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,111
I was scaring her.

93
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,322
I wanna get her cold.
Pull out !

94
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,791
No. No, you left me
in there to drown.

95
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,950
I wonder how long
you can hold your breath.

96
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:37,042
- Maybe we should find out.
- You need me, and you know it.

97
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,380
Lincoln !
You need me. You need me.

98
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:46,430
Why ? Why do we need him ? We have
the key. We'll find out what it's for.

99
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:49,012
I can tell you what
that key's for right now.

100
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,603
It's to a private cigar club.

101
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,142
Where ?

102
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,810
Chicago.

103
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,392
We have to hurry.

104
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,352
We have to hurry, Larry.
I did a bad thing.

105
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:43,272
God ! I did a very bad thing.

106
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:48,453
All gas stations :

107
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:51,913
on 80, 30, 77.

108
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:54,030
I want Scofield's
and Burrows'pictures

109
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,793
on each and every gas pump.

110
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,910
If they have no fuel,
they can't get anywhere.

111
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,252
- Sir ?
- What ?

112
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:01,583
We might need to divert
our attention away from Scofield

113
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:03,962
- and Burrows for a while.
- Why would I do that ?

114
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,921
Because one of the other
escapees just killed a civilian.

115
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,803
Patoshik.

116
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,880
A man fitting his description
was spotted

117
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:13,180
running from the scene
of a brutal homicide.

118
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:15,640
Happened in Algoma,
Wisconsin,

119
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:17,773
less than four hours
from the prison.

120
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:20,311
Call the field office in Madison,
and have them get some agents

121
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:22,653
Okay. I'll notify headquarters.

122
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:26,361
I didn't say headquarters. I said,
are you not following direct orders ?

123
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,901
Oh, I am following
direct orders, sir.

124
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,200
Just not from you anymore.

125
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:36,161
Everything goes through
headquarters from now on.

126
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:38,582
May I ?

127
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:49,553
Yeah.

128
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,552
You heard about Patoshik.

129
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,221
Just now.

130
00:07:53,897 --> 00:07:54,933
Good.

131
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:56,471
He goes.

132
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,280
Come on, the man is mentally ill.
He doesn't know anything, he's not a...

133
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:02,353
Patoshik was one of Scofield's
cellmates for a while.

134
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:05,060
Scofield included him in the escape.
Who knows what he knows ?

135
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,530
- Scofield and Burrows are still out there.
- Don't worry about Scofield and Burrows.

136
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,070
So,

137
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,282
again...

138
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:14,952
Patoshik goes.

139
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,120
Take care of it.

140
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,291
Hi, are you in
charge of seating ?

141
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:26,003
- Yeah, can I help you ?
- Agent Paul Kellerman, Secret Service.

142
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,383
I'm transporting a fugitive
to Chicago.

143
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:31,090
- I need you to clear a car for me.
- A fugitive ?

144
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:32,590
That's right.

145
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:34,848
Well, it's just that we're already
near capacity...

146
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,304
You want him to rub elbows
with your other passengers ?

147
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,853
- No, sir.
- Okay.

148
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,272
What's he wanted for ?

149
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:41,640
Killing people.

150
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,272
- Good Lord.
- Make it happen.

151
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,152
All right, come on,
follow me.

152
00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:59,660
It's gonna be all right.

153
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:04,292
If you say so.

154
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,963
We use him to get what we need,

155
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,342
then we dump him.

156
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,593
Okay.

157
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:21,812
I'm sorry you got
involved in this.

158
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,443
The fact that
you're helping us...

159
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,981
it means a lot.

160
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,361
Thank you.

161
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,030
The other riders aren't
in any danger, are they ?

162
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,622
I mean, should I make an
announcement or anything ?

163
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:42,490
You want pandemonium ?

164
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:45,000
- No, sir.
- Okay, then no announcements, right ?

165
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:48,003
Keep everybody out of this car
then everything is jake.

166
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:50,882
I've done this a million times.
Never had a problem.

167
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,461
Okay, will do.

168
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,231
Let's go.

169
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,441
{y:i} For all passengers
going to Chicago,{y}

170
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,572
it won't be any stop
till the station{y}

171
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,860
We'll be in Chicago
in about five hours.

172
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,200
Want to get some rest.

173
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,223
You okay ?

174
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:41,262
Yeah.

175
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,363
Brad.

176
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:00,613
- You don't look too good.
- I helped you with Sara Tancredi,

177
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:03,202
and you were supposed
to get me into Ad Seg.

178
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,452
I tried.

179
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,210
But your new warden is...

180
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,420
straight as an arrow.

181
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,920
But I might be able to do you
one better than Ad Seg.

182
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:20,383
You found Scofield and Burrows
through the Russian girl, right ?

183
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,641
Yeah, Nika. Why ?

184
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:24,720
And you tracked down Bagwell

185
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,433
by following Susan Hollander.

186
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,481
Yeah.

187
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,021
And I blow my nose with
my right hand and I wipe my ass

188
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,271
with my left.
What of it ?

189
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:41,322
I've got very powerful people
behind me

190
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,200
that want me to finish my job.

191
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,083
They can push through the quickest
habeas corpus proceedings

192
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,001
the courts have ever seen.

193
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,960
Paperwork's sitting on the right
person's desk as we speak,

194
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,540
setting forth all

195
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:57,593
the Constitutional violations
in your prosecution.

196
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,763
It's just waiting
to be rubber-stamped.

197
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:05,140
And what do I have to do ?

198
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,391
You just find those cons.

199
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,350
Only, this time...

200
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,021
you're gonna do it for me...
unofficially,

201
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,560
under the radar,

202
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,271
no paper trail...

203
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:20,692
I need a junkyard dog

204
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:23,361
who's willing to do
the ugly things it takes

205
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:25,743
to bring a con to justice.

206
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,003
Are you my dog, Brad ?

207
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,880
Damn hell, yeah, I am.

208
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:42,131
This is delicious.

209
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:43,590
What'd you call it again ?

210
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:45,393
That, my dear Patty-cake,

211
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,352
is what my auntie back in'Bama
used to call "hobo chicken."

212
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:51,312
One part chicken, two parts
spice, three part actual hobo.

213
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:57,402
I know...

214
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:01,363
fowl isn't part of a...

215
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,862
traditional brunch, per se, but

216
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,030
I have found a
lean meat can act

217
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:09,661
as an aperitif to...

218
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,952
awaken the pallet

219
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:14,963
for more subtle flavors and

220
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:18,002
textures, such as...

221
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,340
Mama mia !

222
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,840
Pumpkin cinnamon breads
with fresh strawberries and cream.

223
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,262
Boy !

224
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,801
Now, how did you two meet ?

225
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,311
Church.

226
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:34,641
After my, uh...

227
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:36,772
accident, uh,

228
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:39,020
I was volunteering
with some other...

229
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,482
amputees.

230
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,861
My parish back home did
an exchange program with

231
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,821
churches all over
this fine country and...

232
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:47,871
well...

233
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,701
the good Lord just saw fit to plop
my country rump right down

234
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,871
rump right down in the pew
beside my Susie Q.

235
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:57,121
And you just stole her heart.

236
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,793
I'm a regular one-armed bandit.

237
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,672
A one-armed bandit...

238
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,842
Mrs. Wallace,

239
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,971
Teddy just bought me
a brand-new bike.

240
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,971
It's out in the garage.
Wanna go see ?

241
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:10,852
Sure.

242
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,723
We have got company.

243
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:15,271
Oh, that's okay.

244
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,103
No, it's not; it's rude.

245
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:19,401
Zack knows better.
Isn't that right ?

246
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,650
You do know better, Zack.

247
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,213
You gotta have discipline.

248
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:41,003
Without a strong
father figure,

249
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,671
a young man might just
end up in prison.

250
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,523
Since you are such a fan

251
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,731
of lame store-bought
blueberry pie,

252
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,271
I am gonna bake you
a real pie...

253
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,781
Hi, my name's Lance
and I'm an addict.

254
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:17,203
Hi, my name is not Lance,
I'm not an addict.

255
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,590
Michael...

256
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,140
Do you know if there's any way
I can get any water ?

257
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:37,222
Yeah, I think there's
a bathroom downstairs.

258
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,143
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

259
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,071
It was never personal, Sara.

260
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,743
- War never is.
- Yeah.

261
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:24,151
Sara !

262
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:28,230
Sara, back off !
Let him go, Sara.

263
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,193
Sara !
Sara.

264
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:43,331
You get one of those !
You get one of those.

265
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,250
One.

266
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:46,671
Calm down.

267
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:48,551
Down. Get down, right now.

268
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,642
What ?

269
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,471
These three guys said they saw
what looked to be a fight

270
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,933
going on in there.

271
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,230
They didn't, all right ?
Just get the train to Chicago.

272
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,563
Do I need to notify
the police ?

273
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,900
You need to do what I told you
to do. You take the tickets,

274
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,570
I'll watch the fugitive. You guys can
continue to do bong hits,

275
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,150
or whatever you do
back there, okay ?

276
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:12,281
Now would you guys
mind your own business ?

277
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:14,111
Everybody clear ?

278
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,072
Great.

279
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:17,871
Don't interrupt again, please.

280
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,291
Just so we're all clear :

281
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,331
if she tries that again...

282
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,672
You'll do what ?

283
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,711
Just stay on the other side
of the car.

284
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,511
It wasn't personal, Paul.

285
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,723
Yeah.

286
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,143
All ours, Patty Cake

287
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:29,401
- Ooh ! What're these ?
- Oh, I'm, uh...

288
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:31,571
gonna do some renovations.

289
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:34,283
I was just tappin'the sheetrock,
lookin'for the stud.

290
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,902
Looks like you
already found one.

291
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:38,861
Whoo ! Potty mouth !

292
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:40,412
Oh !

293
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,490
Me and the girls get together
every Friday

294
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,872
for book club.

295
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,831
You ought to host it this week
and everybody can meet you.

296
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,540
I'll see you then !

297
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,791
Can't wait.

298
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:58,761
This ain't ever
gonna work here.

299
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,223
Go pack your things.

300
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,103
we're movin'.

301
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:31,332
Now, hey, if you
don't stop me,

302
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:34,132
I'm gonna eat this
whole thing by myself.

303
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,930
All right, sweetie,

304
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,430
listen.

305
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,052
I'll make a deal with you.

306
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,721
Remember that merry-go-round
that we saw today ?

307
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,230
You're not gonna get
a chance to ride it,

308
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,441
if you don't eat something.

309
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:55,320
- Go ahead.
- I don't feel good.

310
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,030
Oh, sweetie.

311
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:09,081
Okay, come on.

312
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:10,710
Let's go, all right ?

313
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,212
I got you.

314
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,672
Okay, just hold on.

315
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,011
- Okay, sweet pea ?
- Check, please ?

316
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,842
All right ! Nobody move !

317
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,151
- Hey, Sara ?
- Leave me alone.

318
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:53,920
How is she ?

319
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,343
Well, she wants to be alone.

320
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:02,013
So we get what her dad
locked away with that key.

321
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,300
What do we do then ?

322
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:05,803
I mean... you saw what they did
with the tape we made.

323
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,360
They're gonna bury everything
we put out there.

324
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,472
That's why we're keeping him
close to us.

325
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:11,983
He's got a lot of connections
in Washington.

326
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,563
So we get to the cigar club,

327
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:16,561
open her dad's box...

328
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:19,110
what if the only thing
inside's a bunch of stogies ?

329
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,200
I think it's worth making
the trip to find out.

330
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,672
- Yes ?
- Caroline.

331
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:43,092
{y:i}Paul. Where are you ?{y}

332
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,431
I need to know exactly
what you meant

333
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,351
when you said you were gonna
make this right.

334
00:21:48,357 --> 00:21:50,143
- I need specifics.
{y:i}- Where are you ?{y}

335
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:51,522
{y:i}What's that noise ?{y}

336
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:54,273
I'm on a train.
I'll be in Chicago later today.

337
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:56,233
But I need to know specifics.

338
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:58,770
Where are Burrows and Scofield ?
Are they with you ?{y}

339
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,362
Don't worry about them.

340
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:02,283
- Worry about me.
{y:i}- Paul,{y}

341
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:04,570
there are still positions
in my administration{y}

342
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:07,530
that need to be filled...
including Chief of Staff.{y}

343
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,412
{y:i}I want that to be you.{y}

344
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,043
When I get to Chicago,
we'll meet.

345
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:13,501
We'll talk.

346
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:24,381
All of it.

347
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,090
I just brought enough
to get a sandwich.

348
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,223
I was sitting
right there, okay ?

349
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,260
If you're lying...

350
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,690
Look, my daughter is sick, and
I don't want to spend any more minutes

351
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:35,391
in here than necessary.

352
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:38,980
Trust me,
that is all that I have.

353
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:46,992
What do you got, sweetheart ?

354
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:52,333
What do you got ?

355
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:59,541
- You don't want to listen ?!
- Hey,

356
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,673
- hey, calm down, man.
- Shut up !

357
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:02,792
All right.

358
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,260
Listen to me, you've got
to calm down.

359
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:07,931
All right, I can help you get
everything that you want.

360
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:10,973
But you don't want to hurt
anybody else, right ?

361
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:12,261
Come on.

362
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:14,852
Look, listen.

363
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:17,733
Hey. Why don't you go ahead
and lock the door,

364
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,272
and turn the closed sign back,

365
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:21,312
so everybody thinks that
this place is closed,

366
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:22,561
all right ?

367
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,820
And then, we can get everybody away
from the window.

368
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,742
- Is that cool with you ?
- Everybody's away from the window, okay ?

369
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,821
Let's move everybody onto
this side of the room.

370
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:31,081
Get on this side of the room,
everybody.

371
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:33,241
Let's move to this side of the room
from the window.

372
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,591
- Move !
- Everybody, let's get on this side

373
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,330
of the room, okay ?
This side of the room.

374
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,253
- Yeah.
- Why don't you take my daughter, okay ?

375
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:40,501
Take her on this side of the room,
so that everybody...

376
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:42,253
everything is gonna be okay.

377
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,040
Everything is gonna be fine.

378
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:47,131
Because you're not gonna put your hand
on another person, right ?

379
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:50,011
Right. We're all good.

380
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,103
Y'all good ?

381
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,681
We're good, right ?

382
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:01,900
- Hey, Sara ?
- Come on in.

383
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:09,743
Hey.

384
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,080
I've been sitting
here evaluating.

385
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:27,882
I, uh...

386
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:33,013
I jumped bail.
I'm on the run,

387
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,352
and I just tried
to take a man's life.

388
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:40,731
I'm not using.

389
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,733
Which is actually...
quite an accomplishment.

390
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:52,282
But three weeks ago,
I was a doctor.

391
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,281
You can get that back...

392
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,450
all of it.

393
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,833
You need to believe that.

394
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:02,002
You believe that ?

395
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,001
You think you can
get it all back ?

396
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:11,672
I choose to have faith.

397
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:16,972
Because without that,
I'm nothing.

398
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:21,982
It's the only thing
that's keeping me going.

399
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:26,022
Well...

400
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,481
I got two things
keeping me going.

401
00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:33,201
First, is that I want the people
who killed my dad.

402
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:38,330
And actually, the second...

403
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:41,831
ironically, I probably
wouldn't even

404
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,543
say if I hadn't lost him,
but, um...

405
00:25:46,757 --> 00:25:48,790
You should know that...

406
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:02,103
The first thing they tell you
when you take the job,

407
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:03,733
is, um,

408
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:06,690
never to fall in love
with an inmate.

409
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:02,530
What's going on ?

410
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,423
Roadblock.

411
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:19,091
Linc !

412
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:20,391
It's locked.

413
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:56,303
Hey ! You can't be in here.

414
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,221
- Run the roadblock.
- Man, I can't do that.

415
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:08,390
Run it !

416
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:47,352
Bradley Bellick, FBI.

417
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,692
Brad Bellick,

418
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,731
Federal Bureau
of Investigations.

419
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:56,232
Brad Bellick, FBI.

420
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:59,401
Special Agent Brad
Bellick, FBI.

421
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,071
Hi, there, I'm Brad Bellick
with the FBI.

422
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,450
I'm an agent with the FBI,
Brad Bellick.

423
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:09,372
Brad Bellick.
I'm with the Bureau.

424
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:14,882
Brad Bellick.
I'm with the Bureau.

425
00:29:15,717 --> 00:29:18,211
I already talked to the cops,
told them all I had to say.

426
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,672
Yeah, well, I'm no local hayseed cop.
I'm federal.

427
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:24,053
And you're not going to get away
with lying to me.

428
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,683
- I didn't lie to nobody.
- Really ?

429
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:28,683
"He was just some homeless guy,

430
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,271
hangs around Hancock Square,

431
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,390
hitting up college
kids for change.

432
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,112
He's down there all the time.
if he's not there,

433
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,850
I don't know where
to find him."

434
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,311
That's your statement, right ?

435
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:38,522
- Pretty much.
- Right. See,

436
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,742
the problem is Charles "Haywire"
Patoshik is a paranoid,

437
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,571
who suffers from
fear of crowds,

438
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,360
who's terrified of strangers.

439
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:47,282
If he's anywhere,
he's in the middle of nowhere,

440
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,160
keeping to himself,
being a weirdo.

441
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,411
- And ?
- And if you want to get tough...

442
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:53,123
how about I arrest
you right now

443
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,042
for hindering
a federal investigation ?

444
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:57,751
Who they going to believe ?
An agent with 15 years on the force

445
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:00,130
and three
Presidential Citations

446
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,130
or a piece of white trash

447
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,802
with a juvie record ?

448
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,590
I didn't ask him to do it

449
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:09,073
but in case you haven't noticed,
I ain't exactly broken up

450
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,723
over my dad's death.

451
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,060
Why can't you just leave
this Patoshik guy alone ?

452
00:30:13,065 --> 00:30:14,231
Where is he ?

453
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,983
Or do you want to
get locked up...

454
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:18,313
right now ?

455
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:27,953
- Yeah.
- I got a lead on Patoshik.

456
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:29,373
Where ?

457
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,043
I'm on my way.

458
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,832
{y:i}Keep him there.{y}

459
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,162
Alone.

460
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,092
Any information on Scofield
and Burrows,

461
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,960
I want to be
notified immediately.

462
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,092
If that works out for you.

463
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,973
They're gonna have cops waiting
for us at the next station.

464
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:54,063
- We need to jump then.
- And do what ?

465
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:56,441
Hide under a barrel ?

466
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:57,772
Linc's right.

467
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,362
Okay, you just put
those in there.

468
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,861
I'm so sorry about all this.

469
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,953
It's okay, sweet pea.

470
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,123
Here's everything
right here, man.

471
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:23,922
- It's good.
- All right,

472
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:26,011
everyone in the storage room.
Now.

473
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,132
What ?

474
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,130
Get back there

475
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,263
until the cops show up.

476
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,561
No, no, no, no,
I can't go back there.

477
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,182
- Come on.
- No.

478
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,063
Look, you kept a cool head
this whole time.

479
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:38,640
Don't get yourself killed now.

480
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,232
You know what ?
Listen to me.

481
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,232
I'm a wanted man.

482
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:44,192
Okay ?

483
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:46,913
If the police show up here,
they'll take me back to prison,

484
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:48,530
and you know what ?
That's fine.

485
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:50,362
But my little girl right here ?

486
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,573
She's sick.

487
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:53,033
And she's going
to be left alone.

488
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,080
And I can't let that happen,

489
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,831
so can you please

490
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,540
let us go ?

491
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:13,262
- Go ! This way.
- Okay.

492
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:14,470
Go !

493
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,313
All right,
everyone in the back.

494
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:21,143
Move.

495
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,192
- Not you.
- No !

496
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:25,900
You're coming with me.

497
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,692
Go on. Move.

498
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:31,152
Okay, I want you to stay
right here, okay ?

499
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:35,782
- Go on !
- Hey.

500
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,420
- I think you should let her go, man.
- Take off.

501
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,212
- Last chance.
- You've got the money.

502
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,170
Burglary and assault.
Man, hey, that's change, man,

503
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,670
that's little time.
But this right here...

504
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:52,303
you will be in prison
for the rest of your life.

505
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:54,430
- Believe me on that.
- Unless you want

506
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,760
your daughter to see you die,

507
00:32:57,068 --> 00:32:57,970
move.

508
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:05,153
I'm trying to help you, man !

509
00:33:16,248 --> 00:33:17,531
Sweetie, stay right there.

510
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,173
Oh, no.

511
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,770
Who did this ?

512
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:45,521
I did.

513
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:57,453
Thank you.

514
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:10,500
Haywire !

515
00:34:11,178 --> 00:34:12,132
Don't move !

516
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:15,302
Run ! Larry ! Run !

517
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:16,891
Hurry !
Hurry !

518
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:28,981
{y:i}Dino, it's Eric.{y}

519
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,521
{y:i}We've got four jumpers.{y}

520
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,363
{y:i}Three males
and a female.{y}

521
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,741
Call it in and get us
to the next station.{y}

522
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,860
Do you hear me ?
Get us to the next station.{y}

523
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,973
The men who pushed through
the roadblock are jumping off the train

524
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:44,830
near mile marker 54,

525
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:47,370
just south of the
Tedford Bridge.

526
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:28,620
Please, stop !
Stop where you are.{y}

527
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:30,462
Freeze !
Don't shoot !

528
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:33,751
Don't shoot !
Turn around !

529
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:38,301
I'm an employee of
the train company.

530
00:35:38,728 --> 00:35:39,933
Dino, it's Eric.

531
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,471
We've got four jumpers.

532
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:44,310
Three males and a female. Call it in
and get us to the next station.

533
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,273
Let's go. Come on.

534
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:49,393
They told us to jump and run

535
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,693
and not to look back
or they'd shoot us.

536
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,203
We need to find a car.

537
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,451
- Yeah.
- I got Haywire trapped.

538
00:36:45,705 --> 00:36:46,873
{y:i}Don't do anything.{y}

539
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:49,200
Just hold him
until I get there.

540
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:52,083
No problem.
I got this wingnut treed.

541
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:17,523
- Caroline.
{y:i}- Paul, where are you ?{y}

542
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,030
Did you send the police ?

543
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:21,073
No, of course not.

544
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:23,360
How did they know
I was on that train ?

545
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:25,703
{y:i}Paul, I have no idea.{y}

546
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:28,700
- I'll let the president know.
- I contact the president directly.

547
00:37:30,168 --> 00:37:32,461
{y:i}Are Burrows and
Scofield with you ?{y}

548
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:35,333
I was expecting to
brief the president.

549
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:38,960
You report to me now.

550
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:40,512
{y:i}Paul ?{y}

551
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:45,093
Where did we spend
my 35th birthday ?

552
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:46,141
What ?

553
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:47,892
The restaurant.

554
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,933
Where was it ?
You remember.

555
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,771
Don't be ridiculous.
I have to go.

556
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:52,940
Do not hang up.

557
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:53,981
I have to go.

558
00:37:53,986 --> 00:37:55,693
{y:i}Just get Burrows
and Scofield...{y}

559
00:37:55,698 --> 00:37:56,483
Hey.

560
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,693
Whoever this is...

561
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:01,990
tell Bill Kim
that he just screwed up...

562
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:03,903
big-time.

563
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:06,741
Paul ?

564
00:38:07,377 --> 00:38:08,280
Paul ?

565
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:37,813
What's all this ?

566
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,820
Some whacko climbs up
to a grain elevator,

567
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:42,360
people want to watch.

568
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:44,862
Oh, God, you were supposed
to keep a handle on things.

569
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,322
Do you know what that means ?

570
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,700
I got you Haywire.

571
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:49,620
What else do you want ?

572
00:38:51,085 --> 00:38:53,042
FBI. He's my chargee.

573
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:27,650
How you doing, Charles ?

574
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:30,950
I don't want to go
back to prison.

575
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:33,583
I don't blame you.

576
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,290
I want to go to Holland.

577
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,871
That's not what I
expected to hear.

578
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:41,843
But you can't go there, son.

579
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:44,461
I just...

580
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:50,763
I just want to go... here.

581
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:53,351
See ?

582
00:39:58,198 --> 00:39:59,522
I'll tell you what.

583
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:03,693
You don't have to go to prison.

584
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:08,403
But you can't go to
Holland, either.

585
00:40:08,746 --> 00:40:10,741
Oh, no, no, no, no,

586
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:11,961
- no, no.
- It's okay, it's okay,

587
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,241
it's okay. Hey,

588
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:15,200
you're in a tough spot.

589
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,873
You feel trapped,
you got no options, and...

590
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,423
caught in a situation
where you have no control.

591
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,131
I know how you feel.

592
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:24,673
I do.

593
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,222
It takes its toll on you,
and all you want to do is run.

594
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:34,431
But run where ?

595
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:36,390
I just want to go.

596
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:42,191
There's a way out.

597
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,442
A way out ?

598
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:52,240
Of this maze ?

599
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:55,452
Yeah.

600
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:03,582
There are private humidors
in the back.

601
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:05,713
Each member's name
is on their box.

602
00:41:05,717 --> 00:41:07,551
- Any security ?
- A receptionist.

603
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:08,593
That's it.

604
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:11,342
I'm not a wanted fugitive.

605
00:41:11,478 --> 00:41:13,720
Give me the key.
I'll do it.

606
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:18,771
Want to take a walk ?

607
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:20,101
Yeah.

608
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,811
I know you killed your parents
because they hurt you.

609
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,901
And I know you killed that guy yesterday
because he was hurting Sasha,

610
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:29,151
but what you did...

611
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:33,361
was wrong.
You know that.

612
00:41:36,337 --> 00:41:38,242
I just want to go.

613
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:43,082
You can.

614
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:47,090
I want to go now.

615
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:01,683
It's okay.

616
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:25,832
Sara.

617
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:29,210
About before.

618
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:31,801
Me, too.

619
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,310
Yeah.

620
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:04,312
