1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,503
Previoulsy on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,004
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

3
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,297
The evidence says you did.

4
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:06,507
I was set up.

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,927
Put down your weapon!

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,846
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell.

7
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,057
I'm looking for someone, guy named Lincoln Burrows.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,725
Man killed the Vice President's brother.

9
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,352
Why you want to see Burrows so bad, anyhow?

10
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,478
'Cause he's my brother.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,771
I'm getting you out of here.

12
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,778
It's impossible.

13
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,565
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

14
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:24,900
You've seen the blueprints.

15
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,235
Better than that.

16
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,653
I've got them on me.

17
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,655
You find out who's trying to bury him.

18
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,073
Nobody's trying to bury him.

19
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,366
The evidence was cooked.

20
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,742
There's a lawyer poking around.

21
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,245
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

22
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,998
I'm going to kill that scum.

23
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:43,126
You won't. You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here.

24
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,586
What're you doing here? Where's Maricruz?

25
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
She's with me now.

26
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,673
Fish, I gotta be back in.

27
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,341
Nick Savrinn with Project Justice.

28
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,679
My boss may not think Lincoln's case is worth looking into, but I do.

29
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,013
When do we get started?

30
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,015
Getting through this wall is just the beginning.

31
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,519
There's a whole lot of real estate in between here and the outside walls.

32
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,187
That is a transfer request.

33
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,232
Michael Scofield is getting shipped out tomorrow.

34
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,893
I assume this is about your transfer request for Michael Scofield.

35
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,811
More specifically, why you denied it.

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,688
Look, Mr. Kellerman,

37
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,566
do I come into your house and tell you where to put your furniture?

38
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,069
We're just asking for professional courtesy.

39
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,822
But you're asking for a federal courtesy in a state penitentiary.

40
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:57,492
Most people in your position would be happy to have another body taken off their hands.

41
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,954
These men are my responsibility from the minute they walk through those walls

42
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,750
to the time that they've paid their debt to society, I'm responsible for them.

43
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,836
Which means that unless Mr. Scofield has done something I don't know about,

44
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,672
he is going to stay here at Fox River under my watch.

45
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:14,092
Mr. Pope, in our line of work, we've discovered that

46
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,888
just about everyone has done something that someone doesn't know about.

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,849
What's this?

48
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,476
Right now, just a piece of history.

49
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,104
Whether it becomes a current event, now that's up to you.

50
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,363
My wife already knows about Toledo.

51
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,240
Does she really?

52
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,289
You're a smart man, Warden.

53
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,709
I'm sure if you look hard enough, you could find a reason why Michael Scofield's

54
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,713
presence is no longer required at this particular correctional facility.

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,062
Could use more PVC. here, boss.

56
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:20,742
Boss?

57
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:21,910
Sure thing, Burrows.

58
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,830
But, hey, I don't want to check your trunk for splinters.

59
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,915
I want every piece accounted for. Sure.

60
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,253
I got a ripped fertilizer bag inside!

61
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,882
Hey, you!

62
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,717
You!

63
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,639
Get in there and clean it up before this whole place starts smelling like San Juan.

64
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,646
Hey, he's on his way. You mind telling me what this is all about?

65
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,195
These are the guys we're breaking out with.

66
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,864
I don't think so, Fish.

67
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,116
That was not our agreement.

68
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,785
I'm not going to work with this...

69
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,204
crazy rhino.

70
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,288
Keep pushing it, John.

71
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,957
Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

72
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,375
What's your deal, man?

73
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,670
Touch my brother again, and I'll show you.

74
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,967
Brother?

75
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,677
Your brother?

76
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,475
We've only got a few minutes.

77
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,978
We're gonna spend them spitting on each other, or are we gonna talk some business?

78
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,315
The reason we're all here today is we have a decision to make--

79
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,777
- Yeah?
- English, Fitz or Percy?

80
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,322
If we're going to pull this off, we need to take one of them out.

81
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,660
And you want us to tell you which one?

82
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,120
I just want you to help me get to them.

83
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,205
I'll take it from there.

84
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,498
You're crazy, you know that?

85
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,541
All I need is five minutes.

86
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,292
Oh, you won't even get five seconds.

87
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,378
Thought you had everything worked out, Fish.

88
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,880
We're not breaking out of a Jamba Juice, gentlemen.

89
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,258
It's gonna take a little more than digging a few holes.

90
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,387
There are eyes, ears, dots that couldn't be connected from the outside.

91
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,347
And English, Fitz and Percy...

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,391
One of those dots.

93
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,939
How exactly are you supposed to pull this off?

94
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,567
With a little help from my friends.

95
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,169
Sucre, hold up.

96
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,920
Scofield, you got company.

97
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,601
Why do I get the feeling that there's more to you than meets the eye, Scofield?

98
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,897
Anything you want to tell me?

99
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:02,571
Some other reason you're in here, besides holding up a bank?

100
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,001
You're being transferred.

101
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:16,752
W hat?

102
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,755
We're moving you over to Statesville.

103
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:20,923
You can't do that.

104
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,133
Yes, I can. I'm the boss here.

105
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,593
This is my house.

106
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,346
Three weeks.

107
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,305
What for?

108
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,726
Lincoln Burrows-- he's being executed in three weeks.

109
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,437
Well,  I'm aware of that. What's that to you?

110
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,439
He's my brother.

111
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,737
When I knew I was being sent to prison, my attorney petitioned the D.O.C.

112
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,614
So you could be near him.

113
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,657
That's right.

114
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,578
Don't take that away from me.

115
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,290
Not until it's over.

116
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,544
I'm not the one behind the transfer.

117
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,005
You're up against much bigger fish than me.

118
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,385
I'll arrange for you to say good-bye.

119
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,179
You ship out tomorrow.

120
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,391
I'm going into the walls tonight, see if I can access the roof.

121
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,352
You going to tell me about the transfer?

122
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,562
I'm taking care of it.

123
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,731
You're taking care of it?

124
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,150
Sounds to me like you're reaching.

125
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,276
Maybe...

126
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,611
a little.

127
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:52,866
A little? You know, I had made my peace to what was coming.

128
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,954
and then you show up and give me the one thing a man in my situation shouldn't have--

129
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,831
hope-- and now that's gonna be taken away.

130
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,459
- Don't do this, Linc.
- I got three weeks.

131
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,211
What do you want me to do?

132
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,462
Hmm?

133
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,760
Come on, Michael.

134
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,303
What do you want me to do?

135
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,974
Bring her back.

136
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,142
You know I can't do that.

137
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,146
But look, there's some stuff that I can do.

138
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,817
It's not gonna be the same, but we're gonna figure it out.

139
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,320
And, no matter what, it's still gonna be me and you.

140
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:35,701
Okay, but what if something happens to you?

141
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,705
You just... have a little faith.

142
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,630
Just have a little faith.

143
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,303
All right, here's the deal.

144
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,431
We believe Lincoln. This tape is a lie.

145
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,478
It has to be.

146
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,225
You saw it. It's all there.

147
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,060
Yeah, but, maybe what we're looking for is what's not there.

148
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,772
Okay. Steadman.

149
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,357
You see, what's he looking at?

150
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,026
Car? A pedestrian?

151
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,861
No, no, no. His eye line is too high, right?

152
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,613
It's like he's looking right into the camera.

153
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,089
Might as well be saying "cheese."

154
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:20,996
- Now he just sits there.
- Like, 10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

155
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,915
- Waiting for someone.
- Right.

156
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,042
There.

157
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:26,293
That's a nine millimeter.

158
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,753
Shouldn't there be some kind of kick or something?

159
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,004
Lincoln's pretty strong.

160
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,048
Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?

161
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,469
No. You shoot someone, supposedly for revenge,

162
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,589
do  you take the time to go back in and hit the glove box

163
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:40,224
or you just get the hell out of there?

164
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,351
Fed said he was trying to make it look like a robbery.

165
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,521
Look.

166
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,690
Look at Lincoln's angle as he leaves the frame.

167
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,608
Mm-hmm.

168
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,360
Walks away from the car.

169
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,990
Now, this guy, who conveniently hides his face from the camera,

170
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,450
he comes back in. Why?

171
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:02,079
To explain the bloody pants they'd already planted in his apartment.

172
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,956
- Nick, this is great.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,832
Who should we go to?

174
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,625
Nobody.

175
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,379
Yet. I mean, to the unbiased eye, we're just backing a horse that died in the gate.

176
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,964
A lot of "what ifs" and conjecture, you know.

177
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,508
We don't have anything. We need some evidence.

178
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,344
Look, if... if Lincoln didn't fire this gun,

179
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,722
then somebody with some serious skills went to work on this tape to prove that he did.

180
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,516
Fine, but how do we prove that?

181
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,061
I know a guy.

182
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,521
You know a guy?

183
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,731
Yeah, I know a guy.

184
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,191
Thanks.

185
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,820
Seems we need to have another powwow.

186
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,947
There's been talk about you packing your bags.

187
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,490
Don't believe everything you hear.

188
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,367
I'm not going anywhere.

189
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,291
You know, I have a really hard time trusting you, Fish.

190
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,877
The important thing is that we stay on schedule.

191
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,171
And English, Fitz and Percy?

192
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,881
English, Fitz or Percy.

193
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,425
You want to know which one I think we should take out?

194
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,802
All due respect, I don't need opinions.

195
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,429
I need answers.

196
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,181
Remember, the warden leaves at 5:00 tonight,

197
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,474
so by 5:05, we're going to need that key.

198
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,561
And how is this key going to give you the answers?

199
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,104
I'll worry about that.

200
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,814
You worry about getting the key.

201
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,773
Hey.

202
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,651
This key better be worth it.

203
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,652
Understand?

204
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,328
Afternoon, Mr. Scofield.

205
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,582
I need to know if there's any way to block a transfer order.

206
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,334
There's about 50 ways.

207
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,210
All right.

208
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,503
I'll take the quickest.

209
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:37,716
You file a motion for what they call an "interlocutory injunction."

210
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,634
How long does that take?

211
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,177
How fast can you write?

212
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,972
A man can claim almost anything violates his constitutional rights.

213
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,186
There's environmental issues, allergies, religious requirements, take your pick.

214
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,896
- What if they don't buy it?
- Don't matter.

215
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,898
Court's required by law to hear your motion.

216
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,400
Until they do, you can't be transferred.

217
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,655
Hell, they been trying to move my tired, gray behind for ten years.

218
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,699
God bless the American legal system.

219
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,078
Why do you want to stay in here so badly?

220
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,540
Someone here I can't bear to leave behind.

221
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,293
I guess that means we got something in common.

222
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,631
State's requiring a physical for Lincoln Burrows.

223
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,049
You heard the news, didn't you?

224
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,634
Thanks. No. What?

225
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,760
They're brothers.

226
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:24,054
- Who?
- Burrows and Scofield.

227
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,223
Michael Scofield?

228
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,642
Heard it from one of the C.O.s over in gen pop.

229
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,269
He didn't say anything to you about it?

230
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,061
No.

231
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,314
Oh. Must be hard to be here so close to your brother

232
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,817
and not be able to do anything to help him.

233
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:45,617
What's this?

234
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,077
More bathroom reading.

235
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,328
Westmoreland again?

236
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,246
Scofield.

237
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,123
He's blocking his transfer.

238
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,881
Even  if the motion is denied, it's going to take 30 days to process.

239
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,090
And that means...

240
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,469
All right, I'm going in.

241
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,096
I'm going to need your help.

242
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,264
You mean in-in?

243
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,057
Now? I thought you were waiting...

244
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,977
I need to make sure I know how I'm getting up there, so when the time comes...

245
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,312
Yo, yo, yo.

246
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,273
In case you didn't notice, the lights are all on.

247
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,150
We got a live studio audience, Fish.

248
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,902
How are you going to get around that?

249
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,280
Don't we have some laundry to do?

250
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:33,165
Just to be clear, I ain't touching your drawers.

251
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,093
Eyes straight ahead.

252
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,387
Keep it moving.

253
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,640
Keep it moving.

254
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,599
Keep it moving.

255
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,767
Him.

256
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,271
Get him! Get him!

257
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:00,234
Get him!

258
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,080
Get off me!

259
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,624
Get him! Get him!

260
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,459
Get him!

261
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:18,502
Get off me!

262
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,737
Fish!

263
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,530
I can't deal with this.

264
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:07,986
Fish.

265
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:09,938
Come on.

266
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:26,839
Yo, Fish!

267
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,841
Fish, you're taking too long, bro!

268
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,578
This ain't gonna fly, man.

269
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,039
The 'Ricans, we got genetically higher blood pressure, you know that?

270
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,584
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

271
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,253
Thought you said your cousin was moving in on your girl.

272
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,131
That's my other cousin, but thanks for bringing that up, jackass.

273
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:14,178
Look, the good news is, I can get to the roof.

274
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,470
So what happens now?

275
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:16,305
N ow?

276
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,724
It's all about timing.

277
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,927
This is a top-dollar job.

278
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,887
- Do you know who did it?
- No. You?

279
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,224
People who do this kind of work are ghosts, man.

280
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,185
The guy behind the guy behind the guy, you know what I mean?

281
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,145
You see anything? Definitive cuts?

282
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,189
Any place that proves the tape might've been doctored?

283
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,273
The thing's clean.

284
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,358
No footprints.

285
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,195
I mean, usually, you peel a video back a couple of layers and anything bogus comes off.

286
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,030
You know, now you see it, now you don't.

287
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,156
But not this one.

288
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,241
It's laced.

289
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,784
Ingrained.

290
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

291
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:23,330
- You see something?
- No.

292
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,291
The problem with your eyes is that they play tricks on you.

293
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,459
Now, but your ears...

294
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,836
ears don't lie.

295
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:31,421
Look. Here's the audio track from the tape.

296
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,758
- Sound pretty true, right?
- Yeah.

297
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,385
But noise is a lie.

298
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,095
See, it doesn't just die like that.

299
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,431
Stripped down, those levels should be dancing.

300
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,767
I mean, a room that size would give you a...

301
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:46,603
a... blam, blam, blam, blam. You know?

302
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,689
Like, one off each wall, split second after the other.

303
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,109
On yours, the reverb's bouncing at the same time.

304
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,235
What does that mean?

305
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:58,365
The sound of the gunshot, it wasn't recorded in that room.

306
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,328
Would you testify to that?

307
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,122
Oh, I, uh... I don't know.

308
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,957
Tape you gave me's a dupe.

309
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,209
You know, for all I know, you guys tampered with it.

310
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,878
Look, you want me to testify in court,

311
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,547
I'm going to need to get my hands on the original.

312
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,470
- How are those allergies?
- Excuse me?

313
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,766
In your motion, you cited chronic, um...

314
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,602
- Sinusitis.
- Hmm.

315
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,270
It's not an allergy, actually.

316
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,147
It's a bacterial infection.

317
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:30,856
Hmm?

318
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,483
The moist air from the river along the east wall helps keep me, you know...

319
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,945
clear.

320
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,739
I'm impressed.

321
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,617
Not even a week in here and you're already working it like an old con.

322
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,577
Well, you've got one up on me, Warden.

323
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,537
You know why I needed to file those motions,

324
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,540
but I have no idea why you needed to transfer me.

325
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,834
Traffic  control, Scofield, that's all.

326
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,377
Traffic control.

327
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,379
Look, it's coming up on 5:00.

328
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,547
What do you say we call it a day?

329
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,217
- I don't think I can do that, sir.
- Why not?

330
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,386
If I let go of this support right now, the whole thing's coming down.

331
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,889
See, the Taj was designed using axial force,

332
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,726
a series of internal forces along a longitudinal axis.

333
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,810
Uh-huh, yeah.

334
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:09,811
How much longer?

335
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,105
Depends on how long it takes to dry.

336
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:16,318
If you need me to leave, I can show your secretary how to hold it.

337
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,569
All right, you can stay till it dries.

338
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:18,987
There'll be a guard waiting outside the door.

339
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,489
Just check in with Becky when you're done

340
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,866
and she'll have somebody escort you back to your cell.

341
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,617
All right.

342
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,536
And, uh, Scofield...

343
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,374
I want to thank you for showing up today.

344
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,501
I would have understood it if you didn't.

345
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,919
We had a deal.

346
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:34,795
Right.

347
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,755
Still, thanks.

348
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,215
My wife is going to love it.

349
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,050
You're welcome.

350
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:55,983
- See you tomorrow, sir.
- Patterson.

351
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,277
- Good night, Warden.
- Night, Becky.

352
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,571
We just happen to be two people, who happen to know each other,

353
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,365
who happen to show up at the same movie theater,

354
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,243
at what happens to be the same time.

355
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:07,619
That's it.

356
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:51,205
You know, from this angle, you look just as good as you did when we first met.

357
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,831
How about from this one?

358
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:53,874
Even better.

359
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,128
- Oh.
- Uh-uh.

360
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,796
Those are for your guests.

361
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,173
Guests?

362
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,466
Your associates?

363
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,884
They said you had a meeting.

364
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,260
They're in the den.

365
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:15,479
Evening, Warden.

366
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:02,401
There's nothing I can do.

367
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:06,405
I'm legally obligated to file every properly drafted motion with the court

368
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,990
so that a hearing can be scheduled.

369
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,283
And how long does that take?

370
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,535
A month, maybe two if there's a logjam.

371
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,495
I'm sorry, but it's out of my hands.

372
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,814
Why do I get the feeling you're not all that disappointed?

373
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,916
May I ask you a question, Warden?

374
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,752
More of an observation, really.

375
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,213
I was looking at the, um,

376
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,675
morgue photos from that boy back in Toledo, Will Clayton.

377
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,095
And, my Lord, if he wasn't the spitting image of his daddy.

378
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,684
Apple fell real far from the tree with that one, didn't it?

379
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,771
Fell off the tree, fell all over the pavement.

380
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,274
You son of a bitch.

381
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,277
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair.

382
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,822
Something tells me that's pretty much all the forgiveness she's got left in her bag.

383
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,408
Especially when it comes to an illegitimate child.

384
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,828
What happened with young Will, Warden?

385
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,372
Get out of my house.

386
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,750
Lose Scofield's paperwork.

387
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,920
You gentlemen staying for dinner?

388
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,838
Thanks, but I think we're on our way.

389
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,299
Judy, it was a real pleasure.

390
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,217
Thank you.

391
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,677
And that just may have been the best iced tea I've ever had.

392
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:15,641
Warden, better do everything you can to hold on to this one.

393
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,226
I will.

394
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:18,352
Good.

395
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,233
Is everything all right?

396
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,527
Oh, yeah. Just fine, honey.

397
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,738
I just have a little unfinished work to take care of.

398
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:30,906
I'll be right in.

399
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:32,449
Okay.

400
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,612
It's all clear.

401
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,865
Evening, Lincoln.

402
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,408
Doctor.

403
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,452
I'm, uh, supposed to give you a physical this evening.

404
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:19,580
- Mm-hmm.
- Believe me,

405
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:22,499
apologize in advance for the heavy dose of irony we're about to participate in.

406
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,500
That's all right.

407
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,002
Just doing your job.

408
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:29,006
Yeah, well, letting the state know that you're healthy enough to execute

409
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,799
is not why I went to medical school.

410
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:31,842
Hmm.

411
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:33,760
I apologize.

412
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,220
It's okay.

413
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:39,975
All right.

414
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,646
I'm, uh, going to need a family medical history from you,

415
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,941
any ailments or conditions that are hereditary.

416
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,151
Start with your mom.

417
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,445
Hmm... cancer, liver.

418
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:52,779
Okay, father?

419
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,033
Um, split when I was young.

420
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,285
Siblings?

421
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,163
Anyone besides Michael?

422
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,543
Fox River's a small town, Lincoln.

423
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,630
People around here don't have a whole lot to do besides time and talk.

424
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,550
You close?

425
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,554
We were.

426
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,808
How about now?

427
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:22,601
Huh?

428
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,520
How about now?

429
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,858
He's been abandoned his whole life.

430
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:36,740
Dad, Mom, she died young, and now me.

431
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,244
Think that's why he's here?

432
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:42,079
'Cause your...

433
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,499
your death would feel like it's happening again?

434
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:50,921
I abandoned him a long time ago. That's why he's here.

435
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,157
Gates closing!

436
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:23,203
It's time.

437
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:24,746
Time?

438
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:26,832
Oh, God, here we go again.

439
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,584
Count's in 15 minutes.

440
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,376
What are you doing?

441
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,587
Trust me, the less you know, the better.

442
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,588
The less I know?

443
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,089
Man, you got me in the dark.

444
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,883
That's exactly where you want to be.

445
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,766
Don't normally find you here at this hour.

446
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:50,647
Are you, uh, seeking his forgiveness or advice?

447
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,859
I really don't know anymore, Ben.

448
00:28:56,403 --> 00:29:00,741
All I know is my son Will was my responsibility.

449
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,703
And if I'd stayed in his life, I could have saved his life.

450
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,997
His death was an accident, Henry.

451
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:18,217
He was a criminal and an addict, but he was only 18 years old.

452
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,929
His mother made it clear you couldn't be in his life

453
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,305
if you weren't going to be in hers.

454
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,266
When you chose to stay with Judy, you understood that.

455
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,020
I not only understood it, I was grateful for it.

456
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,272
I told myself I...

457
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,108
I was respecting her wishes.

458
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,279
I cursed her under my breath while every day

459
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,659
I thanked God for allowing me to wash my hands of...

460
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,953
of Toledo...

461
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:49,915
all of it.

462
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:56,296
So, I ran home to Judy.

463
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:00,551
I buried the secret.

464
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,012
But I never got a chance to...

465
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,140
to bury my...

466
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:08,809
my son.

467
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,031
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

468
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:28,829
Sacrifices somebody else's life just to make their own life easier?

469
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,376
You can argue with me all night.

470
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,712
Believe me, I haven't got anything better to do.

471
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,755
But it won't change the fact that

472
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,301
I can't just hand out original copies of evidence.

473
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:43,552
If you could just take a look...

474
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,471
Oh, I don't care if your FOIL is signed by the attorney general,

475
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:47,639
I can't give it to you.

476
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,349
What if we brought somebody here to watch it?

477
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,518
Your supervisor could monitor him the entire time.

478
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,855
He'd strip down, swear on a stack of bibles. Whatever it takes.

479
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:57,357
Wait, what did you say the docket number was?

480
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:01,028
It's, uh, 296-SPE.

481
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,238
What's wrong?

482
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:04,615
Come with me.

483
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,999
Last night, a pipe burst upstairs, flooded the place.

484
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:19,171
Files from over a hundred cases, pretty much lost all of them, including yours.

485
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,923
Just this room?

486
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:22,883
Some kind of freak accident.

487
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:36,563
Count 'em.

488
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,065
Callahan...

489
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,361
Malinowski, Pohlen.

490
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,699
Chance, Graziano.

491
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,536
Scofield, Sucre.

492
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,420
Scofield.

493
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,298
Get the hell out here.

494
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:55,559
We got a runner!

495
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:29,343
All right, for the last time, piñata, where the hell's Scofield?

496
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,678
He's gone, you're gone. You hear me?

497
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:33,472
Call it off, Captain.

498
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,349
I got Scofield right here.

499
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:36,391
Where?

500
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,726
In the warden's office.

501
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,354
You looking at him?

502
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,816
Stop trying to nail the secretary and check the damn office!

503
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:55,536
Captain, he's gone.

504
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:58,223
Man can't just vanish, deputy.

505
00:34:58,307 --> 00:34:58,891
I know, sir.

506
00:34:58,974 --> 00:34:59,892
He never checked out with you?

507
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,185
- No.
- And the rear door?

508
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,603
It's still locked, sir. I checked.

509
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:03,645
How the hell did he...?

510
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:05,939
What's going on?

511
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,192
You're in the warden's office after hours.

512
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,904
I could kill you and the paperwork wouldn't need much more than the date!

513
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,322
Tell me, what were you doing in here?

514
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,740
All right, deputy, that's enough.

515
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:21,288
Work wasn't dry, you said to stay until it was.

516
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:23,957
- You were in here the whole time?
- Yes, sir.

517
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,709
It's true. I never saw him leave.

518
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,085
I must not have seen him behind the table.

519
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,338
Warden, all due respect, this is ridiculous!

520
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,715
- This prisoner was out of his cell.
- He missed the count.

521
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,175
I understand, deputy.

522
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,720
Thing is, Mr. Scofield is not our problem anymore.

523
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,264
Seems there was an error in his paperwork.

524
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:41,225
He's going to be transferred after all.

525
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,809
That's not possible.

526
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,229
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

527
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:48,482
Warden, all I need is three weeks.

528
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:49,733
Get off me!

529
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:50,776
Hey, come on, now!

530
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:53,362
Please, I just need a little time.

531
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,947
Just give me the time.

532
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,744
Any chance you want to write this off as a coincidence?

533
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:02,663
Me, neither.

534
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,623
How could they have known we were coming for the tape?

535
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,583
Three hours ago, we didn't even know.

536
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,210
Well, we're pissing someone off.

537
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,462
You say that like it's a good thing.

538
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,173
People start breaking the law, you know you're getting warm.

539
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,346
We still have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

540
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:25,060
Nick.

541
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:25,853
Stay here.

542
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,289
Whoever it was is gone.

543
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,332
Does it look like they got anything?

544
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,125
No.

545
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,800
Everything's exactly the way I left it.

546
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:07,603
What? What?

547
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:12,149
What?

548
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,027
- The tape, it's gone.
- Are you sure?

549
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,777
How could they know?

550
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:16,570
Let's think this through.

551
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,530
How could they know exactly where to look?

552
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,407
Wait, wait. Does anyone else have a key to this place?

553
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,658
- No!
- You sure this is where you put it?

554
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:22,784
You were here, remember?

555
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:28,081
I was talking to you, I walked toward the cabinet, and I said...

556
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:30,918
What?

557
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,213
Veronica?

558
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,631
Are you okay?

559
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,179
Veronica?

560
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:52,731
Open up!

561
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,026
Breakfast, gentleman!

562
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,110
Let's move it!

563
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:58,278
Sucre, let's go.

564
00:37:58,362 --> 00:37:59,488
Scofield, wait here.

565
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,657
I'm sure your ride will be along any minute now.

566
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,416
This can't be it.

567
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,336
It can't end like this.

568
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,879
Let's move it!

569
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,090
Fitz.

570
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:20,342
What?

571
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,427
They were going to take Fitz out.

572
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:25,472
It was as clear as day.

573
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:28,767
And the cops?

574
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,394
How long did it take them to respond?

575
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:31,979
You got all the timing down?

576
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,693
Think we would have made it?

577
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,282
Sucre, now.

578
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,480
Hey, Fishface, where you going?

579
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:10,619
Call my wife,

580
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,871
tell her to get the kids and get the hell out of the country.

581
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,097
I'm sorry.

582
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,662
Don't forget to buckle up.

583
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,626
What's this prisoner doing out of his cell?

584
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,086
Being transferred.

585
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,297
No, no, no, no.

586
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,673
There must be some kind of a mistake.

587
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,383
This man filed a motion yesterday.

588
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,469
He has a medical condition which precludes transfer.

589
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,471
Sinusitis, right?

590
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:14,141
Sinusitis.

591
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,435
Take the prisoner back to his cell.

592
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,603
But yank his rec time.

593
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,229
He missed count last night.

594
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,314
Hey.

595
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,149
You're home early.

596
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:05,150
Everything okay?

597
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:07,027
Yeah.

598
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,654
Yeah, it is.

599
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,032
There's just, um...

600
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,704
Judy...

601
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,462
there's someone I need to tell you about.

602
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:30,884
Yes?

603
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,136
The transfer didn't go through.

604
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,638
That's disappointing.

605
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:36,682
We can refile, but the warden...

606
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,392
It's a waste of time.

607
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,646
I think it's time we stop beating around the bush, gentlemen,

608
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:45,315
and go after the damn bush!

609
00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:47,234
Burrows.

610
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,070
What do you want done?

611
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:53,573
Take the only thing Burrows has left: time.

612
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:57,520
After all, the chair isn't the only way to take a man's life in prison.

613
