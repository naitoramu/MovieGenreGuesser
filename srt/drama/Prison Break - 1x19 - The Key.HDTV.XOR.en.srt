1
00:00:00,418 --> 00:00:02,322
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,844
Hey, John, you know,
actually, about Jesus...

3
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:09,759
...say hi to him for me,
will you?

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,595
It's him.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,912
- Did you see him?
- Who?

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,525
The guy in the viewing room.

7
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:17,544
- No.
- It was Dad.

8
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:18,774
Where's your girl?

9
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:20,678
She'll be at my place
in about an hour.

10
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,858
Pretty soon,
we're gonna call in our favor.

11
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:32,374
Have at it.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,175
Boss!

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,834
Department of Corrections is allowing
you a one-hour visit with your son.

14
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:44,142
I'll make the travel arrangements,
but I don't want any problems.

15
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:58,919
I used to have a Great Dane,
big and wild.

16
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:02,581
When she was 12, she got cancer,
so we had to put her down.

17
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:07,113
And you'd think it would be this big,
dramatic event, but...

18
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:11,537
it was very peaceful.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

19
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:14,991
One minute, she was breathing,
the next, she wasn't.

20
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,056
Hey!

21
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:29,658
Everything okay?
Need me to call 911?

22
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,033
No, no, no, I got it.

23
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:35,656
Engine's smoking pretty bad,
looks like it could blow up any second.

24
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:38,405
- It's okay, actually.
- You think?

25
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:40,543
- Yeah.
- If you say so.

26
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,695
Fernando Sucre
released from Ad Seg.

27
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,572
Cuz!

28
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:20,513
You're out.

29
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,150
It's good to see you.

30
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,927
Y'all can sign each other's
yearbooks later. Where we at?

31
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,381
The map is complete.

32
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:29,230
I got what I needed.

33
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:31,848
- Then we're ready.
- Almost.

34
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:35,958
I know which pipes we need to
take beneath psych ward now.

35
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,957
Which means our way to
the infirmary is clear.

36
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:40,805
With our new route,

37
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:43,433
we're gonna come up on the
far end of that building.

38
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:47,192
Which means we've got to walk down 30
feet of hallway to get to the
doctor's office--

39
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:48,935
our exit point.

40
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:53,172
Which means there's only one
piece left to this whole thing--

41
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,384
a key to that room.

42
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,407
No sweat.

43
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:02,288
All we got to do is run a bump and
grab on a C.O. like we did last time,

44
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,048
grab the keys, make a copy.

45
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,491
It's not that easy.

46
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:07,587
Only the medical
staff have those keys.

47
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:10,009
How you fixin' on
getting it then, Pretty?

48
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,191
Carefully.

49
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,084
No more surprises
this time, right?

50
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:16,262
Right.

51
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,411
Jesus...

52
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,686
Mary, Joseph.

53
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:28,430
- Hello, John.
- Michael.

54
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,476
How are you?

55
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:42,222
Any day above ground is a blessing.
Thanks be to God.

56
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:46,483
You mind? Please.

57
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,314
Thank you.

58
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,687
Lot of rumors going around.

59
00:05:54,114 --> 00:05:54,871
Yeah.

60
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,350
I'm glad you're back.

61
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:03,432
I'm surprised you're still here.
I thought you'd be gone by now.

62
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,940
Well, we had a few setbacks.

63
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:10,152
Still planning on it?

64
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,610
That depends.

65
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,163
How does the idea of escaping
sit with the new you?

66
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:24,011
Oh, the old sinner who was confined
to these walls, he's dead.

67
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:28,218
The new soul
deserves to be free.

68
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:31,394
Well, the old sinner was going
to have a jet ready for us.

69
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:34,675
Is the new soul going to
be able to pull that off?

70
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:40,670
Noah had his ark, did he not?

71
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:47,803
Let's pray.

72
00:06:55,584 --> 00:07:00,496
I'm gonna need a
blade... pronto.

73
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:03,759
- Hit and run?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,075
- And Burrows is gone?
- That's right.

75
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:10,927
- The officers?
- Two are dead, one's in critical.

76
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,857
Do you realize what the media's gonna
say when they get a hold of this?

77
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:15,087
We'll get him back, sir.

78
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,221
40 years in corrections, and this
is how they're gonna remember me.

79
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,983
This is Kane County.
Sheriff Ballard's a good friend of mine.

80
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,813
He hasn't said a
word to anyone yet.

81
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,483
Give us four or five hours,
we'll find him.

82
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:28,245
If I don't report this to the D.O.C.
right now...

83
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:34,553
They don't have to know.

84
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:37,821
You've always been a
by-the-book guy, boss,

85
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:41,396
but this time,
the book's gonna get us all fired.

86
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:44,407
Find  him.

87
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,875
The records of every phone call made to
and from every contact in Quinn's
cell phone.

88
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,080
Well we have our haystack, any idea
what the needle might look like?

89
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,396
There must be thousands
of calls here.

90
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:34,917
But to who? To where?

91
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:38,816
You know, it's gonna take us
forever to go through all of these.

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,305
What if these have nothing to do
with Lincoln and Steadman, huh?

93
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,484
What if we're just
burning time?

94
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,178
We're just that much
closer to the execution.

95
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,020
What's going on with you, Nick?
It's almost like you want to quit.

96
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,710
I don't want to quit.

97
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,390
Then let's get to it.

98
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,276
Dr. Tancredi will be right in.

99
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,533
- Morning.
- Morning.

100
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,571
How you, uh,
how you feeling today?

101
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:24,132
- Better.
- Good.

102
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,920
We got checkpoints
up in 171 by Lamont,

103
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:34,066
Sage Bridge and at the
river goin towards Romeo.

104
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,778
According to our
witness overthere,

105
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,140
this new perp was driving an 06 Mustang,
black, dark blue, maybe.

106
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,917
We're not gonna be able to sit
on this thing very long, Brad.

107
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:45,232
This is me, Nate. I need this.

108
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:46,493
All right.

109
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:49,867
You go back to Fox River.
I'll be in constant contact.

110
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,391
You mind if I...

111
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,842
How you doing, M. ...

112
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:07,220
Roy Hoggings. Hi.

113
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,267
Where you going?

114
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:13,303
Uh, I'd like to get
going if I could.

115
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,692
I'm late for a
meeting in Aurora.

116
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,692
- Where do you come from?
- Chicago.

117
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,266
Kind of a indirect
route to get to Aurora.

118
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,740
I'm ot from around here.

119
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:39,049
If any of you get so much
as the whiff of anything,

120
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,045
I want to know it immediately.

121
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,808
Makes of two us, pal.

122
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,252
What do you want
from me, Michael?

123
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,688
Sara...

124
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:00,998
I  need you to do
something for me.

125
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:04,567
What?

126
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:14,917
Wait for me.

127
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:19,909
It won't always be like this.

128
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:25,637
In this room, in this place.

129
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,723
Until then, I can't.

130
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,278
We can't.

131
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,565
Damn it.

132
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:42,575
I can't.

133
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,085
And I got to go.

134
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:11,968
- Hey, Squirt.
- Avocado.

135
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:16,348
How many times I got to say it?

136
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:18,968
You address me formal-like.

137
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:22,243
- Mr. Bolz-Johnson.
- That's better.

138
00:13:22,382 --> 00:13:25,401
I think maybe you and I
can work something out.

139
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,327
Really?

140
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:29,060
Yeah, check it,
I got a this homie on the outside.

141
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:32,952
He can put a hundie into your
commissary account each month.

142
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,137
It's nice of you to
think of me like that,

143
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,468
but you only got
one thing I need.

144
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:07,174
I need you to get something for me.
Do your bump and swipe thing.

145
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,935
- Like I did with the watch?
- Exactly.

146
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,934
Yeah, that did me
a lot of good.

147
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:19,320
Guards found out,
they stuck me in a cell with Avocado.

148
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:27,677
So if you want something glommed,
you need to do something for me.

149
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:36,310
Kill that son of a bitch.

150
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,427
That's not something I can do.

151
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:46,850
Screw Honus Wagner.

152
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,082
What was that?

153
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:51,426
This kid in my neighborhood,

154
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:56,366
his dad had a baseball
card collection...

155
00:14:58,474 --> 00:15:01,414
So I figured,
you know, I'd swipe it.

156
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:05,475
I could get some party cash,
you know?

157
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,967
There was one card in there.

158
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:15,497
A 1910 Honus Wagner.

159
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:20,409
Doesn't mean nothing to me, you know.
Hoops is my sport.

160
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:26,587
This card,
it was worth $300,000,

161
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:31,092
so they slapped me
with grand larceny.

162
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,956
That's why I'm here.

163
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:43,317
That's why I'm sitting on a nickel
getting turned out like a little bitch.

164
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,646
A baseball card.

165
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:28,006
Dad?

166
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,860
What are you doing here?

167
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,903
As soon as I heard they granted
you a visit with your son,

168
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:41,082
I knew they'd make
a move on you.

169
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,886
I mean what are you doing here?

170
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:46,766
I've got a car about
20 miles from here.

171
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:49,316
We'll switch out. After that...

172
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:52,396
I'm gonna make sure
you disappear.

173
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:59,953
Then this business will just be
between me and them. Can you move?

174
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:03,050
What are you talking about?
They're after me, not you.

175
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:06,003
It's not as simple as that,
trust me.

176
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:09,803
I worked for them.

177
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,806
You worked for them?
You're an alcoholic, a...

178
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:16,426
Is that what you remember?
Or is that what you were told?

179
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,114
Why did you leave?

180
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:24,624
I took a position with a group of
multinationals known as The Company.

181
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:27,526
They call every shot
this country takes--

182
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:33,434
what laws to pass, what judges
to appoint, what wars to fight.

183
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,382
Thing is, if you wanted to
rise in the ranks like I did,

184
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:39,327
you had to commit to leaving
everything you know behind.

185
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,573
Because then, you start to get
access to the real information.

186
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:46,959
Information people would do a lot
of things to get their hands on...

187
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,007
like harm your family.

188
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,990
You expect me to believe that?

189
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:54,016
Why didn't you reach out to us?

190
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,472
Why didn't you call us?

191
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:59,618
I regretted it every day
but I didn't have a choice.

192
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:02,864
Lincoln, the day I
left The Company,

193
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:06,710
I took all that
information with me.

194
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,874
That's why they're
doing this to you!

195
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:12,067
All  of it... to stop me.

196
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,178
You have to trust me.

197
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:18,458
Then you'll have to tell
me what's going on.

198
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,638
- I can't do that.
- Then I can't help.

199
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,371
Look, I did what you asked.

200
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:28,813
Green card for credit card,
that was the deal.

201
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:31,135
Then, we'll make a new deal.

202
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,525
Michael, if somebody
finds out...

203
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,059
Believe me,
I'll be in more trouble than you will.

204
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:40,099
I know,
and that's why I won't help you.

205
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:42,904
Look,  Nika, I promise you...

206
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,710
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

207
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,409
I don't know why
you're in there,

208
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,027
but if there's one thing those guys
that brought me here taught me,

209
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:52,980
it's that if you fight,
if you struggle,

210
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,610
you only make things worse.
Stop fighting, Michael.

211
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:01,840
Just think about it, okay?

212
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,159
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:17,840
There it is again, the 406 number.
It's on every listing.

214
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:19,825
Four-oh-six.

215
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:25,097
Yeah, there's over 200 businesses,
another hundred residences

216
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:27,002
in 17 different countries.

217
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,768
They're all calling
the same number.

218
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:30,558
- Four-oh-six.
- Montana.

219
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,222
Can you check the prefixes?

220
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:34,563
This doesn't make sense.

221
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:37,359
All these people from all over
the world are calling this place

222
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:40,248
in the middle of nowhere
with a population of 42.

223
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,498
Blackfoot, Montana.

224
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,812
I thought you
understood, Terrence.

225
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:05,579
If you want to talk,
we set up a meeting, at home, in person.

226
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:08,866
I saw the latest tracking.
Your polls are headed south.

227
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:13,858
Maybe the Burrows thing is finally
starting to gain some traction with
the swings.

228
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,489
- It could hurt.
- Good-bye, Terrence.

229
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:19,176
- You said it was almost over.
- It is.

230
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:24,760
Are we talking about Lincoln Burrows...
or your candidacy?

231
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:28,430
The only reason that
you are still alive

232
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:31,382
is because I won't
let them kill you.

233
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:35,665
Yeah, I'm pretty clear on that.

234
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,170
But the thing I
can't quite figure is

235
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:41,936
with the crap storm
this thing's become...

236
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:45,544
why they haven't killed you.

237
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:33,813
Figure out how you're going to
get the key to the infirmary yet?

238
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,456
Not quite.

239
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,443
You working a game on her,
or what?

240
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:44,763
I don't know.

241
00:21:53,236 --> 00:21:55,332
I've had time to think.

242
00:21:57,222 --> 00:21:59,396
Not that you tried to kill me,

243
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:03,316
but about how Jesus saved me.

244
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:11,264
I didn't come here, Theodore,
to inflict any more pain.

245
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:18,790
Take my hand so we can put
this behind us. Please.

246
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,616
Show me the palm of
your other hand.

247
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:36,050
Don't insult me.
After all you've done,

248
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:42,088
the least I ask is that
you don't insult me.

249
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:10,945
Does not a warm hand feel
better than a cold shank?

250
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:18,219
You got a point there,
John. Yeah.

251
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:22,281
Truce.

252
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:25,826
You got it. Truce.

253
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,505
Son of a bitch.

254
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:47,236
It's been two and a half hours and
you're telling me that sheriff's
got nothing?

255
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,993
I'm telling you the
roads are blocked off.

256
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:51,945
That Mustang's going to be somewhere
within those ten square miles.

257
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:55,363
All right, listen,
you got two hours to find him.

258
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,917
And after that,
I have got to talk to the press.

259
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,175
There's an escaped
killer outside our walls

260
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:03,137
and there are some things that
are more important than career.

261
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,327
Now you find him.

262
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,603
- Hey, Captain.
- I don't have time.

263
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:14,782
He says he really
needs to talk to you.

264
00:24:14,937 --> 00:24:16,777
You have something for me
or do you need something,

265
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:19,138
'cause if it's the latter,
you just wasted my time.

266
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,405
That cellie you stuck
me with, Avocado...

267
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,708
Do you have something or
do you need something?

268
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,088
Last time I'm going to ask.

269
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:28,389
I'm asking you to just please
get me out of that cell.

270
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,168
Boss, please.

271
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,264
Boss!

272
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,803
Let's go!

273
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:50,857
You need to start relaxing.
It'll hurt a lot less.

274
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:53,234
Can we go on your bunk?

275
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,095
Sure, squirt.

276
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:59,586
Let me make it a wee
bit more comfortable.

277
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,589
Now we're talking it.

278
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:26,050
Are you the doctor
from the prison?

279
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:27,685
Uh, yeah. Can, I, uh...?

280
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,408
Do you know a prisoner
named Michael Scofield?

281
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:32,331
I do.

282
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,846
- You're his wife, right?
- I need to talk to you.

283
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,934
I think Michael has got
himself in some trouble.

284
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:44,895
And I think he's planning on doing
something dangerous to get out of it.

285
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:52,572
Thanks. Um, so what is it...?

286
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:55,383
Michael he has deep
need to help people.

287
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,337
So I've come to understand.

288
00:25:57,818 --> 00:26:00,244
That's actually how we met.

289
00:26:00,705 --> 00:26:03,597
There were these men
that brought me here.

290
00:26:03,893 --> 00:26:06,131
Told me I'd have good job,

291
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:09,117
but that was just a lie.

292
00:26:09,258 --> 00:26:11,438
They were going to sell me.

293
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:13,591
And until they did, I...

294
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:19,181
Michael paid them
off for my freedom.

295
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:22,569
And not to keep me for himself,
like I've heard from other girls,

296
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:25,539
but  to give me an opportunity.

297
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:29,781
He's a good man.

298
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:31,432
Yes, he is.

299
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:36,511
Nika, I want to do whatever
I can to help Michael.

300
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:40,602
To do that, I need you to tell me what
it is you think he's mixed up in.

301
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:44,929
- I think this was mistake.
- No, no, it's not at all.

302
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:47,015
God, I'm sorry.

303
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:51,519
Listen, could I just have a contact
number for you in case I see...

304
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,149
I  don't think
that's a good idea.

305
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,534
Please don't tell
him that we met.

306
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:55,373
I-I...

307
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:06,079
Something I don't get.

308
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:09,041
How could killing me stop you?

309
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:13,731
'Cause I'm the one who leaked
the information about EcoField.

310
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:17,038
They could've covered up the
scandal a thousand different ways,

311
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:20,201
but they chose to fake
Steadman's death.

312
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,857
And they chose you,

313
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,953
'cause they knew it
would flush me out.

314
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:30,333
They knew that any man with a son
on death row who was innocent,

315
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:33,066
would have to come forward.

316
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:34,555
But you didn't.

317
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,986
We had a cause, Linc.

318
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,678
We have a cause.

319
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,639
Their wars can be averted,

320
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,854
millions of lives can be saved.

321
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:52,504
So you were willing
to sacrifice one.

322
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:54,453
Yeah.

323
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:59,337
At least I thought...

324
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,032
But I couldn't watch you die.

325
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:08,250
You know what you've done?

326
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,676
The mother of my child is dead.

327
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,567
- I know.
- Do you?!

328
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,954
Then I'm guessing you know
Michael's in Fox River

329
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,381
and LJ's rotting
in some prison.

330
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:22,852
- I know all of it.
- If you think for a second...!

331
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:25,140
You don't have a
choice right now.

332
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,612
This is all on you. All of it.

333
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,912
Yeah, I know.

334
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,235
That's why I'm here.

335
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:37,135
'Cause there's still a
chance we can make it right.

336
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:13,079
That man in there is our
transportation out of here,

337
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:16,362
which means, now,
you go after him,

338
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,460
and it messes with my chances
of me seeing my family,

339
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,331
so I ain't gonna
let that happen.

340
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,800
So why don't you hand me that
shank you're holding, huh?

341
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:32,500
Good.

342
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,055
- Hey, Sara.
- Hey, Rick.

343
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:53,655
You all right?

344
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:56,506
Yeah. I can't find my keys.
Would you let me in?

345
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:57,854
Oh, sure.

346
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:08,524
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- That makes both of us.

347
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:11,502
Look...

348
00:30:13,654 --> 00:30:16,768
You were right, and I'm sorry.

349
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:19,219
I should never have gotten
you involved in this.

350
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:21,344
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's not.

351
00:30:21,532 --> 00:30:23,542
If anyone knew what I asked...

352
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:30,165
I'm not even sure why I did it.

353
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,536
- Thank you.
- Now we're even.

354
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:37,986
You didn't owe me anything.

355
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:42,047
Yes, I did.
I owed you everything...

356
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,002
but that's over now.

357
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:47,582
Good-bye.

358
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:53,094
The lady doctor...

359
00:30:53,315 --> 00:30:54,991
she cares for you.

360
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,517
Bellick!

361
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:09,942
It's the sheriff.
I think he's got something.

362
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:10,820
Go for Bellick.

363
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:13,814
We just got a call from Steve
Schimek up at the junkyard.

364
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:15,772
Our Mustang is on the premises.

365
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:16,865
He seen Burrows?

366
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:19,973
Yep, I got a couple of units five,
10 minutes away tops.

367
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,105
Good, I'm right behind you.

368
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,618
Here. You ready to travel?

369
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,170
Place is gonna be crawling with cops.
You know that, right?

370
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,240
There's an unimproved
road down by the river.

371
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,720
There's a chance they
haven't blocked it off yet.

372
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:38,914
We got trouble.

373
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:42,791
Come on.

374
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:44,647
Through here.

375
00:32:58,778 --> 00:32:59,836
Come on!

376
00:33:00,277 --> 00:33:01,228
Hey!

377
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:11,941
Get out of here.

378
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,445
Go.

379
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:16,818
Turn around.

380
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,416
Bellick!

381
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:33,632
Bellick, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

382
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,069
Thought you'd go for a little stroll,
did you?

383
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:15,775
You hear about Avocado?

384
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,335
Got his salchicha sliced.

385
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:22,212
- How?
- Tweener.

386
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,424
But Avocado's saying it
got caught on the frame

387
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:26,828
while he was hopping
down off his bunk. Yeah.

388
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:28,435
Why did he lie?

389
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:29,980
Doesn't want Tweener
to go to the SHU,

390
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,321
'cause he can't
get him in there.

391
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,871
All I have to say is as soon as
Avocado gets out of the infirmary...

392
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:38,975
Tweener's a dead man.

393
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,221
How's that key coming?

394
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:46,063
- What about your car?
- I just checked.

395
00:34:46,444 --> 00:34:48,451
Uh, your apartment?

396
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:53,110
Uh... no,
'cause I had them this morning.

397
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:56,014
Then they got to be here.

398
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,122
Just retrace your steps. When did
you first notice they were gone?

399
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:00,967
When I came back from lunch.

400
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,909
Hey, Kev, I need to take a
look at that visitation log.

401
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:39,016
Thanks.

402
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:42,727
Michael?

403
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:46,460
I need to know where he is.

404
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,073
- Who?
- Fibonacci.

405
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:55,150
You see, my conversion requires
that I not only seek forgiveness,

406
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:59,554
but provide forgiveness,
even to my greatest transgressors.

407
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:02,376
Don't look at me like that,

408
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:06,231
like I'm the same old man I used to be.
I'm not.

409
00:36:07,644 --> 00:36:13,016
Trust me, I need to reach out
to Fibonacci, so we can heal.

410
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,652
That's a good story,
but the answer is no.

411
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,345
I understand.

412
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:24,763
I'll be patient.

413
00:36:42,864 --> 00:36:43,760
Hello.

414
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:47,344
Hey, you're now
officially on standby.

415
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:50,975
And you'll have her there.
Do you understand?

416
00:36:51,348 --> 00:36:52,985
I'll do my best.

417
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:55,335
Hey, I said "Do
you understand?"

418
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:02,419
Yeah. Loud and clear.

419
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,714
Good. Goose Park Airstrip.
Find it on the map.

420
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:11,763
Soon as I call, you have that
bitch there ready and waiting.

421
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,164
Hey.

422
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:28,059
You still want me to swipe the
thing you were asking about?

423
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:31,595
'Cause I'm having a
going-out-of-business sale.

424
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:33,794
Why don't you get
yourself to Ad Seg.

425
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,003
For that to happen I'd have to
admit what I did to Avocado.

426
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:42,514
That'd get me what, 20 years?

427
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:45,147
I'm dead no matter what.

428
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:49,529
There may be another
way out of here.

429
00:37:51,182 --> 00:37:54,461
Yeah, in a body bag.

430
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:01,861
I need to know if
I can trust you.

431
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:06,671
I'm as straight up as they come,
you know?

432
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,278
No, I mean really trust you.

433
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:19,992
- Hey.
- Hi.

434
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:29,281
- How are you?
- I'm fine. You?

435
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:32,498
Fine.

436
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:37,027
Have your hand, please?

437
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,632
- Here they are.
- Here what are?

438
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:53,963
Your keys, they were right
over there by your inbox.

439
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,601
You got a maintenance
guy waiting outside here,

440
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:59,272
says you wanted him
to change the locks.

441
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:01,303
Want me to call him off?

442
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,521
No, send him in.

443
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,059
Is it okay if I...

444
00:39:16,114 --> 00:39:19,390
Yeah. We're about done here.

445
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,070
Is there something wrong?

446
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,629
No.

447
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,835
Unless you want to talk about
what happened this morning.

448
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:40,673
I think I have a
pretty good idea.

449
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:42,468
We're done here.

450
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:23,163
I want him under
24-hour surveillance.

451
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:26,049
He doesn't sneeze
without my knowing it.

452
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,986
What the hell for?
What did I do?

453
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:31,603
Someone tried to kill me.

454
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:36,445
Finding you at a junk yard eight miles
from here makes me think different.

455
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,618
Who was your accomplice?

456
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:42,530
What accomplice?

457
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:44,723
24-hour surveillance.

458
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:19,602
Boss.

459
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:24,652
I heard Avocado cut
his hose on your bunk.

460
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:27,229
Must have been some serious
gymnastics going on.

461
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:28,938
I got something for
you this time, boss,

462
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:31,517
but I want guaranteed
protection from Avocado,

463
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:33,446
and I want time cut off my bid.

464
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,564
Anything else?

465
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:38,248
Couple of big-canned whores
available to you 24/7?

466
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:40,911
Believe me,
what I got is worth it.

467
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,246
So are you gonna
step up or what?

468
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:49,159
This is your last
chance, Tweener.

469
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:52,990
You blow smoke again, they'll be
scraping you off the heel of my boot.

470
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,627
Scofield and his
whole P.I. crew?

471
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,027
They're escaping.



9999
