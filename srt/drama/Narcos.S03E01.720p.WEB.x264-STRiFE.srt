00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,273
<i>Thank you for being here
with us, with the groom and the bride.</i>

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>Come and dance with us, everyone.
Let's begin.</i>

4
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,781
<i>As they say, here we have
the most beautiful women in Laredo.</i>

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,033
- Congratulations, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

6
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,951
Congratulations.

7
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,055
The last time I saw Danny, he was riding
a big wheel down the sidewalk.

8
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,641
It means a lot to your<i> tía</i>
that you're here.

9
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,327
- Don Chucho.
- Luis, how are you?

10
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,477
How are you, sir?

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,396
- Javi.
- Hey, Luis.

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,440
We heard about what you did in Colombia.
We sure are proud of you.

13
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,110
- Thanks, Luis. Have a good night.
- You, too.

14
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,193
<i>Hola,</i>Paco.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,411
Everyone in Laredo is at this thing.

16
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,577
Hey!

17
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,169
- Be right back, Pops.
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,257
- Here you go, sweetheart. You got that?
- Yummy!

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Hey, Lorraine.

20
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,930
Javi. Heard you were back.

21
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,182
I mean, the whole town's talking about it.

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,310
I had some time off.

23
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,145
Decided to spend it here?

24
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,109
Actually, I'm...

25
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,903
trying to quit.

26
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,239
Doing the Nicorette thing.

27
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,908
Look at you. A whole new man.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,293
Listen, Lorraine...

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
I just wanted to say
I've thought about things...

30
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,760
and I'm real sorry about all of it.

31
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,803
You waited ten years
to tell me you're sorry?

32
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,847
I know what I did.

33
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,392
I was, um...

34
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,356
It was wrong.

35
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,777
I forgave you a long time ago, Javi.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,071
The truth is, I'm grateful.

37
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,032
I ended up where I'm supposed to be.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Maybe we both did.

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,579
If you hadn't come into my life
and disappeared from it,

40
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,289
none of that would have ever happened.

41
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,709
Can you imagine
if we were actually married?

42
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,298
- Here you go, baby.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,634
- Hey, Jav.
- Randy.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,678
- How are you?
- Good.

45
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,305
Yeah, I just... I just wanted to say hi.

46
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,390
Yeah.

47
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,351
You hungry?

48
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,646
Oh, you are getting so big.

49
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,620
I know you didn't like it tonight,
all the attention, but...

50
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,873
folks want to pay their respects.

51
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,583
You're a hero to them.

52
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm not a hero.

53
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,530
Will you tell me something?

54
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,119
What happened to you over there?

55
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,539
- Dad, I don't know. It got ugly.
- But you want to go back?

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,719
When you were a kid, a little guy,

57
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,638
all you wanted to do was get out of here,

58
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,515
out into the world.

59
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,560
But you didn't like what you found.

60
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
A lot of people don't.

61
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,064
But don't try to change it.

62
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,402
More likely, it'll change you.

63
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,655
It was right here, wasn't it?

64
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,910
The last time we had this conversation.

65
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,454
You didn't listen to me then, either.

66
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,455
Nope.

67
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,214
So, Cali.

68
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,343
Cali.

69
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,943
Sir, here you are.

70
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,778
Thank you.

71
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,122
<i>I'm not a hero.</i>

72
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,042
<i>There were some in the hunt for Escobar.</i>

73
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,336
<i>A lot, actually.</i>

74
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,840
<i>But it's tough to see them
through all the blood.</i>

75
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,259
<i>To kill a monster, sometimes you have
to get in bed with other monsters.</i>

76
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,387
<i>If that surprises you,
pick up a history book.</i>

77
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>It's what we do.</i>

78
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,478
<i>The enemy of my enemy is my friend,
until he becomes my enemy again.</i>

79
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,397
<i>When that happens, God help them.</i>

80
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,527
<i>The day Pablo went down, the Cali cartel
became Public Enemy Number One.</i>

81
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,323
<i>And the fact that they helped us
bring him down didn't mean shit.</i>

82
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,577
Many observers fear Colombia's
other large cartel, the Cali cartel,

83
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,913
will now simply step up
its own drug production.

84
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,831
<i>And that's exactly what happened.</i>

85
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,434
<i>While the world was focused on Escobar,</i>

86
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,170
<i>Cali's operations had grown exponentially,</i>

87
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,589
<i>differing from their rival
in every possible way.</i>

88
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,010
<i>Where Pablo sought the love and protection
of the masses of Medellín,</i>

89
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,346
<i>these guys rubbed shoulders
with Colombia's elite</i>

90
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,099
<i>and called themselves
"the Gentlemen of Cali."</i>

91
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>And whereas Escobar craved the spotlight,
these guys stayed in the shadows,</i>

92
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,188
<i>perfecting the game,</i>

93
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,943
<i>building complex smuggling
and distribution networks through Mexico,</i>

94
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:09,990
<i>Europe, and the Far East,
without leaving so much as a fingerprint.</i>

95
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,368
<i>Even the people working for them didn't
know it was Cali coke they were moving.</i>

96
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,912
<i>It was fucking Cocaine, Incorporated.</i>

97
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>And they ran it
like a Fortune 500 company.</i>

98
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>So, without further ado,</i>

99
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,421
<i>meet the management team
of the Cali cartel:</i>

100
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,718
<i>Pacho Herrera,
head of distribution and security.</i>

101
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,635
Hello.

102
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,055
<i>He led a team of young psychopaths
who would do anything he asked.</i>

103
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,224
Yes. What's up?

104
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,935
<i>Chepe Santacruz-Londoño.</i>

105
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,020
Let's see.

106
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,773
<i>Grew up with the Rodríguez brothers.</i>

107
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,653
<i>He was in charge of U.S. operations</i>

108
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>and responsible for Cali's
crown jewel: New York City.</i>

109
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,912
<i>He actually lived there,
under an assumed name, of course.</i>

110
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,417
<i>Cartel's number two was
operations chief: Miguel Rodríguez.</i>

111
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,335
Palmira's police superintendent.

112
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,646
Didn't we just take care of him?

113
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,673
- I'm talking about the new one, Arango.
- How much?

114
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,383
- Should I put $20,000?
- No.

115
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,886
Put 17.

116
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,305
- Seventeen?
- Yes.

117
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,016
<i>Miguel watched over
all the money coming in,</i>

118
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,060
<i>and what bribes they were paying out.</i>

119
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:26,941
<i>And last but not least, cartel CEO,
the man with the plan: Gilberto Rodríguez.</i>

120
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,445
<i>They called him the Chess Player,
because he was always one move ahead.</i>

121
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,284
<i>They were the pinnacle of trafficking
evolution. Apex drug dealers.</i>

122
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,745
<i>And being number two
allowed them to quietly grow</i>

123
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,414
<i>into the biggest cocaine cartel
in history.</i>

124
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>Except now, that was over.</i>

125
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,628
<i>Now that the guy
that occupied our attention was gone,</i>

126
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,838
<i>they were number one
with a fucking bullet.</i>

127
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>And there was no chess move
that would get them out of it.</i>

128
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,054
<i>But I was looking forward
to seeing them try.</i>

129
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,724
Anderson! Move all that over to the left.

130
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,935
The tables are too close together.

131
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,401
Are you planning on saying
anything tonight?

132
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,987
No.

133
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,865
I'll speak for the both of us.

134
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,451
- Did you talk to the North Valley people?
- Yes.

135
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,955
And?

136
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,582
They said what they thought
I wanted to hear.

137
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,002
But tonight, after the announcement,
we'll know the truth.

138
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,675
You're more superstitious than Aunt Luz.

139
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,535
Hey, boss.

140
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,954
Is everything ready?

141
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,413
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,001
It took all night, but... it's ready, sir.

143
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,628
You can handle it, you're young.

144
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,636
We're meeting Córdova.

145
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,930
He wants to go over the game plan.

146
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,099
Big night tonight, right?

147
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,060
Lots of company.

148
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,662
Gentlemen.
Let's start with the obvious.

149
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,332
Tonight is fucking important.

150
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,918
The Rodríguez brothers never...

151
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,629
gather members of their organization
in one place.

152
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,841
That simply never happens.
But tonight, they're going to do it.

153
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,928
So we have to be sharp.

154
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,681
- Eyes in the back of the head, understood?
- Yes, sir.

155
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,726
- Jorge.
- Stay focused.

156
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,187
Stay on the radio. Communicate.

157
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,564
Tonight is his last operation.

158
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,611
He's leaving us
to become a fancy businessman.

159
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,529
Let's leave a good impression.

160
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,491
Maybe he'll hire us one day.

161
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,243
Let's go.

162
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,128
What do you think Gilberto
is going to announce tonight?

163
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,257
I think it's a move into the Asian market.

164
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,425
I have no idea.

165
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,178
After Friday, it's not my problem.

166
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,805
Are you really leaving?

167
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,057
I promised Paola.

168
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,437
I promise things to my wife
every day, brother.

169
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,233
Relax, you'll find someone else
to make you look good.

170
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,027
I hope so, buddy.

171
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,947
Because right now,
I'm surrounded by a bunch of assholes.

172
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,210
Congratulations on the promotion, sir.

173
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,670
Tell me what you do again.

174
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,589
I'm the deputy country attaché.
I'll also be your driver.

175
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,758
I drive myself.

176
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,139
You know, you're kind of a big deal
around here. Since Escobar.

177
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,725
- Katie.
- Good morning.

178
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,312
Sir, can I ask?

179
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,398
What was Escobar like?

180
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,400
Never met him.

181
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,947
<i>Just because we'd been focused
on Escobar the past few years</i>

182
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>didn't mean we were completely ignoring
the Cali godfathers.</i>

183
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,162
I want updates from Duffy and Lopez
on where we're at with Cornerstone.

184
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,246
- ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,967
Those are our intelligence summaries
on the Cali cartel.

186
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,636
I don't want summaries.
Where's everything else?

187
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,139
<i>We had agents on them the whole time.</i>

188
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,849
<i>Good agents.</i>

189
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,770
<i>And recently, we had gotten lucky.</i>

190
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,940
You got some kind of medical condition?

191
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,319
Oh. No, I got one.

192
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,404
<i>The latest break in the case against Cali</i>

193
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,908
<i>came from a joint Customs-DEA operation
called Cornerstone.</i>

194
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,663
<i>And it put a lot of mid-level Cali guys
behind bars in the States.</i>

195
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,126
<i>And while they weren't eager to help us,</i>

196
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,046
<i>you could always count
on some poor relative in Colombia...</i>

197
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,343
<i>who would do whatever it takes
to get their brother or son back home.</i>

198
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,987
Who am I speaking with?

199
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,472
<i>And if that sounds harsh,
that's because it is.</i>

200
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,182
This is Andres, his brother.

201
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,142
<i>The DEA doesn't fuck around.</i>

202
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,560
And how can I help him?

203
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,116
Here we go.

204
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,371
Hey, brother. Have a seat.

205
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,875
Something to drink?

206
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,948
You're fine, brother.
Nobody out here knows us.

207
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,134
Cali cops don't even know we're here.

208
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,428
Relax. You're safe here.

209
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,971
Lay it on him.

210
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,682
Let's talk about tonight's party.

211
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,351
We need info on the people attending.

212
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,520
Cops, politicians.

213
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,397
- Cops and politicians?
- Yes.

214
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,568
Who work for the cartel.
These people are ruining your country.

215
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,335
And the why. Tell him.

216
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:52,076
Look, the thing is, these
people never get together in one place.

217
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,204
We need to know why now.

218
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,582
Our guess is Gilberto Rodríguez

219
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,460
is making some kind
of important announcement.

220
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,085
Understand?

221
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,380
If no...

222
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,549
bye-bye,<i> hermano.</i>

223
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,393
- How are things in Texas, Agent Peña?
- Hot.

224
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,315
How's the family? You know,
you had a few more weeks off coming.

225
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,168
Could've spent more time at home.

226
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,527
Yeah, well, I guess they couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

227
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,493
Sir, this operation in Miami, Cornerstone,
shook some leads loose.

228
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,119
Could be a break on Cali.

229
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,749
- Anyone testifying?
- No, but it put an asset in play.

230
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,515
Could shed some light on their next move.

231
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,594
Things won't be like Escobar, Agent Peña.

232
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,014
It can't be.
Things have changed down here.

233
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,432
New President coming in.

234
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,227
Gaviria put up with things
that this guy might not.

235
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,606
Just take it a little slowly.

236
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,442
Get your feet under you,
get used to the new job.

237
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,948
Sir, the CIA station chief...

238
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,825
he and I have history.

239
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,763
I'm hoping it won't be an issue
moving forward.

240
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,705
I know you and Stechner
have your differences.

241
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,416
- It won't be a problem.
- I'm not sure I share your confidence.

242
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,585
Stechner signed off on your appointment.

243
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,338
In fact, he wanted you back.

244
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,926
The CIA and the DEA
need to work together on this one.

245
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,511
We have the same goal.

246
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,487
Come in.

247
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,286
<i>Hola,</i> brother.

248
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,163
We were starting to worry.
Everything cool?

249
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,417
We were getting worried.
Everything okay?

250
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,169
Yes, but...
I thought someone was tailing me.

251
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,214
- He thinks he may have been followed.
- No, yeah, I figured.

252
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,383
I had to make sure I was alone.

253
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,177
Let's get you suited up.
Run through the plan again.

254
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,680
Take off your shirt. Sit.

255
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,644
Okay.

256
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,604
Ready.

257
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,688
We're good to go.

258
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,532
Look, don't you think you
should fix things with Pacho, Claudito?

259
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,704
He's a boss.

260
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,666
We're in their territory, right?

261
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:32,755
Yes. Yes.

262
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
I'll fix it tonight.

263
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,216
María.

264
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,051
María.

265
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:45,101
For our children,
and our children's children.

266
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,687
That sounded great, brother.

267
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,940
Let me do it from the top.

268
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,277
No one gives a shit about your speech.
We can hear it after...

269
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,030
- Pacho!
- Chepe!

270
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,199
Come here, you crazy motherfucker.

271
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,994
What's up?

272
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,789
Look at you. How's New York?

273
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,168
Cold. But if you ask nicely,
the girls make up for it.

274
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,921
I brought you something, baby-face.

275
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,801
Lovely. Thanks.

276
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,682
It's been too long
since we were all together.

277
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,021
Tonight is our night,
because we've earned this.

278
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,151
- Gentlemen of Cali, cheers!
- Cheers!

279
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,320
I think there is business
to discuss first, Gilberto.

280
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,116
You're acting like someone
just pissed you off.

281
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,661
Brother, you're richer than the Pope.

282
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,538
But I work harder than him.

283
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,622
Cheers, then!

284
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,206
To the Pope!

285
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,626
Cheers.

286
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,086
Welcome, Chepe.

287
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,508
Look, Gilberto...

288
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,804
you know I have a personal issue

289
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,891
with that son of a bitch,
Claudio Salazar from North Valley.

290
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,477
And he's downstairs.

291
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,562
I would like to solve it.

292
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,108
Okay, Pacho.

293
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:21,739
I understand your need for revenge,
but this isn't the time to get into it.

294
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,741
There's too much at stake.

295
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:29,830
Well... shall we enjoy
this expensive party or what?

296
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,793
No. Instead, let's listen
to Gilberto's speech again.

297
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,212
Chepe, you motherfucker.

298
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,776
Look, that's Menga's chief of police.

299
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,696
I pay him money every month.

300
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,658
I pay all these people.

301
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,869
Well done, big shot.

302
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,287
It's not your money.

303
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,206
But I'm the one who controls it.

304
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,792
- Who bought you these earrings?
- Guillermo. Enough.

305
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,961
Sure. You're turning into Al Capone.

306
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,259
Shit. Get out of here.

307
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,317
- How are you, sir?
- Pallomari.

308
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,319
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

309
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,656
Yes.

310
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,242
Nice to see you.

311
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,287
Don Gilberto, good evening.

312
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,956
- Welcome, Mr. Mayor.
- Don Gilberto, how are you?

313
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,918
Good evening, Don Gilberto.

314
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,594
- Look, here it is.
- Motherfucker.

315
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:20,816
Hello.

316
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,860
- Good evening.
- Can I have<i> aguardiente</i> with ice?

317
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,070
- Of course.
- Thank you.

318
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,008
Are you...

319
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,011
enjoying yourself?

320
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,930
Yes. Very much, thank you.

321
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,231
Miguel Rodríguez, nice to meet you.

322
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,691
María Salazar.

323
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,860
Thank you for having us.

324
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,008
Good evening.

325
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,843
Mr. Rodríguez would like
for his associates

326
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,030
to join him in the equestrian ring
for an announcement.

327
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,847
Please, go right ahead.

328
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,851
Gentlemen, please follow the ushers
towards the stables.

329
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,435
Thank you.

330
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,776
Stop there.

331
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,113
You must be using some high-end equipment

332
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,323
if you're getting anything
in this shitty light.

333
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,409
Who are you?

334
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,661
I'm in charge of security
for the Rodríguez brothers.

335
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,163
See that man over there?

336
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,457
His name is Navegante.

337
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,668
Guess what he does?

338
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,631
Either you come with me,
or you go with him.

339
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,215
You understand?

340
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,177
Follow me.

341
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,405
Your name is Andrés Restrepo.

342
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,032
You live with your mother
in commune number 3.

343
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,619
You have a girlfriend in Libertadores.

344
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,873
Your brother is Lucho.

345
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,293
He's in federal custody
in the United States.

346
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,254
That's why you agreed to work for the DEA.

347
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,964
Don't lie to me.

348
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,009
Andrés, you made a bad decision.

349
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,512
But I think you're smart enough
to realize that.

350
00:25:56,305 --> 00:26:00,058
You have another decision to make,
and it's the only way to get out alive.

351
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,269
Leave Cali.

352
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,065
Don't say goodbye to your mother
or to your girlfriend.

353
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,859
I need you to disappear.

354
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,865
Associates.

355
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,992
Friends.

356
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,953
Our enemy is dead!

357
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,625
Our business is strong!

358
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,878
Together we have taken this business

359
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,507
to heights that our predecessors
couldn't have imagined.

360
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:38,263
But friends... there's circumstances
that we need to acknowledge.

361
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,021
Stoddard!

362
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,606
<i>Listen to me.</i>

363
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:54,780
<i>The law enforcement spotlight will shine
brightly on us, as it once did on Escobar.</i>

364
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,742
<i>And so, while we celebrate,</i>

365
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:03,956
<i>they will do everything they can
to take away everything we've built.</i>

366
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,253
<i>An American named Joseph Kennedy</i>

367
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,172
made his fortune
selling bootlegged liquor,

368
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,008
but he turned that money into legitimacy.

369
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,261
His children, great politicians.

370
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,931
And one of them
was even elected president.

371
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:26,436
Yes, gentlemen, we have been negotiating
with the authorities,

372
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,272
and soon we will reach an agreement.

373
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:39,491
Our organization, within six months,
will be out of the cocaine business.

374
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,745
We will surrender our labs,

375
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,123
our safe houses,

376
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,750
and our trafficking routes.

377
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:55,173
But gentlemen, don't make the mistake
of thinking it won't be on our terms.

378
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,677
Any prison sentences will be minimal.

379
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,305
Our money will remain ours.

380
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,808
Our legitimate businesses
will continue to grow.

381
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,479
We have six months to make
as much money as possible!

382
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,191
And gentlemen,
as a token of our friendship,

383
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,572
we'll give each of you a juicy share

384
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,658
of the final profits from this year.

385
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,960
To the bright future we'll all soon enjoy.

386
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,048
For our children...
and our children's children!

387
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,552
- Cheers...
- Cheers!

388
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,180
- Cheers, gentlemen!
- Cheers!

389
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,642
- What did you think?
- I think it's a great move.

390
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,188
- Congratulations!
- For the future!

391
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,194
Thank you, brother. Thank you for coming.

392
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,981
What would you like?

393
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,298
Whiskey. Dry.

394
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,721
Hey, sir!

395
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,017
We were wondering
if we could get you a drink.

396
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,186
I'm good. Thanks.

397
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,065
Okay.

398
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:40,445
Six months.

399
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,240
I'm going to bleed New York dry.

400
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,744
Come up behind the Statue of Liberty
and fuck her right up her ass.

401
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,127
And then what?

402
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:00,173
We only have six months
of doing whatever the fuck we want?

403
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,099
Hello.

404
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,148
I love you, brother.

405
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,236
I'll see you on the dance floor.

406
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,800
- Can you get in the car, please?
- Why do you want to leave so early?

407
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,260
Because it's time, okay?

408
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,144
- Why are you treating me like this?
- Enough!

409
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,264
Get in the car.

410
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,526
How was everything tonight, Jorge?

411
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,211
Very good, sir.

412
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,384
Do you think we surprised them?

413
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,262
Yes. I think you surprised many people.

414
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,727
I'm told we had an uninvited guest.
What happened there?

415
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,149
Don't be modest.

416
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,360
Córdova told me.

417
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,071
It's your talent.

418
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,741
Spotting the threat,
knowing when they're going to fuck us.

419
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,911
It's priceless.

420
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,543
I'm told you want to leave.

421
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,633
I'm grateful to you
and your family, but...

422
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,346
I'm starting my own security firm.

423
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:17,352
I only wanted to stay until...
Escobar stopped being a threat.

424
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,940
And we are very grateful. Honestly.

425
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,527
You have done great things for us
over the years.

426
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,488
For my family. For me.

427
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,452
I cannot accept your resignation, Jorge.

428
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:47,924
With all due respect,
I've already made arrangements...

429
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,509
Arrangements can change.

430
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,390
Look, we didn't get where we are
by allowing good people to leave.

431
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,228
We will need you more than ever
in the months ahead.

432
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,815
It's only six months.

433
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,403
Can I count on you, Jorge?

434
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,906
Yes?

435
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,204
Of course, boss.

436
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,413
Miguel.

437
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,811
Pretty girl.

438
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,399
Displays some shaky judgment
in men, though.

439
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,988
Welcome back, Agent Peña.

440
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,407
<i>Mazel tov</i> on the promotion.

441
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:59,246
That extra, what, 9K a year
is really gonna come in handy.

442
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,372
The same.

443
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,791
So?

444
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,918
You signed off on me
coming back to Bogotá.

445
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,001
Did indeed.

446
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,214
Because you know how things work.

447
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,258
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

448
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,472
To the folks back in D.C.,
Escobar was a win.

449
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,640
Thanks.

450
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,478
But down here...
we know what it cost, don't we?

451
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,897
Medellín was a failure.

452
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,357
Thousands of Colombians dead,

453
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,277
and coke still flooding
American streets by the ton.

454
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,114
Oh, come on. You don't care about
American streets or dead Colombians.

455
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,205
What was accomplished, Agent Peña?

456
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,043
We do Cali differently.

457
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,547
No swallowing the spider
to catch the fly this time.

458
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,383
America's got plans for Colombia.

459
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,845
Another bloodbath complicates them.

460
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,267
So...

461
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,395
what's the play?

462
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,147
Surrender.

463
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,358
Cali cartel throws in the towel.

464
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,737
Hands over the keys to the biggest
criminal enterprise in history.

465
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,603
As far as I'm concerned,
the DEA can even take the credit.

466
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,326
And these fucking guys walk?

467
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,454
Negotiations are on the two-yard line,

468
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,624
but it has backing from Washington.

469
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,421
So, what the fuck do you need me for?

470
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,549
Well, you're the dashing DEA agent
that took down Escobar.

471
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,969
Always helps to have a hero on board.

472
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,765
Don't worry. Cali will serve some time.

473
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,392
Technically speaking.

474
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,479
And that's enough for you?

475
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:53,860
If there were any justice in this world,
Javier, you'd be in jail.

476
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,786
I know your guys are running an operation
on Cali tonight.

477
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,870
Please.

478
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:11,002
I can tell you this:
it'll come up double zeros.

479
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,465
These guys don't make mistakes.

480
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,594
You try to go after the Cali bosses,
all you'll get are more bodies.

481
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:43,910
I don't know, man.

482
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,788
I met him at an embassy thing
about a year ago.

483
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,706
Yeah?

484
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,874
Couldn't drink it or fuck it,
dude wasn't interested.

485
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,547
I hear you. I mean, he's not a bad guy.

486
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,467
He was in my class at the Academy.

487
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,644
Kid's been gone eight hours.
He better have something good.

488
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,116
Fucking retard.

489
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,918
Something's up.

490
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,612
Maybe he got made. Or just spooked.

491
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,989
Either way, we stay here tonight.

492
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,950
- Head out when it's light.
- Yeah.

493
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,839
Does Andrés have this number?

494
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,592
We don't know the phone number.
How could he?

495
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,223
Answer it.

496
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,686
Hello?

497
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,981
Hello? Who is this?

498
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,568
Hang up!
And get away from the fucking window!

499
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,656
They're fucking watching us.

500
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,744
<i>Turns out that break
from Cornerstone wasn't much of a break.</i>

501
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,873
<i>Cali spent a billion dollars a year
on payoffs.</i>

502
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:39,627
<i>That's "billion," with a B.
Which bought eyes and ears everywhere.</i>

503
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,505
<i>Anyone visiting Cali was ID'd
and background checked</i>

504
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,257
<i>before they put their bags down.</i>

505
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,428
<i>Walk into a police station,
they know about it.</i>

506
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,805
<i>Get into a taxi, they know.</i>

507
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,183
<i>Make a phone call, forget it.</i>

508
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,769
<i>They basically owned
the fucking phone company.</i>

509
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,105
<i>Operators were told
to pay close attention to calls</i>

510
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,359
<i>that came from places of interest,
like, say, the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá.</i>

511
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,737
<i>Get a call from them...</i>

512
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,949
<i>you got flagged.</i>

513
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,220
Who am I speaking with?

514
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,287
<i>And from that point on...</i>

515
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,331
Bye-bye,<i> hermano.</i>

516
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,583
Understand?

517
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,377
<i>they were on you.</i>

518
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,339
<i>It was like the Soviet Union
with nice weather.</i>

519
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,091
- Fuck!
<i>- Even called it the Cali KGB.</i>

520
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,428
- Juan.
- Here it is, sir.

521
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,512
Thank you.

522
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
Don Gilberto.

523
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,659
This just arrived.

524
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,168

<i>Retirement works

528
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,357
I just bought a brand new plane.

529
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,110
So that motherfucker Gilberto
can shove it up his ass.

530
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,947
<i>Besides, who are they to make a deal

<i>They don't get to surrender on our behalf.</i>

532
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,745
That son of a bitch, Díaz.

533
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,582
I'm going to send Navegante.

535

They're going to have to give me more
than that fucking wrapping paper.

536
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:57,890
Fucking balls on the old goat
to tell me how to run my business.

537
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,770
That's not going to be so easy.
These men are weak.

538
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,857
I'll handle that one myself.

539

to snatch the good territories.

542
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,869
Let's organize
so we can put a move together now.

543

Fuck Joseph Kennedy,

Córdova...

545
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,754
El Pecas will handle that one.

Please don't look at me like that.

It's one o'clock in the morning.

No, brother.

Fine.

And?

570
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,757
He asked me not to leave.

571
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,427
Just for a little while.

572
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,512
How long?

573
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,058
I'm asking you how long.

574
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,561
- Six months.
- Six months?

575
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,522
What did you tell him?

576
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,736
What could I tell him? It's six months.

577
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,114
We've talked about this for a long time.

578
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,272
You're telling me we can't start our new
lives because we have to wait six months?

579
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,999
You know what? I don't think
you really want to leave this job.

580
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,418
- How can you say that?
- You think I'm an idiot?

581
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,003
You like working for them.

582
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,131
It's become your life, Jorge.

583

You are my life. The girls are my life.

584
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,305
- What do you want me to do?
- Don't say another word.

585
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,058
- It's six months, not six years.
- Not another word.

586
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,784
She owns a spa.

587

588

A bottle of<i> aguardiente,</i>

accept this as a token of respect.

594

To let bygones be bygones.

595
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,575
You know what, Pacho?

596
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:56,165
I think our differences are in the past.

597
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,131
I'll be right back to share it with you.

Please, let's talk. Pacho!

609
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,385
Motherfucker.
He didn't do anything to you.

610
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,681
Pacho, you motherfucker!

611
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,600

616
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,865
No! No, no, no!

617
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,367
Son of a bitch, Pacho!

618
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,581

619
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,333

<i>When Pablo Escobar killed you,

<i>But the Gentlemen of Cali...</i>

622

<i>they did that differently, too.</i>

623
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:56,113
<i>They wrapped your body with chicken wire
and dumped you in the Cauca River.</i>

624
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:01,493
<i>When you bloated and your body expanded,
the wire cut you into little pieces...</i>

625

<i>for fish food.</i>

626
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,666
<i>Not very "gentlemanly,"

<i>I suppose that's for the best.</i>

634
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,442
<i>It makes it easier to look the other way.</i>

635
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,570
<i>To let them fucking slide.</i>

636
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,535
<i>To pretend that these guys weren't just
as evil as the guy that came before them.</i>
