1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:02,135
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:03,743
Mr. Kim. Sara Tancredi.
I'm on it.

3
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,667
Is pursuing her the
best use of your time?

4
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,120
- It is.
- I'll let the President know.

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,258
- I contact the President directly.
- I'll contact her.

6
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:16,968
No family with
Patoshik? Nothing?

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,640
Yeah. Until about four years
ago when he killed them all.

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,253
Fernando Sucre--
he was in Las Vegas around 2:00.

9
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:26,698
Out west,
just like Bagwell and Franklin.

10
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,030
You know D.B. Cooper?

11
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:31,280
The money's in Utah,
and they're all going to get it.

12
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:33,988
You're one of them
Fox River boys.

13
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:45,934
- Come on. You got the map?
- No. Someone else does.

14
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:49,880
Before I destroyed it, I committed
it to my photographic memory.

15
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:53,701
I have the information, you have
the manual requirements necessary

16
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:56,472
to unearth Westmoreland's
buried booty.

17
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,021
- Get in.
- Okay.

18
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:02,403
Should be dead ahead.

19
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,460
The bastards built over it.

20
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,062
It's gone.

21
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:22,992
We have to open
up in 15 minutes.

22
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:24,823
So, it doesn't matter.
I dare you.

23
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,592
- I said no.
- I dare you. Please?

24
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,933
The ranch is gone, Michael.

25
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,850
Well, the five
million might not be.

26
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,160
And you gonna find it how?

27
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,782
What, you got a divining
rod tattooed on your ass?

28
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,683
I don't want to hear
anything out of your mouth

29
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:17,063
other than that your
photographic memory spits out

30
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,870
regarding that map.

31
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:21,061
You watch your
tone with me, boy.

32
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:25,052
I will watch you get tossed to the side
of the road to fend for yourself, boy.

33
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,942
Because if you can't remember
where that silo was,

34
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,153
you're worthless to us.

35
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,601
- Yo, let me out!
- Shut up!

36
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:35,041
- The map!
- Uh, uh, okay.

37
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:37,433
Okay, okay, all right,
all right, all right...

38
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:40,482
The ranch...
The ranch was in the center of a box--

39
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:44,152
Sheep Road on one side,
Kokosing Road perpendicular.

40
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,970
In the center of the property
was the ranch house.

41
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:50,443
And the ranch house was
surrounded by trees.

42
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:05,942
Every tree here is
a year old at most.

43
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,370
Except those.

44
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:13,363
Where is the silo?

45
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:20,400
In... side the trees.
I want to say on the left,

46
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:23,931
but that may have been a barn.

47
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,900
I remembered the
best I could, gents,

48
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:29,503
but I didn't know this place would
now be smothered in tract homes,

49
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,842
so, you know, I'm sorry that
I'm not Rainman over here.

50
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:39,450
- Mahone.
- Lyle Sands.

51
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:43,221
We've been briefed on all the men at
large. The full force and resources

52
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:46,443
of the entire Salt Lake City
field office are at your disposal.

53
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:48,192
Thank you.
Do you have those files my office

54
00:04:48,225 --> 00:04:50,633
- requested on the D.B. Cooper case?
- We're pulling them now.

55
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,213
And this is the D.B.
Cooper case from 30 years ago?

56
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:56,092
Correct. If I can get those files
immediately, I'd appreciate it.

57
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:59,980
Hey, sorry, but I have to ask.
Aren't you here for the Fox River Eight?

58
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:04,690
I am, and they're here in Utah
to get D.B. Cooper's money,

59
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,800
so how about those files, Lyle?

60
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:08,610
Silo.

61
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,481
Silo, silo, silo, silo.

62
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,302
This is stupid.
We're going to get made out here.

63
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:17,022
Ah, shut it.
I think I remember.

64
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,793
If I had to bet,
I'd lay it all on the silo

65
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,750
being on the left of the
ranch house inside the trees.

66
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:27,871
No. It's outside the trees.
Right there.

67
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,212
You see those two trees?

68
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:32,191
They're shorter than the rest.

69
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:34,681
They were all planted
at the same time, but

70
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,931
those two didn't get
as much sunlight.

71
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:40,651
- Something was in their way.
- The silo.

72
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:44,221
Our money should be right
there under that garage.

73
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,052
You better be right, boy.

74
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,213
This isn't a
high-end subdivision.

75
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,183
They slapped this
place up overnight.

76
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:52,671
The silo's foundation
might still be there.

77
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,990
To save money,
they probably just laid the concrete

78
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,090
for the garage floor
right on top of it.

79
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:59,731
We'll dig straight down.
If we hit the foundation, we stay.

80
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:04,523
- But if not, we go.
- Let's do it.

81
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:11,670
- Oh, man.
- Uh-uh.

82
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:21,700
Ain't no problem that a screwdriver
to her temple won't fix.

83
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:32,712

84
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,692
People die all the time, boys.

85
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:06,190
Five million dollars
comes once in a lifetime.

86
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:08,802
Let me out!

87
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,582
Well, we got to do something.

88
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,162
And it's not going to
involve hurting anyone.

89
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,633
I got an idea. First,
we're going to need some supplies.

90
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:43,000
110% do not agree with this.

91
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,542
Everybody's got to pitch
in to make this happen.

92
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:49,580
But back in the big house,
the boy proved he couldn't be trusted.

93
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,330
Which is why we're
doing it here.

94
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:54,662
If he gets caught in town,
he ain't got a clue where the house is.

95
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:58,663
Besides, you're the one we
can't turn our backs on.

96
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:02,373
Oh.

97
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,131
You know,
I could have died in there, man.

98
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,613
Well, guess what?
We need you to do something.

99
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:15,710
I need you to do something for me.
I want my cut of the money.

100
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:18,912
Well, we'll talk once you
prove we can trust you.

101
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,703
What do I got to do?

102
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,481
I want you to go back
to that Garden Center

103
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:27,680
and get everything on this list.
Then gas up the car.

104
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:32,313
And we'll meet you right
back here in an hour.

105
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:37,221
- All right.
- And David...

106
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:41,651
Don't screw this up.

107
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:44,573
This ain't Fox
River no more, man.

108
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:47,762
You're looking at
the real deal now.

109
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:50,381
But I want my cut.

110
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,220
I'll be back in an hour.

111
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:01,983
Let's go.

112
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,422
Mistake.

113
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:07,750
Big mistake.

114
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:39,192
Come on, man.

115
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:09,111
Am I glad to see you.

116
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:11,773
Did you walk here?

117
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:16,060
Well, no... it's...
it's just a long story, man.

118
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,280
Thought you were meeting
up with your family.

119
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:21,980
I met a...
I met a few roadblocks. You?

120
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:23,322
Yeah.

121
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:26,892
Let me guess...
you're going to Tooele.

122
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:27,912
Yep.

123
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:32,332
Well, it looks like we're
going in the same direction.

124
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:37,411
Hopefully we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?

125
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,200
Hey...

126
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:46,783
I'll make it worth your while.

127
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,023
Got some good news, sir.

128
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,132
Got our first tip on Patoshik.

129
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:56,950
Spotted at a burger joint
in Cedar Grove, Wisconsin.

130
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:58,980
Just hand it over to
local authorities for now.

131
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:01,852
The only thing we're working
today is Utah and D.B. Cooper.

132
00:11:01,886 --> 00:11:03,051
Got it.

133
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:05,551
Lyle.

134
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:08,830
There's a guy here listed
as having the only

135
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,560
D.B. Cooper bill ever found in
circulation, Harold Jenkins.

136
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:15,831
Yeah, D.B. bought gas from Jenkins with
a hundred on the day of the hijacking.

137
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,790
We checked the serial
numbers and they matched.

138
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,701
- You worked the case?
- Fresh out of the academy.

139
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,003
And nobody's cracked it yet.

140
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:28,000
What makes you think that these
escapees know where the money is?

141
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,611
Because they may have been locked
up with the real D.B. Cooper.

142
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,013
This Jenkins from the gas station,
he still alive?

143
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,580
Should be.
He was only 18 at the time.

144
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,650
Let's go say hi to him.

145
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:14,868
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

146
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,354
Please check the
number and dial again.

147
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:36,400
I'm assuming you're here because
you have updates on Sara Tancredi?

148
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:41,013
Yes, um, Scofield sent her
a message through the mail,

149
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,930
that phone number that
was disconnected.

150
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,272
You know, to be honest, uh,

151
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:50,921
I was expecting to
brief the President.

152
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:55,711
Yeah, about that, uh,

153
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:58,532
right now, as you can imagine,

154
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,253
- Caroline's quite busy.
- She's always been busy.

155
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,990
I've been working side-by-side
with her for 15 years.

156
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:06,752
Paul, she's the President
of the United States now.

157
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,813
Yes, Bill,
and I helped put her there.

158
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,613
Well, if you'd like for
her to remain in office,

159
00:13:12,798 --> 00:13:15,851
you'll take my advice and just
stay on the sidelines for now.

160
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:21,531
She needs to be completely insulated
from anything regarding Lincoln Burrows.

161
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,602
I want to talk to her.

162
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:31,961
You report to me now,
and only me.

163
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:34,660
You're not to try and contact
Caroline again without my approval,

164
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:38,750
and you don't show
up here unannounced.

165
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:43,753
Finish the job you were given;
get Burrows.

166
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:48,352
If you're telling me the road to
him leads through Sara Tancredi,

167
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:50,700
by all means, pursue it.

168
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:54,082
And once that's been accomplished
and this whole thing goes away,

169
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:58,170
we'll go about transitioning
you back into Caroline's life.

170
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:03,380
Now do you have
anything else on Sara?

171
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,870
The President has
unwavering faith in you.

172
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,861
Wants to make sure
you go through the

173
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:10,343
Senate approval process
with your eyes wide open.

174
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:11,610
So what are we up against?

175
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:15,400
Key allies in the House and Senate are
Meyerhoff, Barnwell and Summerville.

176
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:17,182
We're counting on them
to sway the middle.

177
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:18,463
But who's the opposition?

178
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:22,493
Senators Blake and Killoren have openly
vocalized their opposition to you as VP.

179
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,211
Any indications to why?

180
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:28,301
Political payback for the President's
vote on the energy bill last month.

181
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:31,363
Took them by surprise and
they don't like surprises.

182
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:39,792
- Lance, this is, uh, my father Frank.
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.

183
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,952
It's nothing to
lose sleep over.

184
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,241
Frankly, the biggest
issue we have to address

185
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:46,923
are the charges
facing your daughter.

186
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:48,931
Governor, are you with me?

187
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,932
Absolutely.

188
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:09,231
No, just chill, dawg. Listen,

189
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,812
once we roll out,
we bounce out of town,

190
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:14,730
we'll drop a dime and
they will find you.

191
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:16,890
Just be quiet. Just chill, man.

192
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:34,490
Woody?

193
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:39,812
Where you at? Woody?

194
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:58,492
I need Sheriff Williams.

195
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:01,011
Yeah, I'll hold.

196
00:16:08,045 --> 00:16:09,261
Woody?

197
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:26,830
When'd you learn
about electricity?

198
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,512
I used to steal copper wiring
from transformer boxes.

199
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:32,131
Sell 'em on the docks,
make a few bucks.

200
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,673
When you were at school,
of course.

201
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:47,490
I was just looking, Pretty.

202
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:49,211
What's that old chestnut?

203
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:51,672
"I can look at the menu.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna eat."

204
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,901
We get in, we get the money, we get out.
That's it.

205
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:56,251
No, absolutely.

206
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,673
We're good.

207
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,073
Now it's just up to the kid.

208
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,651
Did you get everything?

209
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,432
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

210
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:44,043
What?

211
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:46,481
Nothing. It's cool.
I handled it.

212
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:47,841
- Whoa!
- What?!

213
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:48,630
Whoa.

214
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,862
Okay. Check it.

215
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,831
This fool came in the shop.

216
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,913
He was acting all shady.
He got a bad vibe,

217
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:59,582
so he picked up his celly phone, he
started to make a call, so I popped him.

218
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:00,972
You did what?!

219
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,972
I hit him with a shovel, man!
I didn't know what else to do!

220
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,801
So I just, I tied him up and

221
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:08,102
in put him in the back room
with that other country hick.

222
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,051
- Here we go. Here we go.
- I came through, you gimp!

223
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:14,723
- Who was he calling?
- The sheriff.

224
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:18,102
Man, man, I don't know, dude.
It just, it set off...

225
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,490
- Did the call go through?!
- Maybe, man...

226
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,581
What do you mean, maybe?
Did the call go through?!

227
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:30,963
Yes. No, I don't know! I don't know,
man. Yo, but I got the gear.

228
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:33,393
We got to move on this now.

229
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:35,650
Yes?

230
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:40,102
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is your electricity out?

231
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:43,282
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Harold Jenkins.

232
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:47,941
- Right here.
- Alexander Mahone, FBI.

233
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,312
I'm staying 50 feet away
from her at all times.

234
00:18:50,347 --> 00:18:52,450
What the hell else
does she want?

235
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,331
I'm not here about that.

236
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,982
- What are you here for?
- D.B. Cooper.

237
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:02,402
People still want to know
about that guy? Unbelievable.

238
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:05,533
You worked the gas station in
American Fork where he filled up.

239
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:10,133
Yeah. Normal-looking guy.
Barely said a word.

240
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:13,771
There were some discrepancies in the
statement you filed 30 years ago.

241
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:17,522
In the report, it's noted that you
said he filled up at 7:00 a.m.,

242
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,500
but on another occasion,
you said it was 7:00 p.m.

243
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:24,283
- Which was it?
- Both.

244
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,343
- He gassed up twice?
- Yeah.

245
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:34,221
- Full tanks both times?
- Yeah. Why?

246
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,121
A systems what?

247
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,051
It's a systems
diagnostics test.

248
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:43,653
Footage from our gopher cam picked up
exactly where your line was corrupted.

249
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:48,373
- And who corrupted it, you guys?
- Maybe.

250
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:51,530
All I know is my supervisor called
and said he wants me and my crew

251
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:56,043
to get over here and fix that
problem double-quick, double-time.

252
00:19:56,135 --> 00:20:00,802
So... you're not with
the electric company?

253
00:20:00,928 --> 00:20:04,000
No, ma'am.
Now feel free to call your company,

254
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,532
but I should tell you,
all they'll do is send over some tech,

255
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:08,583
maybe tomorrow if you're lucky.

256
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,623
And he'll spend a whole day
trying to find the problem

257
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,861
and another day
trying to fix it.

258
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:20,581
But we're here right now and we're
ready to turn your juice back on.

259
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:24,161
- My juice?
- That's right.

260
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,382
And, uh...

261
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:32,613
and that's your... crew?

262
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:37,073
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:41,393
Yeah, D.B.
Cooper was driving a 1965 Chevy Nova.

264
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:44,502
There's no record on file
that Cooper even had a car.

265
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:47,610
But Charles Westmoreland did, and
the car registered to him at the time

266
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:51,222
was a 1965 Chevy Nova with
a 16-gallon gas tank.

267
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:55,180
Back then, a Chevy that size probably
got what, eight miles to the gallon?

268
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:57,813
Now, D.B.
stopped at the station in American Fork,

269
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,643
gassed up once early that day

270
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:02,660
and then came back later that
same night and gassed up again.

271
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:06,100
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico,
which is a straight shot south,

272
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:09,052
drive off the main road
for an all-day detour?

273
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:09,682
The money.

274
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,642
Exactly. Cooper/Westmoreland jumped
out of a plane with $5 million.

275
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:18,950
But Westmoreland didn't have the
money on him when he was arrested.

276
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:22,082
He ditched it before he got caught.
Give me that Magic Marker.

277
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:26,323
From American Fork, he couldn't have
gone further than 64 miles in
any direction.

278
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,450
I want everything you've
got in that perimeter.

279
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,230
Those cons are in one
of these towns, and

280
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:34,060
if there's so much as a cat missing in
one of them, I want to know about it.

281
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:40,042
The defective cable runs
right beneath your garage.

282
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:43,560
We're gonna have to dig up
the floor to get to it.

283
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,252
Well, who's gonna pay for this

284
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,700
and what about the
cleanup and the repair?

285
00:21:49,797 --> 00:21:51,762
Well, the company
will cover all costs.

286
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:54,420
We'll just dig a small trench,

287
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:56,550
once we're finished,
we'll re-lay the cement.

288
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,231
It'll look as good as new.

289
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:00,010
How long is it going to take?

290
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:03,343
One way or another,
we'll be out of here today.

291
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,610
We really need to
get started, ma'am.

292
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:10,382
We wouldn't want a pretty
little thing like yourself

293
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,210
sitting in the dark tonight,
now do we?

294
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:17,303
Now that depends on
who I'm sitting with.

295
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:18,522
Touche.

296
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:27,401
Fine, that's okay, y'all go ahead
and do whatever y'all need to do.

297
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:29,650
Jeanette, the noise
might be substantial.

298
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:32,560
You might want take in that
tennis game after all.

299
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:35,903
Oh, no it's...
it's too hot for that now.

300
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,843
Plus, I'm gonna keep
an eye on y'all

301
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:40,821
and make sure you
don't steal anything.

302
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:41,891
Ma'am.

303
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:49,242
- How are you?
- Good.

304
00:22:51,557 --> 00:22:53,003
All right, where's Tweener?

305
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:55,220
He's next door plugging
in the extension cord.

306
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,302
We're going to have
to cut up the cement.

307
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:00,230
Yo, we gots company.

308
00:23:05,697 --> 00:23:07,993
What's up, snowflake?

309
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:12,751
As always,
your timing is flawless.

310
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,543
I don't follow.

311
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,101
Well, let me try to
explain it to you.

312
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,741
We're trying to
run something here

313
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,131
and we can't have people
walking in off the street.

314
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:24,651
Oh, oh, okay,
so you want us to leave

315
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,953
and then you can just
mail us the check?

316
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,721
Sucre, I know you trust me.

317
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:33,752
And you know I'll cut
you in on that money.

318
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:37,610
But the two of you being here
right now jeopardizes everything.

319
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:42,730
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.

320
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:46,072
Wait a minute. Hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?

321
00:23:46,168 --> 00:23:48,941
You know, I say I want in,
you say no.

322
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:53,730
Then I threaten to tell somebody
about what's going on here.

323
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,782
Then you decide to play nice and
then we're one big, happy family.

324
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:02,291
Why don't we just stop wasting time,
all right?

325
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:08,223
Thank you.

326
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,351
Damn, man, you still alive?

327
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:23,741
- And kickin', home boy.
- How'd you find us?

328
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,223
Man, if I can do rapid deployment
of satellite communications

329
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:29,712
for Uncle Sam all
over the world...

330
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:33,191
How are you guys doing?

331
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:36,100
Who are you? Who are they?

332
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,683
I, uh,
I had to call my supervisor.

333
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,473
He sent them right over.
This job is a top priority.

334
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:45,293
We want to get this done as quickly
and efficiently as possible.

335
00:24:57,558 --> 00:24:59,292
Well, Jeanette, like I said,

336
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:02,230
there's a lot of work to do,
and it's going to be noisy.

337
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:06,871
- Oh, drinks. I forgot to ask.
- We're good. Thanks.

338
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:19,121
Yo, man, this is not good.

339
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,701
We got her up in our grill
checking in on us all the time.

340
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,091
The boy is right.

341
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:30,862
And since I can't dig,
I'll volunteer to keep her occupied.

342
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,201
You don't touch her.

343
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:37,580
Who are you, Sister Mary Francis?
I know how to play nice.

344
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:39,740
I'll be watching.

345
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:34,231
Billy? Is that you?

346
00:26:42,888 --> 00:26:45,280
Billy? Is that you?

347
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:50,642
Yep.

348
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:53,742
Oh.

349
00:26:57,905 --> 00:26:59,553
Thank you kindly.

350
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:06,381
Well now,
how did you get out of working?

351
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,673
Union rules.

352
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:12,151
Uh, one crew member
always has to supervise.

353
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,333
I'll check on them in a bit.

354
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:20,190
- Lemonade?
- Mm.

355
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:22,672
Hmm...

356
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:29,153
More ice.

357
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:41,231
Yeah. And I like mine
with a little... Oops.

358
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:47,073
But since you're on the clock,
I guess you can't...

359
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:49,033
join me?

360
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,621
Just two fingers.

361
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:17,902
Been a while.

362
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:19,060
Yeah?

363
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:27,701
Whiskey always makes me feel...

364
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:30,142
irascible.

365
00:28:30,925 --> 00:28:33,650
I don't know what that means.

366
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:37,880
But I do like the sound of it.

367
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:46,072
Are you wearing Angel perfume?

368
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,433
I am.

369
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:56,050
Oh, hmm...

370
00:28:56,655 --> 00:29:00,423
That reminds you of an ex,
I take it.

371
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:01,300
Yeah.

372
00:29:03,626 --> 00:29:07,100
Now, was that good memories...

373
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,351
or bad memories?

374
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:13,682
Both.

375
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:27,350
- Did you talk to Maricruz?
- I don't want to talk about it.

376
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,732
I got to get some
water or something.

377
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:33,570
Use the hose on the
other side of the house.

378
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:37,930
Sucre...

379
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,550
down the road,

380
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:44,213
if you're in
trouble, europeangoldfinch.net.

381
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,732
It's what we can all
use to communicate.

382
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:50,940
Post a note on
the message board.

383
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:56,783
- What's it called?
- Europeangoldfinch.net.

384
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:58,743
That's a bird, right?

385
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:07,102
I got something.

386
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:15,553
It's the silo's foundation.

387
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:16,863
Hells, yeah.

388
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:19,241
Thank you, Charles.

389
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:23,883
We just need to find the
edge and dig underneath it.

390
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,060
We'll get the money...

391
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:29,023
hit the back roads.

392
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:32,411
- Uh, well...
- What's wrong?

393
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:38,771
We gots to stop in Tooele
first and gas up the ride.

394
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:40,412
I thought you already did that.

395
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,843
Man, when the garden center thing
happened I just forgot, all right?

396
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:47,643
I want you to go
back into town--

397
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:49,711
I want you to gas up that car.

398
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,830
Because I'm not driving around with
millions of dollars in the trunk,

399
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:53,983
do you understand?

400
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:56,141
Man, why do I gots to do it...?

401
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,261
Okay.

402
00:30:58,608 --> 00:30:59,723
Okay.

403
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:12,490
Better check in on our friend.

404
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,453
Miss Tinsel Toes.

405
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,183
Billy?

406
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:34,031
Billy?

407
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:36,540
Yeah.

408
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,781
I made you a sandwich.

409
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:42,680
Peanut butter and jelly
with the crusts cut off.

410
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:44,691
Just like you like.

411
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:51,950
I'm so glad you came back.

412
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:55,773
I don't want to say
I told you so, but

413
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:58,923
that was just not
the girl for you.

414
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,260
Where is that?

415
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:08,960
Where's what, sweetheart?

416
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,540
That painting.

417
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,910
Oh, it's Holland.

418
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:16,633
Where I grew up. You know that.

419
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,800
It's beautiful.

420
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,293
Oh, there's no place better.

421
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:29,220
It's so peaceful, so...
so protected from this crazy world.

422
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:47,802
Hello, Operator?
There's an intruder in my house...

423
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:55,910
Hello, ma'am? Ma'am?
Are you there?

424
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,922
Is anyone there?

425
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,393
Heard you had some
activity in Tooele today.

426
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:07,350
A bit. Don't see how it
warrants a visit from the FBI.

427
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:09,611
A stolen car was dumped
just outside of town,

428
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:12,963
belonging to a woman who went to school
in St. Louis, am I getting that right?

429
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:13,732
Yes, sir.

430
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:17,731
And then here, the owner's
girlfriend reports him missing,

431
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:20,471
and then his buddy comes by
to check it out and he...

432
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:21,913
goes missing, too.

433
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,882
Yeah, but Woody and Chet have
been known to drop everything

434
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,662
and go boar hunting when the
opportunity presents itself,

435
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,543
and they don't tell
their old ladies.

436
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:36,591
Mr. Mahone, I'll bet you my lunch money
there's nothing amiss around here.

437
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:42,260
But Woody's dad'll be showing
up soon with the keys and...

438
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:43,650
you can look for yourself.

439
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:45,360
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?!

440
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:53,140
Mr. Mahone.

441
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:54,680
Shh.

442
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:09,082
They're here.

443
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:11,853
Those escaped convicts.
They're here in town.

444
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:40,831
Who's there?

445
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,722
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?

446
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,692
Yes.

447
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,082
Can you tell me what happened?

448
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:51,583
There was this strange man.

449
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:56,333
I made him a peanut
butter sandwich.

450
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,771
I thought he was Billy.

451
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:06,473
And once the kids went to sleep,
we'd take a bath.

452
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:11,063
A long... bath.

453
00:35:11,207 --> 00:35:15,672
And afterwards,
I'd just sit there and watch her...

454
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,862
do her routine, see.

455
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:20,820
Rub her lotion on,
comb her hair.

456
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:24,643
Dress up in her
nighttime fineries.

457
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,032
Oh, you're killing me.

458
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:33,920
She had this spot on
her neck right... here.

459
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:38,681
Gave her goosebumps every time.

460
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,342
And that perfume...

461
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,063
My ex.

462
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,380
He was an accountant.

463
00:35:57,265 --> 00:35:59,891
He was really buttoned up.

464
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:04,413
He was ram, damn,
thank you, Sam.

465
00:36:05,616 --> 00:36:07,682
Well, shame on him.

466
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:15,732
Why did it end with that
lady you were talking about?

467
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:24,533
Just went out separate ways.

468
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,473
Do you know...

469
00:36:32,615 --> 00:36:36,100
what I think the best cure
is for a broken heart?

470
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,131
Do tell.

471
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:43,062
Get back on the bike.

472
00:36:44,305 --> 00:36:46,513
Whatever bike it is.

473
00:36:50,006 --> 00:36:52,682
Amen to that.

474
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,610
Speaking of.

475
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:00,323
Could you do something for me?

476
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:04,191
I'm certain of it.

477
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,190
Come here.

478
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:13,331
Only you have to
be very discreet.

479
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:18,203
They don't come any discreter.

480
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:24,141
You know that, that big guy the
strong guy that, that doesn't...

481
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,910
speak much?

482
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:29,350
Would you go in
there and ask him

483
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:35,950
if he would like to have a drink with
me after he punches out? Please.

484
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:40,861
You've just been playing me
this whole time, haven't you?

485
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:45,191
Come on. Don't be like that.

486
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:49,701
Would you just go in and
ask your friend? Please?

487
00:38:11,305 --> 00:38:12,241
Hey, Dad.

488
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:14,230
Sarah. I've been
trying to reach you.

489
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:17,090
Uh, yeah. I've been meeting with
my defense attorneys all day.

490
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,483
Um... You in Washington?

491
00:38:18,668 --> 00:38:20,910
Yeah, but I'm coming
back on the next flight.

492
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,320
I thought you were going
to be there for a while.

493
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:24,852
No, no. Plans changed, okay?

494
00:38:24,995 --> 00:38:28,492
Sarah, do you remember that guy that
I met with you in your apartment?

495
00:38:28,618 --> 00:38:32,520
- I want you to stay away from him.
- Who, Lance? From my, my group?

496
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:35,670
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
He is not who he says he is.

497
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,932
And I found out some
other things, too.

498
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:40,510
- What are you talking about?
- You were right.

499
00:38:41,676 --> 00:38:44,020
- Sarah?
- I gotta go.

500
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:02,290
Yo.

501
00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:04,723
Uh, just one second, sir.

502
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,400
Thank you.

503
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:08,820
How can I help you?

504
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:10,740
Just put $40 on three.

505
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:12,993
I'm sorry. Uh...
What pump was that?

506
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,151
Three.

507
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,892
Oh, that one's been sticking.

508
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:17,531
Okay, well, then,
I'll move the car.

509
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:19,111
Ah, no. Don't--
Don't trouble yourself.

510
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:21,822
I'll have the, uh,
mechanic come out and pump it for you.

511
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,962
Hey, we got a customer
waiting on three!

512
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:26,910
Yo, look, man,
I'm in a hurry, all right?

513
00:39:27,056 --> 00:39:29,353
Oh, he'll be right out.
Just one second.

514
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:37,760
Put your hands behind your
head and drop to your knees.

515
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:40,033
Drop!

516
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,701
Where are they?

517
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:54,900
Where... are... they?

518
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:58,341
All right, man.

519
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:01,312
One hand or not, I think Hillbilly
needs to be up ahead digging.

520
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:02,331
What you think?

521
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:12,100
Good man.

522
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:24,841
Oh.

523
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:35,333
What the hell are
you doing up here?

524
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:37,213
Uh, I'm sorry, Jeannette.

525
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:40,832
I just didn't see you downstairs.
I heard something.

526
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:45,501
Don't bother. She's got the
hots for the big, strong one.

527
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:47,072
I'm sorry, Jeannette.
We're gonna...

528
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,570
we're gonna get
back to work now.

529
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:50,150
No, I think y'all are done,

530
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:52,853
and I think y'all
need to leave now.

531
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:54,391
We're almost finished.

532
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,422
No, I think you
are finished, okay?

533
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:59,281
And I want you to
leave my house now.

534
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:07,591
Sucre, check it out.

535
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:20,091
Cop.

536
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:25,800
Thank God.

537
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:35,132
Oh, let her go, T-Bag.

538
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,083
She's our only way
out of this, pretty.

539
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:47,051
Don't say a word, you old whore,
or I'll cut your throat out.

540
00:42:47,105 --> 00:42:47,963
