1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,038
Mr Shelby, you're not yourself.
I should call a doctor.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,471
It's just myself talking to myself
about myself.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,274
Michael, you're going to New York.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
Why?

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,275
Because the company has business
to attend to in America.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,676
You knew I was going to be shot...

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,037
...and you chose not to tell me.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,634
I chose my mum.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,957
<i>Thomas Shelby,
Labour Party, 48,564!</i>

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,393
I've been to a doctor on your behalf.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,957
It starts when you stop. When you rest.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,310
Mr Shelby, you're meant to be resting.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,558
I have learnt something, Frances.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,471
There's no rest for me in this world.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,592
<i>Perhaps in the next.</i>

16
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,316
Arthur.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,717
"We cannot give you the assurance
you are asking for.

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
"We expect payment in full."

19
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,278
Here's my favourite part.

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,878
"We have never even heard
of <i>your</i> people,

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,279
"so we are not afraid of your threats."

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,317
And they've signed it
"the Angels of Retribution".

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,114
Hm.

24
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,312
They say
they haven't even heard of us.

25
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,956
So tell Aberama and Isiah to
introduce themselves.

26
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,434
And, Finn...

27
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
...you stay out of it.

28
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,955
Yeah.

29
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,920
Wait.

30
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,599
Wait, wait. Say that again.

31
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,720
No.

32
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,479
No, that cannot be possible!

33
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,876
Peter, my beautiful pilot...

34
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,710
Now will you please fly me
and my winnings back to England?

35
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,111
Ten spoonfuls of sugar for me, please.

36
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,914
Where's that full one?

37
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,838
Look, Ruby.

38
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,474
Daddy's back from his call.

39
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Everything's going to be all right now.

40
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,792
Oh, no, no.

41
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,434
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,200
Oh, no, no.

43
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Ah!

44
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,716
Hello?

45
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,638
Arthur! Arthur, where's Tommy?

46
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,517
Just get to him and tell him
that we've lost the lot.

47
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,552
Stay there. You stay put.

48
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,592
You'll hear from Tommy.

49
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,400
Arthur, what are you talking about?
How is that possible?

50
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,398
<i>It's possible because,
this morning</i>

51
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,876
in New York City at 6am,

52
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,471
the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed

53
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,398
<i>like a steam train.</i>

54
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,830
We were most definitely on board.

55
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,633
Fuck it.

56
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,236
- Oi! Come on, get changed!
- Jesus Christ!

57
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
Bring the car round!

58
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,314
We've got to get out of here.
Hurry up. Come on!

59
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,557
I'm going!

60
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,559
Change of plan.
We're not going to London any more.

61
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,639
- We're going straight to Birmingham.
- There are other passengers.

62
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Not any more.

63
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,712
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

64
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,797
- No. No.
- I love you, you love me.

65
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,435
- That's the truth.
- Gina, wait, come on.

66
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,119
I want to meet your family.

67
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,276
No, you don't.

68
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Argh!

69
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,232
<i>Now</i> you've heard of us.

70
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,599
Come on.

71
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,313
Couch. Couch!

72
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,877
Put something down for the blood.
My sister'll fucking kill me.

73
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,593
Be fucking careful.

74
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,871
She spends thousands of pounds
on this shit.

75
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Argh!

76
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,989
- Get me some booze.
- Ah!

77
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,036
Just fucking get the thing out of me
and sew me up.

78
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,276
Just do it.

79
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,113
Peaky boy, give me your blade.

80
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,635
That's enough.

81
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,116
Don't want you throwing up
on your sister's furniture.

82
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,038
- You know what you're doing?
- I've done this a thousand times.

83
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,120
I once took a bullet from between
two ribs, one inch from the heart.

84
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,674
Mind you, it was a horse.

85
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,553
And the horse did die.

86
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,239
Hold him. Hold him.

87
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
There you go.

88
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,389
Just a little one.

89
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,630
- What the fuck is going on?
- Oh, fuck.

90
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,479
Hello, Ada.

91
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,956
Get out, both of you.

92
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,036
Push this on the wound.

93
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,799
- Keep up the pressure.
- Get out.

94
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm so sorry, Ada.

95
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,870
They broke a statue of some thin woman.

96
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,071
Fucking statues.

97
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,919
What has Tommy told you?

98
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,600
- Shelbys stay out of the sporting stuff.
- What?

99
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,076
- To maintain his fucking reputation?
- Oi!

100
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
You listen to me.

101
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,756
We've got a chance.

102
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,315
Tommy has given us that chance.

103
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,480
He's got power, we've got money
and our past is left behind us.

104
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,037
And you've got a precious young life,
Finn, you fucking idiot.

105
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,256
Three inches to the left
and that would have been gone.

106
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,430
You've got nothing to prove, Finn.

107
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,519
You have got nothing to prove.

108
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,116
Daddy! Daddy!

109
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,696
Come here, you. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

110
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,915
Ooh!

111
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,635
Now, what have you been up to, eh?

112
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,989
Get it done, Johnny.

113
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,598
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.

114
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,753
Where's Charles?

115
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,349
He's in the wagon. He won't come out.

116
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,392
He heard Johnny talking Rokker.

117
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,876
He understands more Gypsy
than we think.

118
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,992
He heard him say you shot the horse.

119
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,192
I told him it was mercy. I said
it's what you do when a horse gets sick.

120
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,595
He doesn't understand.

121
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,879
Dad, why did you shoot him?

122
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,118
Charlie, get out here now.
Let's get it done.

123
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,511
Charles? Come here.

124
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,995
Sit down.

125
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,990
Now, listen to me.

126
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,034
Your horse was sick. He was in pain.

127
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,456
The vet couldn't do anything,
even Curly couldn't do anything.

128
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,675
I put him to sleep.

129
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,359
- It's what you do.
- No!

130
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
It's what <i>you</i> do.

131
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,631
Shoot horses, shoot people.
Everybody says.

132
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,798
Dangerous, my beautiful horse.

133
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,960
Too wild to race.

134
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,994
Wouldn't take the reins or the whip.

135
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,913
Should have been a war horse.

136
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,234
Got tired of the pasture.

137
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,475
Couldn't stick the peace and quiet,
gave up on life...

138
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,435
...and is now free.

139
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
In the bleak...

140
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,990
You're crying.

141
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Tom...

142
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,876
...I'm sorry.

143
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,913
I didn't know your boy spoke Rokker.

144
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Fill it in, Johnny.

145
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
It's fine.

146
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,796
I've called the house, the office.

147
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,673
But if I tell you...

148
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,509
...you won't believe it...

149
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,594
...so I'll show you.

150
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Huh?

151
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,992
I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.

152
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,873
Yeah.

153
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,520
Fucking Michael... said he was advised
by the broker that prices would rebound.

154
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,916
Everybody was told the same thing.

155
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,430
He held on.

156
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,440
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.

157
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,309
Michael.

158
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,638
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.

159
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,869
Michael held on...

160
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,592
...and carried on dancing and playing...

161
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,354
...and fucking in the snow.

162
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,475
Charlie!

163
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,674
Charlie, come out here now!

164
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,838
Kid never fucking listens.

165
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,031
Never listens, Lizzie.

166
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,911
What do I have to do
to make people fucking listen to me?!

167
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,157
Holy fuck.

168
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,033
What do we do now, Tommy, eh?

169
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,796
What do we do?

170
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,679
Lizzie, you go with Arthur to Birmingham,
you stay in the Midland Hotel.

171
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,511
Arthur, call a full meeting of
the board of directors tomorrow at noon.

172
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,359
A full fucking meeting.

173
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,154
What about today, eh?
What's wrong with today, Tom?

174
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,351
- I need to do some thinking.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,039
Oh, you do that best on your own,

176
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,959
- don't you, eh?
- I won't be on my own. Never on my own.

177
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,835
Lizzie, you have the driver
come back tomorrow.

178
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,032
And, Arthur, tell my boy...

179
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,517
...that sometimes death is a kindness.

180
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,835
Come on.

181
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
<i>What now?</i>

182
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,239
What am I, a genie?

183
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,636
You summon me up
with your little bottle of dope.

184
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,798
I take it for the pain, to keep warm.

185
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,154
Is that what it's for?

186
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
The warmth?

187
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,956
The warmth.

188
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,035
All this time.

189
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I know.

190
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,678
Our love still remains.

191
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,990
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

192
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,674
Do what they tell you to do.

193
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,034
Too much to do, Grace.

194
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,954
The kids.

195
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,712
I need to say goodbye.

196
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,359
I need to sleep.

197
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,430
Just think, Tom.

198
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,990
Linda!

199
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,839
Oh, there you are, eh?

200
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,913
You're the chairman, Arthur,
so start acting like one.

201
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,394
Chairman, am I, hm?

202
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,916
No.

203
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm the fucking doorman, Linda, hm?

204
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,159
And you ain't coming in here tonight,
love, dressed like that.

205
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,871
Tommy made me chairman so that...

206
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,354
...he could stay clean.

207
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,474
It's called an arrangement.

208
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,789
It's an opportunity.

209
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,080
I know who I am, Linda.

210
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,356
I know who I am and I'm all right with it.

211
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,790
Finally.

212
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,909
I can live with it.

213
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,673
I need you to be all right with it.

214
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,714
I need you to be all right with it, eh?

215
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,036
What is it, eh?

216
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,669
And what do you want, hm?

217
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,869
What, do you want the chairman?
Do you? Hmm?

218
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,910
With his fancy briefcase
and his gold fountain pen, eh?

219
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,635
What do you want?

220
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Chairman...

221
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,551
...or doorman? Hm?

222
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,959
You think we can fuck and it'll be OK
and I'll be quiet. Well, I won't.

223
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,077
Every week, your brother's down in London,
making out he's fucking Robin Hood,

224
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,557
champion of the people, while you're
up here running the racket for him.

225
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,096
And according to your "arrangement",
if anything should happen,

226
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,840
it'd be you who takes the blame,
does the time or swings for it.

227
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,231
- And what do you want?
- I want you...

228
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,355
...to take the opportunity

229
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,030
that God and the New York Stock Exchange
has presented to you.

230
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,416
Mr Shelby,
the meeting will be starting soon.

231
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,671
Yeah. All right.

232
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,114
Be right there.

233
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,110
Thank you, Edna.

234
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,714
And shut the door.

235
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,512
OK, now...

236
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Mmm, they're nice.

237
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
...let's begin.

238
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,674
Yesterday, as you all know,
there was a fucking terrible...

239
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,277
There was a terrible disaster. Hm?

240
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,629
It wasn't just for us.

241
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,320
It was for the whole world.

242
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,836
Happened in New York.

243
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,070
That's where it happened.

244
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,953
And it slowly spread to London.

245
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,671
And then to, er, fucking Hong Kong. Hm?

246
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,717
Whole thing... whole thing went up.

247
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,316
Well, actually the whole thing
went fucking down but...

248
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,557
...we wasn't the only ones hurt by this.

249
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,196
Whole world is hurt.

250
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,590
A lot of people.

251
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,394
In the papers.

252
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,113
It's all over the news.

253
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,152
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Arthur?

254
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,033
Shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?

255
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,392
Polly, Arthur's now
the chairman of the board.

256
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,352
Er, Mr Chairman,
perhaps while we wait for Thomas,

257
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,555
I might lighten the gloom and express, as
a relatively new member of this company,

258
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,798
what a pleasure it is to be in a boardroom
that has so many females in it,

259
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,075
and all females who are both
sharp-witted and decorative.

260
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,557
Yeah, well, we're a very modern
company, Mr Greene.

261
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Indeed.

262
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,119
Although there are still some among us
who cling to their old-fashioned values.

263
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,430
How far have we got?

264
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,111
We've established
that ladies are decorative.

265
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,833
We've only just sat down, Tom.

266
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,840
Actually, um, Arthur has some documents
that he'd like to hand out.

267
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,155
Yeah?

268
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,555
What documents?

269
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,552
I was just explaining to everyone, Tom,
that, um, well, we're fucked.

270
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,798
- Ain't that right? Hm?
- Yes and no.

271
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,830
It is true that a large proportion
of the company's funds

272
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,078
were invested in American stocks
and shares.

273
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,429
Invested or hidden?

274
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,516
All investments are approved
by the board, Linda.

275
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,599
Only the ones that went
through the books, Thomas.

276
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,159
Linda, after this meeting there will
be another meeting, for just family.

277
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,356
Did we vote on this?

278
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Arthur?

279
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,160
"Arthur, can't you control your wife?"

280
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,516
We are a very modern company, Mr Greene.

281
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,790
To be precise,
everything we channelled

282
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,038
through the New York Stock Exchange
is now offering a return

283
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,356
of ten cents to the dollar.

284
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,789
And the Nolan Bank of America,

285
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,389
where we invested our fluidity,

286
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,309
is offering five cents to the dollar
on all deposits.

287
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,955
Yeah.

288
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,037
- There is hope.
- Why?

289
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,595
What have you got in there,
a magic wand?

290
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,995
As nonexecutive director of the company,
I need the permission from the chairman

291
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,954
to present my strategy to the board.

292
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,390
Permission granted, Tom.

293
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,872
The Peaky Blinders are coming.

294
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,314
The Peaky Blinders are coming.

295
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,750
Micky,
the Peaky Blinders are coming.

296
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,118
Ladies and gents, Peaky Blinders are
on their way. Please vacate. Thank you.

297
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,231
- Good to see you.
- All right, Mr Shelby.

298
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,794
- Mr Shelby...
- Yeah?

299
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,195
...thank you for what you did.

300
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,549
What did I do?

301
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,070
He was going to evict us,
that bastard Fellows.

302
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,556
Now he's cut our rent in half.

303
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,911
Good. Glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

304
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
All right?

305
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,315
How far can we go, Mr Shelby,
with this beautiful dream?

306
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,478
- All the way, brother. All the way.
- Revolution, man.

307
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,514
This crash, Mr Shelby. They're saying
they're gonna cut my hours.

308
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,950
- Yeah. Where do you work?
- Greenhams Engineering.

309
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,914
Greenham brothers. I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.

310
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,793
God bless you. God bless you both.

311
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,355
- Enjoy your drink.
- Gentlemen and ladies.

312
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,551
If you'll all move into the saloon bar,

313
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,990
where you will all be served
a free pint of stingo.

314
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,150
Any man who served in France
gets a brandy chaser.

315
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,636
And in spite of what you're reading
in the newspapers,

316
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,832
I want to hear singing and laughing.
Fuck the stock market.

317
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,110
Fuck the stock market!

318
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,551
They backed the wrong horses,
so fucking what, eh?

319
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,031
Thank you, Mr Shelby. At last,
a politician who gets things done.

320
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,833
You're welcome, brother, you're welcome.

321
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,616
- Get down off the furniture.
- Sorry, Ada.

322
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,960
I was getting excited, wasn't I?

323
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Right.

324
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,552
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

325
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,672
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

326
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,598
Your husband believes that being seen

327
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,996
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

328
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,476
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism,

329
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,752
perhaps next time, Polly, you won't
wear earrings worth more than the pub.

330
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,714
Right. Family meeting. First item.

331
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,433
This.

332
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,631
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

333
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,150
by Aberama Gold using your gin
and a razor blade.

334
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,839
Finn?

335
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,176
He says they were sent to Limehouse.

336
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,429
Chinatown.

337
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,153
Sent by fucking who?

338
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,396
Sent by me.

339
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,116
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

340
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,279
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

341
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,314
I listen to you when you tell me
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

342
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,512
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

343
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,319
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

344
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,477
£50,000.

345
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,920
In cash.

346
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,078
He said they were sent to Chinatown
to kill somebody.

347
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,470
That kid needs educating, Tommy,
really does.

348
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,034
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

349
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,834
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity

350
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,794
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

351
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,957
But you told Polly.

352
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,359
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

353
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,836
Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hm?

354
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,477
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member
of the House of Lords, a very wealthy man.

355
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,354
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

356
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,800
covered in flies.

357
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,639
World's a better place.

358
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,312
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

359
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,872
Sometimes, Ada...

360
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,077
...killing is a kindness.

361
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,520
Hm?

362
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,033
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

363
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,279
We received intelligence from
a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.

364
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,871
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.

365
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,277
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

366
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,154
He wasn't worth a trial.
The coppers cleared the streets for us.

367
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,796
This was work commissioned
by a High Court judge, by Scotland Yard

368
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,240
and by the House of Lords.

369
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,829
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

370
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,475
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.

371
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,353
Lizzie, you need to understand.

372
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,073
That you tell Polly, not me.

373
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,116
You need to understand that the corridors
of Westminster are very dimly lit.

374
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,551
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

375
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,070
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

376
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,271
<i>We? We</i> own the ropes, do we?

377
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,030
Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've listened
to me, you wouldn't have known.

378
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,197
When we go home, I'll explain.

379
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,551
I can't be bothered
with this shit.

380
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,914
So...

381
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,114
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.

382
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,157
The strategy I outlined earlier

383
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,796
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

384
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,515
- In the meantime...
- Just business as fucking usual.

385
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,235
In the meantime,
it is fortunate that we have maintained

386
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,716
other sources of cash income.

387
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,311
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

388
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,669
And cash we have.

389
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,519
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

390
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,120
You're gonna hang yourself.

391
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,511
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

392
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,994
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

393
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,352
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

394
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,358
Polly...

395
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,271
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

396
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,475
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

397
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,671
She's pregnant.

398
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,512
Ada's what?

399
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,077
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

400
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,395
Wait a minute.

401
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,715
Wait a minute.

402
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,673
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hm?

403
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,750
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

404
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,679
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives a fuck
who the father is.

405
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,995
Really?

406
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,391
I already know who the father is.

407
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,434
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

408
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,149
OK.

409
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,800
All right, go on, then.

410
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,640
How long you known about Ada, huh?

411
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,955
I know her doctor.

412
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,230
He calls me.

413
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,877
Yeah, longer than me.

414
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,070
Have a look at this.

415
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,674
What's that funny writing on there?

416
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,234
Chinese.

417
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,874
Ah, right.

418
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,675
What is it? Hmm?

419
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Bad news?

420
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,396
Maybe.

421
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,229
Angels of Retribution?

422
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,476
Yeah.

423
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,956
Burn the letter they sent.

424
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,480
It's already done.

425
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,514
Look at that, Tom. Hm?

426
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,160
Pulled from our brother, eh?

427
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,593
Finally took a first bullet.

428
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,599
No-one fucking listens to me.

429
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,675
Here, give it here.

430
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,154
I'll keep it for him.

431
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,875
I still have my first one.

432
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,554
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

433
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,073
Where are you going, brother?

434
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,359
The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

435
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,315
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

436
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,560
I therefore must ask the trade unions
to possess understanding.

437
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,435
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

438
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,600
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

439
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,998
Mr Thomas Shelby.

440
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,880
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

441
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,520
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

442
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,712
asks that following the crash,

443
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,073
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

444
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,231
What he's really asking
is that the working man carry the can.

445
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,315
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

446
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,469
when compared to the wild games of chance
being played in London and New York

447
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,755
by gamblers in silk gloves and beaver
hats, who, when they lose their bets,

448
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,111
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

449
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,355
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

450
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,917
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

451
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,159
that those who so recklessly lost
their fortunes on the capitalist lottery

452
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,637
learn to shine their own shoes...

453
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,832
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

454
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Mr Shelby?

455
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,113
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

456
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
You speak very eloquently.

457
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,559
Thank you.

458
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,152
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

459
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Yeah, I know who you are.

460
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,636
My constituency borders yours.

461
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,117
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

462
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,072
Come.

463
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Ah.

464
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,632
I have bad news, Mr...

465
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Shelby.

466
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,430
We agreed 50,000
on completion of business.

467
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,554
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

468
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,751
There's 20 there.

469
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,712
You'll have to wait for the rest.

470
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,595
Cavalry, eh?

471
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,518
Mm.

472
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,676
Huh!

473
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,990
Yeah.

474
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,550
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

475
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,751
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

476
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,440
When the cavalry finally came,

477
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,190
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

478
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,076
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

479
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,074
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

480
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,954
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

481
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,600
All for a game of chance.

482
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,717
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

483
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,516
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

484
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,711
that will cause you concern.

485
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,991
I now have them in a safe place.

486
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,878
On Monday, you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash...

487
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,680
...or I will steal your white horse
from under you.

488
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,599
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

489
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,280
in a place of power and privilege?

490
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,834
A man like me?

491
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
A man like me?

492
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,873
Lord Suckerby.

493
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,400
I've seen the photographs.

494
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Monday.

495
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,479
Shelby!

496
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,439
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

497
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,234
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

498
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,637
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

499
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,991
- Right.
- Everything all right?

500
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,634
Yeah, fine.

501
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,070
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

502
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,196
Your brother been busy?

503
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,631
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

504
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,752
the former Communist MP
for Battersea.

505
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,475
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall -

506
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,716
he's setting up a meeting -

507
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,800
and there's talk of a mass walk-out
of bus drivers, Nottingham and Derby,

508
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,551
organised by two Communist convenors
not formerly known to Special Branch.

509
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,593
He's also had a telephone conversation
with Jessie Eden,

510
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,236
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

511
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,750
But he'll report more when he sees her.

512
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,996
It's all in there, though.

513
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,554
Names and everything.

514
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,416
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

515
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,990
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

516
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,352
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

517
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,472
Times are hard.

518
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,997
Hm.

519
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,116
Exactly how much did you lose?

520
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,755
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.

521
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,920
He thinks that we can turn the collapse
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

522
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,477
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

523
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,911
He says, "We can wave cash in the faces
of desperate men."

524
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,435
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

525
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,839
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

526
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,953
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

527
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,640
Fuck.

528
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,474
Come.

529
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,115
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

530
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,879
It's from Winston Churchill.

531
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,558
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin

532
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,876
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

533
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,834
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

534
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,350
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

535
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,350
Mr Churchill's private secretary
reckoned he lost £75,000 in two hours.

536
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
And you?

537
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,199
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

538
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,596
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

539
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
You lock up.

540
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,720
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

541
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,230
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

542
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,840
A journalist from the <i>Times.</i>

543
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,713
He used to be with
the <i>Birmingham Mail.</i>

544
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,593
He sent you some questions.

545
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,552
You said you wanted to meet him.

546
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
He's outside.

547
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
Yes.

548
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,950
Send him in.

549
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,439
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>

550
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,279
Have a seat.

551
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,392
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

552
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,477
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

553
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,239
No.

554
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,151
Once, in Small Heath,
you were burning photographs of the King.

555
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,390
<i>- London Times</i>. You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

556
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,637
I sent you a list of questions.

557
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,831
Yeah, I misplaced them.

558
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,952
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.

559
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,275
Yes.

560
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,199
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

561
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,073
Oh!

562
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,475
Good.

563
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,439
Sorry, just...

564
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,153
Ah, here we are.

565
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,719
Yes, um...

566
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,839
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

567
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,751
print journalists take no interest in the,
er, the private lives of politicians.

568
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,837
Private lives?

569
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,034
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

570
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,916
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

571
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,918
Readers are beginning to say...

572
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,192
...want to know more about the men
who represent them.

573
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,595
Of course.

574
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,632
In these modern times.

575
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,997
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

576
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,909
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

577
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,919
- or business affairs.
- Oh, well. No need to worry.

578
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,554
I'm no gentleman.

579
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,510
Hm.

580
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,873
Er, Mr Shelby,
as I said in my letter,

581
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,720
ten years ago I was a journalist
on the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>

582
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,071
And of course, working in that city,

583
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,999
it was impossible
not to know your name...

584
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,075
...and your reputation.

585
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,834
So, when I saw that you had
been elected as a socialist...

586
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,280
You reflected on the fact

587
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:39,078
that working people can indeed change
their lives for the better...

588
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,713
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

589
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,199
aim for happier outcomes,
even win awards for industry.

590
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,073
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

591
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,591
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

592
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,030
Was your conversion from bookmaker
to socialist politician

593
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,039
a gradual thing or...

594
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,950
...a road to Damascus experience?

595
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,713
Yeah.

596
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,718
Now I hear that question...

597
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,233
...I remember receiving your letters

598
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,512
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

599
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,032
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.

600
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,439
I gained a licence
in 1919 for on-track betting.

601
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,789
But, since 1923,

602
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,357
I've made my fortune in the manufacture,
sale and export of motor cars.

603
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,914
And lately gin.

604
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,511
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

605
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,240
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

606
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,160
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

607
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,752
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

608
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,111
there was a Major Campbell.

609
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,635
He was found dead.

610
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,712
A member of your family was charged.

611
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,874
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

612
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,870
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

613
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,515
Is it evolution or revolution?

614
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,156
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

615
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,637
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

616
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,755
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

617
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,111
I am talking about specific events, sir.

618
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Which I don't recall...

619
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,354
...with which I was never
personally linked,

620
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,951
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

621
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,435
Yeah, now...
I recall receiving your letter...

622
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,877
...and I recall that when I did...

623
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,713
...I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

624
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,630
Just a moment.

625
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,714
Here we are.

626
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,835
Ah, Michael Levitt.

627
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,960
Correct?

628
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,357
- Yes.
- Yes.

629
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,914
Journalist.

630
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,032
Unmarried.

631
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,992
An apartment in Maida Vale.

632
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,516
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

633
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,359
"Unmarried" is underlined.

634
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,552
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

635
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,194
Sometimes alone.

636
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,357
Sometimes not alone.

637
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,151
Sometimes with other men.

638
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,193
Sometimes with other men.

639
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,670
I'm old-fashioned... Michael.

640
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,315
I believe private lives
should remain private.

641
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,995
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?

642
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,635
You gonna write this down...

643
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,197
...in your little fucking book?

644
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,799
Well?

645
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,718
Not yet.

646
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,513
I didn't tell him.

647
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,917
Him knowing or not knowing
has no relevance to what we're drinking.

648
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,476
It's vintage.

649
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,118
Fuck it.

650
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,560
This...

651
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,509
...is for us.

652
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,393
Let's drink to the baby.

653
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,197
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

654
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,677
You were going to take me to Cardiff.

655
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,757
I was going to get rid of it.

656
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,035
What about this time?

657
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,835
Imagine.

658
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,113
The father's scared.

659
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,913
He runs away.

660
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,190
You're left.

661
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,471
Oh, sweetheart.

662
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,800
The baby's black,
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

663
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,760
But you don't care.

664
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,270
Because the world has changed.

665
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,030
And the baby's eyes are golden.

666
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,837
And you're gonna leave her with
Aunt Polly every day to look after.

667
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,192
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

668
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,391
How do you know it's a her?

669
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,558
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

670
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,433
It's a girl?

671
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
Golden.

672
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,037
To be born in the year 1930,

673
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,880
where everything will be changed
for the better.

674
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,519
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.

675
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,194
What will Tommy say?

676
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,079
Tommy knows.

677
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,760
Hmm!

678
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,591
He's also seen that the world's
big and round and he says, "So what?"

679
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,717
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

680
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,550
We are flying above the rules now.

681
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,955
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

682
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,875
That's the beauty.

683
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
Hello, Cyril.

684
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,032
Least you're still talking to me.

685
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,070
Where is everyone?

686
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,032
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

687
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,835
You know, Frances, if there were to be
a snap election in this house today...

688
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,715
...wouldn't win it...

689
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,594
...not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

690
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,720
No.

691
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,955
- I gathered.
- Mm.

692
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,273
Where's Charles?

693
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,629
Charles is in the stable.

694
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,080
Thank you.

695
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,434
Did Arthur explain?

696
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,392
He said it's God's will.

697
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,879
But you're not God!

698
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,751
No, I'm not God.

699
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,836
Not yet.
