1
00:00:00,203 --> 00:00:02,627
Kaniel Outis. He's
been working with ISIL.

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,828
You know that's not Michael.

3
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:05,029
We're gonna need you.

4
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:06,864
I can rest when I'm dead.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,366
That's what I'm worried about.

6
00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:10,968
I'm not leaving Michael.

7
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,471
We can't risk all of
it for just one man.

8
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:15,306
ISIL has broken through the checkpoint.

9
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:16,774
Sana'a is falling.

10
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,477
We work together or we both die.

11
00:00:19,513 --> 00:00:21,440
You have my word.

12
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,783
It's Abu Ramal that Poseidon wants free.

13
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,487
Poseidon sent you?

14
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,226
Enough!

15
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,664
Who the hell is this guy?

16
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,366
- He's my brother.
- Back at the prison...

17
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:46,404
I had to deny who you
were. They were filming me,

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,772
and they can't know.

19
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,371
Abu Ramal has been martyred.

20
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:50,606
The entire army of ISIL

21
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,144
just declared war on us.

22
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,886
Behold the villain.

23
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:16,901
Hi.

24
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:20,304
Hey. I, uh, I ran into
town to get some coffee.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,373
- Do you want anything?
- No. I'm good.

26
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,849
Thanks, honey. I'm almost done here.

27
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:26,043
I will see you at the lake
in a little while, okay?

28
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,479
Okay. I'll see you back at the house.

29
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,081
The hubby?

30
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:32,374
Uh, what did you learn from Kellerman?

31
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:35,486
There's no easy way to
deliver this news, darling.

32
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:37,589
It's a heartbreaker.

33
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,494
Doesn't get any better.

34
00:01:45,497 --> 00:01:46,965
He's rotten all the way to the core.

35
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,526
You've been sleeping
with the enemy, baby.

36
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:49,700
I don't understand.

37
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:52,103
I followed them two monkeys
from Kellerman's house

38
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,637
right after they put a bullet in him.

39
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:55,807
Needless to say he wasn't our guy.

40
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,510
He did say some pretty alarming things

41
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,911
about your boy, Poseidon,
the world shaker.

42
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:03,081
Didn't give me enough
to put all the pieces together.

43
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,282
Back up, back up, back
up. What did they say?

44
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:06,628
Jacob? His words?

45
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,087
I couldn't get close enough
to hear much, but what I did...

46
00:02:09,105 --> 00:02:11,444
what I did hear was
your name and Michael's.

47
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:12,693
Yes, they seemed pretty cozy,

48
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,068
- the three of them.
- Oh, my God.

49
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,805
It's a nasty bag of conspir...
Where are you going?!

50
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:17,206
To my son!

51
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,134
Stay down. Stay down.

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,470
It's another artillery strike.

53
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:32,043
But they sure as hell are used to it.

54
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:43,121
Go, go!

55
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:11,837
_

56
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,893
_

57
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:26,897
Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.

58
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,032
Allahu Akbar.

59
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:33,156
_

60
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,442
_

61
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,640
_

62
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:58,166
_

63
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,865
ISIL just offered
ten million for our heads!

64
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,534
Wait. Wait. Stay here.

65
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,837
We got to get off these
streets or we're dead.

66
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:08,472
Ten million rial?

67
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,807
You give up your mother

68
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:10,942
for cash like that.

69
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,629
It's about what I paid

70
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,278
for Freddie Mercury's ashes.

71
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,480
Freddie Mercury now, really?

72
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,616
It's better than talking
about 500,000 people

73
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,284
looking to kill us.

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,552
Come on.

75
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,588
Found a place to figure out next steps.

76
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,030
Let's go.

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,303
This is the part you
tell me what's going on,

78
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:40,671
the whole thing.

79
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:42,239
No. Th-There's no time.

80
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:43,283
Country's about to fall.

81
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:44,642
You'll get your answers, I promise.

82
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,277
Right now our window is closing.

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,077
We need to...

84
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,213
We need to pivot to
the next contingency.

85
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,049
- Train station.
- Get up to the north.

86
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,116
Exit the country that way.

87
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:53,598
Things have changed in the four years

88
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,519
you've been locked
up in Ogygia, Michael.

89
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:56,796
Your plan's redundant.

90
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,510
ISIL control the north, roads,
checkpoints, train stations.

91
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:02,626
Even if we make it across
the city, it's suicide.

92
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,495
No. You're wrong. It's a shell game.

93
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,297
You go where they never expect you.

94
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,732
Wait. You came all the way
to Yemen looking for him.

95
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,034
You think he was lost or something?

96
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:10,301
Come on.

97
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,503
You want to live?

98
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,033
The airport's the only option.

99
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:16,908
The airport's known as the main
artery to the outside world.

100
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,609
It's the first thing
ISIL will shut down.

101
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,952
Planes were flying an
hour ago. You got a phone?

102
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,548
No, but he does.

103
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,480
Burned it up jacking
off to Queen, though.

104
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,419
Guilty as charged.

105
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,121
C-Note's organizing a passage
on the flight as we speak.

106
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,608
No, I'm telling you,

107
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,044
my plan will work.

108
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,392
Once... once you leave

109
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:36,960
the northern part of Sana'a...

110
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:39,596
Enough. We shouldn't even
be talking about this.

111
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:40,965
Get off me!

112
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:42,834
How are you alive?!

113
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:44,702
In Yemen?!

114
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:47,038
What happened to you, Michael?!

115
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:53,210
Now, I'm not moving another
inch until you tell me

116
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,680
what the hell is really going on here.

117
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:25,681
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
... <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> ...

118
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:35,401
Michael Scofield had to die.

119
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,972
I had to fake my death.

120
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:41,407
Go away.

121
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,743
It was part of the deal I made.

122
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:48,347
If I went to work for
a deep-cover operative

123
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,549
named Poseidon...

124
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:54,688
we would all go free.

125
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,697
We were free.

126
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,433
We were exonerated.

127
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,705
No. That's what we thought...

128
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,642
but we were wrong.

129
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:18,978
A few weeks before I married Sara...

130
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,651
I was approached by Poseidon.

131
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:23,416
You think I'm showing?

132
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,366
I'm not used to that yet.

133
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:27,713
I got to... I got to tell Michael.

134
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,099
Here you go. Burgers will

135
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,546
- be just a second.
- Hello?

136
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,128
Yes, this is Michael.

137
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:45,007
Poseidon told me Kellerman didn't have

138
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,487
the authority or jurisdiction
to exonerate our crimes.

139
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,408
He used that as a legal fulcrum.

140
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:54,246
Told me he could put
us all away for life

141
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:57,217
within the mandate of the law unless...

142
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:01,655
unless I went to work for him.

143
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,924
What the hell can they be talking about

144
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,292
at a time like this?

145
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:10,262
I don't know...

146
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:13,833
but big brother's hearing
things I want to hear.

147
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,034
We cannot stay.

148
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,036
We must go now.

149
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:19,439
Maybe we don't.

150
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,342
What the hell are you talking about?

151
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:24,410
Maybe all this running

152
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:26,780
is just delaying the inevitable.

153
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:32,852
Die alone here. Die alone at home.

154
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:37,991
God, you need a girlfriend, man.

155
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:44,762
Those voices are heading our
way. They're almost on us.

156
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,999
Who the hell is this Poseidon guy?

157
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,069
A psychopath.

158
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:53,039
A frustrated policy wonk in the CIA

159
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,955
who felt he could do
better than his superiors.

160
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,613
So, he created a cell within
the CIA called 21-Void,

161
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,216
implementing his own
intelligence operations.

162
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,260
And he needed my help

163
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:10,023
breaking out people
imprisoned all over the world.

164
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,724
Terrorists,

165
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,570
political dissidents...

166
00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:16,830
rogue agents...

167
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,402
and if I did it, you
and Sara, you'd go free.

168
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,136
Your record's expunged,

169
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:28,875
but... there was a rub.

170
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:33,713
I wasn't allowed to have
contact with any of you,

171
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:36,182
including my son.

172
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:38,050
Michael.

173
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:42,856
So, Michael Scofield was dead and...

174
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,159
over the years I assumed many names.

175
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:51,282
Kaniel Outis... the most recent.

176
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:53,767
Why didn't you tell me?

177
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,401
Why didn't you reach out to me?

178
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,303
I didn't have a choice.

179
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,107
Poseidon made that... very clear.

180
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,877
How?

181
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:07,279
At first, I said no.

182
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,181
I wouldn't do it.

183
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:14,120
Then within weeks, Sara
was incarcerated, beaten.

184
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,090
And so I gave in.

185
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,659
Everything I did, I did for family,

186
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,661
for you, for Sara,

187
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:26,900
for Mike... so none of you would
ever have to spend another day

188
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:31,871
inside a prison cell or...
or live a life on the run.

189
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:35,074
Look at us now.

190
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,145
They're starting to
search the buildings.

191
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:41,280
- Train station.
- Airport.

192
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:43,383
Train station.

193
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,628
All passengers must present a ticket.

194
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:59,965
All passengers must present a ticket.

195
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,468
Never gonna get to our seats.
We need to go through there.

196
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,303
Even the pilot can't get on the plane.

197
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:05,853
This is an airport full of planes.

198
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,584
- There's got to be others.
- It's no good.

199
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:09,608
People will die here today.

200
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:10,776
We need another option.

201
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,344
- My man, Omar.
- Omar?

202
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,712
That slippery brother?

203
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,548
Trust is a luxury right now.

204
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,284
He can be trusted. To a
point. He has connections on

205
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,152
- the western coast, across the desert.
- No.

206
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,655
Lincoln and Michael are
coming here. That's the plan.

207
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,690
They don't have a next move if we leave.

208
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:26,593
Now they're out there
somewhere, God knows where.

209
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,661
Your friends are too
late. Look around you.

210
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:30,434
This airport is no good to them.

211
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,098
We're not leaving.

212
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,772
What is that place?

213
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,975
Where the westerners went

214
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:44,310
when they made their escape.

215
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:46,312
I ran into one at the Forger's Den.

216
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,680
I can help.

217
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,182
And how do you expect
to find the foreigners

218
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:51,551
with only one eye?

219
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,430
They're here. ISIL are here!

220
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,771
Come on, come on. I have an idea.

221
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,808
The pilot.

222
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,877
Okay, follow me. Follow me!

223
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:19,984
Don't lose him. Don't lose the pilot.

224
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:30,490
Come on. Come on, come on.

225
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:33,660
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

226
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,828
No, just stay down.

227
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,039
Okay. Wait here.

228
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:46,985
- What?
- I'll be back.

229
00:12:46,988 --> 00:12:48,674
- Benjamin...
- I'm going alone.

230
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,909
Don't do it.

231
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,801
Halt!

232
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,395
What are you doing here?

233
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:12,330
- On your knees!
- Halt!

234
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,600
Come out. Come out.

235
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:16,068
Who are you? Papers.

236
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,103
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- Papers.

237
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,271
Infidels!

238
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,907
The infidels are in the airport.

239
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:24,176
The killers of Ramal! I've
seen them with my own eyes.

240
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,679
- What?
- I want my reward.

241
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:29,081
The ten million rial. I will be rich.

242
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,413
- Take us to them.
- Not until you promise

243
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,187
I will get my ten million rial.

244
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,623
If you speak the truth,
you'll have the money.

245
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:00,646
You kick a lot of ass for a good Muslim.

246
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,474
You can take the man out of the streets,

247
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,252
but you can't take
the streets of the man.

248
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,354
Why do you help me? Who are you?

249
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,356
I'm a man, just like you,

250
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,324
trying to get out of this madness,

251
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,728
but we're not gonna get
out through those gates.

252
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:17,224
The only way out now

253
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:18,998
is up, brother.

254
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,632
The 747 is done.

255
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:21,934
It's been secured by the rebels.

256
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,236
I'm not talking about Yemenia Air.

257
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:25,471
I have my eyes

258
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:27,040
on a different set of wings.

259
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:42,588
- Mom?
- Hey.

260
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,457
Sara!

261
00:14:43,491 --> 00:14:44,690
You scared us.

262
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:45,944
- Sorry.
- Is everything all right?

263
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:48,313
Yeah, no, It's fine. I
just... it's been a crazy day,

264
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:50,296
made more so by the fact that
I forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.

265
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:51,964
- Spanish?
- Yeah.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,900
- That's not today.
- We're gonna talk about it in the car, okay?

267
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:55,715
Are you sure? Is everything okay?

268
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,369
Really. Yes. We're fine. Thank you.

269
00:14:57,405 --> 00:14:59,086
Well, let me get Mike's bag.

270
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,980
No, no, don't worry about it.
I'll get it tomorrow.

271
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,909
I want you to get in the car
and no matter what...

272
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:12,757
- You don't get out, okay?
- Hey, hey, hey! Where you going so fast?

273
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,812
Get in.

274
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,749
Thank you.

275
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,519
How was that department
meeting yesterday?

276
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,456
You usually meet with killers?

277
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,861
Sara. Sara. Please, please, please.

278
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:30,855
I can explain, okay? Just listen to me.

279
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,066
I was sick with worry.

280
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,802
I needed to protect you,
to-to protect our family,

281
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,671
so I picked up your phone from the shop

282
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,139
and I took it to Andrew Nelson,

283
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,174
my buddy in the computer
sciences department.

284
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,643
He did a deep dive,

285
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,279
some kind of data
archaeology, and he did it.

286
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,151
He tracked those bastards down.

287
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,802
Got their cell information.

288
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,704
So... so I called them,

289
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,533
thinking I could-I could maybe

290
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,589
- make a-make a deal with them.
- You called them.

291
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,566
Sara?

292
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,145
Sara, please, listen to me.

293
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,147
Sara, this was for you.

294
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,550
You're gonna want to get
out of the way right now.

295
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,552
Sara. Sara!

296
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,728
This is it.

297
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,698
Our ticket out of the country.

298
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,634
I'm telling you, Michael,
this is a bad idea.

299
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,237
ISIL are everywhere.

300
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:28,320
No, I can do this.

301
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,476
You really paid the
equivalent of ten million rial

302
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:31,944
for some dude's ashes?

303
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,912
Not just any ashes, man.

304
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:37,617
Freddie Mercury's ashes.

305
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:41,186
I would've paid twice that.

306
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:42,621
Come on.

307
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:45,458
Keep your head down.

308
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,499
I think it's time we get
sane and head to the airport.

309
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:55,801
No, no, no.

310
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:58,403
This is better. They
control the station.

311
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:02,474
They'll never think to
look for us here now.

312
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,443
They're repurposing
those trains for cargo,

313
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:05,677
not passengers.

314
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:07,079
Once we're on, it's...

315
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:08,914
it's a straight shot to the north.

316
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,650
They won't check the cars again.

317
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:13,625
That's what you see
when you see the train?

318
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:15,754
I see a bunch of dudes with AK-47s

319
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,889
who don't look a thing
like us. You really believe

320
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:20,392
we can survive 300 miles on a train

321
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:21,860
through ISIL territory?

322
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:23,395
Now that's suicide.

323
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:25,998
- It does seem risky.
- No kidding.

324
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:31,777
No, no.

325
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,306
We get in that line of cargo
carriers. Keep our heads down.

326
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,456
Once we're on the train,
lay low the rest of the trip.

327
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:41,113
Besides, we don't
need to look like them.

328
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:44,082
Tell the believing
men to lower their gaze

329
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:45,651
and be modest.

330
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,520
Come on.

331
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:48,754
From the Koran.

332
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:59,532
All the roads are blocked.

333
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:07,206
So you'll have to find a
different way to the border.

334
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:14,280
By train!

335
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:19,185
Heather, what now?

336
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,719
What now?

337
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:22,287
I mean, it was all a lie.

338
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:23,555
Wasn't it? Everything.

339
00:18:23,591 --> 00:18:25,123
Our whole life, our whole marriage.

340
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:27,826
He was standing as close
as you were to me right now,

341
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:30,295
and he was chatting with
the woman who shot him.

342
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,864
You're saying he planned
to get himself shot

343
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,367
like it was some sort
of, uh, sick performance?

344
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:37,402
I don't know. I don't know.

345
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,004
I mean, I...

346
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,074
- Yes. Yes, it was.
- But he almost died.

347
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,176
So, the plan was to wing him, right?

348
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:47,030
To just put him above suspicion,
but the shot went wide.

349
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,480
He gets hit.

350
00:18:48,516 --> 00:18:52,304
- He knows that he's married to a doctor.
- Sara, Sara, stop. Stop.

351
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:54,152
You haven't slept in three days, right?

352
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:57,189
You're upset about the home invasion

353
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:59,591
and you're tying yourself up in knots

354
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:02,427
because the love of your life,

355
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:06,132
the father of your baby, might be alive.

356
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:12,037
And I can't get through to Lincoln.

357
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:14,106
But I saw that video.

358
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:15,373
It's him.

359
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,081
- Okay, and I...
- That's Michael.

360
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:20,312
And I believe you. I do.

361
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:21,646
And that matters.

362
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,248
That's all that matters.

363
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:24,616
No, I know.

364
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,318
But Jacob is a good man.

365
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:28,253
He's your husband.

366
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,156
- Yeah.
- And he helped you start a new life.

367
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,691
Together.

368
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:35,966
And that's him.

369
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,332
- I have to answer it.
- No. No.

370
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:43,568
- No, you don't.
- Leave a message and we'll get back.

371
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:47,037
Heather, Heather? Is Sara there?

372
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,707
Please, I-I need to speak with her.

373
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,376
Look, there's been a
huge misunderstanding

374
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:51,610
and I can explain everything.

375
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,128
Will you just... Will you tell her that?

376
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,079
And to call me?

377
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:55,347
He's tracking me.

378
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,449
Oh, Sara, honey. I'm your best friend.

379
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,699
Of-of course he's
gonna call here first.

380
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:01,169
It doesn't make him Deep Throat.

381
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,401
Listen,

382
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,658
let's just see if there's
a simpler explanation.

383
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,159
Hmm?

384
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:09,294
Okay.

385
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,466
What was the name of that
computer tech that he mentioned?

386
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,599
Uh... Andrew.

387
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:16,301
Nelson. Andrew Nelson.

388
00:20:16,337 --> 00:20:18,670
Okay, well, I have an old
friend in that department.

389
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:20,205
We can find out

390
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,706
if Jacob's full of it in one call.

391
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,442
Okay.

392
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:39,321
_

393
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,227
_

394
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,873
_

395
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,829
_

396
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,748
_

397
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:20,733
Get on the other side of that train!

398
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:33,279
Come on, come on, come on,

399
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:35,080
come on, come on!

400
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:42,388
Come on, let's go.

401
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:57,569
What do you want?

402
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,571
Look at the picture I just sent you.

403
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,879
I can see the murderers now.

404
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:05,610
Where?

405
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:07,345
Not so fast.

406
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:09,902
Bring your weapons, I will stay on them.

407
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,147
And I call the shots now.

408
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:20,169
We checked. There's enough
fuel to get us out of Yemen.

409
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:29,176
Question is, can you
fly an old bird like this?

410
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,619
We'll find out.

411
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:40,221
There's another station,

412
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:42,197
30 miles outside Sana'a.

413
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,891
We can find a way there, hop a train.

414
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,927
They won't anticipate
us coming that way.

415
00:22:46,963 --> 00:22:49,199
Doubling down on a bad bet.

416
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,430
Just like you did

417
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,466
seven years back with the CIA.

418
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:54,030
Look around you.

419
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:56,370
Your plans affect people,
you don't even see it.

420
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:59,306
I don't blame you for resenting me.

421
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:00,785
You're damn right I resent you.

422
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:03,877
I see it, Linc. I see it.

423
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,712
Every second of every day,

424
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:07,514
the people, the collateral damage,

425
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,917
the lives I've... affected.

426
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:13,159
But I can't start thinking about that.

427
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:14,354
Because if I do,

428
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,556
then it all falls apart

429
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:17,214
and none of us get to go home.

430
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:18,849
I have to stay focused,

431
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:21,095
be the man with the plan.

432
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,529
Just like Fox River.

433
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:25,199
Remember?

434
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:28,844
We got wheels.

435
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:29,912
Good work.

436
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,882
The airport's the only play.

437
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,642
The airport is five miles away.

438
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,178
The border is hundreds.

439
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,013
Look,

440
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,405
the airport might be the right choice,

441
00:23:42,408 --> 00:23:44,685
but I trust my instincts.

442
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:46,320
They've gotten us this far.

443
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:47,501
And my gut says

444
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:50,184
we can still make it out through
the north. Choice is yours.

445
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,796
Look, man,

446
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,027
I agree with you, even if
I don't know you from Adam.

447
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,030
But...

448
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:59,303
got to go with the horse

449
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,553
that got you here, you know? So...

450
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:03,056
he's my horse.

451
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:10,485
Craziest horse I've ever met.

452
00:24:10,513 --> 00:24:12,446
But got us this far.

453
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:13,580
Crazy only works

454
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:14,949
if it doesn't get you killed.

455
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,679
_

456
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,533
Andrew?

457
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:35,936
Uh, Professor Hayden
told us to speak with you?

458
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:37,738
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, right.

459
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:38,672
Sorry.

460
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:40,507
Uh, hi, Andrew.

461
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,376
I'm Sara Scofield.

462
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:43,744
Thanks for taking the time.

463
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,479
By any chance,

464
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:48,448
did my husband Jacob Ness ask
you to work on my cell phone?

465
00:24:48,484 --> 00:24:51,585
Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.

466
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,020
What did he, uh...

467
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,584
What did he ask you to do?

468
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:57,167
Uh, he said he was looking to
find the contact information

469
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,727
for the people who
were stalking his wife.

470
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:02,696
So I did a data dive and
gave him what I could find.

471
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:04,665
How?

472
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:08,143
They hacked your phone
and lifted the data,

473
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:11,338
but in the process, left a
very slight electronic signature

474
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:13,473
that I was able to track back to them.

475
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:14,775
Wait, who are "they"?

476
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:17,445
Don't know. It was a dummy IP address,

477
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,747
but the cell and location were correct.

478
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,182
They couldn't hide that from me.

479
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,758
The man himself.

480
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,596
Hello.

481
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:38,832
Sara, listen, I know you're upset,

482
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:41,501
but I need you to come to the
Whitney Heights police station,

483
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:42,769
right now.

484
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,372
Please.

485
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:55,449
So, now we got some time to talk.

486
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:57,385
Um...

487
00:25:58,354 --> 00:26:00,354
Well, your name's Michael.

488
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,089
Cool.

489
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,757
You have a brother.

490
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:06,327
What else don't I know?

491
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:11,855
Serious, I need to know.
I've been traveling so fast,

492
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:14,068
for so long, I didn't even
stop to think who you really are

493
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,569
or what we're real doing here.

494
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:16,737
I don't even know why

495
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,372
you dragged me into all this, you know?

496
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:21,675
You got to forget the
past, Whip, the details.

497
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:22,976
None of that matters now.

498
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:25,245
What have my actions
been all these years?

499
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:26,780
Who's been taking care of you

500
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,849
through everything, huh?

501
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,250
Me. Right?

502
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:32,753
Right?

503
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,088
Yeah.

504
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,390
Nothing changes.

505
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:37,791
You're still my whip hand...

506
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:39,547
Whip hand, yeah, I
know, I'm your whip hand.

507
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:42,696
It's... it's not good
enough this time, man.

508
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,566
Can you just give it to me straight?

509
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:46,967
You know, I'm a big
boy, I can handle it.

510
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:48,869
There's a reason you're my whip hand.

511
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:51,809
A reason that's gonna change your life.

512
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,894
There's a light at the
end of the tunnel for you.

513
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:01,282
What the hell was that?

514
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,354
Oh, son of a bitch.

515
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,622
We got to go.

516
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:09,890
Let's go!

517
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:36,487
- There's no way out.
- Back of the hospital's

518
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,189
been shelled to rubble. It's blocked.

519
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:40,058
Upstairs is blocked, too.

520
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:41,579
We're gonna go downstairs.

521
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:43,322
Look for a way out.

522
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,850
You do the same.

523
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:52,380
Thanks.

524
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:57,830
What's going on?

525
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:01,184
Sara, just...

526
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:03,626
just come with us.

527
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:05,495
You'll see. Please.

528
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:13,870
Hello, ma'am. Um, Sara Scofield?

529
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,304
Yes, sir.

530
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,541
Thanks for coming in,
I'm Detective Kennan.

531
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:21,378
We'd like you to point out
who broke into your home.

532
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:22,445
And...

533
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:25,014
the one who shot your husband.

534
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,260
It's three and four.

535
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,221
The man and the woman was the shooter.

536
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:33,089
Are you sure?

537
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,332
Yes, sir.

538
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:45,001
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

539
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,005
There's got to be a way out.

540
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,076
Something... something that
connects to the surface.

541
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:54,540
Going down's not gonna work, Michael.

542
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:56,293
We need to set up an ambush and fight.

543
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,614
Yeah, well, fighting is
your default setting.

544
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,050
It's not always about fists.

545
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:03,319
I'm telling you, there's no way out.

546
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,889
Then find something
to fight with, you idiot.

547
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,302
I don't think it's that kind of a party,

548
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:21,771
but I like your style.

549
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:23,806
What are you going to do with that?

550
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:26,308
I don't know.

551
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:27,877

No. It's them.

568
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,487
My first lover was much older than me.

569
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,865
He was my friend's father.

570
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:23,984
Massi was his name.

571
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,999
It was the greatest of scandals

572
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,600
that we kept to ourselves.

573
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:35,204
But his wife discovered us

574
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,340
and told her brothers.

575
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:45,447
Massi was taken into the desert...

576
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:49,051
and buried.

577
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,220
Alive.

578
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:55,892
They brought his eyes to me in a rag.

579
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,434
I need you to use that on me.

580
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:07,303
End my suffering.

581
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:09,846
What, this?

582
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,309
Ja's right. All this running is pointless.

583
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:16,712
Do you know what they
will do to me here,

584
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:19,215
away from seeing eyes?

585
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,452
I can't.

586
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,022
I won't let that happen.

587

00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,787
I won't let that happen.

Michael, come on.

600
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:22,444
I'm sorry, Linc.

601
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:27,049
I should have come to you.

602
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,451
I should've asked for your help

603
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:34,057
when Poseidon offered
me the deal. I blew it.

604
00:33:34,092 --> 00:33:36,092
At the time, I thought,

605
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:40,096
if I dealt with it myself,
the pain would only be mine.

606
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:44,266
But instead I opened this Pandora's Box.

607
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:47,637
I wanted to make it better,
but I only made it worse

608
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:50,473
for everyone.

609
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:53,376
And somewhere in there...

610
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,947
I became a ghost.

611
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,204
I made a lot of mistakes.

612
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,175
A lot of foolish, imperfect choices,

613
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,911
but every one of them...

614
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:34,784
every one of them I made for love.

615
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:37,487
I know. I know.

616
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:41,623
Michael,

617
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:45,294
you're the smartest
person I've ever known,

618
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,897
but you can't carry the
load on your shoulders alone.

619
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,034
You need to share the burden.

620
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,268
Yes.

621
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:54,703
That's family.

622
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,926
That's what family's for.

623
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,576
Sara, I don't know
what you thought, but...

624
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:02,845
I'm just a husband who
was worried about his wife.

625
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:06,081
And yeah, I-I should have told
you what I was doing, but...

626
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:08,317
Look, I felt like... like
everything was spiraling

627
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,833
out of control and I had to do
whatever I could to protect you.

628
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:14,157
So you thought you'd
contact two hired killers?

629
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:16,658
I was trying to play the white knight.

630
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:19,907
Not very well.

631
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,797
And it was insanity.

632
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,398
I was scared to death.

633
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:25,267
A-A blubbering idiot,

634
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:28,738
but I thought they would
respond to money, you know?

635
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,473
Pay them whatever it
took to make them go away.

636
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,576
More than they were already making:

637
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,779
$50,000.

638
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,281
Look, I, uh...

639
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:42,818
I had a tracker in it, Sara.

640
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:46,980
This little thing, but
they didn't touch it.

641
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:52,294
I contacted the police before the meet,

642
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,997
but we nailed them anyhow.

643
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,933
We nailed them.

644
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:58,259
Jacob.

645
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:00,583
I am so sorry I put you through this.

646
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:18,354
Let's do this.

647
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:25,699
A wrench and a pipe against AKs.

648
00:36:26,397 --> 00:36:27,896
It'll be fun.

649
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:31,367

I love you, you crazy
Japanese son of a bitch!

668
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:05,106
It's Korean, champ.

669
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:06,175
Whatever. I still love you.

670
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:07,375
ISIL are like roaches.

671
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,510
More will be here soon.

672
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:10,612
What do we do now?

673
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,547
I need to take a break
from making decisions.

674
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,511
Linc, airport?

675
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:15,550
Airport.

676
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:21,589
Hey.

677
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,826
I got someone I want you to talk to.

678
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:27,862
Hey.

679
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:29,931
Oh, man!

680
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,334
Now that's a voice I never
thought I'd hear again.

681
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,688
Man, you got some
explaining to do, brother,

682
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:36,371
- risen from the dead and all.
- Soon.

683
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:37,672
Where can we meet you?

684
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,674
Uh, hangar two. Right
off the main runway.

685
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:42,787
But you better hurry your ass up.

686
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,545
Hangar two?

687
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:45,014
We could be there in 20 minutes.

688
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,281
We can be there in 20 minutes.

689
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:48,984
I don't know if we have that long.

690
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,919
Wait for us. We'll be there.

691
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,187
We got to move.

692
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:04,599
Sid...

693
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,234
Sid!

694
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,670
I heard your call, infidel.

695
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:12,408
Wings will not carry you to safety.

696
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:15,559
One call, and my brothers

697
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,715
will find your friends at the airport.

698
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:24,404
_

699
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,563
- Sid!
- Sid!

700
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,634
Son of a bitch.

701
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:45,107
No, no, no, no, no.

702
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,047
Talk to me, Sid. Stay with us.

703
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,515
Stay with us.

704
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:56,985
Sid...

705
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:59,555
Sid.

706
00:40:02,259 --> 00:40:04,326
He's gone.

707
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:20,709
Don't waste yourself on him.

708
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,274
You'll beat him by surviving.

709
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:34,556
You will die, you hear me?

710
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:38,594
You will all die!

711
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:41,141
Oh, my...

712
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:43,060
They're moving
more trucks into position.

713
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:44,219
- Yeah.
- We can't wait.

714
00:40:44,222 --> 00:40:46,912
There won't be enough runway
to take off. We must go now.

715
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,404
I owe Lincoln my
life. He deserves better.

716
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,053
But with so many souls in our hands,

717
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:53,723
do we really have a choice?

718
00:40:58,296 --> 00:41:00,729
Listen, we wait five more minutes.

719
00:41:00,732 --> 00:41:01,950
Okay?

720
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:04,552
And then we take care
of the souls that we can.

721
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,288
Understand?

722
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:14,096
What the hell are you doing?

723
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:18,066
The hell are you doing?

724
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:23,638
Listen, we are not leaving my friends!

725
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:24,773
Shut it down. Shut it down!

726
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:26,341
You would condemn us all to death.

727
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:28,491
If you stop me, no one gets out.

728
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:30,946
Your friends can still make
it to safety. We will not.

729
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:58,874
Yeah?

730
00:42:00,077 --> 00:42:02,677
C-Note? You got to
get out of here, man.

731
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:05,881
Hey, no, no, no, no. W-We can
do this thing, man. We can do it.

732
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:09,021
No! Go now! Otherwise,
you and the kids are dead!

733
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:11,193
We'll work something out.

734
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,355
We've been through worse.

735
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:20,195
Linc, I'm so sorry.

736
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:22,698
I'm so sorry, brother.

737
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:31,149
Lincoln? Find Omar. He...

738
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:32,394
What?

739
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:33,841
I can't hear you. What?

740
00:42:47,246 --> 00:42:51,903
