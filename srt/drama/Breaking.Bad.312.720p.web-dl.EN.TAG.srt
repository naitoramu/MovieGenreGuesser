4
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:50,641
{\pos(192,225)}So if it's okay, I was thinking

5
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,818
{\pos(192,225)}about using this one for the test.

6
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,964
{\pos(192,225)}Mom's brakes are very sticky...

7
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,053
{\pos(192,225)}and you barely press down on them,

8
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,092
{\pos(192,225)}and it's like a screech.

9
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:02,804
{\pos(192,225)}Sure.

10
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:06,371
{\pos(192,225)}But I'm good?

11
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,010
{\pos(192,225)}Yeah, you're great.

12
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:10,135
{\pos(192,225)}Why?

13
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,905
{\pos(192,225)}Are my feet okay?

14
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:19,574
I looked it up.

15
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:23,518
New Mexico says all I need
is a note from a doctor.

16
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,060
I mean, I know it's
not the right way and all,

17
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:28,296
but once I get my provisional,

18
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,102
I can keep working at it.

19
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,437
As long as it gets you
safely from point A to point B,

20
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:38,212
then who am I to argue?

21
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:50,088
{\pos(192,225)}Hi.

22
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,233
{\pos(192,225)}You're a sweet girl.
Yes, you are.

23
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,390
Yes, you are.

24
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,028
I know.

25
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:58,247
I know.

26
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,239
There you go.
Here you go.

27
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,364
All right.

28
00:04:17,578 --> 00:04:18,659
Thank you.

29
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,049
{\pos(192,225)}Got it?

30
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:22,641
{\pos(192,225)}Okay. All right.

31
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,546
So...

32
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:26,654
{\pos(192,210)}9 a.m. Saturday?

33
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,256
{\pos(192,210)}9 a.m. Saturday.

34
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,468
{\pos(192,210)}So, which means pick me up
about 8:30.

35
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,354
I'll be here with bells on.

36
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,394
What?

37
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,965
Just a saying.

38
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,985
Don't worry.
I won't be wearing bells.

39
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,459
Hey, Mom.

40
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,302
{\pos(192,210)}Hi. Do you have a minute?

41
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,983
{\pos(192,210)}- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Yeah, sure.

42
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:45,523
- Thanks.
- See you, Dad.

43
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:48,037
- Bye, son. Good work today.
- Thank you.

44
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:58,006
Have you thought anymore
about about what we discussed?

45
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,212
{\pos(192,210)}"Thought any more,"
meaning reconsidered?

46
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,304
{\pos(192,210)}So show me the flaw in it.

47
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,182
{\pos(192,210)}"Flaws," Skyler.

48
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,705
{\pos(192,185)}"Flaws," plural, not singular.

49
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,569
{\pos(192,210)}Where do you want me to start?

50
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,971
{\pos(192,210)}I don't love
this situation, all right,

51
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,410
{\pos(192,210)}that you put me in.

52
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,202
{\pos(192,210)}However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

53
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:26,247
{\pos(192,210)}You took the seed money.
You went gambling.

54
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:29,083
{\pos(192,210)}You invested it in the car wash
that you helped run for four years.

55
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,220
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper.
Because guess what?

56
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,140
{\pos(192,210)}She's actually a bookkeeper.

57
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,878
{\pos(192,210)}Now, that is a story an auditor can
believe, so what am I missing?

58
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:40,394
{\pos(192,210)}You're missing that you should just
take this money that I give you

59
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,997
{\pos(192,210)}and not look too closely at it,

60
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:43,572
so

61
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:46,277
{\pos(192,210)}if, God forbid, I get caught,

62
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:49,937
{\pos(192,210)}you maintain plausible deniability.

63
00:05:50,062 --> 00:05:52,072
Okay, my estranged husband

64
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:53,908
{\pos(192,210)}who, when he was working,

65
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:55,980
{\pos(192,210)}made $43,000 a year,

66
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:58,802
{\pos(192,210)}starts shoveling money at me,
and when the police come,

67
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,568
{\pos(192,210)}I'm supposed to say, "Gee,

68
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:02,950
{\pos(192,210)}"I never thought about it, Officers.
Made sense to me."

69
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,005
{\pos(192,210)}Really?

70
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,422
{\pos(192,210)}That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

71
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,490
{\pos(192,210)}I'll tell you what, Walt.

72
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:12,827
{\pos(192,210)}I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name

73
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,332
than some complete idiot.

74
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,595
{\pos(192,210)}So you're

75
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,174
{\pos(192,210)}promoting caution here.

76
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:24,313
{\pos(192,175)}And you want a believable story.

77
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:28,209
{\pos(192,175)}That, it seems to me,

78
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,911
{\pos(192,210)}is the safest way to make the best

79
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,744
{\pos(192,210)}out of a very bad situation, yes.

80
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,648
But I'm noting

81
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:40,531
a little hole in your plot, though.

82
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,025
Why would your estranged husband

83
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,488
be doing all this for you?

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,323
Because he loves his family

85
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,000
and desperately wants
a reconciliation,

86
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,681
though it may be

87
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:56,247
hopeless and futile.

88
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,413
Then again,

89
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:00,535
he'd try anything.

90
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:06,447
I'm just not buying it.

91
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,149
No, I think it would be better

92
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:10,952
if the husband were
no longer estranged.

93
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:15,894
You know, maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

94
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:20,617
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

95
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:28,411
I am at least going to be
a part of this household.

96
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,771
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

97
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:32,869
Not every night, no.

98
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,778
Six nights a week.
You'll get one night off.

99
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:38,746
Dinner two nights, not weekends,

100
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,752
with 24-hours' notice.

101
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,837
Five nights a week with no notice.

102
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,173
Three, six-hours' notice.

103
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,588
Five nights a week
with two hours' notice.

104
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:48,623
Four.

105
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,211
Don't push it.

106
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,266
And I want my own key to the house.

107
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,099
For emergencies
and appearances, yes.

108
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:00,201
I am going to babysit
my own daughter.

109
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:02,065
I'll help my son with his homework.

110
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,234
I am going to be
a part of this family,

111
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,111
and that is how we'll sell
your little fiction.

112
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:35,118
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

113
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,176
No. Thanks, though.

114
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:46,860
Maybe some other time.

115
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,818
No, seriously.

116
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:51,336
Get a beer with me.

117
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,970
What?

118
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,575
What the hell are you doing?

119
00:09:25,145 --> 00:09:26,565
That's ours, right?

120
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:30,371
Look at it and tell me
if that's ours.

121
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,079
Yes, it's ours.
Now put it away.

122
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:43,119
What the hell is wrong with you?

123
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,627
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

124
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,923
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

125
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,968
They had Combo shot down
in the street,

126
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,583
and now it's our product

127
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:57,263
they're selling.

128
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:01,226
Which means they work
for our guy. Right?

129
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:03,751
What is that?
That's hearsay.

130
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,880
- Do you have any proof?
- I heard it from the sister of the kid

131
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,608
who shot him.

132
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,258
Hear how I just said "kid"?

133
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:14,851
This kid...

134
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:16,658
he's 11 years old...

135
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,340
shot Combo on orders.

136
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,145
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

137
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,470
They got him...

138
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,002
And you know he's not the first.

139
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,194
They use kids 'cause, hey, why not?

140
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:34,021
Easy to control, easy to fool.

141
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,344
All they get is juvie
if they ever get caught.

142
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,656
Hearts and minds, right?

143
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,074
Get them young,
and they're yours forever.

144
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,966
These guys killed Combo.

145
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,436
They used this little kid

146
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,400
like some puppet.

147
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:54,976
They used him to shoot my friend.

148
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,693
So why are you telling me this?

149
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:08,894
I need your help.

150
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:12,614
How?

151
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:14,014
I need ricin.

152
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,079
My God.

153
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,566
God.

154
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:20,100
These two...

155
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,571
They got to go.
All right?

156
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,573
I've got the entire
thing figured out...

157
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,675
a delivery method, everything.
All I need from you

158
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,207
is the poison, that's all.

159
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:32,393
Look,

160
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,227
otherwise, you don't have to...
lift a finger.

161
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:38,643
Listen, you don't even know
what you're talking about.

162
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,689
Look, you
don't get how right this is?

163
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,727
You don't get how the whole
entire world

164
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,656
- would be better off...
- We're not even talking about this.

165
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:48,988
I know a woman

166
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,407
who buys from the
these two once or twice a week.

167
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,598
She brings them hamburgers 'cause
they sit in their car all day,

168
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,889
and they get hungry,
so she brings them food,

169
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,839
and they knock
a few bucks off her price.

170
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:01,709
There's your delivery system
right there.

171
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,170
- I can be a mile away.
- Jesus.

172
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,981
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

173
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,972
You know what? That meth-head
stood up to your brother-in-law.

174
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,649
All right?
He questioned her for five hours.

175
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,522
She didn't give it up.

176
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,185
You know how it is you know?

177
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,992
Because you're not
in prison right now.

178
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,661
I know I would be
in prison after this.

179
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:24,002
Prison or worse, and I'd
be right alongside you.

180
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,067
You cannot be serious.

181
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,333
Listen, this is a ridiculous idea.

182
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,767
It's ridiculous?

183
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,742
What, so you're saying
it's not going to work?

184
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:37,745
How about back
when it was your plan?

185
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:40,259
Back when you were
going to use it on Tuco?

186
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,770
Apples and oranges.

187
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:45,019
Guy eats ricin. Two or three days later,
he gets the flu

188
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,600
or a heart attack or something,
and he keels over.

189
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,929
That's what you said.

190
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:50,704
Untraceable back to us.

191
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:52,832
To me.

192
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:57,611
Not even that other scumbag we work for
is ever going to figure it out.

193
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:00,763
It was a good plan
back when it was Tuco,

194
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:02,638
and it's a good plan now.

195
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,702
Tuco wanted to murder us.

196
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,851
These guys don't.

197
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:10,277
Apples and oranges.

198
00:13:10,402 --> 00:13:11,979
Do I really have to sit here

199
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:13,626
and explain the difference to you?

200
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,305
Combo

201
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,389
was us,

202
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:17,889
man.

203
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,987
He was one of us.

204
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:22,094
Does that mean nothing?

205
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,760
Why didn't you go after these guys

206
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,423
- two or three months ago?
- Because I just found out about them.

207
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:29,787
What's to find out?

208
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,167
It's a dispute over turf, right?
How hard could it have been

209
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,102
for you to track them down

210
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:36,837
on their turf

211
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,082
and kill them months ago?

212
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:42,042
Because back then

213
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,622
you were too busy getting high,

214
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:45,946
feeling sorry.

215
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,387
Now,

216
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,617
murder...

217
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,900
is not part of your 12-step program.

218
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,209
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

219
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:00,618
What you are talking
about here is pointless.

220
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:04,465
This achieves nothing.

221
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,996
It accomplishes nothing.

222
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,639
If you don't see
what it accomplishes,

223
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,348
then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

224
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:21,111
Jesse, listen to me.

225
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,259
You are not a murderer.

226
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,764
I'm not, and you're not.

227
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,650
It's as simple as that.

228
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,135
I'm doing it...

229
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:44,595
with or without you.

230
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:16,799
Knock, knock.

231
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,170
Christ sakes, Marie,
you don't say "knock, knock." You...

232
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,138
- Like that.
- Well, I like saying it.

233
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:23,923
That's not the rules.

234
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:25,467


235
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,729
Listen, you knock your way, Groucho.
I'll knock mine.

236
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,637
But, look, see?
I win.

237
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:30,906
Not so fast.

238
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,976
Christ, again?
That's three in a row.

239
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,897
Frickin' Paul Newman over here?

240
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,606
Do you play cards with your dad?{\Have you been playing cards
with your dad?}

241
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,191
No, why?

242
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,026
How is your old man?

243
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:47,097
- He back teaching?
- No,

244
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:49,170
I don't think either
of them are working right...

245
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:50,705
right now.

246
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:52,938
How they swinging that?

247
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,720
Did you know

248
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:58,374
that the doctor has told your Uncle
Hank that he can get out of here

249
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,444
- any time he wants to.
- Yeah?

250
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,069
That's great.

251
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,082
Yeah, well,
we're not so sure about that.

252
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,347
Why not?

253
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,634
What? That's what they said.

254
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,282
That's what they said
because they want the room.

255
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:12,396
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
re-set the meter,

256
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,641
and wheel the next slob in here.
We went over this.

257
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:16,004
Drop it.

258
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,448
Are you not well enough?

259
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:23,399
Jesus, kid, you, too?

260
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,026
Do I look well enough?

261
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:27,686
I'm shitting in pants,
peeing in pitchers.

262
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,090
Can't move my legs.
Got it?

263
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:34,243
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

264
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,704
What about people on crutches?

265
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:38,923
Maybe I should be in here, too.

266
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,820
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

267
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,545
Deal, you little prick.

268
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:04,867
Bitch.

269
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,805
You know I'm hourly, right?

270
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,282
He promised me he'd be here.

271
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:16,206
Oh, he promised, huh?
Well, why didn't you tell me?

272
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:17,681
Let's wait, then.

273
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,998
That's a joke.
The kid ain't coming.

274
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,724
Okay, so what's Plan B?

275
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:24,269
I don't know.

276
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,669
I really don't.

277
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:28,197
Well, let's brainstorm.

278
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,216
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

279
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,404
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it.

280
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:37,506
Or try, at least.

281
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,851
Okay, so, what, we pay him off.

282
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,622
No. No, it's not about money.

283
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:43,646
It's about getting him
off the streets,

284
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,899
getting him to calm down.

285
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,568
Maybe...

286
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,077
What if we...

287
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,121
maybe...

288
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:00,205
Could you get him arrested?

289
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:06,409
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

290
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:07,536
No, now, listen.

291
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:10,215
I know it sounds risky,
but it wouldn't be anything

292
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,077
that would get him into real trouble

293
00:18:12,202 --> 00:18:14,168
and nothing that could lead
back to our business.

294
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,026
Just some minor offense.

295
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,307
Pinkman in jail... I don't know.

296
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,474
- I'm picturing it and...
- No, not in jail

297
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,599
as in...

298
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:24,473
"jail" jail.

299
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,731
I'm talking about one of those

300
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,821
situations where you're
in an orange jumpsuit

301
00:18:30,946 --> 00:18:32,779
picking up litter along the highway.

302
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,723
That's jail.

303
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:38,701
You're talking
about a level-two joint.

304
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,348
Something that keeps him off
the street for, say,

305
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:43,695
30 days.
Then by the time he gets out,

306
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,585
tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

307
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:50,397
Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact.

308
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:54,075
In the past
I've recommended Springer, but

309
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,618
hearing chancy things
about their bathrooms

310
00:18:56,743 --> 00:18:58,597
since they renovated,

311
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:00,463
so...

312
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,184
So it's possible, right?

313
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,453
It falls under
my premium-services package,

314
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:09,107
but you can afford that.

315
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,029
I'll call my P.I.

316
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,444
You understand what you have to do?

317
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:23,169
You can

318
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,504
never talk to anyone.

319
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,166
Right?

320
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:30,553
I mean, ever.
Understand?

321
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,071
Yeah.

322
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,964
I found this stuff on the Internet.

323
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,301
Takes days to kick in.

324
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,696
Just keep quiet,
and this won't ever come back to you.

325
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,310
You're okay with this, right?

326
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,693
Just think of it like
it's the same thing as always.

327
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,004
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

328
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,408
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

329
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:06,673
You got a kid.

330
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:07,968
Right?

331
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:09,981
What's his name?

332
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:11,516
Patrick.

333
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:13,967
Imagine these two guys

334
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,059
and Patrick working as a mule,

335
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,461
making him kill people.

336
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:21,804
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

337
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,662
Of course I would.

338
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,398
I do all kinds of things for him.

339
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,254
Okay, so...

340
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,052
these guys using kids like that,

341
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:37,035
they got to go.

342
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:38,420
Right?

343
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,245
Good.

344
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,270
Tomorrow.

345
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,013
I'll be in touch.

346
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,539
Bet that tastes good, huh?

347
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:30,785
Come here.

348
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:35,337
Here we go.

349
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,739
Here we go.

350
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:51,458
What are you doing?

351
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,494
If you need to talk, use the phone.

352
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,451
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

353
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,543
Your wife's out, right?

354
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:04,407
Isn't she something?

355
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,536
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

356
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,239
What can I do for you?

357
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,055
Have a seat, Walter.

358
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,584
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

359
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:26,265
- And?
- I'm not going to do it.

360
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,762
Why?

361
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,437
Because it's moronic.

362
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:33,335
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

363
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,200
That's not the moronic part.

364
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:37,172
Okay, so what's the problem?

365
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,959
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

366
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:43,655
Saul?

367
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:47,383
My boss.

368
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:49,953
Your boss.

369
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,290
This is a professional courtesy.

370
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:57,783
No one knows I'm here.
Understand?

371
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,150
But our employer would
find out, like always,

372
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:05,131
and if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

373
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,964
You got a good thing going here.
We all do.

374
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:15,292
You want to risk it all
on one junkie?

375
00:23:15,883 --> 00:23:17,659
Now, I realize you two
have a history,

376
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:19,783
but this kid's been
on the bubble a while now.

377
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:22,089
It's a long time coming.

378
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,030
What is?

379
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:33,513
I used to be a beat cop,
long time ago,

380
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:37,415
and I'd get called out on
domestic disputes all the time.

381
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,272
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

382
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:44,039
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

383
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:45,439
Gordie.

384
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:48,143
He looked like Bo Svenson.
You remember him?

385
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,151
<i>Walking Tall</i>?
You don't remember?

386
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:53,057
Anyway...

387
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:54,439
big boy...

388
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:56,126
270, 280,

389
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:57,911
but his wife...

390
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,919
or whatever she was... his lady

391
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,483
was real small,

392
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:06,158
like a bird,
wrists like little branches.

393
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:11,700
Anyway, my partner and I get
called out there every weekend,

394
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:14,048
and one of us would pull her
aside and we'd say,

395
00:24:14,173 --> 00:24:16,491
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

396
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:20,375
And this wasn't one of those "deep
down he really loves me" set-ups.

397
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,562
We got a lot of those, but not this.

398
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:24,181
This girl was scared.

399
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:26,812
She wasn't going to cross him
no way, no how.

400
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:30,218
Nothing we could do
but pass her off to the Emts,

401
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,239
put him in the car,
drive him downtown,

402
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:34,167
throw him in the drunk tank.

403
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,938
He sleeps it off.
Next morning, out he goes...

404
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:38,394
back home.

405
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:41,359
But one night

406
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,750
my partner's out sick,

407
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,047
and it's just me.

408
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,252
And the call comes in,
and it's the usual crap...

409
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,382
broken-nose-in-the-shower
kind of thing.

410
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,953
So I cuff him, put him in the car,
and away we go.

411
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,650
Only that night...

412
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:01,049
we're driving into town,

413
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,118
and this sideways asshole

414
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:06,078
is in my back seat
humming "Danny Boy."

415
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,391
And it just rubbed me wrong.

416
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:12,728
So instead of left,

417
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:14,743
I go right, out into nowhere.

418
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:18,997
And I kneel him down,
and I put my revolver in his mouth,

419
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,143
and I told him,

420
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:22,971
"This is it.

421
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,029
This is how it ends."

422
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:29,244
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself,

423
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,923
swearing to God
he's going to leave her alone,

424
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:33,199
screaming...

425
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:35,951
as much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

426
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:39,004
And I told him to be quiet...

427
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:42,861
'cause I need to think about
what I was gong to do here.

428
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:45,034
And of course he got quiet.

429
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:47,347
Goes still.

430
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:49,922
And real quiet.

431
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,792
Like a dog waiting
for dinner scraps.

432
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:57,657
Then we just stood there
for a while.

433
00:25:59,312 --> 00:26:01,519
Me acting
like I'm thinking things over,

434
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,635
and Prince Charming
kneeling in the dirt

435
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,390
with shit in his pants.

436
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:12,155
And after a few minutes I took
the gun out of his mouth,

437
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,541
and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again,

438
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,495
"I will such and such
and such and such

439
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,165
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

440
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,789
Just a warning?

441
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,545
Of course.

442
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:38,999
Just trying to do the right thing.

443
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,563
But two weeks later he killed her.

444
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:46,606
Of course.

445
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,920
Caved her head in with the
base of a Waring blender.

446
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,923
We got there, there was so much
blood, you could taste the metal.

447
00:27:02,886 --> 00:27:04,621
The moral of the story is...

448
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:08,231
I chose a half measure

449
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,083
when I should have gone all the way.

450
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:19,461
I'll never make that mistake again.

451
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:31,209
No more half measures, Walter.

452
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,345
Man, I don't get this.

453
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,564
I don't get this at all.

454
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,550
All I'm seeing is the kid.

455
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:58,528
So where are they?

456
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:00,738
I don't know.

457
00:28:00,863 --> 00:28:02,265
They're always around.

458
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,729
Burgers are getting cold.

459
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,780
So is it, like, fast?

460
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,036
Don't sweat it, all right?
You're just doing what you do.

461
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:18,615
Nobody's going to know anything.

462
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,828
Can I have another bump?

463
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,395
You had your bump.

464
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,954
We get this thing done.
Then you can have all you want.

465
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,542
Going to need you to come with me.

466
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:31,830
Take a walk.

467
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,601
Where are we going?

468
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:46,832
Sit down.

469
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:01,457
I understand that you have a
problem with two of my employees.

470
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:05,389
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

471
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,868
It is possible they acted rashly,

472
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,454
but, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

473
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,294
A man was selling
on their territory.

474
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:19,588
There is blame on both sides.

475
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,553
This will go no further.

476
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:29,055
It will be settled right here,

477
00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:30,505
right now.

478
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:33,394
You told him.

479
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,608
Wait outside.

480
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:51,995
Listen to me.

481
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:53,830
You have one friend in this room.

482
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,165
This man.

483
00:31:57,608 --> 00:31:58,958
Those men outside

484
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:01,415
are my trusted employees,

485
00:32:02,237 --> 00:32:05,288
and when I learned
what you intended to do...

486
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,920
If it wasn't for this man

487
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:12,055
and the respect I have for him,

488
00:32:12,183 --> 00:32:14,792
I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

489
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,563
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

490
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:26,755
This is what happens now.

491
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,038
My men will come back inside,

492
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:31,618
and you will shake their hands

493
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,610
and you will make peace.

494
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:35,935
And that will be the end of this.

495
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:46,113
Pardon me?

496
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,259
They use kids.

497
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,802
These assholes of yours,
they got an 11-year-old kid

498
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,696
doing their killing for them.

499
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,642
You're supposed to be some kind
of reasonable businessman.

500
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,675
This how you do business?

501
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:00,871
You okay with this?

502
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:02,946
You got anything to say here?

503
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,979
Bring them back.

504
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:45,155
No more children.

505
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,278
Understand?

506
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:53,244
And you.

507
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:59,435
You keep the peace.

508
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:05,718
Say it.

509
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,551
I'll keep the peace.

510
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:15,805
Shake hands.

511
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:01,636
Jesse, your actions...

512
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,814
they affect other people.

513
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,794
And sometimes

514
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:13,551
compromises have to be made...

515
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,398
for the best of reasons.

516
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:56,597
Let the people who get
paid to do this, do this.

517
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:00,243
The people who get paid to
do this, do a lousy job.

518
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:15,265
So I guess this is
what you want, huh?

519
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,544
Just lying in a hospital bed,

520
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,329
getting sponge baths from nurses.

521
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:26,376
It's time to go home, Hank.

522
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,973
How many times I got to tell you?
Not till I'm well.

523
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:39,524
Hey, what are you doing?

524
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:40,867
I'm just seeing.

525
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:42,353
Seeing what?

526
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:43,834
Seeing what I see.

527
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:47,791
I'm not at my best here, Marie.

528
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,107
We'll see.

529
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:52,525
Nothing's going to happen.

530
00:36:52,854 --> 00:36:53,755
I say it will.

531
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,614
I'm in this bed for a reason.

532
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:01,153
It's a waste of time.

533
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,579
Besides, what if someone comes in?

534
00:37:06,065 --> 00:37:07,445
Let them. I don't care.

535
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,270
What's wrong with you?

536
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,255
I'll tell you what.

537
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,943
If I can get the groundhog
to see his shadow...

538
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:18,381
- It's not going to happen. I'm sorry.
- I'm betting it will, and if he does,

539
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:20,487
you check out of here.

540
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,120
I'm not going to bet
on whether I get a boner.

541
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,515
It's not bet.
There's no bet here. No bet.

542
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,805
You afraid you'll lose?

543
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,792
You know what?
You're just...

544
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,809
You're just being foolish, you know?

545
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:33,934
Come on.

546
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,950
What's the point?

547
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:37,518
The point is...

548
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:39,467
you're not completely hopeless.

549
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,580
We have a bet?

550
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:47,748
You know what?

551
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,152
If it'll get you
out of here quicker,

552
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,549
- you got one minute.
- One minute?

553
00:37:52,674 --> 00:37:54,190
All right.
That's a cakewalk.

554
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:56,004
Yeah, this is just...

555
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:58,351
It's just sad.
I mean...

556
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,771
I really feel sorry for
you, Marie, you know?

557
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:02,664
I really do.
It's just... It's...

558
00:38:04,138 --> 00:38:05,008
pathetic.

559
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,643
That's okay.
Keep talking.

560
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:07,768
Protest.

561
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:09,536
Struggle.

562
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:13,759
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

563
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:15,868
not...

564
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:19,090
going to happen.

565
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,039
Bad day?

566
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:49,776
I don't even know.

567
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,036
Anyway,

568
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:57,584
it's better now.

569
00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:07,095
Tell them you're busy.

570
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:11,267
Hello.

571
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Grandma?

572
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:16,272
Slow down.

573
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,390
Slow down. I can't...

574
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:21,501
God.

575
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:24,334
God.

576
00:39:58,947 --> 00:39:59,974
Tomas!

577
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:06,131
You have to let me in!
Please!

578
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:19,047
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

579
00:40:22,094 --> 00:40:24,782
You are now 42 minutes late.

580
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:28,734
I'm starting without you.

581
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,685
- <i>What is wasabi?</i>
- <i>Wasabi. Right you are.</i>

582
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:37,228
<i>"Four-letter Word" for 1,200.</i>

583
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,539
<i>Pilots and musicians
know this word...</i>

584
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:42,724
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

585
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:46,163
- <i>What is "solo"?</i>
- <i>That's the word.</i>

586
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:47,462
This guy is good.

587
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:49,783
- <i>"Four-letter Word," 2,000.</i>
- <i>"A loud"...</i>

588
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,594
<i>harsh cry.
Walt Whitman's was "barbaric".</i>

589
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,709
- Yell.
- What is "yawp"?

590
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,405
- <i>Kevin.</i>
- <i>What is "yawp"?</i>

591
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,240
- <i>"Yawp."</i>
- <i>"Tokyo," 1,200.</i>

592
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:02,844
What the heck's a "yawp"?

593
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,235
"Yawp" is a yell.
I'll be right back.

594
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,921
That's what I said.

595
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,807
Okay to use your bathroom, right?

596
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:27,993
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

597
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:41,973
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

598
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,117
Look, I hope you're not waiting
for an apology,

599
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,189
because I did not rat you out.

600
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,293
I was looking out for your best
interest as well as my own,

601
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:55,143
and I stand by my decision 100%,

602
00:41:55,268 --> 00:41:57,956
so we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

603
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,865
Anyway, just call me back.

604
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,242
So the TV turns itself off?

605
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,492
I'll get it.

606
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:16,372
Where's the remote?

607
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:19,154
<i>On the murder of a young boy
in the South Valley.</i>

608
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,395
<i>Police have yet to release
a statement,</i>

609
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,459
<i>but sources indicate

610
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,962
<i>may have been the victim
of a gang-related execution.</i>

611
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,862
<i>An anonymous tip brought police
to a playground</i>

612
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:33,652
<i>on the 4700 block
of 8th Avenue late last night.</i>

613
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,141
<i>Paramedics were called to the scene
but were unable to revive the boy.</i>

614
00:42:38,662 --> 00:42:39,882
<i>A gruesome crime...</i>

615
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:41,509
Can you turn that off?

616
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:43,662
<i>And yet another casualty
in what appears to be</i>

617
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,625
<i>the city's ongoing struggle against
drugs and the gangs that peddle them.</i>

618
00:42:48,503 --> 00:42:50,603
<i>We'll be passing along detail...</i>

619
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,756
Give me your dad...

620
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,685
I'm sorry. It's just,

621
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,973
they've been talking about
that all day, and it's just...

622
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,238
Did you know your dad and I

623
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:14,246
are thinking about maybe
starting a business together?

624
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:16,307
Seriously?

625
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:20,281
- What kind of business?
- I don't know.

626
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:22,150
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

627
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:25,146
What do you mean?
Like...

628
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:28,766
I'm sorry.
I... I have to go.

629
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:28,386
Run.
