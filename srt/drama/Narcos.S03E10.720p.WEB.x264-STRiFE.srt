2
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,519
Hey!

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,484
Hey, ladies.

4
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,111
Are you looking for something?

5
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,280
We're just taking a ride.

6
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,490
Can't we pass?

7
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,117
No, sweetheart. You have to go back.

8
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,626
Listen...

9
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,379
Do you want to hang out later
back in town?

10
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,799
- What?
- I said...

11
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,336
No, no, no!

12
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,909
- Julio.
- Pacho, you motherfucker.

13
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,578
Motherfucking dog!

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,418
Let me go!

15
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,301
Let go of me!

16
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,386
Let me go!

17
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,179
Let go...!

18
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,891
You.

19
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,561
Mrs. Salazar.

20
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,107
Do you know what makes me happy, Pacho?

21
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,901
Makes me very happy?

22
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,405
That my sons didn't kill
your brother Alvaro.

23
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,617
Because he's going to live
the rest of his life...

24
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,704
as half a man. Half man, half...

25
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,857
Help!

26
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,194
Help!

27
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
the great event of the surrender

28
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,054
of Helmer Herrera,
to Colombian justice.

29
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:33,810
And this incident
marked the end of the Cali cartel...

30
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,397
who were responsible,
according to international sources,

31
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:44,278
for more than 80%
of the cocaine trafficking in the world.

32
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,866
Throughout my campaign and presidency,

33
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,456
I committed to dismantling
all narcotrafficking networks,

34
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,291
and we're doing it.

35
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,628
The Colombian government
was quick to claim victory.

36
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:05,091
The arrest of Miguel RodrÃ­guez
and the surrenders of Pacho Herrera...

37
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,677
and Chepe Santacruz...

38
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,305
looked like big wins in The War on Drugs.

39
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,474
But they were bullshit.

40
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,938
The only real victory belonged
to the godfathers of Cali,

41
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,274
safely ensconced in a BogotÃ¡jail...

42
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,817
Leave that there.

43
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,318
still billionaires,

44
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,114
submitting to a justice
that they had bought and paid for.

45
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,461
They didn't need to build
their own prison.

46
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,451
Hello, sweetie.

47
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,954
The minimum security wing of La Picota
would do just fine.

48
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,747
They wouldn't be there long.

49
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,709
Gilberto. How've you been?

50
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,043
Good, brother.

51
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,546
Grateful that we're all together.

52
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,216
The investment we made in our friends
can bear fruit.

53
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,968
And then all this will pass away

54
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,888
like some old joke
you can't quite remember.

55
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,016
For this, gentlemen, I propose a toast.

56
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,767
Of course you would.

57
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,478
Fucking Chepe.

58
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,064
Gilberto, I'd like to say a few words.

59
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,068
You all know this wasn't what I wanted.

60
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:12,033
So it's very hard for me to admit
that I know this is for the best.

61
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,286
And thanks to you, we're on the verge of,
how do you call it?

62
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,371
"A great victory."

63
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,585
We believe in you.

64
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,964
To my brother, Gilberto. Our leader.

65
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,425
Gentlemen of Cali... salud!

66
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,510
Cheers!

67
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,119
Don't worry about it.

68
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,378
Agent PeÃ±a.

69
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,171
Hello.

70
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,259
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Give me a second.

71
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,094
Go with your mom.

72
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,139
Checked with the embassy,
finishing up paperwork this afternoon.

73
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,141
You're on a flight tomorrow. First thing.

74
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,646
Guillermo Pallomari.

75
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,609
- You have any idea where we can find him?
- No. Why do you need him?

76
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,237
Gilberto and Miguel RodrÃ­guez
gave six million dollars

77
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,364
to Samper's presidential campaign.

78
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,618
So unless we get Pallomari in the States
testifying on the cartel,

79
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,412
generating new indictments...

80
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,917
- What are you telling me?
- The godfathers won't stay locked up.

81
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,847
What do you think's gonna happen
to my family

82
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,300
if these men keep all their money,
all their power?

83
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,678
Well, Witness Protection Services will
provide security for as long as you need.

84
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,855
Pallomari's wife is having an affair.

85
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,066
- With who?
- Some guy at her office. Fredy Moya.

86
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,819
Phones in the cartel safe house,
they're tapped.

87
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,989
I overheard a conversation between them.
It didn't sound like business.

88
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,078
And he can keep them in prison?

89
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,457
We find Pallomari or the godfathers walk.

90
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,439
You're not gonna find him without me.

91
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,632
You're right.

92
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,305
Go ahead, sir.

93
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,599
Director.

94
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,433
Don Miguel.

95
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,561

You know I can't get involved.

Nothing is going to happen to you.
When has anything happened to you?

115
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,263
I'm asking you for legal advice,
and quickly.

116
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,476
I've decided that the best way
to get out of this situation

117
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,687
is to turn myself in to the authorities.

118
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,772
Yes, normally that would be the case. Yes.

119
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:15,067
But the problem is you already
have a warrant out for your arrest.

120
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,027
An arrest warrant?

121
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,197
The police won't protect you.
In fact, they'll probably kill you.

122
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,741
I'm the head accountant.

123
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,619
And every dollar in this organization,
and every secret,

124
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,580
has been through this head.
It's all in here.

125
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,707
Tell whoever needs to know
I'm willing to negotiate.

126
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,753
Guillermo, my advice to you
is to get your family and leave Cali.

127
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,506
My wife's very attached to her work.

128
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,343
- What? I don't understand.
- You know her, she's stubborn.

129
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,306
She built her business from the ground up.

130
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,479
I can't leave without her.

131
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:57,401
Look, Guillermo... this is not
my legal advice, but as your friend...

132
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:02,198
talk some sense into your wife.
Immediately.

133
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,496
Can you get me a gun?

134
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,528
We'll have to look out for ourselves
the rest of our lives,

135
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,629
but if I help them...

136
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,131
maybe one day
we can come back to Colombia.

137
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,926
Are you insane? They almost killed us.

138
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,305
They almost killed us, and now you're
telling me you want to go back? To Cali?

139
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,350
Do you really think
we can come back to Colombia?

140
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,937
The moment we come back to Colombia,
they'll kill our daughters.

141
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,608
Are you doing this to make up
for the last four years of your life?

142
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,198
I'm a good man.

143
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,079
I was a good man.

144
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,041
I'll leave with the girls tomorrow.

145
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,085
I'm not waiting for you.

146
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,933
Wait for me, okay? Thanks.

147
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,282
That way.

148
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,042
Keep looking for him.
No more fucking excuses.

149
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,461
Okay.

150
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,845
Yeah?

151
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,181
Have you heard from your father?

152
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,684
Yes.

153
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,902
David, I've been wondering about
the arrangement I had for my son and...

154
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,069
Arrangement?

155
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,740
I thought it was true love.

156
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,827
Your father knows I care about him.

157
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,458
That's beautiful.

158
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,584
Seriously.

159
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,628
But here's the thing...

160
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,964
You don't mean anything to me.

161
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,300
You're not my mother.

162
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,844
You're not my fucking problem.

163
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,555
- David...
- What?

164
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,099
What the fuck do I owe you?

165
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,064
MarÃ­a.

166
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,611
Open your legs for someone else.
You're good at that.

167
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,156
Okay?

168
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,633
Once we step off this plane,
whatever goes down is on me.

169
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,761
We are way off the well-lit path.

170
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,683
Jorge.

171
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,325
Good afternoon, Mr. Salcedo.

172
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,316
Mr. Espinosa's still at lunch.
He should be back soon.

173
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,276
- We'll wait for him inside.
- Okay, sir.

174
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,447
Another drink?

175
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,827
I need to go. See you next week.

176
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,214
Excuse me.

177
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,008
How are the girls here?

178
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,635
The best of Cali.

179
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,261
Open it!

180
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,848
Get in.

181
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,977
Get in, motherfucker!

182
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,070
Okay.

183
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,117
ACCESS RESTRICTED
PASSWORD REQUIRED

184
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,581
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

185
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,917
- I'm looking for Fredy Moya.
- Yes.

186
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,670
- The one wearing purple.
- Thanks.

187
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,216
Don't pull my chain.

188
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,676
I'm looking at the numbers.

189
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,887
Excuse me.
You work with Patricia Pallomari?

190
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,392
Javier PeÃ±a, DEA.

191
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,769
I'll call you back.

192
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,982
Patricia's taken
a temporary leave of absence.

193
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,692
That so?

194
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,987
You have any idea where I can find her?

195
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,529
I wouldn't know.

196
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,573
She in trouble?

197
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,951
No, but her husband is.

198
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,663
There's a warrant out for his arrest
and a pretty substantial reward.

199
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,957
Any information is helpful.

200
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,831
- Hello.
- It's me.

201
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,335
Baby, I can't talk right now.
Call me back later.

202
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,296
No. Wait, I can't call you back. Wait.

203
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,379
Yes.

204
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,802
Yes, I'd have to check
my records in the office.

205
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,639
I can't talk.

206
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,642
- Wait.
- Patricia, the DEA was just here.

207
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,895
The DEA. Asking questions.

208
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,397
- What did you tell them?
- To go fuck themselves.

209
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,107
They want Guillermo, not you.

210
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,128
- Can't talk. Discuss it later.
- That's her.

211
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,029
They talked about reward.

212
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,701
So, she used the line

213
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,079
in an apartment
in the north part of the city.

214
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,374
We need to take advantage.

215
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,087
Need to use the bathroom.

216
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,562
Work again?

217
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,646
Yes.

218
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,065
Excuse me.

219
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,400
Excuse me.

220
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,819
Open the window this time.

221
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
This way.

222
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:03,613
I'd offer a drink,
but I don't pour liquor for Cali whores.

223
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,453
Have a seat.

224
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,422
Don Orlando,
I'm here to ask for your protection.

225
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,008
Why?

226
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,469
You don't feel safe?

227
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,976
I did what I had to after my husband died.

228
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:39,066
Now I'm in your home...
ready to do what I have to again.

229
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,198
So what is it you're offering me?

230
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,415
In here.

231
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,043
How was the drive?

232
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
It was easy.

233
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,047
Nice place.

234
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,978
Let me start by thanking you
for the meeting.

235
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,232
We're both busy men.
I won't waste your time.

236
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,568
But I'm a business man, like you.

237
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:30,325
The information you seek maybe,
maybe, maybe is in my possession.

238
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,664
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

239
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,040
You feel me?

240
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,505
On the phone,
you told me you know where Pallomari is.

241
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,297
Correct?

242
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,053
Look, let me put it this way...

243
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,932
Patricia and I are in love.

244
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,184
We want to be together.

245
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,440
So Guillermo's a problem for me.

246
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:09,531
From what I've heard,
he's a problem for you too. Am I right?

247
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,075
You are correct.

248
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,332
So maybe we can help each other.

249
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,669
If we come to an arrangement,
my information becomes yours.

250
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:29,925
Okay.

251
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,679
Okay.

252
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,018
- Let me fix you a drink. Okay?
- Sure.

253
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,606
By the way...
are you guys running Windows 95 yet?

254
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,816
Think we're going to wait for next year.

255
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,945
Where the fuck is Pallomari, you faggot?

256
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,239
Did you hear me?

257
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,048
Here's the milk.
Just a few minutes and then you go to bed.

258
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,015
- Get in your room.
- Who is it? Who is it?

259
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,975
I don't know. Get in your room. Quickly.

260
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
- Drop the gun! Put it down!
- Drop your weapon!

261
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,004
- It's okay.
- They're the gringos.

262
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,696
- Calm down.
- Do you know them?

263
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,865
- They came to my office.
- Put the gun down.

264
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:34,783
Close the door.

265
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,284
We're here to help you.

266
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,162
Close the door.

267
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,456
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,460
Lower your gun. You understand?

269
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,673
I'd put the safety on.

270
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,215
Sorry.

271
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,385
Do you want to sit?

272
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,952
Okay, DEA, are we speaking English
or Spanish or...? I don't give a shit.

273
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,704
Colombians have a warrant
for your arrest.

274
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,789
- I know.
- And the cartel wants you dead.

275
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,374
I'm well aware of that.

276
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,715
The only way you survive this
is if we get you out to the United States.

277
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,175
Guillermo.

278
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,220
The United States.

279
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,513
We have your ledger.

280
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:47,731
You decode it for us
and you testify on what you know...

281
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,024
That's quite a bit.

282
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,110
and we make sure
that you and your family are safe.

283
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,992
- Which place in the United States?
- I'm not sure. We have a program that...

284
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,161
Yeah, I know. The program.

285
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,163
But if I'm giving up my life...

286
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,584
I want to know what I'm getting for it.

287
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,254
For instance,
which kind of house will we have?

288
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,924
My family requires
a certain amount of square footage.

289
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,552
It wasn't hard for us to find you
and it won't be hard for them.

290
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,635
You understand that?

291
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:23,933
This is your chance
to keep your family alive.

292
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,313
We will negotiate the details later.

293
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:31,900
This is the only option you have.
Do you understand that?

294
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,404
- Yeah.
- Okay.

295
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,740
Why don't you pack your things,
as little as possible.

296
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,618
No, Guillermo.
We can't leave for at least a week.

297
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,829
- You heard them.
- The company. I can't just leave.

298
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,581
- We must go.
- I need at least a week.

299
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,041
Okay!

300
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:59,094
Put the radio on the dash...
and your hands on the wheel.

301
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,490
How are you, Jorge Salcedo?

302
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,790
Help your kids pack,
let me talk to your wife.

303
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,418
Yeah.

304
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,510
I know about Fredy Moya.
It's none of my business.

305
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,033
You're right. It's not your problem.

306
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,264
You realize what happens if they find you?

307
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,100
And your kids?

308
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,274
I have to say goodbye to him.

309
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,110
We're in love. I can't leave like that.

310
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,238
Mrs. Pallomari, if you stay, you die.

311
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,698
Understood?

312
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,618
I'll be honest with you.

313
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,787
The truth is...

314
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:12,709
I was very disappointed to hear
you were the fucking rat.

315
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,006
But I still like you.

316
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,511
It's all good. I'm not going to kill you.

317
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,808
David RodrÃ­guez...

318
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,937
he wants to do it himself personally,
you know?

319
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,775
That's fine by me.

320
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,654
That way,
our friendship will remain intact.

321
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,363
- Let's go.
- Come on!

322
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,881
- The jacket...
- Okay, that's it. Let's go.

323
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,549
We're on our way down.

324
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,155
Salcedo, we're in the lobby now.

325
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,740
Are we clear?

326
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,993
Salcedo.

327
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,497
Tell them to come out.

328
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,566
Jorge, we clear or not?

329
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,550
Tell them to come out, Jorge Salcedo.

330
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,514
All clear.

331
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,268
Copy.

332
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,687
All right, stay close.

333
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,163
Let's finish this.

334
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,712
Put the gun down.

335
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,966
I don't want to kill you.

336
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,763
We both know that's a lie.

337
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,854
Get down! Get behind the car!

338
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,105
Over there!

339
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,494
What the fuck happened?

340
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,789
He has the keys.

341
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,626
- Let's move!
- Come on, get in the car!

342
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,085
Let's go!

343
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,022
- Drive.
- Patricia!

344
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:07,008
Don't look!
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!

345
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,553
Don't look! Don't look at that!

346
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,805
What the fuck is he doing here?

347
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,683
He saved your life!
Get in the fucking car!

348
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,226
Open! Open!

349
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,689
Be careful, be careful. Okay.

350
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,333
Move, move, move!

351
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,581
What happened? Huh?

352
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,334
They killed Navegante.

353
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,879
And Pallomari?

354
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,965
The motherfucker's gone.

355
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,092
You sure?

356
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,641
We're going to the airport.
We're going to catch those...

357
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,476
We're leaving, now!

358
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,811
Motherfuckers!

359
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,401
You, come with me.

360
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,698
We're going to the airport.
Take the guys. Now, now, now!

361
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,041
That's the North Valley, fuckers.

362
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,168
Who do they think they're messing with?

363
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,713
You just got smoked, bitches.

364
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,595
Boss!

365
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,307
Boss!

366
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,866
Let's go. Out.

367
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,493
- Could you open, please?
- Yes.

368
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,203
- There you go.
- Thank you.

369
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,249
Patricia, get out this way.
Careful, my love.

370
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,375
Okay.

371
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,170
What's this?

372
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,880
You're wanted by the CNP.

373
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,842
We can't aid the escape of a fugitive,
so you've gotta fly yourself out.

374
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,095
Do you see that? We have a private plane.

375
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,431
We have a plane just for us.

376
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,141
If you could sign here, sir?

377
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,684
Me? Okay.

378
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,769
Yeah.

379
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,230
You have to pay for the plane.
Whatever you have on you.

380
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,901
I don't carry that kind of cash.

381
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,571
It's just a technicality.
So that it's not kidnapping.

382
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:34,864
Just a moment.

383
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,783
If it's just a technicality...

384
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,701
Thanks.

385
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,913
- Okay.
- Okay.

386
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,957
Get on the plane. Go.
Everything is going to be fine.

387
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,918
Come on. Let's go.

388
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,841
Goodbye, Salcedo.

389
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,209
Ladies and gentlemen, my next
witness has direct, first-hand knowledge

390
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,046
of the criminal activities
uncovered by Operation Cornerstone.

391
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,507
Please state your name, sir.

392
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,343
Guillermo Pallomari.

393
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,679
And you were an accountant
for the Cali cartel?

394
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,390
No, I was the chief accountant. The chief.

395
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,432
El jefe.

396
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,852
Guillermo Pallomari had a lot to say.

397
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,938
And he said it in federal courtrooms
from Miami to New York City.

398
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,400
This is the ledger of Mr. Pallomaro
that only he himself can interpret.

399
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,696
I'm sorry, Your Honor, my English is not
quite good, but his Spanish is awful.

400
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,240
Can you repeat my name?
"Pallomari." It's so simple.

401
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,909
And people were
interested in what he had to say,

402
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,246
especially about the cartel's influence
with the Colombian government.

403
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,373
So that government went on the defensive.

404
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,751
And we have total agreement
in that these testimonies

405
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:16,382
that we have heard from Mr. Pallomari
are ridiculous and grotesquely false.

406
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,944
- Thank you very much.
- The damage was done.

407
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:23,097
It would be most helpful if the Colombian
president, who's head of the government

408
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,350
was as dedicated to fighting narcotics
trafficking as many of the people

409
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,310
in his own government.

410
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,771
The U.S. House and Senate
began making noise about decertification,

411
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:35,109
turning Colombia from an ally
in The War on Drugs into an enemy,

412
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,153
threatening to choke off
the vital foreign aid

413
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,906
that served the shadowy interests
of both nations.

414
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,200
And that scared people.

415
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,160
Enough to see justice finally done?

416
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,496
Well, governments don't work that way.

417
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,420
Know how many times I've gotten a call

418
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,043
from the Department of Justice
and State the same morning?

419
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,546
Count 'em on one finger.

420
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,840
Guess we have you to thank for that.

421
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,385
I'm headed over
to the National Palace right now,

422
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:07,141
to make clear to President Samper himself
that the godfathers stay in jail.

423
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,270
- At least for the foreseeable future.
- But that's as far as it goes?

424
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,859
We drew up a draft indictment outlining.

425
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,903
President Samper's ties
to the Cali cartel.

426
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,321
Alleged ties.

427
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,283
And I suggest you keep that draft
to yourself.

428
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,454
The DOJ's not going to topple
a government, Agent PeÃ±a.

429
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,179
You can't tell me
you're surprised by that.

430
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,382
Some part of me
was holding out hope, I guess.

431
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,052
Well, you should tell that part
to grow the fuck up.

432
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,807
No, I mean it, Agent PeÃ±a.
You should be happy.

433
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,976
You played the system
like a goddamn fiddle.

434
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,815
You won.

435
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,032
Yes, sir.

436
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,586
Another deal.

437
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,215
A compromise.

438
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,760
A charade.

439
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,181
A way for governments
who don't give a shit

440
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,559
about the war they're supposed
to be fighting...

441
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,187
to go on pretending they're winning it.

442
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,732
But it can't be won.

443
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,902
It'll never be won.

444
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,657
At least not until people see it
for what it is.

445
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,746
Not until they know the truth.

446
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,402
You know what it means
if you go on the record, right?

447
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,863
There'll be a price to pay.

448
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,493
Press the button.

449
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,249
Let's start with your name and occupation.

450
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,842
Javier PeÃ±a, DEA attachÃ© in Colombia.

451
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,556
And so the truth got out.

452
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,727
The news that the Cali cartel had donated
to the president's campaign...

453
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,980
in exchange for virtual immunity...

454
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,650
turned Colombia upside down.

455
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:08,531
And when the highest-ranking DEA agent
in the country went on the record

456
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,659
and said not only did
the United States know about it,

457
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,494
but we allowed it to happen...

458
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,705
they couldn't hide from it anymore.

459
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,666
An exclusive interview.

460
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,919
He accuses the country
of being a Narco-Democracy.

461
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,088
He said the country
has fallen into the abyss.

462
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,716
His words have not been well received
by the Colombian people.

463
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,679
The public is demanding
an official response from...

464
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,869
You didn't really call
the country that we're guests in

465
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,485
a "Narco-Democracy."

466
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,695
Are you saying it isn't?

467
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,156
- The State Department's livid.
- Good.

468
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,450
They're responsible. We all are.

469
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,202
Samper is not going anywhere.

470
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,207
Well, at least people know the truth.

471
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,384
I want you gone, PeÃ±a.
So do the Colombians.

472
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,886
I understand, sir.

473
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:24,523
You know...
any aspirations you had for your career...

474
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,694
just got dragged behind the barn and shot.

475
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,784
I resigned from the DEA this morning.

476
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,008
Recordings that link the president

477
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,344
with narcotrafficking have been leaked.

478
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,471
The reality is
they need five million.

479
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,848
- Uh-huh.
- We're missing three, see?

480
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,850
- We have it.
- Yes?

481
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,352
Yes, that's done.

482
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,563
This scandal threatens elected president
Ernesto Samper's career

483
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,317
if the authorities confirm his campaign
was funded by narcotrafficking money.

484
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,279
President Samper,
the only solution is your resignation!

485
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,408
Colombians can be certain...

486
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:25,876
that if they prove
any money transfer of any kind,

487
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,006
the deposit would've been made
behind my back.

488
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:36,345
The Colombians
called the scandal "Proceso 8000."

489
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,140
And it set into motion
a series of events...

490
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:44,103
that finally brought the reign
of the Cali godfathers to an end.

491
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:50,317
Chepe Santacruz
never did make it back to New York.

492
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,905
Without the government's guarantee
that their sentences would be minimal...

493
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,535
Chepe decided that prison
wasn't the best place for him to be.

494
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,956
And so... he released himself...

495
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,294
and set out in search of new alliances,

496
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,130
with partners who could help him
rebuild the empire.

497
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,299
You won't believe who he chose.

498
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,927
Don Chepe.

499
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,764
I was happy to get your call.

500
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,993
Predictably,
it wasn't much of a partnership.

501
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:29,356
It seems the CastaÃ±os expected
a larger contribution to their cause...

502
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,777
than Chepe was comfortable making.

503
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,573
So the alliance died quickly.

504
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,077
And Chepe Santacruz's wild ride...
came to an end.

505
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,541
Pacho Herrera didn't fare much better
staying in jail.

506
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,127
Vendettas in the drug game never end.

507
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,422
And Pacho's war on the Salazars...

508
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,634
made him some lifelong
North Valley enemies.

509
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,098
Motherfucker!

510
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,229
And as for
the RodrÃ­guez-Orejuela brothers,

511
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,233
political pressure from the U.S.,
and a disgraced Colombian president

512
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,944
who needed to prove
he was tough on narcos...

513
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:22,117
brought back the only effective weapon
we have in The War on Drugs: extradition.

514
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,707
All out of favors
and unlikely to find more,

515
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,044
they will spend the rest of their lives
in a U.S. prison.

516
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,296
The good guys didn't do much better.

517
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,631
BETRAYAL PAYS

518
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:39,426
Back in Colombia,
Jorge Salcedo was publicly branded a rat.

519
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,846
The danger that he put himself in
to ensure the success of our operation...

520
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,766
And in the States, despite testimony

521
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,896
that he was instrumental to our efforts to
capture and prosecute the Cali godfathers,

522
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:54,233
he still had to plead guilty
to felony conspiracy charges.

523
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,404
And from there, Jorge Salcedo...

524
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,200
the guy who had the most to do
with bringing down the Cali cartel...

525
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,745
disappeared into
the Federal Witness Protection Program...

526
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,289
somewhere in the U.S.

527
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,085
A prison of its own.

528
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,688
You knew him, right?

529
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,481
Agent Camarena?

530
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,026
Of him.
My first assignment out of the academy

531
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,904
was a task force that searched for him
in Guadalajara.

532
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,323
It all started there.

533
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,868
Before him,
we didn't even know we were in a war.

534
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,705
Another hot one down there for you, huh?

535
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,957
You took down the big players in Colombia.

536
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,544
Yeah, well... we'll make new ones.

537
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,881
Don't turn a victory into a defeat,
Javier.

538
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,841
The Colombian super-cartels are gone.

539
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,470
And whoever comes next are gonna be
fighting amongst themselves for years.

540
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,473
They're still only going to be a shadow
of what MedellÃ­n and Cali were.

541
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,435
And now it's time to take the fight
to the real enemy in The War on Drugs.

542
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,687
Mexico.

543
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,065
"The real enemy"?

544
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,692
Let me put in some calls.

545
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,611
I'll make
this bullshit resignation go away.

546
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,617
What else is a guy like you gonna do?

547
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,193
All right, fellas. Let's move.
Keep going.

548
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,593
Keep going.

549
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,908
You helping me with this or not?

550
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,828
I thought I was getting a partner.

551
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,454
Come on, Pop. Give me that.

552
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,123
Stubborn.

553
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,714
Stand here for an hour
and you'll count 20 of 'em going by.

554
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,674
So...

555
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,595
do you have to fix the fence
every time a storm hits?

556
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,098
Someone has to do it.

557
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,392
That's how life works.

558
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,526
You thinking of taking them up on it?

559
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,986
Mexico.

560
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,990
It's different there.

561
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,118
- Son, let me tell you...
- Dad.

562
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,872
I've done enough.

563
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,084
I'm through.

564
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:50,886
Hand me that cutter.
