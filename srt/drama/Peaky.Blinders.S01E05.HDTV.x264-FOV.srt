1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,280
They will keep asking me questions
(that) I don't know the answer to

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,740
It's us that have the machine guns
now and it's them that's in the mud

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,700
Guns, Mr Shelby.
We'd pay good money.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,020
For who do you speak?

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
The Irish Republican Army.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,040
What are you? Copper?

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,020
You went after him
because he was IRA.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,780
I followed him because I thought
he might have information.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,440
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,100
Your sister's in there giving birth.
There's one man who should be here.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,140
You are right, Poll. On my oath.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,120
Tell Freddie it's safe.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,120
Welcome to the world, son.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,420
Freddie.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,380
Pol!

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,620
The police came
and took his father away.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,800
You liar!

18

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,220
I've got some fresh eggs and
bread...

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,480
I'll leave it here.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,960
Ada, think of the little one.

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,360
Babies don't have principles.

33
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,100
Did you speak to her?

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
She didn't speak back.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,060
Well, did you tell her?

36
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll only tell her what
I know to be true.

37
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,380
It's the last time
I am going to say this.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,520
It wasn't me
who shopped Freddie Thorne.

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,260
Tommy...

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,100
I'd ask you to swear on the Bible,

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,160
but you can't swear on that,
can you?

42
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
Nothing you hold is sacred.

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,600
There's tea.

44
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,760
The new system...

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,940
..everything in the diary, eh?

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Mm-hm.

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,140
A black star? What does that
mean?

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,040
The black star day...

49
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,580
..is the day we
take out Billy Kimber and his men.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,640
No-one knows this!

51
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,080
Not even your family?

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Grace...

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,560
..everyone in my family
hates me. Why would I tell them?

54
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,420
He's off the bloody rails,
is what he is.

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,660
If he'll turn nose on his
best mate...

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,620
Bloody neighbours, John.
Snitch behind the curtain.

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,700
If you think that,
you're the only one who does.

58
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,340
Look at this, look.
Bloody raking it in.

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,660
Who's running this carny?

60
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,780
Name of Marston. Intends on wintering
in Smallheath with this ring.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,540
Does he! Ain't he heard nobody in
Smallheath craps in a pot

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,140
without the decree of
Tommy Almighty?

63
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,820
Mr Marston, I believe?
The ringmaster?

64
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,980
Proud I am to say so.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,260
Yes, well,
these here are civilised parts.

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,180
Man wants to set his stall up with
fellas lamping each other,

67
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,420
he needs himself a licence.

68
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,560
A licence.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,360
For a fee. From those in charge.

70
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,780
I'll tell you what.

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,900
How about I keep my money, and you
shove a licence up your arsecrack?

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,540
You don't want to speak to me
like that.

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,700
And who the bloody hell do
you think you are?

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,400
My name is Arthur Shelby.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
Dad?

76
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
Jesus.

77
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Thank you. You are a good boy.

78
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,180
Bless you, Father, for these
bounties we are about to receive...

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,420
Jesus Christ...

80
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Please, woman...

81
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,620
..not in vain.

82
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,400
Finish your sandwich
and sling your hook.

83
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,540
Pollyanna.

84
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,060
I'm the guest of the head
of this family,

85
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,300
so why don't you tend
to your mangle or your scuttle?

86
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
The head of the family ain't here.

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Tommy...he sometimes helps me
with business.

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Ah. Well. Speak of the devil.

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
How are you, son?

90
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Get out.

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Come on, son. I'm a changed man.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,720
This family needed you ten years ago
when you walked out on it.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,180
Not now. Get out of this house.

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,580
Tommy, he's different...

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
You shut up.

96
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
It's all right, son.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,680
Arthur Shelby never stays where
he is not welcome.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Quite something you've become.

99
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Bye, son.

100
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,240
He's our dad.

101
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
He's a selfish bastard.

102
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,800
You calling someone a selfish
bastard?

103
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,700
That's a bit rich, Tommy.

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,260
I mean, thanks to you...

105
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,500
..we're already down a bloody
sister.

106
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,380
If you want to see him, Arthur...

107
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,560
You want to see him?
You can go with him.

108
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,980
Grace...

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,100
I am taking five pounds
from petty cash all right?

110
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,020
We don't have five pounds in
petty cash.

111
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,900
Then I'll take what we've got.

112
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,480
Count it and leave a receipt.

113
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,100
Arthur, there are some things in the
books that I don't understand.

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,700
Likewise. Every week we pay
one pound and ten shillings

115
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,700
by postal order to a "Daniel Owen"
in London.

116
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,780
Danny Whizz Bang, hangs round the
pubs in Camden Town Wharf for us.

117
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,060
He keeps his ears open for business.

118
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,340
He's a good man.

119
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,980
I thought Danny Whizz Bang was dead.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,980
Then you thought wrong, didn't you?

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,700
But I've seen his grave.
He was shot.

122
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,620
That was a show to satisfy the wops.

123
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,760
Tommy just shot some
sheep's brains at him.

124
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Who is buried in his grave?

125
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,620
Now look, Grace, if you know what's
good for you,

126
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,420
you don't ask questions about things
that don't concern you.

127
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,620
Never. Right!

128
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,280
And that's for you.

129
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
And don't tell Tommy I took this.

130
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,700
The boy needs a hiding,
if you ask me.

131
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,660
Yeah, well, Aunt Polly's close to
giving him one.

132
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,700
John and Ada too, it sounds like.

133
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,640
John moans on bloody principle -
but if you saw his Mrs...

134
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
You have a girl yourself, son?

135
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,880
P'raps when it suits Tommy, eh?

136
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,140
Yeah, well...

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,180
..he's been different, you know,
since the war.

138
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,540
Yeah, well...

139
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,340
the war can change a man.

140
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,020
Speaking for myself, anyway.

141
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,460
Where did you fight, Dad?

142
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,660
All over, son, all over.

143
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,060
Yeah, all over.

144
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,860
Then the salvation of Jesus Christ
spread his light over me,

145
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,220
and, as a pilgrim,
I come to visit the New World...

146
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,500
America.

147
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,200
..where I beheld the future.

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,380
Casinos!
Money factories, son.

149
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,580
Look, I've been studying
the competition,

150
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,980
their schemes, their systems.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,220
Look at that...
Show me.

152
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,520
It's all there.
There's a fortune to be made here.

153
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm an old man, and my heart's a
battered vessel. But within...

154
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,400
..there still beats the
fluttering pulse of a dream...

155
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,520
The Shelby Casino and Hotel...

156
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,140
Gents and dames will come
flocking from all corners -

157
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,540
New York, Chicago, Boston -

158
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,940
to The Shelby, where I can stand
proudly

159
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,300
with my dear children by my side.

160
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
And the women there!

161
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,180
Like fresh peaches.

162
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,520
Thou could have a dozen.

163
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,060
We'd all of us be kings!

164
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,960
How much, how much to get started?

165
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
The oak needs but an acorn.

166
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,980
Let's do it.

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,020
Let's do it.
Let's bloody do it.

168
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,860
It would make my heart beam...

169
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,900
but I don't want to cause
any discord between the brothers.

170
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,940
So, please, why don't you talk to
Tommy first...?

171
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,700
I'm sick of taking orders from him.

172
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,660
Tommy's not the only one in the
family with a head for business,

173
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,820
and Shelby money is Shelby money.

174
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,960
I thank God for my wonderful sons.

175
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,500
This is cause for a celebration!

176
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,240
Yeah. Slange. Slange.

177
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
On your feet, soldier!

178
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
On your feet.

179
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,100
Dad, I don't want to fight you, Dad.

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,700
Come on, boy!
I'm old enough to be thy father.

181
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,760
Hit him! Hit him! That's it! Hit him!

182
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,860
On your feet.

183
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,260
Get up.

184
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,960
All right!

185
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
That's it!

186
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,400
Is that all you've got, boy?

187
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,440
Get up.

188
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
This here is Arthur Shelby Junior!
My son.

189
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,900
I love him, and I'm proud of him,

190
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,760
and he can fight
any one of yous in here.

191
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,380
You did good, son. You did good.

192
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,640
I love you, Dad. I love you.

193
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Mr Shelby?

194
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,560
Who's asking?

195
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,960
My name is Byrne.

196
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,480
I had word from your man in Camden
Town that you wanted to parley.

197
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Then parley it is.

198
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,220
A few months ago a man named Ryan
came to this place with

199
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,780
a view to buying some
goods from you.

200
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,580
Mr Ryan met with an accident.
He was shot.

201
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,740
I heard... He was a man with a
quick mouth. I know that.

202
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,420
I wondered
if he had made any enemies in here.

203
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,500
None that I know of.

204
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,340
It's not the kind of place
to make enemies.

205
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,940
All are welcome here, Mr Byrne...

206
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,500
Including Irish?

207
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,600
Especially Irish.

208
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,340
Ryan told you he was a member
of the Irish Republican Army.

209
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,280
Was he still welcome?

210
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,620
Like I say,
any man that buys beer is welcome.

211
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Perhaps you didn't believe him.

212
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,140
In pubs sometimes people say things

213
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,180
and sometimes it's
the whisky talking.

214
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,040
It's hard to tell which is which.

215
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,740
As a teetotal man I find it amusing.

216
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,260
Except when it ends in tragedy.

217
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,420
Would you like some cordial
and water, Mr Byrne?

218
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,140
You see, Mr Shelby, Ryan,
for all his quick mouth,

219
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,520
was indeed connected.

220
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,100
Very well connected...to our
brotherhood.

221
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,960
By membership and blood.
He was my cousin.

222
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,160
I am from South Armagh.

223
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
I am a man of influence there.

224
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Cordial and water would be grand,
Mr Shelby.

225
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,780
Grace. Bring some water
and cordial to the snug.

226
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes, Mr Shelby.

227
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,380
My cousin came to buy guns.

228
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
And I told him I had none.

229
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,720
Your man Danny Owen talks a lot
when he's drunk.

230
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,780
He says the Peaky Blinders
do have the guns.

231
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,740
Robbed from the factory
down the road.

232
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,740
He boasts about a stack of
Lewis machine guns.

233
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,460
And enough belts of ammunition to
hold up God's trousers.

234
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,300
Yep. That sounds like our Danny.

235
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,560
He has an imagination.

236
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,000
Like I said, sometimes it's the
whisky that does the talking.

237
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,780
He says only the brothers
know where the guns are kept.

238
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,820
Well, Danny also says he sees
German infantrymen on the backs

239
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,320
of milk carts. And he shoots them
with his broomstick.

240
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
We have men in the BSA factory.

241
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,620
They say it's you who has them.

242
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
And we have men who
work in the police station.

243
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,660
Every finger, Mr Shelby,
every finger in this city,

244
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,880
points in one direction.

245
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
Please don't mistake me for a fool.

246
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,300
Let me get to the point.

247
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,700
I don't care what kind of
half-arsed tinker operation

248
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,980
you have going here.

249
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,580
But I can assure you,

250
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,080
I represent a very different
category of organization.

251
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,200
My cousin was shot.

252
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,720
I am judge, jury and executioner.

253
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I find you guilty
and I pass sentence.

254
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,340
You deliver the guns to me

255
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,940
or I deliver death and hell's fury

256
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,720
to you and your little tribe of
heathens.

257
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
Am I making myself clear?

258
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,460
Let me confess something to you.

259
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,000
And only to you.

260
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,420
I have the guns...

261
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
..but they have become
a burden to me.

262
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,680
Perhaps it is time
to unload that burden.

263
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,200
For the right price.

264
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Malachi Byrne.

265
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
Brigade commander of
the South Armagh IRA.

266
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,820
You've hooked yourself
a big fish there.

267
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,940
With these guns as bait who knows
what we'll catch?

268
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,980
'We'?

269
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,860
Are you suggesting that you and I
could work together as a team?

270
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Perhaps we have more in common than
you think, Inspector.

271
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,660
Can you deliver him?

272
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,420
With your help.

273
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,600
And I want word put out in Ireland
that I was not involved.

274
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,180
So, I would be solving
a problem for you.

275
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
And I would be winning you
that medal.

276
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,800
If I get a medal I will have your
initials engraved on the backside.

277
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,120
My initials on your backside.
Now, that's quite an image.

278
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,020
Inspector, since we are getting
along so well,

279
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,000
can you answer me a question?

280
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,640
Who gave you Freddie Thorne?

281
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,600
As everyone in the city knows.

282
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
It was you, Mr Shelby.

283
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,280
MUSIC: "Ball and Biscuit" by
The White Stripes

284
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
Hello, son.

285
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
It's all there.

286
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,680
It is indeed.

287
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,900
We're going to build something with
this, son. Something magnificent.

288
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,340
When do we sail, Dad?

289
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,540
Hungry for work, are you?
Yeah.

290
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,020
A ship sails Friday.
Meet me at the boxing ring.

291
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,740
Right. Friday.

292
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,840
Friday.

293
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,240
Leave that open.

294
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,100
No.

295
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,300
Are you expecting trouble?
Yeah.

296
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,860
At this hour?
Midnight is as good an hour as any.

297
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,260
What the hell is going on?

298
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,060
When the St Andrew's bell strikes
midnight,

299
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,700
two IRA men are going to come
through that door.

300
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,140
When they have what they want,
they plan to kill me.

301
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,980
It's your job to stop that
happening.

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,700
You could have given me
some warning.

303
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,780
I just got the message myself.

304
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,060
They want to meet me here alone.

305
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,940
And barmaids don't count?
No. Barmaids don't count.

306
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,900
Now, you're going to be in the
back room.

307
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,700
I am going to be sitting there.

308
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,780
When I make a toast, you're going to
come out with that thing raised.

309
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,560
You don't shoot, you just point,
I'll do the rest.

310
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,980
Will you kill them?

311
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,980
No, the police want them alive...
The police know about this?

312
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,020
Look, you just hold it up

313
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,560
and you just point. Right?

314
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Right, go, go. Go on, go.

315
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,380
We'll hold back here.

316
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,160
If damage is done to either side,
it's no concern of ours.

317
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
Lost your thirst, eh?

318
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,040
Just show us where.

319
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,960
Give me the cash.

320
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,080
You're going to need a shovel.

321
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,820
You thick fucking tinker.

322
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,600
Did you think we'd let you live?

323
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,560
Make your peace, Mr Shelby.

324
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,680
I will make my peace my own way.

325
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,800
To barmaids who don't count...

326
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,160
Why did you shoot?

327
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,740
Why did you shoot, Grace?

328
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I didn't know I had it
in me like that.

329
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,840
So, now you've seen me.

330
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,400
And you've seen me...

331
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,480
..and I'm sorry.

332
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,940
You were supposed to come
on the sixth chime.

333
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
You were supposed to come
on the fucking sixth chime.

334
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,720
They refused to surrender.

335
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
They fought well.
They were brave men.

336
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,720
Well, he looks like he was
killed by a wild fucking animal.

337
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,140
Still...

338
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,260
This never happened and they were
never here, who cares?

339
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,460
Will you get the bodies out of here.

340
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,400
All right, are they...? Are they
making the lady uncomfortable?

341
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,960
I'll leave you
two love birds to it then, eh?

342
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Thank you.

343
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,980
First of all, let me
say I had no idea he would

345
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,580
involve you in this ugly business.

346
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,660
If I had,
I never would have let it happen.

347
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,940
He trusts me. I told you that.

348
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,200
You didn't believe me.

349
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,060
Sergeant Moss made a report.
Which, of course, I have burnt.

350
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,280
He said that when he entered
the room, you were embracing.

351
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,560
Is that your primary concern?
An embrace?

352
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,140
My...my concern is your welfare.

353
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,560
It was me who killed them.

354
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,120
I had no control.

355
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,160
You have been living with beasts.

356
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,960
It was the beast that
tried to stop me.

357
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,240
I believe last night
something inside me changed.

358
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,700
I no longer feel
the need to avenge my father.

359
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,080
The hatred that I brought with me
here has gone.

360
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,220
And therefore my reasons for joining
the service.

361
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,320
You want to resign?

362
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,440
I think our mission has come
to a natural end.

363
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,980
I think I know where the
guns are hidden.

364
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,980
You do? So? Tell me where.

365
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,540
If I am right,
and the guns are found,

366
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,700
you will have no more business
with Thomas Shelby.

367
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,580
Is that not so?
Our military mission will be over.

368
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
And we can leave
the city as we found it.

369
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,940
Are you trying to...
do a deal with me?

370
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,420
Because if you are,
you must be explicit.

371
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,260
I want your word that
Thomas Shelby will not be harmed

372
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,020
if the guns are recovered.

373
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,360
Your word as a gentleman.

374
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,860
Will you give it?

375
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,400
Why...would you want to save him?

376
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,020
A residue of sympathy.

377
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,720
Sympathy? You mean sentiment?

378
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,420
Yes.

379
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
In his way, he has been kind to me.

380
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,660
Sentiment.

381
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,520
Yes.

382
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
You are too
good-hearted for this work.

383
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,160
Perhaps.

384
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,800
So, for my sake,
will you spare him?

385
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,360
You have my word.

386
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,300
A week after the robbery there was a
burial at St Andrews' churchyard.

387
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I have found out the man supposed
to be buried is alive.

388
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,060
Arthur is quite transparent.

389
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,500
I learned that the funeral was
attended only by the brothers.

390
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,580
And the grave that was dug was
far deeper than your average

391
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,880
and was lined with lead...

392
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,160
..to keep out the damp.

393
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,680
The guns are buried in that grave.

394
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
Then, tonight,
we will dig up the grave.

414
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,320
Good.

415
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,580
So, I am no longer your
superior officer and

416
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,040
you are no longer my subordinate.

417
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,640
And therefore...

418
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,880
..regulations permit me...

419
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
to offer you this.

420
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,360
I am...I am a simple man,
but a good man.

421
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,680
And my admiration for you...

422
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,440
..has turned to love.

423
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,320
I don't ask for love in return.
Just...

424
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,440
..recognition that we are
like minds...

425
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,160
..with shared values.

426
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Grace...

427
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
..will you marry me?

428
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Mr Campbell...

429
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,520
..you deserve better.

430
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,400
Is it him between us?

431
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,360
Is it the beast that dug that grave?
Is it him?

432
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,720
My resignation will be with
you in the morning...

433
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Dad!

434
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,740
Hullo, son.
May I ask who gave my whereabouts?

435
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,460
Marston.

436
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,820
Said you left him last night with
a bill for your whores.

437
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,020
Well, at least
we got to say goodbye, son.

438
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,480
And bid a fond adieu to your
dear brothers, would you?

439
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,020
How...how could you do this to us?

440
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,100
Do what, son?

441
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,480
All that stuff you said
about...the Shelby Casino...

442
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,380
..and Atlantic City.

443
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,940
Well, if the truth be told,
I've not been

444
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,120
so acquainted with that promised
land as I had thee believe.

445
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,380
You're a fucking liar and a thief.

446
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
You give me back my fucking money.

447
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,060
"Do not despise the thief,
if he steals to

448
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
"satisfy his starvation"

449
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,360
That's in the Holy Bible, son.

450
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,120
And I've starved for so very long.

451
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,200
Fare thee well, son.

452
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,120
I waited for you.

453
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,800
I waited.

454
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,500
Listen to me, boy.
You are not in the prize ring now.

455
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,940
If you ever put your hands on me
again,

456
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,320
I'll cut your fucking throat
and spread you on these tracks.

457
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,400
Where's your father?

458
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm assuming he's busy frittering
the 500 you took from us

459
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,880
and put in his thieving,
whore-groping hands.

460
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,100
What were you thinking?

461
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,880
How dare you do something like that
without talking to Thomas or me?

462
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,720
Does Tommy know?

463
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,840
No. But you're going to tell him.

464
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,860
You might take
satisfaction in a great victory.

465
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,640
A terrible consequence has been
avoided.

466
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,500
'Those guns that we dug up will
never be used to murder the innocent

467
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,860
'or usurp the status quo.

468
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,260
'But, even though we have solved a
crime,

469
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,940
'we have as yet failed to
punish the criminal.'

470
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,220
This man who dug that grave has
also dug his own.

471
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,940
He has proved himself a deadly
menace to the King's peace.

472
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,940
'And tonight we will strike
him down.

473
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,380
'We will drive our swords
through his black heart,

474
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,580
'we will pursue him into the
rat holes that he infests.'

475
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,020
And, finally,
we will rid this city of his kind.

476
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,240
Justice will be done and will be
seen to be done.

477
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
Amen.

478
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,540
There's going to be trouble now,
Finn.

479
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,580
You look after yourself,
do you hear me?

480
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,560
I'm going to be going away for a
while. Right... Go on.

481
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,580
Right... Who wants to fucking fight?

482
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,260
Fighting's over.
We're closing up and moving on.

483
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,940
I said who wants to fucking fight?

484
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,960
My name is Arthur fucking Shelby!

485
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,940
Who dares to fight me?!

486
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,840
Go home, lad. Before you catch
yourself a spanking.

487
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,380
My brother in Digbeth just says
the police are coming down

488
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,500
from Deritend in numbers.

489
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,120
Asking for Tommy Shelby by name.

490
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,480
Shit.

491
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,020
I'm going to have to lie low
for a while. Why?

492
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,500
I lost my bargaining power.

493
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,300
This copper, it's just me
and him now.

494
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,560
When I get back...

495
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,460
..I'll tell you some things.

496
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,980
Harry said the police
are already in Digbeth.

497
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,660
Yeah. You took a chance
coming here, why?

498
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,500
The police are in the lane, Tommy.

499
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Come with me.

500
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,400
I'm looking
for Thomas Shelby.

501
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,000
Never heard of him.

502
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,200
You'll never find him.

503
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,640
Go home.

504
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,400
Perhaps I should ask
the question again.

505
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,240
On your knees.

506
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,520
Now, understand this, barman.

507
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,140
I don't care if you live or die.

508
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,320
I don't know.

509
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,000
He left...

510
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,760
..with the barmaid.

511
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,680
He left with Grace.

512
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,360
I think they were going to
her place.

513
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Call it off.

514
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,740
I don't understand, sir.
We should find the barmaid...

515
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,720
Call it all off!

516
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
All of it!

517
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,840
Get in.

518
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,960
It's not much of a place.

519
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,620
It's all right.

520
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,940
You want tea?

521
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,700
Tea? No.

522
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,460
I have rum...

523
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,420
Actually, tea it is.

524
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,980
You want to impress me?

525
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes. And do you have a biscuit?

526
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,200
No. They attract mice.

527
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,300
People look different at home.

528
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,200
In what way?

529
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Off guard.

530
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,700
Should I be on my guard?

531
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
No, I'm a man who drinks tea.

532
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,280
When the trouble dies down, I'll go.

533
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,040
When will it die down, do you think?

534
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,520
Late, I would say.

535
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,000
So, not until the morning then.

536
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,520
Yes. I'd say I'll be here
till morning.

537
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,740
You have a gramophone?

538
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,860
It's broken.

539
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,120
We could still dance.

540
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Yes. Why not.

541
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
I know you like to be asked
properly.

542
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,720
Grace, can I have this dance?

543
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,520
Are you OK?

544
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,960
I don't hear
the shovels against the wall.

545
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
What shovels?

546
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Will you help me?

547
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,540
Help you with what?

548
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,640
With everything...

549
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,820
..the whole fucking thing.

550
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,820

552
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,760
I've found you.

553
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,280
And you found me.

554
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,680
We'll help each other.
