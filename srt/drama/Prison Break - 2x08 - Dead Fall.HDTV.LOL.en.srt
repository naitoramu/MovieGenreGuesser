1
00:00:00,819 --> 00:00:02,178
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,593 --> 00:00:04,236
I got nothing against you, kid.

3
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:06,866
- What are you doing, man?
- What they do.

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,332
Your pal Manche told me all
about your little treasure hunt

5
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:16,035
for Westmoreland's stash.
We're going to Utah.

6
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:17,674
Fooled you.

7
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:19,452
Hands behind your back.

8
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,840
- Make yourself at home.
- Sure.

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,247
Your father got a call
from the White House.

10
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,350
They withdrew his nomination.
According to them,

11
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,530
his confirmation was
going to be a problem.

12
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,328
My father is not
a suicidal man.

13
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,724
Governor Tancredi,
not part of our plan.

14
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,980
Anyone who knows anything
has got to be dealt with.

15
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:40,752
If someone's a liability,
they go.

16
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:43,902
Tancredi was becoming a liability.
So was his daughter.

17
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,162
Wait, what?

18
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:48,841
Burrows is scheduled
to be released

19
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:52,383
from the Klipton Detention Center in
Kingman, Arizona tomorrow morning.

20
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,383
LJ is out there;
I'm going to get him.

21
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,361
Take care.

22
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:00,943
Charles Westmoreland...

23
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:04,790
God bless you and your
wrinkled old sack.

24
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,690
- It's all here.
- Where's Sucre?

25
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:11,830
Drop the bag.
No one's going anywhere.

26
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:24,713
What the hell are
you doing, man?

27
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:28,742
- Sucre, whatever it is you want...
- I want the money, all of it.

28
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:30,892
What, are you robbing us?

29
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:34,321
The money was never yours to begin with.
This is about business.

30
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:36,770
$5 million worth of business.

31
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,010
So this is how it's
going to go down, huh?

32
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:40,880
After everything.

33
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,823
Once a thief, always a thief.

34
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,123
You just figuring that out?

35
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:49,420
The backpack.

36
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:51,800
Now!

37
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:57,830
Don't do this, buddy.

38
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,101
Yo, take a look
around you, papi.

39
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,491
It's three of us,
it's one of you;

40
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:06,280
you are outnumbered, man,
and we will come after you.

41
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,000
It'll be the last thing you do,
my brother.

42
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:09,583
What, are you going to
shoot at all of us?

43
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:10,493
Probably not.

44
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,693
But I will get two.

45
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,141
Now... which two
is it going to be?

46
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,272
That's what I thought.

47
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:25,441
Adios, amigos.

48
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:35,592
I don't believe this.

49
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,632
We have come all this way
and done all of this work.

50
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,580
Thought you was
compadres, Tattoo?

51
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:47,181
So what are we going
to do now, man?

52
00:02:47,276 --> 00:02:49,350
The police are going
to be here any second.

53
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:53,520
Ain't no way I'm letting that
dunderpate ride off with five... !

54
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,563
It's your choice.

55
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:03,533
It's all right.

56
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:13,723
All right,
I'm going to give you this, and, uh...

57
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,193
you should be able to cut
yourself free in about an hour.

58
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,983
- So what's the plan, man?
- Well, you can do what you want.

59
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:24,820
I let that psychopath
T-Bag loose once.

60
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:26,602
I'm not going to do it again.

61
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:30,200
Make a nice little present for
the police when they get here.

62
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:36,691
Where is he?

63
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:46,270
I don't know, man, look, I got to...
I got to go.

64
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:48,470
Uh, good luck.

65
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,880
They're going to get you.

66
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:21,711
Ms. Tancredi.
I didn't mean to startle you.

67
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,681
What the hell are you
doing in my house?

68
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,711
No reason to be frightened.
I used to work with your father.

69
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,881
I'm so sorry for your loss.

70
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,390
My father didn't
commit suicide.

71
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:46,072
What are you doing?

72
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,270
Making sure it doesn't
look like I did!

73
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,201
People will ask questions if the day
the governor was found killing himself,

74
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:54,081
his daughter is found dead in
what looks like a struggle.

75
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:57,352
Well, then.

76
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,563
What if they don't find her?

77
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:04,172
In an apparent attempt
to avoid jail time,

78
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:07,841
the governor's daughter
skips bail and disappears.

79
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,162
We're talking about your last minutes,
Ms. Tancredi.

80
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:12,431
Please don't do this.

81
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:15,161
That stuff on that table is premium.
It's grade "A."

82
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,201
Do yourself a favor,
go out on a high.

83
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,401
- Look, I'm begging you here.
- One last ride.

84
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,892
Oh, God!

85
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:26,231
Adios, amigos, huh?

86
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,721
- What? Too much?
- You were great.

87
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,411
This thing is
freaking heavy, dude.

88
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:44,170
Won't be so bad
after we split it up.

89
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,610
- Three ways: me, you and Linc.
- Four.

90
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:49,483
We're going to send a share
to Charles's daughter,

91
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:52,003
with her father's love,
just like we promised.

92
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,151
What about C-Note? I feel kind
of bad about the whole thing.

93
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:56,763
There's no way to know
if we could trust him.

94
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:59,442
Once we get down to Panama,
we'll send something up to his family,

95
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:01,153
make sure he's taken care of.

96
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,680
Five million dollars.

97
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,673
I can't believe
I'm going to be...

98
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:11,282
Where the hell is the money?

99
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,531
Where the hell is the money?

100
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,292
The backpack... now!

101
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,922
Mr. Burrows?
Merry Christmas from the state.

102
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,230
Here's a list of options
available to you.

103
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:02,252
Places to stay,
businesses that are

104
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:05,141
more open to hiring men out
of the correctional system.

105
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:20,773
Any questions you might have
about your immediate future?

106
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:21,781
No.

107
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,160
Well, the number on
there is toll-free.

108
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,881
If you encounter any problems,
you can call there 24-7.

109
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,043
Thanks.

110
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:35,102
Wait a second. You know what?

111
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,081
Why don't you tell me
where you need to go,

112
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:38,943
and I'll make sure
you get there.

113
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,451
You know,
I think I'll be all right.

114
00:09:45,637 --> 00:09:47,790
- You sure?
- Yeah. Thank you.

115
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:00,732
Kid didn't bite. He's on foot.

116
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:01,850
All right.

117
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:06,590
Have your men follow.
Remember, it's the father we want.

118
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,671
We can't go back.

119
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,162
You said it, without the money,
we're screwed. We can't...

120
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:14,490
- Just let me think.
- Maybe it's still back...

121
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:16,100
Just let me think!
Let me think.

122
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,723
Maybe it's still
back at the house.

123
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:20,341
The money's not back at
the house unless T-Bag is.

124
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,531
He must've switched the packs.

125
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:27,811
Wh-what do we do...
What do we do now?

126
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:32,932
We still got the five grand we
took when we pocketed the money.

127
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:34,581
It's not gonna be five million,

128
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,223
but it might be enough to
get us where we're going.

129
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:38,701
All units be advised.

130
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:42,180
Escaped convicts from Fox
River have been positively ID'd

131
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,553
at 1131 Monterey Lane.

132
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:46,683
We have dogs being
dispatched to the location.

133
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:49,073
I want every road in or
out of town blocked off.

134
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,142
I don't care if it's on wheels,
rails or hooves.

135
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:53,001
I want it stopped and searched.

136
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:57,482
I thought you said we
would have a head start.

137
00:10:57,515 --> 00:11:00,470
It was the gunshot, buddy.
One of the neighbors must've heard.

138
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,001
How fast can that thing go?

139
00:11:02,148 --> 00:11:04,730
I don't know.
Both of us, it could probably...

140
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,911
We're never gonna get
out of here on the roads.

141
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,053
We need to find another way.

142
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,193
He's in your office.

143
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:24,250
I can't believe they're
calling me back here

144
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,070
when my escapees are out there.
I want to know who this guy is.

145
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:29,318
Said his name was Sullin.

146
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,584
Son of a bitch.

147
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:35,320
Let me know if anything
breaks on the convicts.

148
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:41,531
- Alex.
- Thanks for coming in.

149
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,233
You want to tell me
why Internal Affairs

150
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,243
is pulling me out of the field
in the middle of a manhunt?

151
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:47,781
It's been a while since we've
had a sit-down, hasn't it?

152
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:50,062
Not since the Shales escape,
am I right?

153
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,050
Yeah, yeah.
What's going on, Richard?

154
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,582
Well... that's precisely
what I'm here to find out.

155
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:59,932
And you're not getting
out of here until I do.

156
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:10,193
Oh, my God. Civilization.

157
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,281
What can I get for you boys?

158
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:30,390
- You tell me.
- Two waters, then.

159
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:33,302
And the use of your phone,
if you'd be so kind.

160
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,383
Don't worry, it's a local call.

161
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,683
First thing I do, we get home:
clean underwear.

162
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:43,593
Then what?

163
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:47,070
I guess go back to that liquor store,
beg for my job back.

164
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,690
We had it. We were so close.

165
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:58,270
I can still taste that money right
there in the back of my throat.

166
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:00,660
Well, nothing that a
couple of Keystones,

167
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,380
an hungry man
Salisbury steak dinner

168
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,392
and a night in front of
the TV won't take care of.

169
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:11,301
Hey, Mom, it's Brad.

170
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:15,673
Hey, listen, me and Roy,
we ran into some car trouble and...

171
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:18,403
we were wondering if you
could come pick us up.

172
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,793
I don't know, hold on.
What the hell town is this?

173
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,092
Thought you said this
was a local call.

174
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,052
Hey, Bradley, check this out.

175
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,530
...these individuals were
reportedly the prisoners

176
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:33,132
who escaped from the Fox
River penitentiary in Illinois

177
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:34,633
just a couple of days ago.

178
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,551
What were they doing all the
way out here in Tooele, Utah?

179
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:41,682
Well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage
they dug up, has her own theory.

180
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:47,712
They pretended that they were some kind
of workers from the power company,

181
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:52,560
and that they had made a mistake
and they'd have to do some digging.

182
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:57,871
Hey, Mom, on second thought,
can you wire us some extra scratch?

183
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,172
Turns out, we ain't done yet.

184
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:16,902
Hello.

185
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:19,380
- Bruce, I need your help.
- Sara?

186
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:21,833
Bruce, my father
didn'tcommit suicide, okay?

187
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,171
Okay, just calm down.
Where are you?

188
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:25,920
He was looking into
the Burrows case and

189
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,743
I think that he found something
that they didn't ho know.

190
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,941
And now, I think that they
think that I know it, too.

191
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,112
All right,
I want you to listen to me.

192
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,742
I'm gonna send someone
over to pick you up.

193
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,833
I'll bring you back here, and we'll
sort all of this out, I promise.

194
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:38,362
Just tell me where you are.

195
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:41,552
Uh, I don't know,
I'm at a pay phone on...

196
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:43,520
Third and Harper.

197
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,501
Do you have your cell in
case I need to reach you?

198
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:49,112
Uh, I do, but I thought it
would be tapped. I don't know.

199
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:51,982
Someone's on their way.
Just stay right where you are.

200
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,900
Thank you.

201
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:08,580
- I'll give you 80 bucks for them.
- Come on, man, they're worth...

202
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:11,112
Worth a lot more to the person
they actually belong to.

203
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:13,163
These are ladies clubs, doctor.

204
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:16,620
I'm guessing they're hotter in
a monkey's jockstrap. 80 bucks.

205
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,302
Thrwo in the cooler,
and you got a deal.

206
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,150
- We got to lose the bike.
-Uh-uh. No way.

207
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:33,343
The roads are sealed.

208
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,670
It's the only way we're
gonna make it out of here.

209
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,960
I can't, bro.
I promised Petey...

210
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,213
You're not getting that
thing across the river.

211
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:42,171
And every minute we spend trying
is a minute we don't have, okay?

212
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:45,213
I'm sorry. We gotta move.

213
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,101
I've heard about
these kinds of places.

214
00:15:58,245 --> 00:15:59,831
They got leeches, you know.

215
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,613
I'll take the leeches in here

216
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,250
over the handcuffs back there.

217
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:04,700
I don't know, papi.

218
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:07,370
Sort of depends on where the leech
leeches, you know what I'm saying?

219
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:08,291
Stop kidding.

220
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:25,551
- Are alright, buddy?
- I can't... I can't move!

221
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,350
You feel like you
broke anything?

222
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:29,801
No, I don't think so.

223
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:31,860
Can you get it off me?

224
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:43,652
This thing's not going anywhere.
I'm gonna check your foot.

225
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:03,122
That's allright buddy.
It's stuck.

226
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,350
Call 911.

227
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:50,682
Kelli, my name is Sara.
I'm a doctor. You're gonna be okay.

228
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,611
Can you hear me?
You'll be all right.

229
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:55,230
Take some deep breaths and...

230
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:58,130
Kelli?

231
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:00,311
Kelli.

232
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:10,893
It's gonna be okay, right?

233
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:14,932
I mean, if you can get
eight people out of prison,

234
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:18,082
you can get my Puerto Rican
ass out of this, right?

235
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,760
Can't you?

236
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,230
Come on!

237
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:34,880
Damn it!

238
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,922
Do you hear that?
I know that sound.

239
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,891
There's a dam up river.

240
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,252
It's a signal.

241
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,512
It means they're
opening the locks.

242
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:02,791
That means the water
level's gonna rise,

243
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,961
and when it does,
the log will just float right off.

244
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:06,981
Yeah?

245
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:10,263
Canine units at the scene
have multiple scents

246
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,100
and are spreading
out into the field.

247
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,032
These guys can't have
gotten very far.

248
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,971
There were six cons
back at that house.

249
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,641
They'll be tracking us
in every direction.

250
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:23,520
It'll take an hour just to make it
over this far, and by that time,

251
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:26,140
the water level will rise,
we'll be long gone.

252
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:27,401
Are you sure?

253
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,012
Yeah, I'm sure.

254
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,171
I'm sure.

255
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:38,833
Ask any of the 20 cops there,
John Abruzzi was armed.

256
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:40,342
John Abruzzi drew his weapon...

257
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,363
He never should have been
allowed to get that far.

258
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:43,591
Richard, let's be clear.

259
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,921
If you knew how things needed
to be handled in a manhunt,

260
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:48,632
you'd be out there running one

261
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:51,171
instead of hamstringing
the men that are.

262
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:54,093
The FBI's primary objective in
investigating fugitive matters

263
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,423
is to affect the swift location
and capture of the fugitives.

264
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:59,620
You have two dead bodies, Alex.

265
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,630
I've got two dead
felons, Richard.

266
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,610
Now, maybe that doesn't play well
from a public relations standpoint,

267
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,390
but from a public
safety standpoint,

268
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,910
Abruzzi and Apolskis
were by the book.

269
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:12,950
Shooting of an unarmed kid at
point-blank range is by the book?

270
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:14,350
Come on.

271
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:18,621
Incident report,
David "Tweener" Apolskis.

272
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:22,293
You know, I'm curious,
was he cuffed during transport?

273
00:20:22,478 --> 00:20:23,081
Yeah.

274
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,270
Says in here he somehow managed
to grab your primary weapon.

275
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:28,671
You carry that in
a shoulder holster?

276
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,973
- Hip.
- Left, right? Right, left?

277
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,883
- Left.
- Left.

278
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:37,853
I'm sorry,
I get confused sometimes.

279
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:40,950
So just so I've got this right,

280
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,811
you were driving along alone
with a cuffed prisoner, and

281
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:49,473
somehow he reaches forward across
your chestand grabs your weapon.

282
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:54,691
Huh. It's too bad you didn't
react that quickly with Apolskis.

283
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,091
Maybe he'd still be alive.

284
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,982
What does an origami bird
have to do with any of this?

285
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,613
Michael Scofield
sent it to her.

286
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:46,322
And since your brilliant
plan to eliminate

287
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:49,382
Sara Tancredi from the equation
failed so completely--

288
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:51,362
I wouldn't say it failed
completely at all.

289
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,293
There's a dead woman
in a phone booth.

290
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,063
Civilian.

291
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:59,531
A certain number of bodies
you can sweep under the rug.

292
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:03,050
President's rug is getting so full,
you can hardly stand on it.

293
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:05,821
So what do you
suggest we should do?

294
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:10,462
- You ever go fishing, Bill?
- Just make your point.

295
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:13,561
There's two ways to catch a fish.
You cast out a big net and hope

296
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,191
you get what you're
looking for.

297
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:19,470
Or you choose the right bait
and guarantee that you do.

298
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:22,001
It's a simple strategy,
plays across the board.

299
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:25,671
LJ will lead us to Burrows.
Sara will lead us to Scofield.

300
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:27,590
And how do you intend
to follow Sara,

301
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,670
when the only lead
got is an origami bird

302
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,620
with an out of
service phone number?

303
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:34,261
Maybe it's not a phone number.

304
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:52,540
What do you have?

305
00:22:52,615 --> 00:22:54,832
Junior's on the move,
but still no sign of Burrows.

306
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,460
Sir, the guy's in hiding,

307
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,092
maybe he doesn't even
know his kid's out.

308
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,221
The cop that was
held hostage in Utah

309
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:02,633
has Burrows splitting off
from the rest of the group

310
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:06,760
just after word of LJ's
release hit the wire. He knows.

311
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:09,621
Now if we want to know
for sure if he's there,

312
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:12,902
we need to do something
to draw him out.

313
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:31,652
Hey, you mind
sparing some change?

314
00:23:31,795 --> 00:23:32,403
No.

315
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,352
- Come on.
- No, I'm all tapped out.

316
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,483
You got something.
I'll take whatever you got.

317
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,712
Look, seriously, I just got out
of lock-up. I would if I could.

318
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:46,661
Sorry.

319
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:48,952
I see,
you think you're better than me, huh?

320
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:51,133
I don't think I'm
better than you.

321
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:55,303
- Yo, where you running, little man?
- I'm not running anywhere.

322
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:08,292
This isn't how it's
supposed to go.

323
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:10,232
The whole reason I went
along with the break

324
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,700
was to have a life with
Maricruz and my baby.

325
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:17,781
And now what?
Get some two-bit job?

326
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:21,341
Always be looking
over my shoulder?

327
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:24,280
What kind of life is that?

328
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:27,032
You can come with me and Linc.

329
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:29,562
To Panama. Start over.

330
00:24:29,698 --> 00:24:30,942
The longer you stay here,

331
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:34,153
the more chance there is you'll
never make it to Panama.

332
00:24:34,248 --> 00:24:36,131
You've got other
people to think about.

333
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:39,832
Your brother,
your nephew. Sara.

334
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,642
She's meeting you down there,
isn't she?

335
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:45,743
I don't know.
We never talked about it.

336
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,563
- But you're hoping.
- Just give it a rest, will you.

337
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,262
The dogs are locked in.
We've got two trails merging.

338
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:52,752
They were definitely here. They've
headed east towards Drucker Ranch.

339
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,721
They've gone off-road.
Any additional units,

340
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:57,953
we need to setup a one-mile
perimeter and then start closing in.

341
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,090
It's getting deeper.

342
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:07,421
So how come this freaking
thing ain't moving yet?

343
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:10,432
Let me check.

344
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,333
You all right?

345
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,382
Look, Michael...

346
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:28,433
I understand if you have to keep going,
you know.

347
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,133
Just shut up.
I'm not going anywhere.

348
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,700
No, but, look,
just think about it.

349
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:34,001
- You know, if I leave you drown.
- No, I know, but just...

350
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:36,032
The water level's
getting higher, Sucre.

351
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:39,683
How many seconds can you
hold your breath? 45? 60?

352
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:42,080
That's how long you've
got to live if I take off.

353
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:43,763
How long do you
have if you stay?

354
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:45,743
How long till the dogs
lead the cops here?

355
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,091
What you're suggesting
is not an option.

356
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:49,163
Look, I ain't trying to
be a hero or nothing.

357
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:52,391
We both know there are only
two things that can happen now.

358
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:56,030
Leave me here...

359
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,592
or we both get caught.

360
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:18,962
- Bruce.
- Oh, Sara.

361
00:26:19,097 --> 00:26:20,780
I know we said not
to use this number,

362
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:22,701
but I just needed to
know you were okay.

363
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:25,471
My driver said he went to pick you
up and the place was a crime scene.

364
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,823
Yeah, the woman that he saw,
the woman by the pay phone,

365
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:29,201
that was supposed to be me.

366
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:31,710
And I had to leave her there.
I didn't know what to do.

367
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:33,072
Bruce, who are these people?

368
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,801
They knew exactly where I
was going to be standing.

369
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:36,813
They knew where I
was going to be...

370
00:26:37,736 --> 00:26:40,413
- Sara?
- It was you.

371
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:43,543
What are you
talking about, Sara?

372
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:45,332
I just need to know
where you are.

373
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:46,252
Oh, my God.

374
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:16,403
Excuse me, we'd like to check on
a friend of ours, LJ Burrows?

375
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:17,891
He's getting some stitches.

376
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:19,812
We just want to make
sure he's all right.

377
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,972
And you can see him when he's through.
It's policy.

378
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:23,311
You don't get it.

379
00:27:23,457 --> 00:27:24,972
I get that that kid
defended himself.

380
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:26,930
You going to tell us why you
attacked him in the first place?

381
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,651
- I told you man.
- I know, some guy paid you.

382
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:30,603
- Some guy paid me to do it.
- Excuse me. FBI.

383
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:32,410
What do you mean
somebody paid you?

384
00:27:32,557 --> 00:27:34,062
What the hell does
it sound like, man?

385
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,842
Some dude gave me 50 bucks
to give the kid a beat down.

386
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:40,550
It's Burrows. He's here.

387
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,143
- How you feeling, son?
- Dad?

388
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:53,302
We got to move.

389
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:15,133
Well, there's not much you can do,
you know.

390
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,561
Excuse me, ladies.
I need to ask you a few questions.

391
00:28:18,578 --> 00:28:20,882
I'm on the, uh,
follow-up investigation team.

392
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:22,330
Excuse me.

393
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,773
Uh, we're just curious.

394
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:31,083
Did you see if the convicts actually
found what they were digging for?

395
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:33,573
No. But sure sounded
like they did.

396
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:36,881
The Spaniard, he took off with
one of my daughter's camping packs

397
00:28:36,918 --> 00:28:38,802
and he left the other
ones in a real tizzy.

398
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:41,562
Sounded like he screwed
'em over something fierce.

399
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,200
And they just let him leave?

400
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:45,783
Well, they weren't happy about it,
but, yeah.

401
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:47,331
He took off on his motorbike,

402
00:28:47,478 --> 00:28:48,963
and then they left
a few minutes later.

403
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,213
- Together?
- No.

404
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:52,951
The pretty one and the black fellow,
they left first,

405
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:55,580
and then that dirty Southerner...
he snuck out the back.

406
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:57,663
But he was moving kind of slow,
you know,

407
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:00,590
the weight of that backpack
and that disability that...

408
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,751
Wait a minute,
he had a backpack, too?

409
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:07,841
Yes. He came back in and slipped this
into my brassiere on his way out.

410
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:10,801
He said it was to
cover the damages.

411
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:17,740
Um, we're going to need
to keep this as evidence.

412
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:20,961
Thank you for your time.
Get in the car.

413
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:32,543
Seven, three, six, space.

414
00:29:33,427 --> 00:29:35,490
Three, three, nine, space.

415
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:37,743
Eight, six, eight, seven.

416
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,842
And what exactly
are you looking for?

417
00:29:40,935 --> 00:29:44,742
A pattern. A code. Anything.

418
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:15,952
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

419
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:19,292
They say...

420
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:22,062
people come into your
life for a reason.

421
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:28,230
Maybe my reason was to help
you get out of Fox River.

422
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:32,512
You know,
to help you save your brother.

423
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,153
No.

424
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,300
- To help you save your brother.
- No.

425
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:46,042
It's okay, papi. Let me go.

426
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:50,353
We're a quarter mile up the river
below the dam. They're close.

427
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,343
It's now or never, Michael.

428
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:00,930
I want you to hold your breath.

429
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,003
- Okay?
- Why?

430
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:04,441
Just do it.
I'll be right back, I promise.

431
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:26,551
What the hell are you doing?

432
00:31:26,788 --> 00:31:28,610
Redirect all units
to the river.

433
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:30,531
I want you to go under.

434
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:33,350
And then stick your arm up,
above the water, high.

435
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:36,901
And then when you start
running out of air,

436
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:38,972
wave it back and
forth so I can see it.

437
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,540
And I'll come back and get you.

438
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,463
Okay? All right,
give me your hand.

439
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:48,033
One... two... three.

440
00:32:23,595 --> 00:32:25,941
Come on. Come on!

441
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:06,473
Sucre!

442
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,452
Sucre!

443
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:48,930
Talk to me.

444
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,032
Well, there is one possibility,
but it's almost too rudimentary.

445
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:54,873
We know we're not looking
at a phone number,

446
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:57,492
but maybe we're not
looking at numbers at all.

447
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:05,833
What's important are the letters
that correspond to that number.

448
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:12,181
Three dots, third letter "R."

449
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:21,222
Three possibilities per number.
That's thousands of letter combinations.

450
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:26,581
But only one of them's
spells out a word.

451
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:36,640
Question is where.

452
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:51,033
Hey. What are you
in the market for?

453
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:53,052
Four wheels and a gas pedal.

454
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:56,180
Hey, Petey. Uh, it's me.

455
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:59,331
Uh, listen,
I got something to tell you.

456
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:01,261
Yeah, well, I was wondering
when you were gonna call.

457
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:06,430
Yeah, a lot has come down since
we last talked, and, uh...

458
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:09,862
Gee, I know, I heard.
You ruined it.

459
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:13,441
Yeah. Um... You heard already?

460
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:15,461
Well, brother,
everybody's heard, man,

461
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:18,803
and let me tell you something, man.
Hector is pissed.

462
00:35:18,945 --> 00:35:20,503
What does Hector
have to do with it?

463
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,843
It was his wedding.

464
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:23,952
Wait, man.
What are you talking about?

465
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:25,893
Your bike.
What are you talking about?

466
00:35:25,928 --> 00:35:27,980
- The wedding.
- What about the wedding?

467
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,673
Well, you know the part where,
uh, you say, "I do"?

468
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,720
Maricruz said, "I don't."

469
00:35:34,738 --> 00:35:36,521
She did?

470
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:40,383
Left homeboy standing at the altar
holding his spam in his hand,

471
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:42,160
if you know what I'm saying.

472
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:44,473
What were you telling
me about my bike?

473
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:51,603
All right.
I'll go get your keys.

474
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,110
I got a couple stops to make.

475
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,033
First is this place
called Blanding.

476
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:58,053
Then we'll meet up with
Lincoln in a couple days.

477
00:35:58,086 --> 00:35:59,392
I can't go.

478
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:03,870
She said no, papi. Maricruz...

479
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:06,833
Maricruz told that son of a...
She told him no.

480
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,893
- Can you believe that?
- That's great.

481
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:13,600
I know. Now, I just...

482
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:16,792
No. Go on. Get your girl.

483
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:18,821
What about Panama?
We said that we were gonna...

484
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:21,532
Some other time.
Panama's not going to go anywhere.

485
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:27,931
This is, uh, in case you run
into trouble down the road.

486
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:35,070
In the river...

487
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:37,581
I told you to leave me behind.

488
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:39,782
Yeah, well, I tried, but, uh,

489
00:36:39,926 --> 00:36:42,313
then I got tangled up
in the rope, so...

490
00:36:46,618 --> 00:36:48,623
Okay, here you go.

491
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:54,552
Thanks, and, uh,
we'll need another car.

492
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,111
Do you really think the
diaper sniper got all of it?

493
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,791
Only one way to find out.
If you were Bagwell,

494
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:09,912
and you just got your hands on
$5 million, where would you go?

495
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:39,291
You think you're the only
one who feels betrayed?

496
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:43,990
I'm gonna get out of here some day.
And when I do,

497
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:49,442
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

498
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:06,200
Let me get this straight.

499
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:08,501
You paid that meth-head
to whoop my ass?

500
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:09,382
Yup.

501
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:12,593
Feds were waiting for me to come
get you. It was the only way.

502
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:14,311
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yeah.

503
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:16,371
Yeah, it got me four stitches.

504
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:20,331
Adds character.
Here, take that.

505
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:22,922
There's some ice in there.
Put it on the eye.

506
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:24,753
Keep the swelling down.

507
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,730
I've been in a few
fights in my day, too.

508
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:34,062
Too many.

509
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:04,821
There's one more bird.

510
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:18,613
Clean it. Every surface,
like she never came home. Go on.

511
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:47,363
You know,
waiting for your flight from Utah,

512
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:49,512
I had a little extra
time for due diligence,

513
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:51,653
so I decided to dig a little
deeper on your history,

514
00:39:51,685 --> 00:39:54,832
or rather lack of one.
Starts off simple enough.

515
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,663
Poor family.
Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.

516
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,792
Somehow your dad holds
onto custody, and

517
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:01,833
by the look of these
pediatric meds,

518
00:40:01,926 --> 00:40:04,463
he beats you like a harp seal
for the next four years.

519
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,223
Big shock-- poor, abused kid,

520
00:40:06,368 --> 00:40:08,533
not a lot of options--
he joins the military.

521
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:11,363
Will there be any actual questions,
or is this just a show-and-tell?

522
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:12,512
Okay, I got one.

523
00:40:12,655 --> 00:40:15,863
How does a guy go from infantry
grunt with less than stellar marks

524
00:40:15,898 --> 00:40:17,823
to the Gulf 1, special ops,

525
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,982
to the Federal Bureau
of Investigations,

526
00:40:20,078 --> 00:40:22,721
leading the largest manhunt
this country's ever seen?

527
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:28,850
I have all these dots.
And there's just no way to connect them.

528
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:32,041
Looks like you need to work on
your clearance level... Dick.

529
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:34,453
- Or maybe I just work on you.
- You want to do this?

530
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:35,933
I will chain you to this desk

531
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:38,443
until I get some answers I
cannot fertilize my lawn with.

532
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,920
You sure you want to do this?

533
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,510
I know what they tell
you to do overseas, Alex,

534
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:44,571
and let me make it
perfectly clear--

535
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,480
We do not do it
on American soil.

536
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:49,722
Sir, uh,
there's a phone call for you.

537
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:51,170
I'll take it later.

538
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:53,653
Uh, sir,
you're gonna want to take this now.

539
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:00,973
Yeah.

540
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:02,500
Yes, sir.

541
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:06,532
I, uh... I'm with him now.

542
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:09,960
Yes, sir.

543
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,712
Where you going, Rick?

544
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:20,391
I thought we were really
starting to get somewhere.

545
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:23,730
Let's go.

546
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:40,632
Alex.

547
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:43,530
You got something for me?

548
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:50,132
Open it.

549
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:55,293
The numbers correlate to
the letters on a phone.

550
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,993
Only on this one, none of the
possible combinations make sense.

551
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:02,010
We think it's a location,
a rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.

552
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:04,620
You find it, you find him.

553
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:07,081
You know, you could have
gotten me out of there sooner.

554
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:09,243
You know, even we have to
go through certain channels

555
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:12,522
to make things appear
on the up-and-up.

556
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:14,962
You know all about that,
don't you, Alex?

557
00:42:15,245 --> 00:42:18,201
Keeping up appearances.

558
00:42:19,546 --> 00:42:20,661
Good.

559
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:23,980
I was just making sure
that we're still clear

560
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:26,660
on the directive
of this manhunt.

561
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:31,650
You know, I understand the reasoning
behind Burrows and Scofield,

562
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:34,333
but these other men--
criminals that they may be--

563
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:36,430
there's nothing in their
profiles to suggest...

564
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:41,653
You've been hired to do a job.
The reasoning does not concern you.

565
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:44,103
Don't ask any questions about us,
and maybe we'll continue

566
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:47,712
to make sure no one asks any
questions about you. Are we clear?

567
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:53,050
They all die.

568
00:42:55,225 --> 00:42:56,631
They all die.

569
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:05,610
