1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,869
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,989
This is scylla.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,469
You're not even close to getting out of here.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,339
Dad?

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,059
It's me.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,859
Lisa?

7
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,059
I'm at gunpoint.

8
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,929
It's tancredi. She says if you don't

9
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,049
Let michael and the others

10
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,050
Leave with scylla, she'll kill me.

11
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,750
Don't!

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,039
I'm leaving.

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,470
No, mr. White!

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,339
Turn around!

15
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,899
Gentle now, sugar.

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,650
That's special agent miriam holtz to you, sugar.

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,990
We have it!

18
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:34,799
They got it.

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,429
I never thought

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,599
You'd make it this far.

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,840
I was wrong.

22
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,229
What now?

23
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,109
This is all your transfer paperwork.

24
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,310
You need to get to dallow, asap.

25
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,029
What happened to gretchen?

26
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,330
She got away.

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,670
Self.

28
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,940
Self.

29
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,409
He screwed us.

30
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,809
Self can't do that.

31
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,620
He's government. He can do what he pleases.

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,859
The vans are coming.

33
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,099
They're just late.

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,199
He ain't coming back!

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,960
You don't know that, linc! They're coming!

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,710
What do we do now?

37
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,510
Call homeland. See how much they know about self.

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,829
Stanton.

39
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,719
Herb, it was scofield and burrows.

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,169
Are you at the senator's office?

41
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,610
I think I'm shot!

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,389
I'm shot!

43
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,119
Miriam's, gone, okay?

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,399
What's your position?

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,719
You were right

46
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,760
About this whole operation.

47
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,290
No. Burrows, burrows!

48
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,420
Don

49
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,760
No, no, no, no!

50
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,890
I need to find gretchen.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,380
You gonna help me?

52
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,870
Or you gonna make me shoot you in the face?

53
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,370
Help.

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,759
Department of homeland security.

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,939
I'd like to talk to don self's superior, please.

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,340
One moment, please.

57
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,299
We gave this guy

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,989
Something worth $100 million.

59
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,149
Is he even with homeland? Did we see a badge?

60
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,649
We were given guns and flown out on a c-130.

61
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,009
He didn't work for the dmv.

62
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,369
That doesn't make him the law.

63
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,800
No, it don't.

64
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,490
What if homeland was in on this from the beginning?

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,910
This is herb stanton. Who the hell's this?

66
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,960
Hello? Hello?

67
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,529
The way self played this, I don't know.

68
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,229
He kept himself too insulated.

69
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,799
That's why, that's why he hesitated

70
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,069
With official authorizations

71
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,159
On behalf of our mission.

72
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,519
He kept saying it was because he didn't want

73
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,059
The company to find out. In actuality,

74
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,519
It's because he didn't want to get caught,

75
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,619
The son of a bitch!

76
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,180
He kept the circle tight.

77
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,959
Left the rest of us holding the bag.

78
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,949
If homeland knows

79
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,729
Where we're at, sooner or later they're coming for us.

80
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,049
Let them come-- we didn't do anything wrong. We have deals.

81
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,989
No, we have paper. That's what self left us.

82
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,079
That's what we have.

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,199
We gotta get out of here.

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,830
We can't leave. Michael needs surgery.

85
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,050
I'm not talking about running.

86
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,770
I'm talking about surviving.

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,790
What I want is to see the company burned to the ground

88
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,770
And you in prison.

89
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,910
We did this to you. We did this to you.

90
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,170
They're ready for you downstairs, sir.

91
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,849
Today marks a critical juncture in our endeavor.

92
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,720
Do we have a bead on scylla yet?

93
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,829
Our security, our future stands at a great precipice.

94
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,210
It's a yes-or-no question, jonathan.

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,290
And we don't need a soliloquy.

96
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,009
Howard, why don't you wait in my office?

97
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,479
No. I'm in here

98
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,550
Making sure this operation isn't fumbled as well.

99
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,540
Out... Now.

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,900
What's your plan, jonathan?

101
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,020
That's what we're all here for, right?

102
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,079
You tried to move scylla

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,319
Over our better judgment, and it backfired,

104
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,010
So spill it.

105
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,420
Any further questions?

106
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,090
Very well.

107
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,479
You have your assignments.

108
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,720
Access your assets and retrieve scylla today.

109
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,399
Yeah, well, a lot of people that believed in me

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,420
In the last few months, agent self,

111
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,070
Not all of them are alive today.

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,970
I can't shake that line.

113
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,270
"all that avails is flight."

114
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,990
Come on.

115
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,570
Here, take that.

116
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,010
Sara's right. We need to get you to a hospital now.

117
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,600
We were so close to the finish line.

118
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,270
So close.

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,220
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

120
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,530
Listen, i, uh, I spoke to lj yesterday.

121
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,440
Told him this was almost over.

122
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,500
I'm keeping my word to my son, michael.

123
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,529
I should have seen this coming.

124
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,870
No, no, it's no one's fault.

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,080
Self played all of us.

126
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,840
We gotta get out of here.

127
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,570
This is our last option.

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,570
Get upstairs

129
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,960
There

130
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,510
There

131
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,670
Now we know where we stand.

132
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,560
Let's go.

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,319
Hello.

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Michael scofield.

135
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,069
Yes.

136
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,790
Herb stanton, department of homeland security.

137
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,819
We want to talk.

138
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,809
Can you please come back to the warehouse?

139
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,029
All right, but first we're gonna need some assurances.

140
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,639
What kind of assurances?

141
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,770
Look, we held up our end of the deal,

142
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,579
So we're gonna need you

143
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,579
To honor the terms of our agreements.

144
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,829
Well, I'd have to take another look at those terms,

145
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,629
But I'm fairly certain it didn't include stealing scylla

146
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,110
Or killing two federal agents in cold blood.

147
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,999
What are you talking about?

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,849
Here are the new terms

149
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,230
I'm prepared to offer.

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,209
Come back, turn yourselves in...

151
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,089
Wait a minute! Self set us up!

152
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,260
Don't,

153
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,860
And I'll hunt you down like animals.

154
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,439
We did what they said.

155
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,409
I ain't going down on some trumped-up murder charge.

156
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,609
Self pinned

157
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,989
Two murders on us.

158
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,379
What are you doing, linc?

159
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,849
If homeland security comes...

160
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,779
Then we'll handle it.

161
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,899
You know what?

162
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,699
There's gotta be a point where you draw the line.

163
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,199
Now's the time to draw that line.

164
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,609
Don't be stupid. You can't fight off all of homeland.

165
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,179
Stupid is listening to the government.

166
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,279
I ain't going back to death row. We can still hold onto

167
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,969
Our deals.

168
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,549
All we have to do is flush self out, prove he has scylla.

169
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,419
How are we gonna do that, huh?

170
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,619
We have to devise another strategy.

171
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,999
We should start devising a plan

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,379
That can get us a hundred miles across the mexican border.

173
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,609
That's what we should do.

174
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,139
My cousin petey can hook us up.

175
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,490
We're not running.

176
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,040
We can't.

177
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,799
Negative on scofield, burrows and mahone.

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,009
Tdz think that self may be using a bakergrip

179
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,759
To mask his cell phone signal.

180
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,839
Place a tactical team around homeland.

181
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,389
If self or any of those other bastards show up,

182
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,790
Make damn well sure they don't get near the building.

183
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,419
I can't go back to living

184
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,760
In and out of motels, constantly looking over my shoulder.

185
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,969
Nothing changes. We take down the company.

186
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,870
We finish what we started.

187
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,890
Who are you calling?

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,619
A doctor.

189
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,310
Sara, not now.

190
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,849
When?

191
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,580
Whoa-whoa-whoa, listen.

192
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,639
Cole pfeiffer, an employee of gate,

193
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,549
A downtown wellness organization,

194
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,419
And his yet-unidentified- female accomplice

195
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,960
Both seen here in police sketches.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,250
On them

197
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
Gretchen?

198
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,900
Bagwell?

199
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,019
Have our people at dot

200
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,650
Monitor every traffic camera from san diego to the bay area.

201
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,670
I can't believe you shot him.

202
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,809
Knowing when to sever a cancerous limb

203
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,869
To preserve the rest of the body...

204
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,929
He was one of your most trusted advisors and confida...

205
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,530
When I brought you in

206
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,019
I told you that a cardholder has certain responsibilities.

207
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,759
If you can't

208
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,510
Handle what we're doing here,

209
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,070
It's time you let me know.

210
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,809
Ceo gregory white who was shot and killed in the standoff.

211
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,999
Police are trying to determine whether revenge or robbery

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,360
Was the motive.

213
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,289
Cole pfeiffer was a recent addition...

214
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,730
Maybe we weren't the only ones left hanging, huh?

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,260
If we're gonna flush self out,

216
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,230
How do you think he intended to unload scylla?

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,610
Gretchen.

218
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,220
He's got to sell it.

219
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,900
Tell me when I'm getting warm.

220
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,479
You hand-picked michael scofield and the bunch,

221
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,399
Trucked them all out here on uncle sam's dime,

222
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,409
To do your bidding, and now they're

223
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,540
Standing right in the crosshairs for what you did.

224
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,690
I gotta hand it to you don, if that ain't the mona lisa.

225
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,629
I always said cops are more crooked than criminals.

226
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,659
Let me guess-- a little, little slice of heaven,

227
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,090
Is that what it was for?

228
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,630
Gambling debt?

229
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,699
Maybe you're a...

230
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,000
A geologist of the rock candy variety?

231
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,019
The information you got from gretchen's prints--

232
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,789
You sure it's the right address?

233
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,789
Right as rain. Good. Now,

234
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,540
Shut up or I'm gonna shoot you.

235
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,369
Understand me?

236
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,129
Oh, i, i...

237
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,929
Shut your mouth. I ain't...

238
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,149
I know when shut your mouth.

239
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,880
To shut my... Be quiet.

240
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,210
How long does it take to find a pay phone in this city?

241
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,090
They'll be back.

242
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,350
Okay.

243
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,759
Same deal as before.

244
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,279
No physical duress

245
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,070
For the next eight hours.

246
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,250
Here's the thing.

247
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,720
You need help.

248
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,529
And running around trying

249
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,260
To track down self isn't... Safe.

250
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,079
We could be in mexico in a few hours.

251
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,210
There are doctors there that I trust.

252
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,739
And you've been taking care of all of us.

253
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,330
I think it's really okay if we take care of you.

254
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,830
Surgery or no surgery...

255
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,609
I'm never gonna be able to live with myself

256
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,010
Unless I find a way to take these people down.

257
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,990
It's that simple,

258
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,760
And, uh... I get it.

259
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm not gonna demand that you feel the same way.

260
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,449
I'm telling you, we can't trust anyone--

261
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,779
Government, law enforcement...

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,749
Which is all the more reason

263
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,289
We should consider getting out of here. No.

264
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,509
We deal with this now.

265
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,929
I want this guy as much as you do, but we're scrambling here.

266
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,629
I mean, I don't know how long self has been planning

267
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,190
This thing and from the looks of it, it's pretty air-tight.

268
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,349
Gretchen.

269
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,360
I hope you're calling me to tell me where scylla is, lincoln.

270
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,499
You don't know?

271
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,960
I don't know.

272
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,470
What's going on?

273
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,090
Self double-crossed us and he took scylla.

274
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,319
You know where he

275
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,450
Could be?

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,580
If I'm self, I'm looking for a new buyer.

277
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,270
A new buyer?

278
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,740
You know what?

279
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,659
If you're playing me,

280
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,790
I'm gonna split you in half.

281
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,419
I want him just as badly as you do.

282
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,100
Where are you? I'm coming to you.

283
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Grand hope park. One hour.

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,079
What?

285
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Sis.

286
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,319
It's...

287
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,950
Emily. She's, um...

288
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,010
Been in an accident.

289
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,029
I want you to tell whoever's got that gun pointed at you

290
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,340
To grow a set and get on the phone.

291
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,230
She wants to talk to you.

292
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,080
What's up, gretchen?

293
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,710
Time to come home now

294
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,499
Gonna keep trusting that bitch?

295
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,629
Gretchen and t-bag were waiting at gate with machine guns, guys.

296
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,349
You think they just

297
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,770
Wanted to provide cover?

298
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,590
This chick's a mercenary.

299
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,689
She'll do whatever it takes to get what she wants,

300
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,779
And right now we just happen to want the same thing.

301
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,789
We are taking precautions, but...

302
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,189
One way or the other, gretchen's

303
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,640
Gonna get us to self, and right now...

304
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,819
...That is all that matters.

305
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,379
We don't stand a chance.

306
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,569
Our photos aren't plastered

307
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,819
All over the tv.

308
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,600
Homeland's keeping it in-house.

309
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,570
We have a chance.

310
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,820
Senator?

311
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,030
Herb.

312
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,539
We sponsored this operaton with the best

313
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,709
Of intentions, but the secretive manner in which we've handled it

314
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,539
I now fear is working against us.

315
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,359
How so?

316
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,619
We're in the middle of a manhunt,

317
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,899
And it's just you and a couple of agents

318
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,819
Out there trying to rein in

319
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,210
These cons. It's madness.

320
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,140
What we initally sponsored...

321
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,670
Didn't pan out.

322
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,930
That doesn't mean that the boat is taking on water.

323
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,470
No one knows.

324
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,939
That's the way

325
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,440
It's going to stay.

326
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,510
Come in!

327
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,679
Good afternoon.

328
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,930
Richard sooter, us marshals service.

329
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,429
I've been sent

330
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,369
At the request of deputy director esmar

331
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,159
To get to the bottom of the scofield/burrows supermax story

332
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,520
Once and for all.

333
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,080
I'm hoping you gentlemen can help.

334
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,829
Guys, if there's a reason

335
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,619
You're keeping secrets... Just fill me in here.

336
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,030
I canhelp.

337
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,680
How strong is your stomach?

338
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,630
Very.

339
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,230
Herb... Stanton.

340
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,670
He's working

341
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,600
With donald self.

342
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,089
We got a record

343
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,239
Of all incoming and outgoing calls

344
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,569
From homeland today.

345
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,559
Stanton received a call

346
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,810
Lasting approximately one minute

347
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,570
That was connected to no one.

348
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,809
No one we could identify.

349
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,100
Self's phone.

350
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,849
D.O.T. Has a positive id on gretchen

351
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,039
From a traffic cam.

352
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,559
She's still in los angeles.

353
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,229
Chris is on the phone from johannesburg,

354
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,600
Looking for an update.

355
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,130
I'll call back.

356
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,370
Now, about this mr. Stanton...

357
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,530
Alex, how are you doing?

358
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,490
No sign of gretchen yet.

359
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,250
Linc?

360
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,549
No sign of gretchen.

361
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,750
Sucre?

362
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,110
She ain't here yet, bro.

363
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,610
Sara?

364
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,410
All clear.

365
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,780
All right, here we go.

366
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,649
That's far enough.

367
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,640
Ah... That's far enough.

368
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,580
I'm sorry, rita.

369
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,619
I promise everything is going to be okay.

370
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,309
Yeah, we're all friends here,

371
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,249
Rita.

372
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,880
Don't worry about a thing.

373
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,919
You know, sending feng after me almost cost me my life,

374
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,199
And it did cost me my plan, which is why you're here,

375
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,159
Gretchen.

376
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,499
You're going to help me find a new buyer

377
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,720
For scylla.

378
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,810
You've been talking to scofield and the boys, huh?

379
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,590
Yeah, how are they?

380
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,480
Good and pissed.

381
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,030
Yeah, where are they?

382
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,630
Gee, don, I don't know, I'm not their mother.

383
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,020
You're not their mother,

384
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,430
But...

385
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,910
She looks just like you.

386
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,350
Doesn't she?

387
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,460
She's... Got those big blue eyes.

388
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,630
I'm supposed to meet them in a half an hour.

389
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,480
Get ready to phone in a tip.

390
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,170
Where at?

391
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,010
Where?

392
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,310
To perform the operation, michael,

393
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,820
That would require signatures from about

394
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,510
20 different department heads.

395
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,050
The only way this is going to work

396
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,140
Is via freelancer-- off the books.

397
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,150
I should be thanking you.

398
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,590
Okay, because of what you've done,

399
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,930
Lives are going to be changed forever.

400
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,070
Scofield, have you reconsidered my offer?

401
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,700
If I get you self and if I can get you scylla,

402
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,970
Are you going to be able to hold up our deals?

403
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,540
How do you intend on doing that?

404
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,080
Well, that's what we're working on.

405
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,970
The feds-- they're here.

406
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,690
We were set up.

407
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,730
Hands where I can see them! Hands where I can see!

408
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,400
Killing two federal agents ought to put you back

409
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,570
On top of death row, mr. Burrows.

410
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,780
We didn't kill anyone.

411
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,040
Self's behind this.

412
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,330
Don self

413
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,830
Is a decorated agent and an honorable man.

414
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,160
Yeah.

415
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,070
You wouldn't be the first guy to sit in that chair

416
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,010
And try to sell me a bill of goods.

417
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,990
Why weren't we halfway to mexico

418
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,390
By the time you worked things out?

419
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,270
You slipped up. No.

420
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,660
Because we were in the dark just as much as you were.

421
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,090
We know what happened, burrows.

422
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,770
You're not putting this together.

423
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,420
Think about how much scylla's worth.

424
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,680
Think of the lengths that

425
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,900
Self went to to keep this thing...

426
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,720
To keep this thing off the books.

427
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,500
And us? Us, of all people,

428
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,650
Pulling this job off.

429
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,820
Where are the bodies?

430
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,960
For five minutes, stop thinking about us,

431
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,710
And focus on self!

432
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,400
Why would we jeopardize our freedom?

433
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,740
It's the only thing we've ever cared about!

434
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,170
Where's fernando?

435
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,260
He's on his way.

436
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,660
Michael, look, I still have a friend in the bureau

437
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,950
We can reach out to.

438
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,440
Maybe she can make some calls, see where they're holding linc.

439
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,980
Who are you calling?

440
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,530
It's scofield.

441
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,280
All right. So answer it.

442
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,490
I should have put a bullet in your face when I had the chance.

443
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,300
I'm not the one who set you up, michael.

444
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,210
Yeah? Who did?

445
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,470
You know, I meant what I said before, michael.

446
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,320
I like your style. Okay?

447
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,330
You're a smart guy.

448
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,610
Unfortunately for you, I'm just a little bit smarter.

449
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,210
Yeah? We'll see about that.

450
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,400
I heard homeland made a surprise visit to the plaza, huh?

451
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,640
Look, I'm going to give you some parting advice.

452
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,560
Run.

453
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,590
Okay, get your pals and just start running.

454
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,680
We gotta go. Michael, we gotta go.

455
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,260
I appreciate all your help, all right?

456
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,550
I'm going to sell scylla now.

457
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,060
Don, you're not going anywhere.

458
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,850
Really? Okay.

459
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,260
Who's the buyer?

460
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,480
His name is vikan.

461
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,250
And he's not a buyer. He's a conduit.

462
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,510
A conduit to what?

463
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,050
We're not exactly moving heroin here.

464
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,090
It's a little bit more specialized.

465
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,720
There's about five people in the world

466
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,660
Who know what do with scylla and are willing to pay for it.

467
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,030
All right. Let's go.

468
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,860
Bagwell's staying here.

469
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,720
You're going to find yourself captive in my negativity

470
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,340
If you lay a hand on either one of them.

471
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,740
I warned you not to screw me over.

472
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,270
How could you?

473
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,860
I'll be back very, very soon.

474
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,460
And I promise you, that man is not going to hurt you.

475
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,460
How could you?

476
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,220
I'm going to fix this.

477
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,060
Wow, gretchen, you're making friends

478
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,750
Left and right, huh?

479
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,170
Now move your ass.

480
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,850
We've accessed self's e.I.D.

481
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,900
We've been able to get to files he tried to delete.

482
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,230
They're giving us a lot clearer picture

483
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,430
Of who he is and what he's been up to.

484
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,680
Honorable, huh?

485
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,300
What did you find out?

486
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,880
A name. Robert walker.

487
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,730
The new identity self is planning on using.

488
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,630
We found a social security number,

489
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,520
A bank account in the caymans, credit cards

490
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,770
And a flight itinerary

491
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,060
Out of the country for tomorrow morning.

492
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,470
First of all, we owe you an apology.

493
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,460
And, second, when we finally get our hands on him,

494
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,780
It's going to be paramount to get your help.

495
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,140
How?

496
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,250
Your testimony,

497
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,290
And the testimony of your brother

498
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,650
And the others against self

499
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,410
In exchange for full immunity. You walk away.

500
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,760
We already had a deal.

501
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,830
If you walk now, there'll be no one left to tell the tale.

502
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,690
Dhs needs you to cover its ass.

503
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,660
We can't spend our time chasing your friends.

504
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,730
They need to come in

505
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,750
So we can work out the details.

506
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,050
What if they don't?

507
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,410
We got a whole bunch of trust issues.

508
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,790
Then, you'll all rot in a supermax prison.

509
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,950
Dhs is prepared to fly into the face of this thing

510
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,630
Or to bury it.

511
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,700
It's your choice, mr. Burrows.

512
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,370
This is the best you're gonna do.

513
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,330
Michael.

514
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,330
Linc, where are you?

515
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,390
In the warehouse.

516
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,950
Put me on speaker.

517
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,620
Homeland knows self screwed us.

518
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,420
What do we have?

519
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,890
They found a file he thought he deleted

520
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,400
With an international bank account

521
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,100
And a one-way ticket out of here.

522
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,450
So it's over.

523
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,920
Yeah, well...

524
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,540
If we testify against self, we get full immunity.

525
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,660
Immunity from what?

526
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,030
We... We did the job

527
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,570
They hired us to do.

528
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,140
Michael, senator conrad dallow.

529
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,440
We have evidence that supports your claims.

530
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,740
I'm giving you my word your troubles are over now.

531
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,080
Please come in. So we can end this

532
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,660
Okay, um, I've decided...

533
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,230
Rather, I think that, uh, we should hear the senator out.

534
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,670
And, uh,

535
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,530
If everything goes south, then I do

536
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,380
Have a backup plan.

537
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,610
Sucre, I want you to go with sara

538
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,800
To the meeting place and get a lookout.

539
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,560
Alex and I are gonna make sure they don't bring

540
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,110
Any surprises by doubling back

541
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,180
To the warehouse

542
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,490
And then following them to the rendezvous.

543
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,000
This is where we're meeting the senator.

544
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,380
All right?

545
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,920
We'll be there.

546
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,280
You know, my father spent most of his political life...

547
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,220
Chasing justice.

548
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,860
It was sort of an obsession.

549
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,260
And my mother and I could never understand

550
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,170
Why he would so easily

551
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,390
Make other people's problems his own.

552
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,750
And I think it's why she left him.

553
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,930
And, michael, you remind me more and more of him these days.

554
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,390
The way you put everybody else's problems

555
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,940
Before your own.

556
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,320
That said...

557
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,640
...I want you to know that, if this meeting

558
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,410
With senator dallow doesn't go the way you want it to,

559
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,600
You don't have to worry about you and me.

560
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,680
Nothing's...

561
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,460
...Nothing's gonna come between us.

562
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,330
Yeah.

563
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,300
And everything is gonna be okay, right?

564
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,060
You know, I've figured it out.

565
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,390
Dhs wined and dined you in the beginning

566
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,560
And promised you the world,

567
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,110
And then they ultimately settled

568
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,510
On a broom closet

569
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,720
Next to some schmuck from the faa.

570
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,260
And you said nil.

571
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,780
Gretchen, you have a real keen sense of perception.

572
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,900
It's amazing.

573
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,740
And this all ends

574
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,270
With a three-story hut in tahiti, right?

575
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,540
Flat-screen tv, a couple jet skis outside.

576
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,960
But what you're gonna find, don,

577
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,730
Is that when the rush is over

578
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,650
And you're done patting yourself on the back

579
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,740
And there's no one left to tell the story to,

580
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,950
You'll be just as alone as you are now.

581
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,410
That's who don self is.

582
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,790
Is that right?

583
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,480
You tell me.

584
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,060
Yeah.

585
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,670
Take out your gun.

586
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,550
What's going on?

587
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,530
You want a cut or not, bagwell?

588
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,580
Take out your gun.

589
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,170
Relax, don.

590
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,360
All right.

591
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,270
Point it at her head.

592
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,940
Don.

593
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,790
Pull back the hammer.

594
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,220
Don!

595
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,120
Don!

596
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,310
I want my money. Don.

597
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,940
And I want to be on a plane by the end of today.

598
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,930
Otherwise, you and your family are gonna find out

599
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,120
Who the real don self is,

600
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,410
You understand me? That's him.

601
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,370
Do you understand me? We're set.

602
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,300
Okay, that's him.

603
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,050
Please.

604
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,390
I'll call you back.

605
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,970
1714 east seventh street.

606
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,400
This can't be right.

607
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,670
You sure this is what he wrote down?

608
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
That's what it says.

609
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,430
It's a parking lot.

610
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,210
Why would michael pick here?

611
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,700
I thought you and michael

612
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,810
Were going to the warehouse.

613
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,290
Michael sent me ahead.

614
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,880
What's going on? Where is he?

615
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,320
He's safe-- michael's safe.

616
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,100
We're not gonna be able to do this alone.

617
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,430
He's doing what he has to do,

618
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
And we have to do our part.

619
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,690
Right now, that's getting on that bus

620
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,400
And getting out of the city.

621
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,160
And we got to go now.

622
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,170
He just wants you both to be safe.

623
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,350
We got to go, we really got to go.

624
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,750
Where is michael?

625
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,790
Mr. Scofield,

626
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,030
Herb stanton.

627
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,580
This is senator conrad dallow.

628
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,200
On behalf of all americans, I want

629
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,330
To thank you for your service.

630
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,230
Save it. I'm here to give my testimony,

631
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,270
And then I'm leaving with my brother.

632
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,920
Right over here.

633
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,640
All right, gentlemen, tell us what you know.

634
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,290
Bus 34 with service to bakersfield

635
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,650
And fresno now boarding in terminal five.

636
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,270
Are we really leaving?

637
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,950
You heard mahone.

638
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,620
This is what michael wants.

639
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,760
Yeah, right.

640
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,440
Okay, but if the deal with dallow is legit,

641
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,410
There's no reason to run, right?

642
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,670
Michael's just covering the bases,

643
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,750
Making sure that we don't run into trouble again.

644
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,100
Yes, but if he's in trouble, he's going to need our help.

645
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,430
Well, maybe he thinks there's nothing left for us to do.

646
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,650
If we leave now, we're leaving him behind.

647
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,980
I didn't know don self had it in him.

648
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,230
Now that we know he's behind this,

649
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,010
Our situation's a lot worse.

650
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,620
We're not talking about our careers anymore.

651
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,340
We're talking about real jail time.

652
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,810
We get 15 years just for conducting

653
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,830
An unauthorized operation without congressional approval.

654
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,180
Or not.

655
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,710
This doesn't have to be about containment anymore.

656
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,440
It could be about excision.

657
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,870
You all right with that, senator?

658
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,810
Then they all go.

659
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,940
Where are the others?

660
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,440
Mahone, sucre, tancredi.

661
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,620
They're not coming.

662
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,040
Linc and I will testify, but the others...

663
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,340
Well, we all get immunity.

664
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,970
Those are the terms.

665
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,490
Our testimony alone will put self away.

666
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,600
Gentleman, we can't have the others running around

667
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,620
While we're trying to wrap this up.

668
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,030
Can we call 'em? Can we get 'em here?

669
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,170
The deal was for all of you. Those were the terms.

670
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,720
Without everybody, this is no deal.

671
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,950
Listen, pal, you're gonna get what you want, all right?

672
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,920
Are you gonna call them or not?

673
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,840
Hmm, there never was a deal, was there, senator?

674
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,190
I wish I could give you a better answer, michael,

675
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,240
But don self left a lot of rough edges.

676
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,430
We have to smooth them out.

677
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,850
You want to tell me where they are?

678
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,910
It ain't gonna happen.

679
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,150
I can get you self.

680
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,880
I can still get you scylla.

681
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,380
Scylla? Oh, we're past scylla.

682
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,940
Between getting it back and ending this now,

683
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,660
The choice is simple.

684
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,260
You wanted your supermax answer, you got it, richard.

685
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,290
Now time to go.

686
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,030
Escort mr. Sooter out.

687
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,340
I'm gonna count to five.

688
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,180
One,

689
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,200
Two,

690
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,900
Three...

691
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,010
Get you an apointment with the General

692
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,160
Here you go.

693
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,170
Wait right here.

694
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,380
Been a long time, gretchen.

695
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,620
No longer working for the general?

696
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,990
Correct.

697
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,110
Who's he?

698
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,040
I'm the guy that's holding scylla.

699
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,580
You interested?

700
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,330
Well, the general has offered a reward for anyone

701
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,330
Who can return scylla

702
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,710
Along with the heads of the transgressors.

703
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,490
I appreciate you allowing me the opportunity

704
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,430
To kick the general in the teeth.

705
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,780
Can I see?

706
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,380
All of you.

707
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,770
Sooter, please, I can give you cover.

708
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,890
Save it! Save it, senator, save it.

709
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,820
The general specifically asked that I bring you in alive.

710
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,190
Just move.

711
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,790
You were going to kill us, senator.

712
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,340
It was stanton who made that call.

713
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,850
Look, what was extremely complicated

714
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,400
30 seconds ago is not so now.

715
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,440
There were six people who knew

716
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,620
About this operation. Two of them are still alive.

717
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,600
One is now on the run-- and I'm the other.

718
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,810
And I'm not saying a word.

719
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,400
You're not getting off that easy, senator.

720
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,220
You are going to help us.

721
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,420
There is a folder in that briefcase

722
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,370
On the conference table.

723
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,420
It contains

724
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,790
The last remnants of this operation.

725
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,860
Once you dispose of it

726
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,870
None of this ever existed.

727
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,520
That's the saving grace

728
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,360
Of a covert operation.

729
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,500
If you want...

730
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,740
...It never happened.

731
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,240
I'm going to walk away now.

732
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,790
Catch a flight.

733
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,350
Maybe see my wife

734
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,220
Before she goes to bed.

735
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,450
I only hope I don't catch a bullet in the back

736
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,950
On my way out.

737
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,850
I'm really very sorry, gentlemen.

738
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,390
We tried.

739
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,410
We tried.

740
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,300
Let him go.

741
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,020
Linc,

742
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,980
Let him go.

743
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,300
Don't.

744
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,040
Let him go.

745
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,680
We running now?

746
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,040
I will kill you myself

747
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,150
The next time you do something like that.

748
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,510
Where's mahone?

749
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,890
He's gone.

750
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,600
Well, we can do business

751
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,620
When you get the rest of scylla.

752
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,840
What are you talking about?

753
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,880
It's incomplete.

754
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,600
Incom...? Wha--

755
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,550
Who is this clown?

756
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,470
Clown? Yeah, clown.

757
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,890
There's a piece missing, slick.

758
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,390
Look. Here.

759
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,350
Hello, don.

760
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,750
I believe you have something that belongs to me.

761
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,960
Come and get it.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
