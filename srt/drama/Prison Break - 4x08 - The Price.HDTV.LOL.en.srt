1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,170
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,740
If Scylla was like a pizza, all we got is a slice.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,640
So Scylla isn't one card.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,190
It's six.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,010
How long has it been happening?

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,000
It's not a big deal.

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,450
It was a big deal when you were 13.

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,900
Michael told you about mom?

9
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,820
No. As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,590
In her 30s, they started up again.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,340
How old was your mom when she passed away?

12
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,430
31. Michael's just turning 31.

13
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,540
Who's that?

14
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,580
That's the man that killed my son.

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,040
Yes?

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,500
It's like a digital Black hole.

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,170
It swallows up any electronic data within ten feet.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,960
Mr. Glenn?

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,240
We got a problem.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,770
What's that do?

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,540
It's a battery pack

22
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,910
For a video game console.

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,950
You'll need to buy a new one.

24
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,690
Scylla. Get it to me by tomorrow

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,110
And you will receive 50% of the fee.

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,580
Two Days, 25%.

27
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,850
Three Days,

28
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,530
I shoot you through the brain.

29
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,170
Who is this?

30
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,800
Hello, Michael.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,070
You know what?

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,190
If crab ever throws a psycho at us like this again,

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,540
I'm going to kill him.

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,420
Yeah, but if we Don't get this psycho, crab's going to kill us.

35
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,980
Just have the burner ready.

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,910
Got it covered.

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,890
After this job, I'm Done, man.

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,760
I can't do this anymore.

39
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,930
What do you think crab will say about that?

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,900
I Don't care what crab says about that.

41
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,020
How can I be a good father if I'm always in prison?

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,900
I missed out on my kid's childhood.

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,640
I'm not going to miss out on him becoming a man.

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,100
You know, not for nothing, but this plan is crazy even for you.

45
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,000
You sure this is the only way?

46
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,150
Yeah.

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,470
Hey look. He's coming out.

48
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,820
He's got the case.

49
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,090
Let's buckle up.

50
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,130
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

51
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,130
You're welcome.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,340
Let's go!

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,710
So wait a minute. This is your brilliant plan?

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,770
You're going to pull a kamikaze mission on the general's car?

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,160
Now that the device is gone,

56
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,890
Your opinion doesn't matter.

57
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,820
So shut up and pump.

58
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,010
We know the general travels light.

59
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,410
One limo and a couple of guards.

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,160
It ain't the guards I'm worried about; it's the crash.

61
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,130
Look, I never said this was going to be easy.

62
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,410
Just relax.

63
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,590
First off, Panama was a job.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,820
Some other Time.

65
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,210
What do you want with Scylla?

66
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,230
That's my business.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,940
We're not in Panama anymore,

68
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,290
And I'm not behind a fence, so, again,

69
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,460
What do you want with Scylla?

70
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,810
Same thing you want.

71
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,010
Bring down the Company.

72
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,310
Great. Then why Don't you

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,090
Give me those missing pages and disappear?

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,860
I'd love to. You remember that Day

75
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,310
At the Roosevelt when Whistler made off with Lief's card?

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
Who do you think took the fall for that?

77
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,120
Our names are at the Top of the Same hit list.

78
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,160
Now, I Don't know what arrangement you two have,

79
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,620
But I need some traveling money.

80
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,760
Let's talk about that later.

81
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,090
Why Don't we talk about the kind of scum

82
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,460
You're willing to put on the payroll?

83
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,710
Give me a way to do it without her, and we'll do it.

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,400
We need the pages.

85
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,570
It's a package deal.

86
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,320
Are we partners?

87
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,780
Partners.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,360
Look, I barely dropped a nickel in the slots, right?

89
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,480
This guy was all...

90
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,560
We ought to blanket party

91
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,250
Your ass. Where's the device?

92
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,690
Can it be salvaged? Tell him.

93
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,360
Pit boss walked off with it.

94
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,230
Okay. Well, we're going to call this your early retirement.

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,480
You can either go upstairs

96
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,930
And sit on your cot and ride ut the rest of this thing,

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,200
Or I can call agent Self

98
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,590
And you can ride out the rest of your prison sentence.

99
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,900
Your choice.

100
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,440
I need to talk to you.

101
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,660
So your brother told me about your nosebleeds.

102
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,370
And he told me about your mom.

103
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,650
That wasn't his place.

104
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,630
To be worried about you? When mom got sick,

105
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,770
Linc was at the hospital every Day, holding her hand,

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,630
Watching her die, and he was 13.

107
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,210
It changed him. It made him overprotective.

108
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,100
And now he's jumping

109
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,120
To all the wrong conclusions

110
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,190
For all the wrong reasons,

111
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,980
And it's... It's over nothing because

112
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,370
I'm fine.

113
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,520
You Don't look fine.

114
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,600
Well, maybe that's because

115
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,350
There's something I have to tell you.

116
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,510
Gretchen's alive.

117
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,120
She's working with t-bag,

118
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,700
And they have several pages from Whistler's bird book,

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,910
And they want in on Scylla.

120
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,550
Self is cutting them a deal as we speak.

121
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,730
Self knows that they have their own agenda,

122
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,630
But so do we

123
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,540
And as soon as we get those pages back,

124
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,080
Gretchen and t-bag are going to pay for everything.

125
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,470
They're going to get exactly what's coming to them.

126
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,640
Okay.

127
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,940
This isn't about Gretchen.

128
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,130
It's not about any one person.

129
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,700
And we... We have to finish it.

130
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,450
I need a minute.

131
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,740
Please.

132
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,210
I can't believe this!

133
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,760
What choice do we have?

134
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,990
Gretchen's on the team.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,840
Like it or not,

136
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,090
We need those pages. Another perra

137
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,230
We're jumping in bed with?

138
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,760
Not exactly new territory for us.

139
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,440
I Don't care who we gotta partner up with.

140
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,160
We get those papers, we make with the break-in,

141
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,450
We get this job Done.

142
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,520
She could still have ties to the Company, man. I Don't know.

143
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,610
We'll worry about Gretchen when the Time is right.

144
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,280
For now, let's focus on the general.

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,660
This thing with Gretchen doesn't change a thing.

146
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,760
We're, uh...

147
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,070
We're still close.

148
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,410
Closer to Scylla, farther from Wyatt.

149
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,090
You Don't know that.

150
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,680
Just stay focused, all right?

151
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,350
This is my focus, okay?

152
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,430
I'm doing the job, okay? All right? All right?

153
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Every Day, the trail to my son's killer gets a little bit colder.

154
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,460
That's all I do is focus.

155
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,620
What are you doing?

156
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,410
Um... It's just... Uh...

157
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,180
We're going to need that downstairs.

158
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,470
Yeah. I'll just, uh... Be up here.

159
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,340
Message sent.

160
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,590
How much for Scofield and Burrows?

161
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,960
I see you two have come to an agreement.

162
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,700
She's on work release,

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,540
Just like you.

164
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,480
What kind of work?

165
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,630
You and the secretary keep things quiet in the office

166
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,330
While Michael tunnels to Scylla.

167
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,270
You really think

168
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,170
Scofield's gonna keep his word, huh?

169
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,080
You horsewhipped the woman he loves.

170
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,350
Michael wants Scylla just as badly as we do.

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,080
Yeah, he wanted out of prison, too.

172
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,490
Our partnership lasted long enough for that to happen,

173
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,600
And then... We parted ways.

174
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,690
Trust me.

175
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,140
Yeah, um, go on in, sir.

176
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,170
Scofield will use you

177
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,120
And then he's gonna bury the knife in your back

178
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,210
For what you did to his lady friend. Mr. Pfeiffer. Cole.

179
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,710
Where's Scylla?

180
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,700
Good morning to you, too, sir.

181
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,340
Gentlemen.

182
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,060
I gave you three Days.

183
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,650
Where's Scylla?

184
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,730
I...

185
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,480
Now, uh, mr. Feng, let's not do anything rash.

186
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,220
So you're Feng.

187
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,930
We haven't actually met in person.

188
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,770
I was the liaison between the Company and your

189
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,220
Chinese employers on operation copperhead.

190
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,180
Susan?

191
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,550
That's right.

192
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,730
You went from working for the Company

193
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,110
To stealing the one thing that could destroy them.

194
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,440
That's a tight turn.

195
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,180
With a price that Scylla commands on the open market,

196
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,460
Anybody would turn.

197
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,170
Which is, by the way, 200.

198
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,930
Our paths never crossed on copperhead,

199
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,440
But I did deal with one of your colleagues;

200
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,570
A less-capable associate.

201
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,390
Whatever happened to him?

202
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,250
He was skinned and hung from an overpass.

203
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,380
Oh, yes, I recall.

204
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,010
He couldn't deliver on promises made.

205
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,840
You may also recall that he was my predecessor.

206
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,110
When I joined copperhead, you got what you wanted.

207
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,660
You'll get Scylla, too.

208
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
If I Don't,

209
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,050
I'll peel you like a wet grape.

210
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,090
And the price is 100.

211
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,360
150.

212
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,940
125. Don't disappoint me.

213
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,010
Well, 125...

214
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,180
Million.

215
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,440
Well, then,

216
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,590
Susan, Gretchen, whatever your name is,

217
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,550
I suggest you find a way to bury the hatchet

218
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,680
With Michael Scofield's woman.

219
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,730
We got work to do.

220
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,630
Why do I get the feeling that some poor bastard woke up

221
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,220
To an empty driveway this morning?

222
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,250
Relax, we got it from a scrap yard.

223
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,450
And you're pinning the hopes

224
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,710
Of the entire mission on that relic?

225
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,490
If it was card one, I'd say no.

226
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,580
If this was card five,

227
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,590
I'd say no, but it's the last card.

228
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,590
I really think we can stage a hit-and-run

229
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,880
And get away with it.

230
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,710
All right, we know where this guy works.

231
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,700
We know his route.

232
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,300
I'm gonna wait for him at this intersection.

233
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,860
He drives through.

234
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,180
I smash him with my car, get the card.

235
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,970
And if by some miracle you walked away from the crash,

236
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,710
The general's gonna know that you ripped him off.

237
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,860
Not if I pump him full of morphine first.

238
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,700
The general's gonna wake up tomorrow morning in the hospital

239
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,080
Feeling happy as a clam with no idea what happened to him.

240
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,930
When he's out cold,

241
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,840
We download the card onto the laptop

242
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,120
And put the original back on him.

243
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,810
And you Don't think this is gonna look suspicious

244
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,410
For the paramedics that show up at the scene?

245
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,310
That depends on who the paramedics are.

246
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,290
At the federal impound lot downtown,

247
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,710
There are currently four ambulances seized

248
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,370
In a drug-smuggling ring.

249
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,730
All we need is one.

250
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,920
Go make yourself useful.

251
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,380
Time was commanders would assemble their troops

252
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,950
Before a battle and rehearse schemes of maneuver

253
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,710
On a square of dirt using rocks to depict enemy positions.

254
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,910
They called these rehearsals "rock drills."

255
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,710
Laos was our rock drill. Now...

256
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,190
...It's Time for the battle to commence.

257
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,770
Griffin.

258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,440
Flooding the laotian market with counterfeit kip

259
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,910
Was highly effective.

260
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,700
In phase two, the effect will take longer,

261
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,710
But the result will inevitably be the Same.

262
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,990
I'm signing off on the order to open up

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,150
The next theater of operations.

264
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,390
Excuse me.

265
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,270
The message is untraceable.

266
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,770
Someone went to a lot of trouble

267
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,300
To cover their tracks.

268
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,720
How do we know this person can deliver the brothers?

269
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,010
We Don't.

270
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,230
Bait the hook.

271
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,830
See if he bites.

272
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,320
Hey-hey, my friend!

273
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,710
Who the hell are you?

274
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,290
Don Self, homeland security.

275
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,710
Phil Stroger.

276
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
How's it going? Good.

277
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,110
This is a grande.

278
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,630
This thing cost me nine bucks.

279
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,430
You california types and your gourmet coffee.

280
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,020
Hey, can I help you with something?

281
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,380
This is a federal impound lot, correct?

282
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,070
Yeah.

283
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,390
Okay, I think it's pretty obvious, Phil, I need a car.

284
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,350
So you told Sara about the nosebleeds, huh?

285
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm worried about you.

286
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,090
Well, why Don't you stop

287
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,780
Starting fires that I have to put out?

288
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,710
Mom couldn't outrun this. What makes you think you...?

289
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,630
It's not mom, all right? That was 20 years ago.

290
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,760
This is different. It's totally different.

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,110
Get in.

292
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,780
So my section chief comes over to the rookie's stretcher

293
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,800
And he goes, "you got one hell of a workman's comp claim, kid."

294
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,710
Hey, uh, let's get that trip ticket started.

295
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,780
Looks like I can hook you up

296
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,870
With a Sedan for your stakeout.

297
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,040
You know what, Phil? I gotta go.

298
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,790
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,590
I just remembered.

300
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,660
I got to give a briefing to a bunch of higher-ups.

301
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,500
Can I come back

302
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,660
For the Sedan?

303
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,100
Suit yourself, self.

304
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,170
I'll be back.

305
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,290
Don Self.

306
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,370
I need you to deliver a message.

307
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,260
Okay.

308
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,810
I see your boyfriend's no longer sporting

309
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,130
The latest fashion in gps technology.

310
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,180
So, if neither one of you are wearing ankle monitors,

311
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,580
What are you still doing here?

312
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,230
You should be having hot fugitive sex

313
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,190
In every cash only no-tell motel

314
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,270
From here to mexico.

315
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,550
Some things are more important

316
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,320
Than what two people want, Roland.

317
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,840
I honestly hope that someday that makes sense to you.

318
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,440
Look, Sara...

319
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,060
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,110
For vegas.

321
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,890
I'm sorry for vegas.

322
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,210
Hello?

323
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,110
Listen, I have a message for you from Gretchen.

324
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,030
She wants to meet with you tonight at 7:00 p.M.

325
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,540
At the Safari motel

326
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,780
On 109. Why?

327
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,710
She says she wants to clear the air,

328
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Whatever that means.

329
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,200
Sara?

330
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,180
I'm not interested.

331
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,800
Okay.

332
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
I got a bad feeling about this.

333
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm the one on point. You're in the ambulance.

334
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,280
Why are you so worried?

335
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,200
I just got a feeling.

336
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,960
If anything should happen,

337
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,730
Call my mom in chicago.

338
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Tell her I didn't die like a damn convict

339
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,830
Locked up in some penitentiary.

340
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,400
Nothing's gonna happen.

341
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,470
You ready for this?

342
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah. Me and Sucre got this.

343
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,320
I know you do.

344
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,160
Good luck.

345
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,760
All right.

346
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,950
1 million--for the brothers. Today.

347
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,940
Done.

348
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm in position.

349
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,250
Got it, Alex.

350
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,440
The rest of us are standing by

351
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,730
At the intersection.

352
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,610
No one's expecting you

353
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,780
To actually treat this bastard, right?

354
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,170
Yeah, I'm still a doctor.

355
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,580
Sucre, how you guys doing?

356
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,940
Sucre?

357
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,690
Got to be kidding me.

358
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,160
Sucre, you copy?

359
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,460
We're good.

360
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,340
Being as I was the original recipient

361
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,030
Of the late mr. Whistler's artwork...

362
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,950
What's my cut?

363
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,070
$25 million.

364
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,700
Just so you know,

365
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,380
I have a very keen sense of ownership.

366
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,160
Six headstones

367
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,040
In Coosa county cemetery can attest to that fact.

368
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,460
The names on those grave markers

369
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,710
Took a six pack of schlitz I had cooling in the river.

370
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,440
That particular transgression put me back five bucks.

371
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,250
Imagine what I'd do for $25 million.

372
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,070
You'll get your cut.

373
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,470
But you're gonna earn it.

374
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,100
And how much of that payday

375
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,180
Is Scofield and his crew earning?

376
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,440
Oh, I doubt they'll be around to collect.

377
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,590
There's a lot of blood being spilled

378
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,740
And a lot of money being

379
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,410
Offered up for just a little old Black book.

380
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,170
What's so funny?

381
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,180
That everyone thinks that Scylla

382
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,370
Is just the Company's little Black book.

383
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,760
How do I know I can trust you?

384
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:01,890
King Willow now.

385
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,550
Hey, buddy.

386
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,900
I understand from Lincoln your mom had a hamartoma

387
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,840
In her right frontal lobe.

388
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,960
That's right.

389
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,530
When a tumor like that gets large enough to be problematic,

390
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,200
It's gonna come with a lot of symptoms.

391
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,700
Loss of short-term memory,

392
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,240
Problems with your depth perception,

393
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,770
Problems with your motor skills.

394
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,220
If you had anything like that,

395
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,400
You'd let me know. Yes, but I haven't.

396
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,920
And I won't.

397
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,680
And I'm fine.

398
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,240
Michael.

399
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,770
The general is leaving.

400
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,570
All right, everybody get ready.

401
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,640
You doing all right?

402
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,620
Fine. Just not so good around blood is all.

403
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,820
I'll take care of the messy part,

404
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,460
You just help me get him on the gurney.

405
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,990
Doesn't take two people to crash a car, you know.

406
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,740
You're kidding me, right?

407
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,440
After all I've been through with you?

408
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,520
Now you're worried about my ass?

409
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,430
Shut up and drive, okay?

410
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,710
Buckle up.

411
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,300
What is it?

412
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,580
Linc, we got him. He's two blocks away from you.

413
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,740
We're on it.

414
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,620
Here we go.

415
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,340
What's he doing?

416
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,190
Something's wrong.

417
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,430
He's turning around.

418
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,720
Linc, pull back! It's a trap.

419
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,890
Let's get out of here.

420
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,760
What the...?! Sucre, get down!

421
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,630
Come on, Linc!

422
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,810
Faster!

423
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,920
Keep your head down!

424
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,110
Hang on!

425
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,220
You all right?!

426
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,990
Stay with me.

427
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,920
Stay with us, Fernando. You're going to be all right.

428
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,340
He came straight at us. We were set up.

429
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,860
So you're saying that they knew we were going to be there?

430
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,160
Then they know about this place. That's exactly what I'm saying.

431
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,940
Brad, I'm gonna need some gauze. Somebody could be coming here right now.

432
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,770
If they knew about this place, we'd already be dead.

433
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,980
What about that Gretchen chick?

434
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,400
She's got a couple of pages from Whistler's bird book.

435
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,910
It doesn't make her psychic.

436
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,960
Brad, I need some gauze.

437
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,210
Trust me now.

438
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,420
Well, it looks like someone set us up.

439
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,940
Seriously? Yeah.

440
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,320
And I'm wondering if it was you.

441
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,550
Okay, first you give me the leper treatment,

442
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,290
And now I'm a traitor

443
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,150
Is that right? Come on, Roland, who else

444
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,070
Could've known we were going

445
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,010
At that intersection? You know what, just because

446
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,830
I didn't do Time with you guys, it doesn't make me a rat.

447
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,880
All right? I put just as much into this job

448
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,830
As anybody else.

449
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,050
Okay, I make one little mistake

450
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,190
And all of a sudden I'm judas?

451
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,300
No, you know what? You know, no.

452
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,130
Call Self, okay, because... Because I'm gonna go back

453
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,690
To the can. I'm Done with this... All right.

454
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,160
Just calm down. Calm down.

455
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,730
I want you to look up

456
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,140
All the local businesses at the corner

457
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,420
Of king and willow.

458
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,700
I need the ones with exterior security cameras,

459
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,800
'cause I'm looking for a license plate number,

460
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,920
All right?

461
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,270
How about an apology?

462
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,390
Where the hell is Scofield?

463
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,380
We've been waiting for him to break ground all Day.

464
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,260
He's taking care of one last thing.

465
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,450
He'll be here in the morning.

466
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,420
And Sara, what'd she say about our meeting?

467
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,710
She's not interested.

468
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,290
Okay, well, if she changes her mind, I'll be there.

469
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,700
Just so everyone knows,

470
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,900
This is Sara's last chance to settle up.

471
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,570
I want all the grievances out on the table

472
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,020
So we can move forward.

473
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,680
Listen to me, skank.

474
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,740
You just got your stripes

475
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,700
Ripped off your sleeve by your old boss.

476
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,850
So whatever clout you had with the Company,

477
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,020
It's gone.

478
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,490
You work for me now.

479
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,700
So you can try to pull rank on the hick here

480
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,660
All you want,

481
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,870
But Don't mistake my patience for weakness.

482
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,050
You're alive right now

483
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,610
Because I'm allowing you to be.

484
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,540
So when I get Scylla,

485
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,020
You'll get your traveling money.

486
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,360
And when this is over,

487
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,760
If you step one foot

488
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,660
On american soil, I'm gonna take

489
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,830
This gun...

490
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,450
And I'm gonna put a bullet

491
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,840
Right there.

492
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,900
And that goes for you, too, gummo.

493
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,550
Are we clear?

494
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,060
We're clear.

495
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,330
Here. I made this.

496
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,210
It's a chart of all

497
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,670
The people coming in and out of the office,

498
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,340
Showing which Times of the Day are the busiest

499
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,070
And which are best for digging.

500
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,060
Just answer the phones.

501
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,880
I'll handle this.

502
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,560
Did you get it?

503
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,750
Hold on.

504
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,980
Hurry up.

505
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,440
Why are we doing

506
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,410
This again?

507
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,470
It's an insurance policy.

508
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,510
If she tries to get out of that big Scylla payday.

509
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,510
How big of a payday?

510
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,820
One million dollars.

511
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,340
You put a gun on me again,

512
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,510
And these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

513
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,420
From this moment on, we are allies.

514
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,770
She watching?

515
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,130
Yes.

516
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,620
Brace yourself.

517
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,710
For what?

518
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,250
Don't you ever

519
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,150
Come in my office again unless you're summoned!

520
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,650
Burrows was in the car.

521
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,520
It appears our source is dependable.

522
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,500
When I said bait the hook, I did not mean with me.

523
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,470
They came that close to killing me.

524
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,980
I wouldn't let that happen.

525
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,700
But if you're unhappy with my methods,

526
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,200
Maybe you should parcel out the job to someone else.

527
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,140
I Don't accept resignations.

528
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,940
Close the deal with the mystery man

529
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,780
And bring the brothers to me today

530
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,100
Or your severence pay will be a body bag.

531
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,700
Broad Daylight, city street, and they knew your route.

532
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,100
If Scofield's mission

533
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,410
Was to kill you,

534
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,070
He'd have a better way to do it.

535
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,160
Sara, you need anything? I'm good, Michael.

536
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,270
I'm good.

537
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,390
You are going be just fine.

538
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,620
Almost Done, Fernando.

539
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,920
Here you go.

540
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,850
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, doc.

541
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,550
Mm-hmm. Just wait till you get my bill.

542
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,070
Hang in there, Sucre.

543
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,420
Even if the warehouse ain't on the Company's radar,

544
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,750
We sure as hell are.

545
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,090
This job's over. You Don't know that.

546
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,320
I ain't going back to Fox River, I know that.

547
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,670
What do you think Self is gonna do

548
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,530
When he finds out the Company made us?

549
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,740
We're about to find out.

550
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,110
Yeah?

551
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,550
Hey, where the hell is Roland?

552
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,390
His gps just went offline.

553
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,520
I'm here.

554
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,240
Took the corolla.

555
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,720
Take his laptop, too? Yeah.

556
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,530
Alex.

557
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,240
You doing okay?

558
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,380
How much longer? Almost.

559
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,040
Hey, you got this covered?

560
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,720
What are you still doing here?

561
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,500
Go get the son of a bitch.

562
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,970
All Done.

563
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,170
You got my money?

564
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,700
Oh, yo, I thought this

565
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,410
Was going to be a legit business transaction, okay?

566
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,450
You Don't got my money, I Don't got

567
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,410
The location of the brothers. Where are they?

568
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,860
Oh, god!

569
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,920
What are you doing?! What are you doing?!

570
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,320
Sara...

571
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,570
Hi, Sara.

572
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,380
A former mentor of mine once told me a story

573
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,560
That I think applies to this situation.

574
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,860
At the end of the civil war, grant's union army

575
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,800
Had lee's confederate soldiers outflanked at appomattox.

576
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,790
Lee understood the futility of more bloodshed,

577
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,810
So he requested a cease-fire.

578
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,930
He wanted to bring an end to the fighting.

579
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,420
Soldiers that had been killing each other that morning,

580
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,290
Walked across the lines that afternoon

581
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,770
For the first Time as allies

582
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,100
To trade northern coffee for southern tobacco.

583
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,840
Now, I Don't expect us to exchange gifts,

584
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,500
But that doesn't mean we can't be allies.

585
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,320
Of course, you can't have a cease-fire

586
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,270
Without both parties

587
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,620
Getting what they want.

588
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,810
You have five minutes.

589
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,690
Put as many scars on my back as possible.

590
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,270
I Don't want to rush you, but you have four minutes left.

591
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,180
What was her name?

592
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,850
This is a one-time deal, Sara.

593
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,930
You want your pound of flesh, you take it now.

594
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,100
What was her name? Who?

595
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,960
The guard--

596
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,610
The one you shot and left to die in my arms.

597
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,020
That's what this is about?

598
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,170
A guard that couldn't do her job?

599
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,330
What was her name?

600
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,110
What was her name?

601
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,610
Taylor.

602
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,220
Her first name?

603
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,090
Michelle... I think.

604
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,920
You should know that this isn't about me.

605
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,040
I can handle the scars you put on my back,

606
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,480
But what you did to Michelle...

607
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,290
I had orders. She tried to help you escape.

608
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,330
She did help me escape. She didn't try.

609
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,990
Sara...

610
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,180
You were too busy making an example out of her

611
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,730
To find the key that she left with me.

612
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,360
Then she got what she deserved.

613
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,890
She saved my life.

614
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,460
And you took hers.

615
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,060
You proved your point.

616
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,790
We're even.

617
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,370
We're a long way from even.

618
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,650
And when this is over, you'll pay for Michelle.

619
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,610
Where are they?

620
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,780
The thing about a gunshot to the kneecap--

621
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,150
It takes Days to die from it.

622
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,780
Now, if I were to shoot you, let's say,

623
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,020
Here...

624
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,010
The hollow point would tumble through you

625
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,190
Leaving White-hot slivers in your insides,

626
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,740
Causing unimaginable pain.

627
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,830
Only ending when you bled out on this pavement.

628
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,290
You Don't want that, do you?

629
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,730
Then tell me where the brothers are.

630
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,760
They're in a warehouse.

631
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,700
Pier 31, San Pedro-- they're all there.

632
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,350
Please... Thank you.

633
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,110
No!

634
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,260
What are you doing?!

635
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,200
I told you what you wanted...!

636
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,690
No no no!

637
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,580
All right, all right!

638
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,510
Enough.

639
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,580
You'll get your shot. Now back off.

640
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,010
Alex, listen to him.

641
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,530
Hey, hey, you'll get your shot, man.

642
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,960
You'll get your shot.

643
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,540
Michael, come on. He sold us out.

644
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,740
What are you doing?

645
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,100
We got to go.

646
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,420
Wait... Wait...

647
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,040
Wait...

648
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,610
Michael, let's go.

649
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,130
Don't hand me any more updates.

650
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,540
They're surveilling me.

651
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,250
They're coming after me.

652
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,550
General, we'll get them.

653
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,120
This isn't the first Time someone's

654
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,520
Made an attempt on your life.

655
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,920
This is not an attempt on my life.

656
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,720
This is an attempt on my card.

657
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,760
Get Wyatt.

658
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,190
We're trying to contact him.

659
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,950
Don't try anything-- just get Wyatt.

660
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,830
How do you want to proceed?

661
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,280
I want it moved.

662
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,500
To make the necessary arrangements for security

663
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,500
Would take Days.

664
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,320
I Don't care about logistics.

665
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,390
I want it moved.

666
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,390
Move Scylla.

667
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,330
