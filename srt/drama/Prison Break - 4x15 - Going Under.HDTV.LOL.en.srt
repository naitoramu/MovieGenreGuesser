1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,330
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,000
Michael!

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,730
Scylla is complete.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,660
What the hell are you doing?!

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,330
The buyer is already on the way.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,960
Yeah, I got one.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,230
It's Bagwell.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,560
There is no meeting with the attorney general, is there?

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,700
He's sick, Lincoln.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,560
If they haven't killed him already...

11
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,230
We'll get him back, I promise.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,860
Michael needs an operation to remove a tumor

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,260
from his temporal lobe.

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,000
The price of the operation is the safe return of Scylla.

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
What's that?

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,000
Added incentive.

17
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,860
What's going on?

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,500
Where's Michael?

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,660
Michael needs surgery; he's gonna get it.

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,000
Where?

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,560
Here. What?

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,160
Krantz has arranged for the best doctors in the world.

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,830
We can't let them near him.

24
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,100
We're out of time.

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,400
It's our last option.

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,830
I don't understand why the Company would help him.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,230
Dr. Tancredi, welcome.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,100
Please...

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,030
there's nothing to be afraid of.

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,930
All we want is to help.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,760
You're going to save Michael?

32
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,600
You question our capabilities?

33
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,600
No. I'm questioning your motives.

34
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,430
When a fellow human being is suffering,

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,230
why would we not want to lend a hand?

36
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Empathy, Sara,

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,400
it's the only thing that separates us from the beasts.

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,300
For the duration of the surgery,

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,430
you'll be treated as a guest in my home.

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
And afterwards?

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,930
Sir... the patient is ready.

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,400
It's going to be all right, Sara.

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,630
Trust me.

44
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,600
Mr. Scofield, although you're going to be anesthetized

45
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,060
and should feel no significant pain, we will need to keep

46
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,500
you awake for the duration of the procedure.

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,100
As a safety precaution, we'll need to continually monitor

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,060
your speech and sensory activity to insure the tissue

49
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,160
being removed will not leave you impaired in any way.

50
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,130
What hospital is this?

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,460
Don't worry about it. You've got some good doctors

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,300
who are going to take great care of you.

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,630
I have to get Scylla.

54
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,160
No, no, no, no.

55
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,530
Not now.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,330
Where's Linc?

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
He's here.

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,060
He's just fine.

59
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,260
I'm not leaving until Michael has his surgery.

60
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,230
And I'm not starting surgery until you prove

61
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,500
you can hold up your end of the deal.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,100
Scylla's slipping through our fingers as we speak.

63
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,960
Time is not on our side, nor on your brother's.

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, you'll get full cooperation

65
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,800
from my office.

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,930
If you need anything, just call this number.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm gonna need everything you've got on Self and Gretchen.

68
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,260
Aliases, whatever you got.

69
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,360
How about an accomplice?

70
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, if you're gonna want...

71
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,200
Shut up.

72
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,460
You can save yourself a lot of pain

73
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,460
and the embarrassment of begging me to stop

74
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,230
if you just tell me where they are.

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,630
Gretchen and Agent Turncoat?

76
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,830
Yeah.

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,700
Information like that seems like it could be

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,730
of a certain intrinsic value.

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,530
If there were offers made,

80
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,630
carrots dangled, I could see...

81
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,430
Look, I deserve some kind of something here,

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,160
all the work I put in.

83
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,260
If it wasn't for me finding Whistler's bird book then...

84
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,530
The only thing you deserve is the opportunity

85
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,360
to keep your teeth and fingernails.

86
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,330
No. You...

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,930
I'm gonna pull out every single tooth, every single one.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,230
How about it?

90
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,500
Look, I was just fooling...

91
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,030
: All right!

92
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,900
Arlington Pier! Arling... Arlington Pier!

93
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,400
When? What time?

94
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,730
Three o'clock.

95
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,800
This is the last of the anesthetic

96
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,230
From here on out, you shouldn't feel a thing, Mr. Scofield.

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,730
I'm going to be right over there the whole time.

98
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,930
I'll be right in here the whole time.

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
We're ready.

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm not going to leave you, okay?

101
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,260
Don't you dare leave me.

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
How many surgeries has your team performed using the gamma knife?

103
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,660
The gamma knife has

104
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,760
a recurrence rate of over 13 percent.

105
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,430
We'll be using a technique that's more advanced.

106
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,530
What's going on with Michael?

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
They're gonna operate.

108
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,060
Just like that, they agreed to do that?

109
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,930
I convinced them Michael knew who was gonna buy Scylla.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,760
What are we gonna do?

111
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,230
Get our hands on it before they do.

112
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,500
And give it to who? I'm still working on that.

113
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,830
Linc, I need to know what we're doing.

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
We finish this! Really?

115
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,960
'Cause it feels like it's finishing us.

116
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,230
You, me... we're the only ones left, bro.

117
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,700
One more day and we're done.

118
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
I can't do this without you.

119
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,200
When the buyer gets here,

120
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,760
why don't you let me do the talking.

121
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,030
For what?

122
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,130
I engineered this whole thing, Gretchen.

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,430
I can handle my business.

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,830
Oh, yeah? Why don't you start

125
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,860
by handling that river of nerves

126
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,600
that's running down your forehead.

127
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,700
Did you think this would be easier?

128
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,860
I hoped.

129
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,100
But I guess I always knew

130
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,030
it was going to come down to a pile of bodies.

131
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,730
I never pegged you for a killer.

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
Yeah, well, I never pegged you for a mom.

133
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,460
Is there anything that you'd like to peg me for, Don?

134
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,360
Oh, stop. Okay. Don't embarrass yourself.

135
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,860
That may work on everyone else, but right now,

136
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,600
the only thing I'm thinking about is that $125 million.

137
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,830
So close up your blouse and open your eyes,

138
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,360
because the buyer's on the way.

139
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,630
And I don't want any surprises when he gets here.

140
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,160
How much longer?

141
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,430
Another hour or so. Just sit tight.

142
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,300
I need to use the men's room.

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
Congratulations.

144
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you think I'm gonna do, run?

145
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,260
That's exactly what I think you're gonna do.

146
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,100
You want me to go in the back seat, right here?

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
I want you to have a little bit of respect

148
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,500
for my intelligence, Alex.

149
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,660
I do, which is why I know you wouldn't violate

150
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,000
Code 42-13-72B, which states that an individual

151
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,500
being transported by a representative

152
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,230
of the criminal justice system must be afforded the opportunity

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,660
to relieve himself

154
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,960
if the duration of the transport is more than three hours.

155
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,600
And I do believe we're creeping up on that time.

156
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,200
All right, I'll see what I can do.

157
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,130
But I'm going to remind you of a code.

158
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,500
The one that says if a prisoner attempts escape during transfer,

159
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,600
the accompanying agent has the right to shoot them

160
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,030
through the back of the head.

161
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,530
You sure you don't want to hold it, Alex?

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,600
Any pain or discomfort, Mr. Scofield?

164
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,300
No.

165
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,930
Those needles, they're for... stabilization?

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Not exactly. Throughout the surgery, different portions

167
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,100
of Michael's cerebral cortex will be stimulated,

168
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,830
triggering the areas

169
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,730
that control senses like hearing, smell, memory.

170
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,460
That's why some people,

171
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,460
right before death, often speak of...

172
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,730
Their life flashing before their eyes.

173
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
Exactly.

174
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,230
When oxygen is cut off to the brain,

175
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,860
it kicks into overdrive, tapping into every resource

176
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,000
to continue operating the body.

177
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,660
As a result, all of the senses fire off at once.

178
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,900
Everything you've ever known, felt, believed...

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,260
it all passes in a blink of an eye.

180
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,000
Ь§вы

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,330
Charles?

182
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,270
I guess you can probably call me DB now.

183
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,000
The answer is no.

184
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,370
The answer?

185
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,400
You're wondering if you're dead.

186
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,170
The answer is no.

187
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,400
Then why am I here?

188
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,700
I   lieve that's a question

189
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,730
we all need to find the answer to.

190
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,230
This is officially now the most secure bathroom break

191
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,670
in the history of law enforcement.

192
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,130
Yes, it is.

193
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,630
Hey, look, if you want to cuff me, block off all the exits,

194
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,800
take it out and give it a tap, if it makes you happy.

195
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,100
Would that make you feel happy, Alex?

196
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,170
I hear prison can change a man.

197
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,600
Can we just get this over with.

198
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,670
All clear.

199
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,530
You have 15 seconds.

200
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,500
You should've trusted me,

201
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,770
like I trusted you.

202
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,730
All right.

203
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,930
We're ready to begin to isolate the tumor now, Mr. Scofield.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,870
As we talked about,

205
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,670
I'm going to ask you to slowly recite the alphabet.

206
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,300
If you have any trouble finding a letter,

207
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,830
any problem saying a letter,

208
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,130
you let us know. All right?

209
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,300
All right.

210
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,200
Okay.

211
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,470
Ready?

212
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,930
And begin.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,430
A...

214
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,830
B...

215
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,870
C...

216
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,770
D...

217
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,470
E...

218
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:38,600
F...

219
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,670
G...

220
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,530
H...

221
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,630
I'm sorry, Charles.

222
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,830
For what?

223
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
For everything.

224
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,800
For all the lies I told.

225
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,430
For all the pain I caused.

226
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,270
Are you asking for forgiveness?

227
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,670
I'm not sure I'm entitled to it.

228
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,030
I guess that's for a power

229
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,330
higher than us to decide, isn't it?

230
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,430
It's just hard... hard to believe we've lost,

231
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
that it was all for nothing.

232
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,100
It doesn't have to be.

233
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,300
It looks like

234
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,300
the tumor is nestled behind the hippocampus.

235
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,000
WESTMORELAND:  You have the answers, Michael.

236
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,170
What are the questions?

237
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,100
I don't know, but you do.

238
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,570
You just haven't realized it yet.

239
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,930
Up here, make a right.

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,570
No, no, left, left, left.

241
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,770
We got ten minutes-- what do you think?

242
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,930
It's gonna be tight.

243
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,530
All right, any minute now.

244
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,230
There's no sign of him.

245
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,470
Check Vikan's PDA.

246
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,800
See if the buyer left him a message.

247
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,130
SELF: Oh, this thing is broken.

248
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,500
It must have cracked when he hit the ground.

249
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,270
Can you still see the contact number?

250
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,630
Yeah, it's a Miami area code.

251
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,530
Okay, read it out-- I'll put it in mine.

252
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
No, no, I'm not reading out anything.

253
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,100
I'm gonna keep that number

254
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,530
for now, if you don't mind.

255
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,630
Who is it?

256
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,100
It's my sister.

257
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,870
Don't answer it.

258
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,470
I said don't answer it.

259
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,800
Shoot me.

260
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,570
Hello?

261
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,570
RITA: We're free.

262
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,570
He's gone.

263
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,570
What?

264
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,000
The... the guy

265
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,970
with the, uh, fake hand... he let us go,

266
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,000
so we, uh... we ran across the street to the Patels' house,

267
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,630
and a couple minutes later, I looked out the window,

268
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,630
and I saw these, uh...

269
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,430
these two guys in, uh...

270
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,100
in these suits, and they, uh, dragged him off

271
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,200
into some van. All right, Gretchen, put Bagwell on the phone.

272
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,930
He's not there. Gretchen, I'm not playing anymore...

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,630
Don, the Company took him.

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,470
How's Emily?

275
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,800
She's... She's fine.

276
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,500
Listen, Gretchen.

277
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,130
You need to stay away from us.

278
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,470
For everyone's sake.

279
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,970
Here, baby.

280
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,100
Bye, Auntie.

281
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Forget that hick, Bagwell.

282
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,270
No, I can't.

283
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,900
He knows the location of the exchange.

284
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,170
If he knows we're here...

285
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,130
then the Company does, too.

286
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,830
Hey, that's it.

287
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,570
Right there-- Arlington Pier.

288
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,630
Pull over.

289
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,370
Blood, papi.

290
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,930
We just missed them.

291
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll go look around.

292
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,100
FEMALE : Operations.

293
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,900
The General said to call this number if I needed help.

294
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,730
Your clearance code, please.

295
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,430
Clearance code?

296
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,730
How about I'm Lincoln Burrows and you're about to lose Scylla?

297
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,500
Proceed.

298
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,030
I need to trace this line.

299
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,170
We've already tried.

300
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,400
You're in a zone

301
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,730
where visual surveillance is an impossibility.

302
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, how about you look

303
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,970
outside the zone and check for a vehicle leaving

304
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,270
in the last 15 minutes.

305
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,430
If you see one, get a match and call me.

306
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,700
Nothing.

307
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,170
No tracks, but I found these.

308
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,230
They know we're onto them.

309
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,100
We got to find these people before they split.

310
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,900
Someone's here, but it's not the seller.

311
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,270
What do you want me to do?

312
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,230
I'm just curious, Lang.

313
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,630
When did you decide to turn your back on me?

314
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,430
Probably about the same time

315
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,730
you decided to become a fugitive.

316
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,600
I wasn't talking to you.

317
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,570
I took an oath to uphold the law, Alex.

318
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,100
Did you do it for a promotion?

319
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,530
Did they promise you anything to serve me up?

320
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,630
The only thing I ever wanted was your safety, Alex.

321
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,730
The longer you're on the run,

322
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,100
the lower my chance of getting what I want.

323
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,130
What you looking for out there, Alex?

324
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,470
There.

325
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,170
Agent Wheeler-- I've got a suspect

326
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,000
fleeing custody off Route 14

327
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,400
about three miles north of Greenburg.

328
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,800
Requesting backup and air support.

329
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,300
I didn't mean to startle you.

330
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,100
What are you doing here?

331
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,830
Customer service.

332
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,470
Quality control.

333
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,200
I like to keep a hand in all our theaters of engagement.

334
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,170
Spoken like a military man.

335
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,200
So easy to discuss lives in the balance when it's just theater.

336
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,330
I admire your devotion, Sara.

337
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,870
It's an attribute I value above all others,

338
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,770
but I wonder...

339
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,370
is it the cause

340
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,830
you believe in or the man?

341
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,530
I mean, are you an ideologue

342
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,800
or just a silly schoolgirl following the brooding boy

343
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,000
who finally noticed her?

344
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,530
I'm the girl whose father was murdered,

345
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,630
who's looking for the bastard responsible.

346
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,900
Would you like me to make a few phone calls,

347
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,570
see if I can point you

348
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,300
in the right direction?

349
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,000
You can relax, he's receiving

350
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,130
the best possible care.

351
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
Is he?

352
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,100
Because I've never seen this equipment before,

353
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,870
and I've never seen this procedure.

354
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,230
It's experimental, isn't it?

355
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,670
Well, you could say that, but it has been used once before.

356
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,300
How long did the patient live?

357
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,630
Dr. Tancredi,

358
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,500
I know your opinion of the work we do here, but know this.

359
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,570
Not everything is as it seems.

360
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
And for what it's worth,

361
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,900
the patient lived a long, happy life.

362
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,070
WESTMORELAND: What are you doing?

363
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,170
It is the job of a structural engineer

364
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,330
to make sure everything he creates is designed

365
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,330
to withstand the weight placed upon it.

366
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,870
What I've built here...

367
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,970
does not hold up.

368
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
If you discovered

369
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,100
that a structure you built was deficient,

370
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,230
would you tear down the building

371
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
or find a way to fix it?

372
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,570
I've tried to fix it.

373
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,170
I've tried to make things right.

374
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,370
All I've done is add more weight to it.

375
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,830
And now...

376
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,300
...now I can't take anymore.

377
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,330
All I wanted to do was save my brother's life.

378
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Did you do that?

379
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,430
Yes...

380
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,330
but how many other people

381
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,730
lost their lives in the process?

382
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,170
Knowing that now,

383
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,930
would you have let him die?

384
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
No.

385
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,270
And that makes you feel like some kind of murderer?

386
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,930
Perhaps.

387
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,600
Take ten lives, you're a serial killer.

388
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,630
Take thousands, you're a war hero.

389
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,100
This isn't war.

390
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,800
Are you sure?

391
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,470
There's nothing more than the Company's little black book.

392
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,270
Names, numbers, operation reports.

393
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,970
Not everything is as it seems, Michael.

394
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,600
But you know that...

395
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,130
don't you?

396
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,070
All right, look, we need to reestablish contact

397
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,130
with the buyer, explain to him what happened,

398
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,300
and then set a new location

399
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,770
for the exchange.

400
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,000
I got to say...

401
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,300
I'm amazed at you, Don.

402
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,570
Yeah, all this time, and you never once asked to see

403
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,700
the information in Scylla. That's 'cause I don't care

404
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,530
about the information; I just care what it's worth.

405
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,870
Maybe you're just worried

406
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,870
if you actually knew what was on it,

407
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,770
you'd have second thoughts about who you're selling it to.

408
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,830
Hello?

409
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
FEMALE VOICE: Mr. Burrows, we have a hit on the targets.

410
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,000
Traffic camera picked them up entering a convenience store

411
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,270
on Valley and 14th.

412
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
Looks like they left a footprint.

413
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,430
* *

414
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,600
Don't move.

415
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,200
That's a hell of a job, Agent Lang.

416
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,930
You're the one who taught me how to read the mind

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,130
of a convict on the run, remember?

418
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,100
If you take me in, I'm as good as dead.

419
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,100
You know that.

420
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,530
So...

421
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,570
I'm gonna run now.

422
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,330
And if you need to stop me,

423
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,770
you're gonna have to shoot.

424
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,570
Don't make me do this.

425
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,370
I'm sorry.

426
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,330
Another time, another place, eh, Felicia?

427
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,100
I will pull this trigger.

428
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,430
What happened?

429
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,430
He got away.

430
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,700
Did you have him?

431
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,700
Uh, yeah, I...

432
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,430
I thought I had him unless I...

433
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,930
I just missed.

434
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,230
Did you see which way he went?

435
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,600
Or did you just miss that, too?

436
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,430
: He went east.

437
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,860
Hey, buddy. What's up?

438
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,930
I'm looking for a, a tall chick with black hair

439
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,100
and a guy-- tall guy, uh...

440
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,800
He looks like Bozo the clown.

441
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,060
You know, Bozo and Elvira?

442
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,230
You guys

443
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,660
cops or somethin'?

444
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,760
SUCRE : Not even close.

445
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,630
So how 'bout it?

446
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,230
Nah.

447
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,930
I don't remember anyone like that.

448
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,530
How 'bout now, you punk?

449
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,860
How 'bout now?! Okay! Okay!

450
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,200
They bought a phone, man.

451
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,430
I want the receipt.

452
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,460
All right.

453
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,060
Okay, thanks.

454
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,060
On their way.

455
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,800
You have any idea who the buyer is?

456
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,360
No. And we never will.

457
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,530
Whoever's walking away with the information that's on Scylla

458
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,860
will do whatever it takes

459
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,860
to stay below The Company radar.

460
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,860
Besides, would you screw some guy's wife

461
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,500
and then leave your card on his pillow?

462
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,660
Isn't that what you just did

463
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,500
to the General?

464
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,660
Come on.

465
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,900
After all we've been through,

466
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,360
we can't be honest with each other?

467
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,830
Your little photo shoot.

468
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,860
And your weak ass attempt at the sixth card.

469
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,000
You wanted him to know you were involved, right?

470
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,000
Come on. He punished you,

471
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,460
treated you like crap-- just like your real daddy.

472
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,300
You want at least one of them to pay for it, right?

473
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,300
Come on, Gretchen.

474
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,460
I-I know you.

475
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,860
I did my homework.

476
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,130
Gee, Don, you...

477
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,160
you just cracked my whole Electra complex wide open.

478
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,200
Kudos.

479
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,200
But you're not the only one who did their homework.

480
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,530
Just so you know.

481
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
Yeah? You got something to say? Right now,

482
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,160
we need to be ready for whatever's coming.

483
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,930
You better watch your six, Don.

484
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,960
Okay.

485
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,500
You wanted to see me? Yeah.

486
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,100
I-I can't quite tell from the monitors,

487
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,660
but from what I can see, the-the grow,

488
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,400
it looks like it isn't just on the hypothalamus.

489
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,630
I understand that was the initial diagnosis,

490
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,500
but once we got in there, it appears to have spread

491
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,500
to the hippocampus as well.

492
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,830
Okay. Um,

493
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,700
so with the removal, will there be any memory loss?

494
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,500
Well, in cases like this,

495
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,730
where small portions have to be removed,

496
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,800
it hardly ever affects what's referred to as "net memory."

497
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,460
We're all tapped into such small portions

498
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,100
of what we've experienced in our lifetime.

499
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,600
The bulk of it's just kept in storage,

500
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,700
rarely acknowledged by the conscious mind.

501
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,260
So while there may be some

502
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,730
gross memory loss,

503
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,260
he won't ever know it's gone.

504
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,430
Because he'll never know it was there.

505
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,730
Nurse?

506
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,430
BP's dropping, 90/60.

507
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,330
What's going on?

508
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
I don't know.

509
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,830
Increase dopamine delivery rate to 12.5.

510
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,060
GENERAL: We'll use the Bargain when the time is right.

511
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,100
The time is now.

512
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,100
Bargain. Bargain.

513
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,900
We'll use time--  time is right.

514
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,500
We'll use the Bargain when the time is right.

515
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,830
perhaps the time is now.

516
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,360
DOCTOR: EEG's spiking.

517
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,460
Brain activity's all over the place.

518
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,000
MAP's at 55.

519
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,430
BP's erratic. Dropping.

520
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,860
85, 84.

521
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,500
SURGEON: Give him one mil of Atropine. Michael?

522
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,860
Are you still with us?

523
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,260
The best minds in the world  designed this system,

524
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,460
and you almost beat it.

525
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,300
GENERAL:  But as long as we have...

526
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,630
...we have-- as long as we...

527
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,560
So what are you hearing, uh,

528
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,400
Scylla's worth?

529
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,730
Me, I'm hearing millions.

530
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
We have Scylla.

531
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,630
Things have happened

532
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,000
in the past few days that

533
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,530
have made me uneasy.

534
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,060
But as long as we have Scylla,  we have power.

535
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm sorry, Michael.

536
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,730
We're losing him. 78. Get the crash cart.

537
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,530
Laryngeal scope-- we need to intubate. No.

538
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,900
What's going on?

539
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,360
It's time to go.

540
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,030
Michael?

541
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,860
Michael?!

542
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,570
Michael! What's going on? Why's he crashing?

543
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,340
Ms. Tancredi, you cannot...

544
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,040
No, it's okay.

545
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,540
Michael, don't do this.

546
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,170
Don't do this.

547
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,200
Don't do this.

548
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,240
Don't go.

549
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,700
We're not finished with this.

550
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,040
Not finished yet.

551
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,300
Michael, I'm sorry.

552
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,340
It's time.

553
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,240
Please, Charles.

554
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,540
Michael, not like this.

555
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,670
Not like this.

556
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,940
It doesn't happen like this.

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,540
You promised me we would finish together.

558
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
It's okay.

559
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,370
You've done your part.

560
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,870
I haven't figured it out yet!

561
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,540
Yes, you have.

562
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,900
Would you do something?

563
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,100
I'm trying!

564
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,440
Relax.

565
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,070
You might think it's bad,

566
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,870
but it's not.

567
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Dying?

568
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,840
No!

569
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,700
Don't give up.

570
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,870
Don't give up.

571
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,000
Don't give up.

572
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,500
Not everything is as it seems.

573
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,470
Good-bye, Michael.

574
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,640
Charles.

575
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,940
Michael?

576
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,270
Michael, don't leave me.

577
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,800
Don't you dare leave me.

578
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,670
Sara.

579
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,740
Company tracked the serial code off the receipt.

580
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,700
Gretchen just placed a call five minutes ago

581
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,370
matching the tracking number. From where?

582
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,470
Two miles away.

583
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,070
I was told there'd be three of you.

584
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,370
Well there aren't.

585
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,370
You have the money? Because that's a small case

586
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,370
for $125 million... We don't deal in cash.

587
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,400
Once I verify the validity of the item,

588
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,900
the funds will be wired to an account number you provide.

589
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,270
The item, please.

590
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,400
No, no, no, you're not gonna see the item

591
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,340
until I see the money, okay? You'll have to

592
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,070
forgive me if I don't trust a shiny case with some buttons.

593
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,370
I need to confirm that the data is intact.

594
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,370
Without it, the item you possess

595
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,700
is nothing more than a fancy box.

596
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,770
Speaking of...

597
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,340
Give this man the item.

598
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,840
No, I'm not giving anyone...

599
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,500
This is a businessman

600
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,170
making a business transaction.

601
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,740
One with the longer you take,

602
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,240
the more danger you put us all in.

603
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,440
Can you read what's on there?

604
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,570
You better hope so.

605
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,500
They're not just gonna give us Scylla.

606
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,640
You know what that means, right?

607
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,940
Okay.

608
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,870
Let's split up.

609
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm sure you understand

610
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,200
no one can know where Scylla's going to.

611
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,470
It's your lucky day, sugar.

612
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
Not yours.

613
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,340
Drop it.

614
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,900
Cover her.

615
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,500
Where is he? I don't know.

616
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,970
Where is he?

617
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,540
I don't know! GRETCHEN: Gone.

618
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,700
Stolen.

619
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,700
By who?

620
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,540
By who?

621
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,570
If I die... you'll never know.

622
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,270
You look beautiful.

623
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,500
You're a liar.

624
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,470
How'd it go?

625
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,570
They're still running some tests,

626
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,170
but they feel pretty confident they got it all.

627
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,630
And what is this place?

628
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,470
You need to know something about your surgery.

629
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,570
It was performed by Company doctors,

630
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,970
and the General made all the arrangements.

631
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,230
Why?

632
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,700
I don't know.

633
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,500
Lincoln's handling it.

634
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,800
He says he has a plan.

635
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,070
I'll be honest. Right now, you're alive,

636
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,470
and that's all I care about.

637
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,330
You're gonna laugh, but I had a dream about Scylla.

638
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:30,170
The only thing we really know about it is what Self told us.

639
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,430
You need to rest.

640
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,200
I'm serious.

641
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,430
What if it's not just the Company's little black book?

642
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,630
What if it's...

643
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,830
Not everything is as it seems.

644
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,470
...something more?

645
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,370
Like what?

646
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,470
Something good.

647
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,970
Why go to so much trouble

648
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,970
to protect information about the past,

649
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,330
information the Company could just delete

650
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,330
any time they wanted to?

651
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,130
The General said...

652
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,370
GENERAL: As long as we have Scylla, we have power.

653
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,700
I don't think he was talking about power

654
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,270
like control or influence.

655
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,330
I think he was talking about energy.

656
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,370
Boron.

657
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Argon.

658
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,200
Gallium.

659
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,930
Indium.

660
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
Bargain.

661
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,470
There's a theory that if you can find a way

662
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,200
to combine these elements into the design of a solar cell,

663
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:33,230
you can harness 100% of the sun's energy.

664
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,000
With that kind of power,

665
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,370
possibilities are limitless.

666
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,700
It would certainly explain all the security around Scylla.

667
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,370
They're not protecting the past.

668
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,800
They're protecting the future.

669
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,600
Wow.

670
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,470
Wonder what else is on it.

671
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,700
I mean, the equipment you were treated with,

672
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,270
and the drugs they gave you--

673
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,730
none of it exists on the open market.

674
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,830
Which would explain why some people are willing

675
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,070
to pay hundreds of millions to get their hands on Scylla.

676
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,900
It's not about taking down the Company.

677
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,100
It's about

678
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,430
becoming the Company.

679
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,770
It's about knowing what they know,

680
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,930
controlling what they know.

681
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,770
What do we do now?

682
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,570
So, what's the next move?

683
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:23,970
I'm gonna check on Michael.

684
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,630
No, I mean, after that.

685
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,200
I mean, Scylla's out there somewhere.

686
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,030
Are we really gonna keep chasing it?

687
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,170
I don't know. We'll figure it out later.

688
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,270
No.

689
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,970
I won't be here, Linc.

690
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,500
I can't do it anymore.

691
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,470
Sara said Mike was okay,

692
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,670
and that's all I needed to know.

693
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,300
But now I got to go live my life.

694
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,200
And that's a life where I can go a day without seeing

695
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,630
a dead body, or-or almost becoming one.

696
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm not running away, papi.

697
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,300
I'm-I'm just... I'm just moving on.

698
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,600
This was never about you.

699
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,970
Everything you did, you did for us.

700
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,130
I'll never forget that.

701
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,470
I know you got

702
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,770
something cooking, so...

703
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,370
whatever it is, just be careful, okay?

704
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,200
Yeah.

705
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,730
Thank you.

706
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,030
Hey.

707
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,500
And when you and Mike get down below

708
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,670
and open that surf shop...

709
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,000
Scuba shop.

710
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,500
Scuba shop.

711
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,000
Maybe there will be a job there for me.

712
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,200
You can count on it.

713
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,370
Do you know who took it?

714
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,100
No, but Self and Gretchen do.

715
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,370
Good.

716
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,670
Then you've got your team.

717
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,700
I'm not working for them.

718
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,630
You'll work with a basset hound in a birthday hat

719
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,200
if that's what I tell you to do.

720
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,200
That's what being an employee means.

721
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,030
You're determined and dedicated.

722
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,900
But there are holes in your resume

723
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,800
thatGretchen or Self or even Bagwell can fill.

724
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,370
Now, you all took something from me,

725
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,200
and you're all going to get it back.

726
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,200
Besides...

727
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,230
you can't handle this by yourself.

728
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,600
And deep down, I think you know that.

729
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,100
Have them meet me outside.

730
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,570
Who knows?

731
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,970
You may find that you like it here.

732
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,570
Stranger things have happened.

733
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,070
They've certainly happened in your family.

734
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,770
Now,

735
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,400
about Michael.

736
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,730
Are you going to tell him,

737
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
or should I?

738
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,070
WO Do you have it?

739
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,570
In my hand.

740
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,730
Good. You know what to do.

741
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,400
Last time I saw you in a hospital,

742
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,870
you busted your arm in Little League.

743
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,770
Yeah, some bruiser knocked me down

744
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,970
sliding into second.

745
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,130
Sorry about that.

746
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,330
But you healed good, though, right?

747
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,030
Yeah.

748
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,830
This will, too.

749
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,830
Look, whatever plan you're working on

750
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,370
to get us out of here, we better make a move on it.

751
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,500
You're not getting out of here, Michael.

752
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,030
What do you mean?

753
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,330
I made a deal.

754
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,230
Your life in exchange for Scylla.

755
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,500
Why would you do that?

756
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,570
Same reason you covered your body in tattoos

757
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,130
and-and broke into Fox River.

758
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
This is not just about us...

759
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,400
That's exactly who it's about. It's all it's ever been about.

760
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,530
We do this one thing for the Company,

761
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,430
then they set us up for life.

762
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,930
And you actually trust them?

763
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,930
Who else am I gonna trust?

764
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,930
The government? Guys like Don Self?

765
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,300
I'm done watching loved ones and friends die, Michael.

766
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,870
Scylla isn't what we thought it was.

767
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,570
Not even close. I don't care.

768
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,700
I don't understand how you can say that.

769
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,000
'Cause the only thing worth fighting for is family.

770
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:39,070
I'm gonna do everything and anything I can to end this,

771
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,700
so you, me, all of us

772
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,230
can get on with our lives.

773
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,730
You think you can do that

774
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,430
knowing what you know about the Company?

775
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,430
You want to know what I know about the Company?

776
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,900
Mom worked for them before she died.

777
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,530
I'm just moving on in the family business.

778
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,730
Linc, don't do this.

779
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,730
It's done.

780
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,700
Linc? Linc! Linc!
