1
00:00:05,408 --> 00:00:07,238
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,138
Sona's a one-way street

3
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:10,538
What goes in

4
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:11,978
never comes out.

5
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:13,243
Since the riots of last year,

6
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:14,308
they lt here us to rot.

7
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,538
They figured we would just destroy ourselves,

8
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:18,208
but instead we've thrived.

9
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:19,555
How about we work together, you know,

10
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:20,338
help each other out?

11
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,238
You're on your own.

12
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:24,108
Get me out of this! You want to know

13
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:25,178
where she is, find a way

14
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,438
to get me out of this!

15
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:29,238
Maricruz... Maricruz.

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,338
We can assisyou should you ever decide,

17
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:33,238
say, to break out of here.

18
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:34,978
This conversation's over.

19
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:36,208
We're trying to do this the easy way.

20
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,578
Think you can do me a favor?

21
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:51,778
We have a lot to discuss, Lincoln.

22
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:53,138
Specifically, your brother.

23
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,608
How are we coming with the transfer?

24
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,491
You got to stay.

25
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:58,038
What are you talking about?

26
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:00,308
Dad, I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:01,808
They got me and Sara.

28
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:03,938
You got a week to find this Whistler guy.

29
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:06,678
Otherwise, they, uh, both die.

30
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:27,838
Where you from up there, bro?

31
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:30,838
Chicago.

32
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,078
Michael Jordan.

33
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,408
Yeah.

34
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:35,878
You meet him?

35
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:37,638
It's a big city.

36
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:41,038
Oh, yeah, big city.

37
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,738
Thanks for saving me a spot.

38
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,738
Hey!

39
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,538
Ejected!

40
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,908
You ever have sex with blond cheerleader?

41
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:56,478
Yeah, sure.

42
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:58,938
You're the man, bro.

43
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,338
How long's the water been out?

44
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:03,438
Since riots last year.

45
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:05,208
Government blame us.

46
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,508
They say, "Screw you, you break it."

47
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:10,078
No water.

48
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,678
Gracias.

49
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:21,808
Real quick.

50
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,308
There's an inmate here named James Whistler.

51
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:25,478
I'm looking for him.

52
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:27,578
Welcome to club.

53
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,008
Everybody looking for him.

54
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,478
Why's that?

55
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:33,278
He killed the mayor of Panama City's son.

56
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:34,808
In bar fight.

57
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,108
Mayor not happy.

58
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:40,138
Hey, hey.

59
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,038
So where is he now?

60
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,838
Disappear.

61
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,038
Some say he might even escape.

62
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:51,338
Hey. Hey!

63
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,838
"I don't have no money.

64
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,138
I don't have no money,"that's all I hear from you,

65
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:56,608
you know that?

66
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,338
But then I see you with this, huh?

67
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,478
Life must be good, eh?

68
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:02,178
Look, I'm-I'm hungry, okay?

69
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,708
You worry about me being hungry.

70
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:04,938
Hey, hey, hey,hey, come on.

71
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:05,938
Me being hungry.

72
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,138
Come on!

73
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:08,438
But you eat all the time.

74
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,438
Okay, I can see you up there.

75
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,938
Hey, tranquilo!

76
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:38,138
There's gonna be more water.

77
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:40,238
When?!

78
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,308
I said there will be more water.

79
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,178
Whew!

80
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,738
Later, bro.

81
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,578
Go.

82
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:38,238
Spare a little?

83
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,538
I need some information.

84
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:40,608
Absolutely.

85
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:43,078
You slipped this note in my pocket yesterday.

86
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,108
Why?

87
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:47,738
My memory's a little foggy on account of thishirst.

88
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:53,378
Yeah, it's starting to come back to me now.

89
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:54,578
A little more agua there.

90
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,078
The note.

91
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,908
This guy gave me some rat meat in exchange for putting that

92
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:02,338
in your pocket and the pocket of the guy you were set to fight.

93
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:03,478
Why?

94
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,678
He's nuts, that's why.

95
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,408
Anybody who can live down in those sewers

96
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:08,908
doesn't have all his faculties.

97
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:11,108
Where in the sewers?

98
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,038
Whistler!

99
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,708
Whistler.

100
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:10,908
My name is Michael Scofield.

101
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:16,578
I was  to get you out of here.

102
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:19,608
I'm going to assume they told you I was coming.

103
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:24,278
Or that someone was coming.

104
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,578
Whistler.

105
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,678
Last chance.

106
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,908
I'm not coming down here again.

107
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,138
You're here to get me out of Sona.

108
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:45,438
Are you surprised?

109
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:48,238
It's just that it's gonna be a bit difficult

110
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:49,608
getting me out of this hole.

111
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:52,138
Seeing as if I go above ground

112
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,008
and another inmate spots me,

113
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,378
I'm a dead man.

114
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:33,674
There's a, there's a slight misunderstanding

115
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,514
that I have with the mayor...

116
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:37,844
You know what? It's none of my business.

117
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,944
I'll come back and get you when the time is right.

118
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,274
I may not make it that long.

119
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:43,574
That's your problem, my friend.

120
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:45,614
I've got problems of my own.

121
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,914
So you work for these people?

122
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:50,014
The ones that want me out of Sona.

123
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,514
Look, just stay put.

124
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:52,711
As long as no one knowsyou're here,

125
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:53,444
you should be safe.

126
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:53,915
I'll be back.

127
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,374
Why do they want meout of here so badly,

128
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:57,414
can you at least tell me that?

129
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,774
Is this the part where you pretend you're innocent?

130
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,544
Just a pawn in all this?

131
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:04,574
If they told you anything about me before you came here,

132
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,914
you'd know that to be true.

133
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,414
I just want to know what they want with me.

134
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:12,474
Stay put.

135
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:29,044
In an effort to save some time,

136
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,114
I'm gonna have to insist

137
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,844
that we just skip right past all the threats I know

138
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:33,974
you're prepared to layout.

139
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,174
Should anything happen to Sara to LJ,

140
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:37,644
you will scour the Earth and hunt me down

141
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:39,144
and rip my heart from my chest

142
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:40,844
and bup, bup, bup.

143
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:43,444
I absolutely know how you feel,

144
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,344
as would I, okay?

145
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:48,174
So that's done.

146
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:50,214
On to business.

147
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:52,514
Did you brother get the message?

148
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:55,674
Good. You and I will meet here every day.

149
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:59,574
I'll want a full report of the prior day's progress.

150
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:02,874
When I call your cell phone, answer.

151
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:04,774
Don't ask me stupid questions.

152
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:06,344
Don't waste my time.

153
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:07,374
Get a plan together.

154
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,244
Execute it.

155
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,414
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.

156
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,844
Are we clear?

157
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:17,174
I want a picture of my son and Sara to prove they're alive.

158
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:18,814
Fine. I can do that, next.

159
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:20,314
Why us?

160
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:21,844
I'll answer that question

161
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:24,674
so we can put it to bed and you can focus on your work.

162
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,914
There's a political spotlight on Whistler

163
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,544
due to the nature of his crime.

164
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:30,414
Raids, bribes, what have you,

165
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:31,914
are not an option.

166
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:34,444
We have to go in through the back door, so to speak.

167
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,844
This can't be done in a week.

168
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:38,814
You have a week. That's it.

169
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,974
Are we clear?

170
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:42,844
What's your name?

171
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:45,914
Susan B. Anthony.

172
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,044
I'm assuming you weren't

173
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:48,744
born by immaculate conception.

174
00:09:48,774 --> 00:09:49,814
You're right, Lincoln.

175
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:51,374
Family trees being what they are,

176
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:54,474
moms, da, brothers, sisters.

177
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:58,644
Anything happens to my son or Sara,

178
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:01,614
I'm not coming after you, Susan.

179
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:04,814
Get to work.

180
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:53,244
His man knocks over the water!

181
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:57,274
Now, didn't you see how Lechero just walked away?!

182
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,914
He doesn't care about us!

183
00:10:58,944 --> 00:10:59,974
He doesn't give a damn!

184
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:02,244
Living like a king up there!

185
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,044
Come out, what are you, afraid?!

186
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:09,914
Come on!

187
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:12,074
Lechero, come out!

188
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,014
<i>Por favor.</i>

189
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:23,044
<i>Por favor. Vete.</i>

190
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:26,044
<i>Vete, perro.</i>

191
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:35,574
Why you so interested about that guy down there?

192
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:36,574
No reason.

193
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:39,274
Then why you whispering, college boy?

194
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:41,344
Why don't you lower your voice already?

195
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:43,444
What's in it for me? I'm sorry.

196
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:45,214
Do you have any other friends in here besides me?

197
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:47,174
I'm it.

198
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,644
Friends don't let friends go hungry and thirsty All right.

199
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:51,374
All right. and damn near half-naked.

200
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:54,114
I said "all right;" I'll take care of it! When?

201
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:57,244
When I can.

202
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:00,974
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:02,614
Why's he hiding?

204
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:07,414
Who's he hiding from?

205
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:12,914
Mayor get message to Lechero

206
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:16,174
saying if Whistler guy gets killed here in Sona,

207
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:18,574
whoever kills him gets to go to court,

208
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:19,574
gets to see a judge.

209
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:20,974
Judge friendly with mayor.

210
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:22,844
Kill him, and-and

211
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:26,114
then you get to get out of here and be free?

212
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:28,814
That's what Lechero say.

213
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:30,944
This'll stay between me and you.

214
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:36,214
If your friend wanted you to know, why didn't he tell you?

215
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:39,344
Cause... 'cause you and I are friends now.

216
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:41,674
Unless you want to be enemies.

217
00:12:42,614 --> 00:12:44,574
Friends.

218
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,944
Good. Me, too.

219
00:12:56,244 --> 00:13:00,544
Sucre?

220
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:04,374
Sucre, get me out of here, please.

221
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,544
Where's Maricruz?

222
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:06,674
Yeah.

223
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,144
Yeah, Maricruz-- she's good, she's okay,

224
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:09,774
but-but not telling you anything

225
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,614
until you get me out of here.

226
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,874
Tell me where she is right now!

227
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:16,974
You shoot me, you'll end up inside this hellhole.

228
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,944
I'm done.

229
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:20,614
I don't care anymore.

230
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,544
I can only guess she's dead by now,

231
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:25,844
so you're dying with her.

232
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,544
I never had her!

233
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,314
At that house in Mexico,

234
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:31,444
I chased your aunt and Maricruz off.

235
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:32,974
I told them I'd lock 'em up

236
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:35,044
for accessory if they didn't hightail it.

237
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:36,474
I swear to God.

238
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,974
And the crucifix?

239
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:39,214
I ripped it off

240
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:40,614
Maricruz before she ran.

241
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:43,114
There was no phone in that dump, so I knew you wouldn't

242
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:44,714
be able to call from the road to...

243
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:48,044
to make sure I wasn't lying.

244
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:50,014
I-I conned you.

245
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,274
So...

246
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:54,474
so Maricruz is...

247
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,914
She's picking grapes.

248
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,814
I have no idea.

249
00:13:57,844 --> 00:13:59,514
Now, just lower the barrel.

250
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:01,514
Put the gun down.

251
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:09,414
Now, I came clean with you and helped you out,

252
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:10,974
right, buddy?

253
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:13,214
So you got to return the favor.

254
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:17,414
Call my mom in Joliet-- Edna Bellick.

255
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:19,074
She's listed. Sucre?

256
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:21,014
I never laid a hand on Maricruz.

257
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:22,774
I would never do that!

258
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,614
Sucre, help me, please!

259
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:28,514
Sucre, help me!

260
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:30,814
Help me!

261
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:42,914
Oh, man.

262
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,574
Oh.

263
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:38,014
Hey.

264
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:39,614
Hey.

265
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,444
You find Whistler?

266
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:42,974
Yeah.

267
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:45,114
What's his story?

268
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,474
I don't know, and maybe

269
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,814
it's better that way, huh?

270
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:50,544
I just got

271
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,044
to get him out of here, right?

272
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:53,244
Come on, man, come on.

273
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:55,414
We got to keep moving, we got to keep moving.

274
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:56,574
What's the next play?

275
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:58,244
Whistler got a note out

276
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:00,374
on a dead body yesterday.

277
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,974
I don't know what it means or who it's for.

278
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,044
But we need all the leverage we can get,

279
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,114
and, uh...

280
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:10,874
I need some money.

281
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,774
No one's ever broken out of this place before,

282
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,214
let alone with a week to plan it,

283
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,844
so...

284
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:32,774
you tell these people, whoever it is that took Sara

285
00:16:32,814 --> 00:16:35,044
and my nephew...

286
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:38,074
you tell them I get it,

287
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,574
and I'm going to do everything I can.

288
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:43,444
I'm going to break this guy out of here,

289
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,914
or I'm going to die trying.

290
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:47,914
And if it's the latter,

291
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:50,614
then that should count for something, right?

292
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,714
Th's got to count for something.

293
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,344
You tell them that.

294
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:55,774
I will.

295
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,344
Tell them.

296
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,614
I'd trade places with you in a second.

297
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:05,014
I know.

298
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,274
Whistler?

299
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:33,814
You're not safe here.

300
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:39,244
I can take you someplace that is.

301
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:47,414
If you're here to help me,

302
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:50,444
then just leave me alone.

303
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,814
Please.

304
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:14,077
Sucre?

305
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,377
Linc!

306
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:17,747
What are you doing here?

307
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,377
What are you doing here?

308
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:20,447
Michael's locked up.

309
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:21,947
For what?

310
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,777
I don't know. I'm sorting it through.

311
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,117
I could use your help.

312
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,617
We're in a... we're in a bad spot.

313
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,547
Uh, I feel for you, man, but I'm done with bad spots, Linc.

314
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,047
I'm going to go see Maricruz.

315
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,247
I just talked to my cousin Petey,

316
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:35,047
and he told me she's back over in Chicago.

317
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:37,077
Hey, you're still wanted in Chicago, remember?

318
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,017
I'll figure something out.

319
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,647
All right.

320
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:45,817
If you change your mind, I'm staying at the Plaza del Sol.

321
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,847
I won't. I'm-I'm out of here, bro.

322
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,177
I'm going to go see my girl.

323
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,047
Listen to me. The innocent people in your life--

324
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,977
you got to keep them innocent-- if that means walking away

325
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:56,347
from them, that's what you got to do.

326
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,817
Good luck, Linc.

327
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:22,847
<i>Banco de Versailles, por favor.</i>

328
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:26,444
Have we had our laughs with him yet?

329
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:28,584
He's useless, man.

330
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:29,884
You want to get rid of him?

331
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:32,284
Huh? Then you cut the mango. Huh?

332
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:33,244
You caused me

333
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:35,114
a big, big problem out there today!

334
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:36,444
You understand that?

335
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:37,984
Now there's no more water.

336
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,184
They'll live.

337
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:40,544
Oh, yeah?

338
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:41,744
They'll live?

339
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:44,144
Yeah? Well, you tell them that, then.

340
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:49,214
Hey, come out, Your Majesty.

341
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:49,984
Teodoro!

342
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,184
Are you scared of...

343
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:55,444
little people like us?

344
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:58,144
There's water here.

345
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,714
Give each man a little, hey?

346
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:01,544
At once.

347
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:06,614
The kings have their heads chopped off.

348
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:08,644
Hey, Lechero!

349
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:11,644
Don't worry about us!

350
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:13,614
We're fine!

351
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,984
He may have ruled the streets

352
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,914
out there, but in here,

353
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,984
he's just like us.

354
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:21,414
Just like us!

355
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,444
Come out!

356
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:23,814
What, are you afraid?

357
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:26,114
Come and look at me!

358
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:27,444
Come on!

359
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:29,414
Lechero, come out.

360
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,384
The American in his underwear-- you seen him?

361
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:44,014
T-Bag.

362
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,444
Boy, you're going to be drinking your own urine

363
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:48,314
before you get any of this.

364
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:51,114
I just need to speak to Señor Lechero, please?

365
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,384
Why don't you do yourself a favor-- scamper.

366
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:55,144
But I got something. Oh, yeah.

367
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:58,184
You got yourself the untouchable status.

368
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:01,544
Get myself killed just talking to your mangy ass.

369
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,244
<i>Andale.</i>

370
00:21:05,284 --> 00:21:06,684
But I got information.

371
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:11,814
Good information.

372
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:25,384
Are you out of your mind, huh?

373
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:27,014
Hey! Hey! Hey! He's got info.

374
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,444
Pick a... pick a kneecap, huh?

375
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:30,614
I got information! I just want food and clothing.

376
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:31,384
Patron, please.

377
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,544
Hold on. Hold on!

378
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:37,744
This better be informative.

379
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:40,084
Or it's your kneecap next.

380
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:45,414
This morning, before that whole, uh, water thing,

381
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,514
I, I heard you and the lads talking

382
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:50,084
about that Whistler character, how ne's found him.

383
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:51,744
Well...

384
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,614
I just want food and clothing...

385
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:54,514
Just tell him, idiot!

386
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:55,944
There's a guy hiding

387
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:57,014
down in the sewers.

388
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:58,744
I-I figure he's hiding from you, right,

389
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,344
because you run this place, right?

390
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:01,784
And so I figured you'd want to know everything

391
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:02,984
goes on here, so...

392
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:04,044
Fine, shut up.

393
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:06,214
<i>It just might be Whistler, si, patron?</i>

394
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,114
<i>¿Si?</i>

395
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:16,544
Is he Australian?

396
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:18,444
Yeah.

397
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:21,014
Yeah!

398
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,814
Courtesy of the Lechero's munificence.

399
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:40,714
All right, now, y'all need to back up a tad now.

400
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:42,444
Hey.

401
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:44,044
How long you been in Sona?

402
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:46,584
Three years.

403
00:22:46,614 --> 00:22:48,114
How old are you?

404
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:49,484
Seventeen.

405
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:52,114
And as far as you know,

406
00:22:52,144 --> 00:22:54,084
no one's ever broken out of this place except,

407
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:56,814
uh... except maybe this Whistler guy?

408
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,844
You Americans ask a lot of questions.

409
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,144
Oh, no.

410
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:17,644
What's wrong?

411
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:19,244
Come on. Please.

412
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:20,714
Come on! I have a family.

413
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:22,544
S-So do I.

414
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:24,714
Come on.

415
00:23:25,814 --> 00:23:26,844
Stop!

416
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:29,184
Stop, okay?

417
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:31,444
Just...

418
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:45,514
He's coming with me.

419
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:04,147
Just back up, Michael. Just...

420
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:08,617
You don't actually think that killing somebody

421
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,877
is going to help you get out of here, do you?

422
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,277
That does seem pretty strange, doesn't it?

423
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:15,317
But this is a really strange place,

424
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:16,817
one I want to get out of.

425
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:18,317
Then I'll help you.

426
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:19,747
I'll testify for you,

427
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:21,217
whatever it takes. Wow.

428
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:23,417
Wow, look at that halo

429
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:24,617
that just appeared above your head.

430
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,947
It's amazing.

431
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,617
I don't have a choice, Alex... What'd you tell me

432
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:28,417
yesterday?

433
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,447
What did you tell me yesterday?

434
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,247
Huh? "You're on your own, Alex."

435
00:24:31,277 --> 00:24:33,877
Back up. Back up!

436
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:37,417
You...

437
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,547
you don't want this.

438
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,177
Let me help you, Alex.

439
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:59,077
Hey, your majesty!

440
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,647
You got to shut him up.

441
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:04,617
Come on!

442
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:06,777
I need this bolson to call me back.

443
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,217
I need to talk to you.

444
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:09,417
Don't ever walk in here

445
00:25:09,447 --> 00:25:10,947
without being called! I'm sorry.

446
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,277
But it's worth the breach in etiquette.

447
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:13,177
Is it now?

448
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:14,777
I thought you could use my help.

449
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:17,077
There are ways I can be of assistance.

450
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,247
No.

451
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:23,577
Whistler don't mean

452
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:25,517
nothing to me, man.

453
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:27,177
I have five consecutive life sentences-- I ain't coming out

454
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:28,947
of Sona no time soon.

455
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,677
And why should I deprive other men of chance at freedom?

456
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:32,047
Huh? I need you to trust me.

457
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,977
Oh.

458
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,677
Trust you?

459
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:40,277
I don't know you good enough, brother.

460
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:43,777
Teodoro.

461
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,817
<i>Si, patron?</i>

462
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:55,717
Can I trust this bobo?

463
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,317
He's a snake.

464
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:01,847
He stabbed me

465
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:05,777
in the back every chance he got.

466
00:26:05,817 --> 00:26:09,977
A snake who stab a man in the back.

467
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:13,977
I never hear of such a creature before.

468
00:26:15,747 --> 00:26:17,977
We got to stop this!

469
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,547
Just give me two more minutes.

470
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,447
Leave now!

471
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:25,517
Leave!

472
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:27,447
Crumbs!

473
00:26:27,477 --> 00:26:28,947
That's what you're giving us!

474
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:30,517
Your crumbs!

475
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,717
Hey, Lechero,

476
00:26:32,747 --> 00:26:34,517
how's your television?

477
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:37,077
How's your whore?

478
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,917
Come on, what are you scared of?

479
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,017
Hey.

480
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:41,977
I need some, uh, some moonshine.

481
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,777
Moonshine? Or some alcohol.

482
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:44,817
Booze.

483
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:45,877
Booze, yeah.

484
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,077
I need it now. A liter or a gallon--

485
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:48,177
whatever you can get your hands on.

486
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:49,217
It's not good time for party, bro.

487
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:52,147
Bring it to me in my cell.

488
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:12,147
<i>Vamonos.</i>

489
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,247
Come on, Whistler.

490
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:08,247
What are you...

491
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:09,677
Whistler, stop!

492
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:10,747
Stop!

493
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:13,277
What are you...

494
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,217
Whistler...

495
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:20,177
Just come up top with me.

496
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,417
You got

497
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:24,447
a better chance coming up with me.

498
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:26,477
At least you can plead your case to Lechero.

499
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,577
Just get...

500
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:28,777
Go to hell.

501
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:31,047
Just...

502
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:40,317
His best batch, he say.

503
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:41,847
It's fine.

504
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:43,877
I'm going to need some plastic bags.

505
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:46,917
You didn't get it for to party, did you?

506
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:49,247
Plastic bags, as many as you can get.

507
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:51,577
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.

508
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,817
<i>Gracias.</i>

509
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:23,277
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,117
Excuse me?

511
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:38,077
You speak English?

512
00:30:38,117 --> 00:30:39,177
Yeah.

513
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,077
We've met.

514
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:42,547
I mean I saw you yesterday at, uh,

515
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:43,847
Sona

516
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,147
Yeah. You know, uh,

517
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,917
you could lose the whole grieving widow thing.

518
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:49,617
You're Whistler's girl, right?

519
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,377
I'm sorry, I have to be somewhere.

520
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,147
I've got, uh, I got to do something, all right?

521
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,717
Do what?

522
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,117
Give me that back

523
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:57,317
or I'll call the police.

524
00:30:57,347 --> 00:30:59,417
You're not going to call the police.

525
00:31:03,217 --> 00:31:05,117
Why does he want this?

526
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:07,917
I don't know.

527
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:09,477
He's just a fisherman.

528
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:11,377
A fisherman?

529
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,377
Well, tell your fisherman friend...

530
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:16,577
tell your fisherman friend Scofield's brother has this.

531
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:20,477
Why won't you people

532
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:21,647
just leave him alone?!

533
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:25,147
You think we want to be forced into this?

534
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,247
You think we want to be here, lady?

535
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:30,317
Forced into what?

536
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:34,177
What are you talking about?

537
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:46,747
All right, hold this.

538
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:48,377
Hold it.

539
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:51,177
Watch the hallway for me.

540
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,377
I'm friends with everybody here, bro.

541
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,717
That's how I keep alive.

542
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:00,817
You and I are friends, right?

543
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:03,317
Yeah, but looks like you got enemies.

544
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,817
What I did for you, getting you those things...

545
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,477
No one will ever know.

546
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:22,777
Lechero! Lechero!

547
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,317
Lechero! Lechero!

548
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:28,877
Whoo!

549
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,917
Stand up, stand up.

550
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:32,617
Stand up.

551
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,247
Come on.

552
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:38,477
Back up! Back up.

553
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,277
You can have him,

554
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:43,647
but two of you will die in the process.

555
00:32:43,677 --> 00:32:46,777
You first? You first. I'll wrap this right around your head.

556
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:49,677
Move. Move!

557
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:12,517
Lechero!

558
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:13,847
Lechero!

559
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,117
Lechero! Lechero!

560
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:18,377
Enough!

561
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,817
Let me go down there.

562
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,817
Let me cut just one throat.

563
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:25,747
Just one.

564
00:33:25,777 --> 00:33:27,347
And then regroup later

565
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:28,517
with a real reason

566
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:31,547
to come after you. Shut your mouth.

567
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,617
He's right,

568
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:34,047
Sammy.

569
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:35,817
Lechero! Lechero! Lechero!

570
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,977
So, what we going to do, boss, huh?

571
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,247
We just going to sit up here,

572
00:33:40,277 --> 00:33:41,817
hope they run out of rocks?

573
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,917
Lechero! Lechero!

574
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,577
We have a problem.

575
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:50,777
What is it?

576
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:53,577
Ran out of water.

577
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:56,347
<i>So, you mean you've got a problem.</i>

578
00:33:56,377 --> 00:33:58,217
Look, there was an accident here.

579
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,077
The tank tip over.

580
00:34:00,117 --> 00:34:02,047
My men need water, man.

581
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:05,377
I'll see if I can get the water truck there day after tomorrow.

582
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,217
<i>No, I need water now!</i>

583
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:09,177
I guess it's too bad there's no guards

584
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:10,617
in there anymore with you, huh?

585
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:11,717
You could

586
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:15,347
take hostages, have a riot, make demands.

587
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:17,447
Day aftertomorrow.

588
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:18,947
Lechero...!

589
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:21,447
You call me and you raise your voice at me like that

590
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,417
again, you're not going

591
00:34:23,447 --> 00:34:25,447
to see water for two weeks.

592
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:28,017
<i>Hmm? ¿Entendido?</i>

593
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:51,672
They got Whistler.

594
00:38:38,342 --> 00:38:40,202
Enough!

595
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,142
Enough!

596
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:15,565
Now, I'll decide this!

597
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:16,735
You'll decide nothing.

598
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:23,535
You can't deliver, Lechero.

599
00:36:23,565 --> 00:36:25,295
You're done here.

600
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:10,765
Now what?

601
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,395
What?

602
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:14,095
What do we do?

603
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:22,335
You've been outbid.

604
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,865
Wait. What are you talking about?

605
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:25,635
What are you ta...?

606
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:26,965
What are you talking...?

607
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:34,795
That's, uh, very useful.

608
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,935
Very useful.

609
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,295
And Whistler's clear?

610
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:46,595
Yeah.

611
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:50,465
Clear as the blue sky, brother.

612
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:21,635
Hello?

613
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,595
Baby, it's me.

614
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,065
Oh, my God.

615
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:28,135
Oh, I... I've been so scared, I've been praying

616
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:29,435
every day.

617
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:31,065
I did, too, babe.

618
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,735
I just thank God youokay.

619
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:35,665
Petey called me after he had talked to you,

620
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:38,165
and he said that you might be coming back here?

621
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:39,295
That's what I told him.

622
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:40,835
Yeah.

623
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:43,135
You have to be so careful.

624
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:45,135
Baby,

625
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:47,735
I've been thinking, and, um,

626
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:51,365
the only thing that I...

627
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,895
that I care about right now

628
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:55,935
is that you and the baby are okay.

629
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,695
That's all that matters to me.

630
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,695
I'm not coming back.

631
00:39:01,735 --> 00:39:04,795
It's not because I don't love you, because

632
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:05,995
you know I do--

633
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:08,965
I love you more... I love you more than anything,

634
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:12,495
but... all I do is bring you down.

635
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:14,765
I'm no good for you.

636
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:16,765
That's not true, that's not true.

637
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:20,035
Oh, it is, it is, it is, and...

638
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:21,335
sometimes the only way

639
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:23,165
to protect the people that you love

640
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:26,395
is... is by staying away from them.

641
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:33,135
however long that takes-- I'll find you.

642
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,995
I'll find you, and, uh,

643
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:37,295
and I'll make you and our baby proud.

644
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:38,465
<i>Te lo prometo.</i>

645
00:39:38,495 --> 00:39:40,495
<i>Te lo prometo, mi amor.</i>

646
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:42,895
I wish we could go back.

647
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:47,895
I would give anything to go back.

648
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:53,735
I wish that, too.

649
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:56,035
I wish that, too, baby.

650
00:39:56,065 --> 00:40:00,495
I love you so much, baby.

651
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,835
I love you, too, baby.

652
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,665
Good-bye.

653
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:15,435
Bye.

654
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:33,165
You know, they told me that your brother

655
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:34,565
got all the brains,

656
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:36,595
but I didn't realize you were this stupid.

657
00:40:36,635 --> 00:40:38,435
What do you want, Susan?

658
00:40:38,465 --> 00:40:41,335
No sooner do I tell you to stick to the plan,

659
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:43,195
than you go and hassle Whistler's girlfriend.

660
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:44,295
You need to quit

661
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:47,665
playing Sherlock Holmes and leave her alone.

662
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,565
Why?

663
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,465
'Cause I said so.

664
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:52,535
How about that? All right.

665
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:55,195
How about you beat it, so I can get to work?

666
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:56,335
I will

667
00:40:56,365 --> 00:40:58,995
as soon as you give me what you took from her.

668
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:00,835
I took nothing from her. I got a gallon

669
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:03,735
of bleach, a tarp and a hacksaw in the trunk of my car.

670
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:05,295
One hour, tops--

671
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:07,665
you're off the face of the earth.

672
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,635
It's just a bird guide.

673
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:15,735
I am not going to ask you again.

674
00:41:19,635 --> 00:41:20,965
Toss it.

675
00:41:24,595 --> 00:41:26,165
Tomorrow-- bar.

676
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:27,835
Progress report. I will be waiting.

677
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:54,895
(footsteps approaching, man gasping)

678
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:16,335
So it's water you want.
