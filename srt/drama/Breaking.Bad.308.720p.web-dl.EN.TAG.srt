1
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:20,773
You'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:24,543
Whatever.

3
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:27,044
Sir,

4
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,846
if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

5
00:01:30,617 --> 00:01:32,417
So roll me further, bitch.

6
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,185
- What's coming?
- Male Caucasian.

7
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,786
Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

8
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:05,821
BP is 70. 7-0 over palp.

9
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,355
Pulse 140... 1-4-0.

10
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,005
Weak and thready at the brachial.

11
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,632
No breath sounds on the right side,
and the belly is rigid.

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,469
Patient appears pale
and diaphoretic.

13
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:16,366
- How many entry wounds?
- We found four...

14
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,589
shoulder and hip, through and through.
Right lung and lower left quadrant,

15
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:21,267
no visible exit wounds.

16
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,397
Let's give him 2 grams of oxygen.

17
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,771
- What's his hemoglobin?
- 7.3.

18
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,149
I need two large-bore Ivs,

19
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,634
6 units O-neg,
type and cross for 6 more units,

20
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,621
Chest X-ray and KUB.

21
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:34,905
Notify the O.R.
we are on the way.

22
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,784
O.R. One is clear.
Let's put him in there.

23
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,942
Sorry I'm late, man.

24
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:17,465
Damn, brother, look at you.

25
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,944
That's messed up.

26
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:22,244
How are you feeling?
You okay?

27
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:23,812
Actually...

28
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,510
I'm great.

31
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,142
I don't understand.

32
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,819
I thought things were
going pretty well.

33
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,186
{\pos(192,225)}I...

34
00:03:57,623 --> 00:03:59,741
{\pos(192,225)}I thought we were kind of simpatico,

35
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:01,009
{\pos(192,225)}you know?

36
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,314
{\pos(192,225)}We were becoming a real team.

37
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,249
{\pos(192,225)}Not so much, no.

38
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,345
{\pos(192,225)}Is this about
the temperature setting{\*the other day}?

39
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,954
{\pos(192,225)}Because I can assure you
that will not happen...

40
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,823
{\pos(192,225)}No, it's bigger than that.

41
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:16,119
{\pos(192,225)}It's... It's...

42
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,717
much more than that.

43
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:20,991
Could you elaborate?

44
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,920
Yes, of course I could, but

45
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,848
I don't think either of us

46
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:29,575
would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

47
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,399
So...

48
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:37,718
I set up the entire lab.

49
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,249
You said you liked
the configuration.

50
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:42,437
And I do.

51
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,243
For the most part.

52
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,990
{\pos(192,225)}Look, you're a fine chemist, really,

53
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:50,692
{\pos(192,225)}with a promising future.

54
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,215
{\pos(192,225)}It's just that...

55
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,668
{\pos(192,225)}that I...

56
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:55,457
that... that we

57
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,568
{\pos(192,225)}just have

58
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,100
{\pos(192,225)}different...

59
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,342
Rhythms.

60
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,385
It's...

61
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:05,622
{\pos(192,225)}It's as if I'm

62
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,175
{\pos(192,225)}classical

63
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,461
but you are... are more...

64
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:12,771
Jazz.

65
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,736
And God knows there is
nothing wrong with jazz.

66
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,959
It's simply

67
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:23,108
that I

68
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
require...

69
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:26,618
Classical.

70
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:28,495
Exactly.

71
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:32,256
Shit.

72
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,160
{\pos(192,210)}Man, this is the bomb.

73
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,011
What's up, partner?

74
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:51,026
- I can't believe this.
- This is my replacement?

75
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,151
Jesus.

76
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,992
{\pos(192,225)}- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

77
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,662
{\pos(192,225)}Damn, we should have
ditched that RV months ago.

78
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,037
It's all, like, shining up in here.

79
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:09,926
I'm sorry. I must be missing something.
I don't mean to be...

80
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:13,714
This...

81
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:17,127
... makes no sense.

82
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,537
{\pos(192,225)}So...

83
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,420
{\pos(192,225)}I guess this is...

84
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,554
{\pos(192,225)}Dear mother of God.

85
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,775
This is for the best.

86
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,271
200 pounds a week.

87
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:44,613
Got it?

88
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,190
{\pos(192,225)}Man!

89
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,092
Okay. There's a lot to show you.

90
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,235
Some new techniques to learn.

91
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,138
What, now?

92
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:11,836
Yes, now.

93
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:13,835
{\pos(192,210)}We've only got a couple days

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,187
{\pos(192,210)}before our next batch is due,
and I need to get you up to speed.

95
00:07:18,665 --> 00:07:19,665
{\pos(192,210)}Right on.

96
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:21,991
{\pos(192,210)}I'm just saying...

97
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,414
How's the cell service down here?

98
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,198
It's nonexistent.

99
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,851
{\pos(192,185)}We're shielded.

100
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,327
{\pos(192,185)}There's a hard line
for emergencies. Come on.

101
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,923
So you haven't talked
to anybody today

102
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,499
other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

103
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,667
Why?

104
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,456
Your brother-in-law.

105
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,048
What about him?

106
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:50,595
Upon arrival, he was unresponsive.

107
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,889
You getting some exposure
on those wounds?

108
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:55,333
- 2 units of normal saline.
- We've got a bivalve mass.

109
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,313
He's got breath sounds bilaterally.
This femur is{\feels} like a wet bag of gravel.

110
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,939
The other one's not much better.
Let's get those boots off.

111
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:04,218
See if you get a pulse.
You get a blood pressure cup or an ABI?

112
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:05,485
Where's that blood?

113
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:12,794
{\pos(192,210)}Sir, can I help you?

114
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:15,196
{\pos(192,210)}It's all right.
He's family.

115
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:20,602
{\pos(192,210)}I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

116
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,216
I'm so sorry.

117
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,535
I don't know what to say.

118
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,069
How is he?

119
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:42,777
{\pos(192,210)}I don't know. They won't really tell us
anything and he's still in surgery.

120
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:46,367
They shot him four times.

121
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:49,535
Christ.

122
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,037
Where's Holly?

123
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,963
I got a sitter.

124
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,109
- How are you?
- Fine.

125
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,139
{\pos(192,210)}Sure?

126
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,309
I'm fine. I just need
some fresh air.

127
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:17,749
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it.

128
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:19,047
{\pos(192,210)}I'm fine.

129
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,701
{\pos(192,210)}This is ASAC Merkert.

130
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:28,151
Hank's brother-in-law Walt.

131
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:30,605
I'm very sorry.

132
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,673
Thank you.

133
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:35,376
Can you tell us anything
or any details?

134
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:38,146
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

135
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,331
They didn't have any I.D. on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

136
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,919
Their tattoos indicated
an affiliation with the drug cartel.

137
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,358
{\pos(192,210)}Why did they attack Hank?

138
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:52,026
{\pos(192,210)}We're not sure yet.

139
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,562
{\pos(192,210)}It could be in relation

140
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,464
{\pos(192,210)}to an investigation
that Hank was working,

141
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,934
{\pos(192,210)}or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

142
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:04,646
They had an ax.

143
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,104
{\pos(192,210)}The cartels tend to be dramatic.

144
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,110
Jesus.

145
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,728
{\pos(192,210)}- Where are they? Did they...
- Hank got both of them.

146
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:18,639
He killed one outright,

147
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,870
and the other one's upstairs
in critical condition.

148
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,271
Your brother-in-law's
one tough son of a bitch

149
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,983
{\pos(192,210)}to take them both out,

150
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,571
{\pos(192,210)}considering he didn't
even have his gun.

151
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,224
He didn't have his gun?

152
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:38,924
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

153
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,710
The assault charge.

154
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,794
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

155
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,419
That means I had to
take away his weapon.

156
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:53,755
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay, All right. Listen.

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,781
If you would have all listened
to him right from the start,

158
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,760
and let him arrest
that little degenerate,

159
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:01,030
he wouldn't have had to take
things into his own hands,

160
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:04,148
and he would have had a gun
and defended himself.

161
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,191
- Let's just...
- No. Just...

162
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,138
It's their fault.

163
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:12,673
He didn't have a gun.

164
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,776
Honey, this isn't helping you.

165
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,138
You.

166
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,337
What kind of partner are you?

167
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:24,519
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

168
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,554
Where were you?

169
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,346
Texas.

170
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:31,683
And you.

171
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,801
You're supposed to
protect your agents

172
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,665
instead of taking their guns,

173
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,100
not supporting them,

174
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:40,740
not backing them up...

175
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,170
when they...

176
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:45,674
Honey, let's just go
and sit down, okay?

177
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,609
I'm not doing anything

178
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,845
until these two get
the hell out of here.

179
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,920
I mean it.

180
00:11:58,037 --> 00:11:59,302
Sorry... Go.

181
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,622
You are not welcome here.

182
00:12:01,747 --> 00:12:04,761
The DEA is not welcome here.

183
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,295
Come on.

184
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,321
Come on. Let's go sit down.

185
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,002
It's not just them.

186
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,568
It's you, Walt.

187
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,455
This Pinkman

188
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:39,336
that Hank was looking for...

189
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:41,898
Hank would have never
even heard his name

190
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:45,993
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

191
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,394
Do you ever think about that, Walt?

192
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:50,885
Do you?

193
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,324
Do you ever think about everything
that you have put him through?

194
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,544
Stop.

195
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:58,462
You're upset,

196
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,509
and you're looking for someone to blame,
and it's understandable,

197
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,157
but don't blame Walt.

198
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,230
It's not his fault.

199
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:13,995
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,529
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:16,963
Sweetheart. No.
Don't...

202
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,304
It's okay.

203
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:24,773
It's Hank...

204
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:26,814
It's all right.

205
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,554
All right, you're done.

206
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,038
Okay, next.

207
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,117
Jesse Pinkman in the house!

208
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:56,187
My...

209
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,899
dear...

210
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:58,816
God.

211
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,749
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

212
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,464
<i>Walter White, please
pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

213
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:56,134
<i>We working sometime this year?</i>

214
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:59,600
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

215
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:02,459
I tried your cell, and it
went straight to voice mail.

216
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:05,309
- How {\else }am I supposed to get hold of you?
- You aren't.

217
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:08,486
<i>Look, man, it's been a whole day.
How long is this grieving process?</i>

218
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,321
Just put a clock on it for me.

219
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,418
<i>All's I'm saying is
we have a schedule, right?</i>

220
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:16,089
My family comes
before your schedule.

221
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,329
<i>Dude, it's not my schedule.</i>

222
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,091
We have responsibilities here.

223
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:22,316
<i>I'll get there when I get there.</i>

224
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,296
You know what? Whatever.

225
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,299
I'll just cook on my own.
You will do no such thing.

226
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,424
<i>Why not?</i>

227
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,737
<i>For starters,</i>

228
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,815
you aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

229
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,600
<i>There's got to be some
sort of manual, right?</i>

230
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:40,257
And I can read.

231
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,923
- Touch nothing.
- <i>Stop treating me</i>

232
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:45,717
I'm like your assistant.
I'm not your bitch to order around.

233
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,946
We're partners.
Remember?

234
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,319
I need you

235
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,612
to sit patiently

236
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,392
and wait, and I will be there
as soon as I can.

237
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,561
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

238
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,529
We... We really do appreciate that.

239
00:17:58,654 --> 00:18:00,231
What, is your wife there?

240
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,591
<i>Uh, yes. Yes, she is,</i>

241
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,436
and she would be happy to know
that you asked about her.

242
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,254
{\And }Please do keep us in your thoughts.

243
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,440
Tell your douche-bag brother-in-law

244
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,032
to head towards the light.

245
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,785
So I'm thinking, um,

246
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,847
maybe we should go get
everybody some breakfast.

247
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,875
Yeah. That sounds good.

248
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:21,992
Do you know who that was?

249
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:37,941
You know,

250
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,591
these eggs are really not too bad.

251
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:56,844
Look{\ at that}.

252
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:59,263
- Look at what?
- At what?

253
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,557
This.
These spots.

254
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,910
This fork is absolutely filthy.

255
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,341
Tell me you see this.

256
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,402
You've got good eyes.
Look at that.

257
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,459
Those are just water spots.

258
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:16,739
Fork is fine.

259
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,032
Those are not water spots.

260
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,860
That's dirt.

261
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:25,713
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

262
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:28,788
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

263
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:30,462
God knows what.

264
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,445
Seriously, Aunt Marie,

265
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,920
it's water spots.

266
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,988
Ours at home aren't any better.

267
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,491
Yours at home are irrelevant.

268
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:41,915
We're in a hospital.

269
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,301
They need {\to be held to }a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

270
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:48,563
I'm not actually sure
if the cafeteria necessarily

271
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,832
qualifies
as being part of a hospital.

272
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,333
It's in the same building.

273
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,262
It's all under the same roof.

274
00:19:54,387 --> 00:19:56,550
Do you think
that sick people aren't eating

275
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,627
with this bacteria-infected
silverware?

276
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:01,503
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

277
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:10,673
I survived.

278
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,089
I had my lumpectomy
at this hospital.

279
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,457
Remember that?

280
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,957
Remember how scared we all were?

281
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:23,180
I didn't want to act like it,

282
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,500
but I was terrified.

283
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,406
All that week,

284
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,148
all I could think of
was how they were actually going to

285
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,816
cut me open

286
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:37,295
and take out a part of me

287
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,505
that was with me my entire life.

288
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,451
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

289
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,603
I think the scariest part
was when...

290
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,889
They took me into pre-op,

291
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:53,964
lying there,

292
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,541
waiting for them to anesthetize you,

293
00:20:58,136 --> 00:20:59,629
knowing that...

294
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:02,714
You may never wake up again.

295
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:10,593
Actually,

296
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,529
what I really remember
about that day

297
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:17,097
is driving to the hospital.

298
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,029
You remember me
wanting to drive that day?

299
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,325
Anyway, there we are.

300
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,243
We're driving up Central,

301
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:29,300
and we hit every green light...

302
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,458
Every single light that we hit...

303
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,002
green.

304
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,547
When does that happen?

305
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,602
Just like bang, bang,

306
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,603
green the entire way.

307
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,057
And the whole time,
all I could think about

308
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,961
was "Why today?

309
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:56,392
"Why can't I just spend
a few extra minutes

310
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,359
"in the car with my family?"

311
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:04,397
I never wanted to be stuck
in traffic so bad in my life.

312
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,514
At least I was with my family.

313
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,240
I had that.

314
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:18,546
Anyway,

315
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,627
I survived this place.

316
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:26,122
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

317
00:22:58,676 --> 00:23:00,379
I was going to ask you
the same question.

318
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,685
<i>I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?</i>

319
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:15,415
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

320
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,400
Someone gave the go-ahead.

321
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,030
<i>Are you accusing me?</i>

322
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,574
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

323
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,403
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

324
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,074
I assume

325
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,308
<i>that the next shipment
will be delayed.</i>

326
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:33,031
<i>Any thoughts
on when it might arrive?</i>

327
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:34,972
A week, a month.

328
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:36,999
There's too much
focus on the border.

329
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,181
We lay low for the time being.

330
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:40,464
We lay low,

331
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,047
and then we get the real story
from my man who survived.

332
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,431
Your man is in custody.

333
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:50,298
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

334
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:52,014
I'll get him the best lawyer,

335
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,051
<i>and then we'll learn the truth.</i>

336
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,308
Keep me apprised.

337
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,358
Any time you've got that close
proximity to the spine,

338
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,856
there's always going to be cause
for concern, but, as I say,

339
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,766
it's really too soon to tell.

340
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:11,116
He's out of surgery,
at least, which is...

341
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,951
Out of surgery,
on his way to recovery.

342
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,110
All right.
Where's that?

343
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:17,081
Unfortunately,
you can't see him just yet.

344
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:19,416
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

345
00:24:20,302 --> 00:24:22,002
How long will that take?

346
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,774
I can't really say.
Could be hours,

347
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,217
but we'll let you know
just as soon as you could see him.

348
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:30,727
Thank you.

349
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:40,141
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

350
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,466
Get some rest?

351
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,363
I'm not going anywhere.

352
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:46,860
Me, neither.

353
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,865
Is anyone else dying
to brush their teeth,

354
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,340
or is it just me?

355
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,293
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

356
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:06,206
I could swing by your place.

357
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:07,738
That would be great.

358
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:09,013
Thanks, Walt.

359
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:32,114
We just heard he came through?

360
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,911
Yeah, well, it's...
You know, guardedly good news.

361
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,569
Thank God.
I'll take it.

362
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,206
Hey, guys, this is
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

363
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,711
We were just swapping Hank stories.

364
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,249
That could go on all day.

365
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:49,673
God knows,
there's a million of them.

366
00:25:51,487 --> 00:25:52,468
Meanwhile...

367
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,762
Miserable piece of shit.

368
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:57,539
Guy who shot him,
the one that's left, he's up there,

369
00:25:57,664 --> 00:26:00,728
got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

370
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,311
Your tax dollars at work.

371
00:26:02,955 --> 00:26:04,980
You ought to see what
Hank did to that bastard.

372
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:07,868
Want to see?

373
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:11,882
Come on, let me show you.

374
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:34,927
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

375
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:33,944
You got him?

376
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,112
Come on.

377
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,295
Easy, easy.

378
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,688
{\pub}Fallacies

379
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,089
Fallacies

380
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:37,467
One for you and two for...

381
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,268
Finally.
About damn time.

382
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,802
Why isn't there anything cooking?

383
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:02,385
<i>Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

384
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,124
- <i>Operator.</i>
- This is Walter White.

385
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,599
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

386
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>We got problems, big ones.</i>

387
00:30:14,237 --> 00:30:17,817
Reverend, so nice of you to call...
Again.

388
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:19,391
Turn your phone on already.

389
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:22,614
<i>You know,
I will definitely look into that.</i>

390
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:26,917
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone.

391
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:31,800
I told you to wait.

392
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,896
I don't know how many more ways
I could say it.

393
00:30:34,021 --> 00:30:35,873
<i>Yeah, dick, I was waiting,</i>

394
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:38,401
<i>and then that creepy,
quiet guy showed up.</i>

395
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:41,943
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

396
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:44,176
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

397
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,170
It was the other one, the one
that I'm qualified to speak to.

398
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,681
{\Then }He started asking questions{\, too},

399
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,706
<i>like why I haven't cooked anything.</i>

400
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,685
<i>We have a quota.</i>

401
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:54,921
It's due tomorrow.

402
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:56,606
Do you seriously not care, or what?

403
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:59,866
<i>Because that guy, he's got,
like, the dead eyes.</i>

404
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,386
Let me ask you something.

405
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,367
Do you remember when we were out
in the desert with Tuco?

406
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,691
You mean when he put
a machinegun to my head?

407
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:10,411
Yeah, I think that does ring
a tiny bell. Why?

408
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:14,472
He kept saying that someone

409
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:17,161
was coming up from Mexico to get us.

410
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:19,904
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

411
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:21,973
<i>What {\the hell }has this even got to do with...</i>

412
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,133
I don't know.
It was...

413
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,660
His cousins.

414
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:32,463
Right, Jesse?
It was his cousins.

415
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:34,987
Cousins.

416
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:36,896
Whatever, man. Why?

417
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:57,107
Any news?

418
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:58,779
No change.

419
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,927
I didn't know whose
toothbrushes were whose, so I...

420
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,195
I just stopped by the drugstore.

421
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:13,572
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

422
00:32:22,471 --> 00:32:24,871
I think I'm going to go
wash my face.

423
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,327
I'm going crazy.

424
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,418
Do you want to come?

425
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:48,686
I got candy bars.

426
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:56,115
Is this what you were asking for?

427
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,939
I skimmed through it.
Looks interesting.

428
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:06,794
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

429
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,925
What's it about?

430
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:20,252
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '80s.

431
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,295
I remember seeing him on the news.

432
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,467
It's more about the guys
who investigated him

433
00:33:30,136 --> 00:33:32,036
and tried to bring him down.

434
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:34,512
Some of them were DEA, you know?

435
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:39,808
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about,

436
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:43,970
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

437
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:47,345
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

438
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,780
I guess I never thought about it.

439
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:58,934
He said that good guys

440
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,309
never get ink like the bad guys do.

441
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:12,454
So he gave it to me.

442
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:15,238
Figured I'd read it.

443
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:31,255
I need to...

444
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,948
I'll be right back, okay?

445
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:43,313
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

446
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:44,488
Absolutely.

447
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,801
<i>So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.</i>

448
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:53,718
No. Unfortunately...

449
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:55,369
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

450
00:34:55,984 --> 00:34:57,513
<i>we're not going to be able</i>

451
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,789
to keep our schedule this week.

452
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,310
But not for lack of trying.

453
00:35:02,478 --> 00:35:04,240
Is there something I should know?

454
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,330
To be completely honest with you...

455
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:11,404
Gale really screwed us up.

456
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,210
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just...

457
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:18,608
He set us way back, and we've
been playing catch-up ever since.

458
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:24,388
And I've had to be out
running errands

459
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,085
<i>and trying to keep us on target.</i>

460
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:31,621
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly and...

461
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,816
It's just all very technical
and boring,

462
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:37,316
but rest assured that...

463
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,463
that we will do whatever it takes.

464
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,808
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

465
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:45,302
<i>We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.</i>

466
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:49,781
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

467
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:55,779
I have your word on that?

468
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,234
You do.

469
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,109
You have my word on that.

470
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,690
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

471
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,013
Any news?

472
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,711
I'm just wandering.

473
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,875
How's everybody doing?

474
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,478
Well, as well as can be expected.

475
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:44,142
It's this not knowing

476
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,655
that's the hardest part, I think.

477
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,184
Anything new on these guys?

478
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,836
Who they are?
What they wanted?

479
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:55,071
No, nothing yet,

480
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:56,546
but we'll get it.

481
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:02,149
Steve...

482
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:07,518
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

483
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:11,856
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

484
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:14,463
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

485
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:18,974
No way.

486
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,912
I'd love to walk in there and
shoot that bastard right in the head.

487
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Me, too.

488
00:37:39,786 --> 00:37:41,744
Great. We'll be right down.

489
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:43,585
Food's here.

490
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:46,336
You like Pollos Hermanos?

491
00:37:49,657 --> 00:37:50,854
On occasion, yeah.

492
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,272
Owner's a big booster for the DEA.
He heard what happened.

493
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,732
He's going to feed
every cop in the building.

494
00:37:57,691 --> 00:37:58,984
That's wonderful.

495
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,259
Yeah, and apparently
he's bringing it by personally.

496
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,212
{\pub}- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

497
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:15,337
Good?

498
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:17,263
Delicious.

499
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,961
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

500
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:21,679
Yes, thank you.

501
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:25,611
Guys, did you hear that?
Mr. Fring is offering a $10,000 reward

502
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,936
on any information about the case.

503
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:31,534
That's wonderful.

504
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:33,940
Thank you, Mr. Fring.

505
00:38:34,391 --> 00:38:35,822
You're very welcome.

506
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,861
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

507
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,838
between us and these animals.

508
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:41,281
I only wish I could do more.

509
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:49,198
We do appreciate your support.

510
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:51,651
This reward
could turn the tide here.

511
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,176
It'll really help.

512
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,337
Again,

513
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,555
I can't express how sorry I am.

514
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,216
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

515
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:02,344
Really?

516
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:04,554
Our fun run, a couple months ago.

517
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:07,941
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

518
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:11,922
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

519
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:14,064
As a matter of fact,

520
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,418
Mr. White, your name came up.

521
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:20,632
Really?

522
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,540
There happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

523
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,778
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

524
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:31,153
I hope that there's been good news.

525
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,730
Things have improved, yes.

526
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,984
That's wonderful to hear.

527
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,471
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

528
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:49,140
I've taken up enough of your time.

529
00:39:51,894 --> 00:39:55,063
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

530
00:39:55,577 --> 00:39:57,273
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

531
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:02,206
- Let me walk you out.
- It's not necessary.

532
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:11,469
You know, I didn't say thank you.

533
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:12,767
I'll walk him out.

534
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,342
I'll be right back.

535
00:40:19,256 --> 00:40:20,806
Enjoying the chicken?

536
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:29,767
It's good chicken?

537
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:34,510
I just wanted to thank you again.

538
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,985
It's my pleasure.

539
00:40:36,396 --> 00:40:38,295
May I speak with you?

540
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:39,851
Just a moment?

541
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:45,744
You knew.

542
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,640
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

543
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:53,621
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

544
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:55,902
What careful man wouldn't?

545
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:59,473
He is not a problem for us,

546
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:00,948
for our business.

547
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,719
Your being here is...

548
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:11,137
Is this some sort of message?

549
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:13,421
I'm supporting my community.

550
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:16,143
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

551
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,647
- Are we done?
- This attack on my brother-in-law...

552
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:22,141
I don't understand it.

553
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:24,235
I don't know what it means.

554
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:28,504
Please, if you have some knowledge

555
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:30,498
that you could share with me.

556
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:37,119
I fear for my family.

557
00:41:38,107 --> 00:41:39,334
I'm sure they'll be fine.

558
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:41,877
I am told the assassin that survived

559
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:43,493
is gravely injured.

560
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:45,368
It's doubtful he'll live.

561
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,975
Now thank me and shake my hand.

562
00:41:56,003 --> 00:41:57,903
Thank you.
Thank you again.

563
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,891
You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

564
00:42:11,186 --> 00:42:12,486
What's going on?

565
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,210
What's happening?

566
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,930
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

567
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:22,919
- Defib?
- No reason. Patient is in asystole.

568
00:42:23,264 --> 00:42:25,087
Continuing chest compressions.

569
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,050
- Give me a liter of saline wide open.
- I can't get a pulse back.

570
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:32,128
Still nothing.

571
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,343
All right.
Stopping compressions.

572
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,319
Time.

573
00:42:35,444 --> 00:42:36,444
8:43.

574
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:38,810
Time of death. 20:43.

575
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,180
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

576
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:13,790
<i>I assume you heard the news.</i>

577
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:15,115
Your man died.

578
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:16,532
I heard.

579
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:17,785
It's unfortunate.

580
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:19,183
<i>Yeah, "unfortunate",</i>

581
00:43:19,351 --> 00:43:22,301
and meanwhile,
I have <i>Federales</i> surrounding my house.

582
00:43:22,426 --> 00:43:24,144
You know what I think, Gustavo?

583
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:26,107
{\I think }You're behind all this.

584
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,780
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

585
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:32,038
That's the part
I'm trying to figure out.

586
00:43:32,163 --> 00:43:33,963
Go off on your own, maybe.

587
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:37,300
Would you actually think
that would work?

588
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:39,649
<i>You sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

589
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:42,540
Maybe you should call me back
when you're seeing things more clearly.

590
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,459
I see things clear enough.

591
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:48,087
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

592
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,381
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

593
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:53,448
<i>and I wind up with </i>Federals<i>
in my rose bushes.</i>

594
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:55,178
<i>But just for a while.</i>

595
00:43:55,787 --> 00:43:57,263
Appearances,

596
00:43:57,431 --> 00:43:58,431
politics.

597
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:01,831
<i>Are you still there, Gustavo?</i>

598
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:04,854
I'm here.

599
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:07,565
<i>I'll weather this.
I always do.</i>

600
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:09,485
My brother's a police chief.

601
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,070
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

602
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:13,738
And when I get proof

603
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:17,326
and the others find out
what you've done,

604
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:20,064
maybe we come pay you a visit.

605
00:44:20,988 --> 00:44:22,038
<i>Maybe we...</i>

606
00:45:15,438 --> 00:45:17,593
How is he?
Tell me something good.

607
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:21,275
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

608
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,652
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediate family only.

609
00:45:23,777 --> 00:45:24,767
We're all family.

610
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:25,919
I understand,

611
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:28,396
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need...

612
00:45:28,884 --> 00:45:30,296
We're all family.
