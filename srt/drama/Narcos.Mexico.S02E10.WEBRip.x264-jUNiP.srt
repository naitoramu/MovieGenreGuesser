1
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,664
I want you to finish your food.

2
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,043
We're not eating again until dinnertime.

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,258
- You tossed and turned all night.
- Yeah?

4
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,843
Anything going on at work?

5
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,055
Nothing new.

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,892
Everything's back to normal.

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,980
Normal's good. Right?

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,233
Yes.

9
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,862
Everything's good. Very good.

10
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,078
Drink your milk too.

11
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,863
What happened, man?
You forget how to pack?

12
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,490
Clean this up.

13
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,451
Put this stuff in those boxes.

14
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,954
- What happened?
- Offside.

15
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,081
Yo, we're out of beer.

16
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,374
Yeah, all right. I'll go.

17
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,253
Pack this up and put it over there.

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,926
- What's the score?
- Still one-zero.

19
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,553
Those assholes don't know how to play.

20
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,972
Aponte can't defend worth
a shit since last season.

21
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,808
Gonna get the beers, be right back.

22
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,560
Zarco, keep an eye on those clowns.

23
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,354
Hey!
Really need the bazooka, Rambo?

24
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,237
Funny guy.

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,405
Just go.

26
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,703
Cross it, asshole!

27
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,980
Sell-out crowd here

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,098
on a beautiful, sunshiny day.

29
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,103
Two and two is the count.
We're up to six pitches in this at-bat.

30
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:11,274
It is Fan Appreciation Day
here at the ballpark.

31
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,026
Last day of the regular season.

32
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,320
The two-two pitch.

33
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,240
Breaking ball. Swung on.
Hits it off his foot.

34
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,909
That's $3.99.

35
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,792
And the count remains two and two.

36
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,833
So, this game of cat
and mouse continues.

37
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,212
The crowd really wants a strikeout here,

38
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,757
in a tight game in the top of the sixth.

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,300
Looks in and delivers.

40
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,593
What's the score?

41
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,802
Popped him up.

42
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,554
Still one-nothing.

43
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,014
Come on, Dodgers.

44
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,516
He's got enough room,
and he corrals it...

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,101
Thank you, miss.

46
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,356
So one not-very-quick out
with a nine-pitch at bat

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,774
here in the top of the sixth.

48
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,360
And that'll bring up the second
baseman who's one for three...

49
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,961
Son of a bitch...

50
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,504
Go, go, go, go!

51
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,838
Get back! Get back!

52
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,274
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

53
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,318
Like this, in your home.

54
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,822
Azul tells me things in
Sinaloa are going well.

55
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,451
It's coming along, coming along.

56
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,328
Handling business, sir.

57
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,205
Good to hear.

58
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,915
I wanted...

59
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,126
I wanted to talk to you
about Héctor Palma.

60
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,629
Said you'd think about
letting him back in,

61
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,547
- giving him a pass.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,716
Thing is,

63
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,220
Palma tried to pull out
of the Federation.

64
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,056
- He fucked up. I know that.
- No, Chapo.

65
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,474
He didn't fuck up.

66
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,892
He betrayed all of us.

67
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,104
It was just talk.
He never did anything.

68
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,707
- Because I stopped him.
- He was messed up in the head.

69
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,442
The Cochi thing, it hit him hard,
just like everyone else.

70
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,050
Heard anything about Palma?

71
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,455
You've spoken to him, Chapo?

72
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,625
No, not since he ran.
Haven't heard a thing.

73
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,420
Güero is a good man.

74
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,754
A good worker.

75
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,049
They like him in Sinaloa.
He can help grow the plaza.

76
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,843
Make money for everyone.

77
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,390
The bosses, they're cool with it.

78
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,518
What do you mean?

79
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,894
We spoke about it, all of us.

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,314
Palma's coming back.
And they approve.

81
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,028
You're a good friend.

82
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,197
Loyal.

83
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,033
All right, Chapo.

84
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,578
I'll let you know.

85
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,829
Thanks for coming.

86
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,459
Thank you for your time.

87
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,172
Take care, Chapo.

88
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,178
What?

89
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,639
Bosses are taking votes now?

90
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,976
Palma's popular. Respected.

91
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,230
Clemency could be smart.

92
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,025
After all the shit we've been through...

93
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,155
What have you heard about
Palma? Where is he?

94
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,657
We know the family's
holed up in Acapulco.

95
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,119
His wife used a credit
card to pay for a motel.

96
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,165
Have guys keeping an eye on it,
but Palma hasn't showed.

97
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,461
Once money starts coming in
from the Juárez shipment,

98
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,131
if Héctor Palma is ready
to ask for forgiveness,

99
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,550
a pardon makes sense.

100
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,218
We interrupt this program

101
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,068
with breaking news coming
out of Sylmar, California.

102
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,695
From New York City
with a special report.

103
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,039
Federal agents in California...

104
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,367
Hey, Morris, it's coming on now.

105
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,744
You hear about this thing, Breslin?

106
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,372
Some shit went down in L.A.

107
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,624
To this country by
the drug criminals,

108
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,544
the untold tons that are
still getting through

109
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,588
to the streets and brains of
Americans, especially the young,

110
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,758
and how hard it's going to
be to turn that around.

111
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,218
David Dow reports.

112
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,472
Authorities say a citizen's
tip led them to the warehouse

113
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,349
in a North Los Angeles suburb,

114
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,435
where they made the largest
cocaine seizure in history.

115
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,897
At least 20 tons, with a street
value that could range as high...

116
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,441
That doesn't make fucking sense.

117
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,280
It gave me cold chills

118
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,401
when I walked in and looked at it,

119
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,656
and the magnitude of it has
really not sunk into me yet.

120
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,824
It's enormous...

121
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,493
It's gonna bring tears to a
lot of people's eyes tonight

122
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,177
because it's not gonna be on the street.

123
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,582
Up to that morning in 1989,

124
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,918
the biggest cocaine bust in
American history was four tons,

125
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,087
grabbed in Fort Lauderdale.

126
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,798
But the world heavyweight title holder?

127
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,500
That was the 11 tons pulled
out of the Colombian jungle

128
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,886
in Tranquilandia.

129
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,888
That shit was legendary.

130
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,809
You added both those
busts together though,

131
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,979
still wouldn't touch the
haul from that warehouse.

132
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,981
Sylmar blew them away.

133
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,442
And it wasn't fucking close.

134
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,277
North of 20 tons.

135
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,447
Worth $7 billion, easy.

136
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,326
No one had ever seen that
much cocaine in one place.

137
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,038
Oh, and there was over $12
million in cash on hand.

138
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,415
Pizza money, I guess.

139
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,585
And all of it, the entire place,

140
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,254
was secured with a six-dollar padlock.

141
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,676
Fuck.

142
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,640
It was the kind of bust
that makes careers.

143
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
Or ends them.

144
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,553
We've been short on cash for months.

145
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,442
And the fucking Colombians who
were finally going to pay us

146
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,861
just lost billions of dollars.

147
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,489
How are the Colombians
gonna pay us now, eh?

148
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,323
I'm not sure.

149
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm not sure.

150
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,160
But they're going to pay us.

151
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,828
They have to. Right?

152
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:07,249
With what? They just lost more
coke than anyone's ever seen.

153
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,628
- They better fucking give us our money.
- Or what? What can we do?

154
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,879
I'll fuck them up, bro.

155
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,131
Really, Ramón? How?

156
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,802
I'll get a fucking army,
all killers, man.

157
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,387
With what money?

158
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,683
You gonna walk up to the Colombians
and ask them for a loan?

159
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,101
Hey, hey.

160
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,728
Or have them buy you fucking
guns? Don't be stupid.

161
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,730
Things are gonna get ugly, man.

162
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,998
We don't need a damn army.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
That's what I just said!

164
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,442
Yeah.

165
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,053
Hello.

166
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,226
Of course, it'd be my pleasure.

167
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,688
Come to Guadalajara,
I'll see you here. Much safer.

168
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,339
It's okay. Stay with the car.

169
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,751
Would you like a drink, sir?

170
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,295
Strawberry daiquiri.

171
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,804
I preferred Panama.

172
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,723
But Guadalajara, it's okay.

173
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:33,229
Look at you, still walking around.

174
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,232
You must have forgiving partners.

175
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,360
It was unfortunate.

176
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,404
But ultimately...

177
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,199
insignificant.

178
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,659
Really?

179
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,035
Insignificant?

180
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:50,787
Listen to yourself.

181
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,875
Seven billion dollars' worth of
cocaine, lost on your watch.

182
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,127
That's insignificant?

183
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,633
We Colombians can always make
more cocaine, Miguel Ángel.

184
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,469
On top of that, there's my fee.

185
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,763
Two hundred and ten million dollars.

186
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,306
That's a lot of money.

187
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,724
Well, as I once said,

188
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,893
cocaine is fast.

189
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,396
Money is slow.

190
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,402
Perhaps we can do something
about that this time.

191
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,114
My partners and I want
to make you a proposal.

192
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,367
One that we believe you will like.

193
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,076
Let's hear it.

194
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,164
We are prepared to offer
you $4,000 a kilo.

195
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,750
Half up-front.

196
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,461
The other half upon delivery.

197
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,798
That's $280 million
to your organization.

198
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,053
Yeah, you grow the leaf.

199
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,680
You process it.

200
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,266
And maybe you can make enough of it

201
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,643
to replace what you lost

202
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,521
and keep you from being
buried by Escobar.

203
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,316
But...

204
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,444
I know something else, Pacho.

205
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,197
I'm the only person that can move it.

206
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,159
That's if you want to
cross it through Mexico.

207
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,663
Miguel Ángel...

208
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,167
we did great things together.

209
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,753
Seventy tons.

210
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,338
We?

211
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,592
Sorry, but you're wrong, Pacho.

212
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,136
What you tried to do...

213
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,555
was fuck me over.

214
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,142
Right? But you weren't able to.

215
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,118
And now, here you are with
your fucking hat in your hand

216
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,440
asking for a favor.

217
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,360
Because you are drowning.

218
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,863
You should understand...

219
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,991
I'm a very resentful person.

220
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,871
And I prefer to let you drown.

221
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,294
I've heard things about you, Félix.

222
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,089
Things you've done,

223
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,675
how you do business.

224
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:18,227
It's a funny thing, this Sylmar
thing happening when it did.

225
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,399
If you want me to handle your product,

226
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,944
then I'll get paid differently.

227
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,365
Pay attention.

228
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,285
I keep half the loads

229
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,247
that come through here.

230
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,752
Kilo for kilo.

231
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:51,760
If this doesn't work for
you, go through Canada.

232
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,931
It's only 3,000 miles that way.

233
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,895
You getting into sales?

234
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,153
That's a dangerous path, Félix.

235
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,530
I wonder if you have
thought this through.

236
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,241
Don't worry.

237
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,202
I've thought this through.

238
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,249
And your partners, are they on board?

239
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,752
I don't have partners.

240
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
I have employees.

241
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,385
So...

242
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,430
I assume we have a deal.

243
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,942
Make that to go.

244
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,361
He's not staying.

245
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,795
Enjoy, Miguel Ángel.

246
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,686
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,358
The asshole asked for more time.

248
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,986
Told him he could have it.

249
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,750
But from now on he's
paying me in product.

250
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,406
- Retail?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,408
Thought we were done with that.

252
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,702
After what happened last time...

253
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,664
Sylmar changed that.
This is an opportunity.

254
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,375
It's a gamble, a dangerous one.

255
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,336
The plaza bosses just
lost a lot of money.

256
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,796
They won't be happy.

257
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,299
And a move this big should
be discussed by everyone.

258
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,969
It's done, Azul.

259
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,221
That won't go over well.

260
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,599
The plazas see themselves
as partners now.

261
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,059
What is it with you, Azul?

262
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,354
Are you their spokesperson now?

263
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,273
Who do you work for?

264
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,360
That's right.

265
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,613
Call a meeting of the plazas.

266
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,118
I need to see their faces so
I know who I can count on.

267
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,582
Azul, come here.

268
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,211
I've made a decision on Güero Palma.

269
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,017
Don't worry, it's just me.

270
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,519
Sweetie, go to the bedroom.

271
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,819
What are you doing here?

272
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,197
How'd you find us?

273
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,951
It's not easy to hide from Félix.

274
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,411
He knows you've been here,

275
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,413
hiding out with the kids
for the last few weeks.

276
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,250
- Oh, shit.
- Wait, relax.

277
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,626
Everything's cool.

278
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,711
Félix decided to give Héctor a pass.

279
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,173
Clemency, to help smooth things
out with the plaza bosses.

280
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,758
I'm here to take you home.

281
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,986
Look at that.

282
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,862
Beautiful.

283
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,615
Yeah. Nice.

284
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,083
Hey, let's pull over...

285
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,296
get some fresh air,

286
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,256
take a break.

287
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Sure.

288
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,511
Pull over.

289
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,470
All right.

290
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,197
You two stay in the car.

291
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,034
Don't get out.
Take care of your brother.

292
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,753
So beautiful.

293
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,421
Yes.

294
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,013
Listen, I need to talk
to you about something.

295
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,855
What we had, it was exciting.

296
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,567
I care a lot about you.

297
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,406
But I love my husband and my family.

298
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,410
Once I get back, we can't
keep seeing each other.

299
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,748
I know.

300
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,097
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

301
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,102
I'm sorry, Guadalupe.
I don't have a choice.

302
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,990
Don't worry, kids,
everything's going to be fine.

303
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,340
What's up?

304
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,632
It's done.

305
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,219
Boss, can I...?

306
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,974
Out of my way!

307
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,935
Juan! What happened?

308
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,938
Saying a grease fire probably
broke out in the kitchen.

309
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,404
Sit on your ass on your
own time, asshole!

310
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,239
Put out the fire!

311
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,242
- Put it out!
- Yes, sir, Don Juan.

312
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,330
That's bullshit.
Wasn't a fucking accident.

313
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,290
That skinny motherfucker in Guadalajara.

314
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,209
He's back.

315
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,961
Hear what he just did to
Héctor Palma's family?

316
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,884
Yes.

317
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,595
Right.

318
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,306
Goodbye.

319
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,026
I thought it was from a rabbit.

320
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,487
Rabbit?

321
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,781
Rabbits don't produce eggs.

322
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,616
They eat them, maybe.

323
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,590
Look, it has dots...

324
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,372
See what I found, Mama.

325
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,375
Go up to your room, Abril.
And close the door.

326
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,961
- Mama.
- Listen to your mother.

327
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,339
What's up?

328
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,466
Did you do it?

329
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,554
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

330
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,930
I don't.

331
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,936
Guadalupe Palma,

332
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,521
her children.

333
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,776
Whatever this is, you don't
want to have this conversation.

334
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,942
- No, I do.
- Don't touch me.

335
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,946
- Did you kill Güero's family?
- Shut up.

336
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,116
I'm not gonna fucking
shut up! Answer me!

337
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,537
Did you kill them?

338
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,416
I need them to fear me.

339
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,711
The men who work for me
need to be kept in line.

340
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,213
You're worse than I thought.

341
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,133
There was an opening,
and I made a move.

342
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,885
That's what I do, María.

343
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,512
You were a good man once.

344
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,473
Before all the lies started,
before all the whores you fucked,

345
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,350
before betraying your friends...

346
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,476
Rafa! Neto!

347
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,937
Comes with the territory, right?

348
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,230
Along with the big house,

349
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,345
- all that fucking jewelry.
- I never asked for that shit.

350
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,236
You didn't have to, did you?

351
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,322
You killed Güero Palma's children.

352
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,824
Fuck him, fucking Güero Palma.

353
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,947
I want you to leave!
Get the fuck out of this house!

354
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,536
Get in your fucking car and leave.

355
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,373
I'm not going anywhere.
Come here. So now you're terrified?

356
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,833
What about your family?

357
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,835
Should we talk about your dad?

358
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,754
- Don't compare yourself to my father.
- No?

359
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,298
He always protected
his family. He loved us.

360
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:18,345
You don't love anything. You can't.
You're fucking broken inside.

361
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,305
Go! Get out of here, leave now!

362
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,432
I'm not leaving. You are my
family, and I'm staying.

363
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,685
When have you ever cared
about your family?

364
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,063
Get out!

365
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,024
Get out! Leave now!

366
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,152
Enough, put that down.
Put that down.

367
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,030
If you come back,
I swear I'll kill you. I swear!

368
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,263
It's insane, Benjamín.

369
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,224
Can you imagine?

370
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,267
Félix is trying to scare all of us.

371
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,645
I'd say it's working then.

372
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,941
Félix ordered all of us to a meeting.

373
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,609
All the plazas.

374
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,944
What for?

375
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,320
Not sure.

376
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,908
He's going to fuck us over.

377
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,827
Again.

378
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,955
He won't ever stop, Benjamín,
not as long as we work for him.

379
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,039
That's it.

380
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,417
I know.

381
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,627
If you know, then what
are you going to do?

382
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,840
Félix is the one with the coke, my dear.

383
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,676
What can I do?

384
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,436
What if we had our own
connection in Colombia?

385
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,107
Have to say I'm surprised.

386
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,734
How did you get this number?

387
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,615
And what is it that you and
I need to discuss exactly?

388
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,950
I had Azul call you here so we
can discuss what comes next.

389
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,330
As of today,

390
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:55,668
the Federation's moving into
cocaine sales in the US.

391
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:03,134
Before long, we'll push the Colombians
out of the market altogether.

392
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,428
What about the money they owe us?

393
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,389
What about it?

394
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,351
We're talking about power, Aguilar.

395
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,146
Real power on both sides of the border.

396
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,274
But when do we see money?

397
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,569
Changing how things work
is gonna take time.

398
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,737
Exactly.

399
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,614
Exactly, Francisco.

400
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,992
It will take some time,
just have to hang in there.

401
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,161
Just be patient.

402
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,205
Three months, six,

403
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,748
maybe even a year.

404
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:40,421
And the decision for this
transformation, when did we make it?

405
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,257
We didn't.

406
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,468
I made this decision.

407
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,264
Listen, man,

408
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:54,102
I have the protection, I have
the product, transportation.

409
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,438
Don't get confused, Benjamín.

410
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,482
We are partners,

411
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,984
but this is my vision.

412
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,153
So the rumors are true.

413
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,781
You tipped them off on Sylmar.

414
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,537
Yeah.

415
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,497
It was me.

416
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,836
You only see what's in
front of you, right?

417
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,715
I'm talking about running the
Colombians out of business.

418
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,467
It's about control.

419
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,638
I'm talking about the future.

420
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,475
This meeting is to see who
has the same vision as me.

421
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,686
Who's on board and who isn't.

422
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,445
My family is pulling
out of the Federation.

423
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,453
Fine.

424
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,205
It's all right, Benjamín.
Good luck.

425
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,041
Just be careful.

426
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,129
I hear Tijuana is...
a little dangerous right now.

427
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,759
Tijuana belongs to the
Arellano Félix family.

428
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,427
Don't forget.

429
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:21,981
Sinaloa's out.

430
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,907
I'm with Guzmán.

431
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,534
We're keeping Sinaloa.

432
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,787
Palma is coming back.

433
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,414
Things have changed, Félix.

434
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,092
No, Azul. Nothing has changed.

435
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,847
Rats will always be rats.

436
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,520
Get the fuck out, Azul.

437
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,620
Pablo Acosta was full of shit, mostly.

438
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,207
But he was right about a couple things.

439
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,796
The price of being in business
with you is too high.

440
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,342
I'm out too, man.

441
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,179
Me and Aguilar are taking Juárez.

442
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,579
You all got together, huh?

443
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,999
I spoke with Cali.

444
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:08,588
Guaranteed them Mexico
can keep moving their coke.

445
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:12,467
But I told them it was us or you.

446
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,430
They chose us.

447
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,437
You're out, man.

448
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,868
So now you run the Federation?

449
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,079
Who, me? No.

450
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,916
There's no more Federation.

451
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,544
We all operate separately,
run our own territory.

452
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,964
It's better that way.

453
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,512
It's over.

454
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,562
How long?

455
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,274
How long you been
planning to fuck me over?

456
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,028
Been waiting for the right time.

457
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,781
I took you out on my own,

458
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,201
people get nervous.

459
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,621
This way, everyone owned a piece.

460
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,124
They don't see me as a threat.

461
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,974
You can run,

462
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,435
but it won't matter.

463
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,480
You wouldn't have any
of this without me.

464
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,107
I know.

465
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,276
I haven't forgotten.

466
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,696
Fine.

467
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,242
Fuck you, Amado.

468
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,949
You got some weird call from D.C.

469
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,492
Put the message on your desk.

470
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,291
When'd this come in?

471
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,210
Ten minutes ago.

472
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,506
Hey, you're gonna get to those
open status reports, right?

473
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,884
Yeah.

474
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,928
Yeah, sorry about that.

475
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,582
Good morning.

476
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,423
What's up, Isabella?

477
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,512
What are you doing here, Benjamín?

478
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,265
Came to check out your place.
It's nice.

479
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,728
What's going on?

480
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,398
I talked to my brothers, Isabella.

481
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,817
I told them.

482
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,069
You're being bought out.

483
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,364
I ran it through some
properties I put in your name,

484
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,992
then repurchased.

485
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,243
It's clean.

486
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,370
And generous.

487
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,928
What is this?

488
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,097
Your end.

489
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,143
For going away.
Tijuana's closed for business.

490
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,490
I'm not leaving Tijuana.

491
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,442
Look, my family's left the Federation.

492
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,237
We're taking Tijuana for ourselves.

493
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,573
I'll be working with my brothers now.

494
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,951
You sold out our business
to your brothers?

495
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,635
Where'd you think we'd end up?

496
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,580
There's a limit.

497
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,457
No, there isn't.

498
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,085
Fuck you.

499
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,464
I don't need a handout from the
woman I thought was my partner.

500
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,591
All of this...

501
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,676
wasn't just about money.

502
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,721
Don't make this more
difficult than it has to be.

503
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,057
Oh, sweetheart,

504
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,226
I've been difficult my
whole fucking life.

505
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,793
Federal police!

506
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,758
This way.

507
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,095
Let's go!

508
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,769
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo,

509
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,105
you're under arrest.

510
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:04,693
There's $5 million in a
safe upstairs, comandante.

511
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,029
Not interested.

512
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,246
So it is an arrest.

513
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,331
No one's here.

514
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,128
Makes sense.

515
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,049
Arrest's a better headline.

516
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,429
Justice served.

517
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,807
Keep your mouth shut, you live.

518
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,853
That's the only deal
Mexico City's giving.

519
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,792
Hand me my cigarettes.

520
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,895
On April 8th, 1989,

521
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:26,317
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo was
arrested at his home in Guadalajara.

522
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,611
The country's number-one fugitive,

523
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,156
the most powerful drug
trafficker Mexico had ever seen,

524
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,784
was taken into custody without
a single shot being fired.

525
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,662
Four months into the new
Mexican president's term,

526
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,081
it was a badly needed win

527
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,917
in more ways than one.

528
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,503
The arrest went down right
as Congress was considering

529
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,920
whether or not to certify
that Mexico was cooperating

530
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,132
in stopping drugs.

531
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,762
Not sure why the world's biggest
junkie was in a position to judge,

532
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,805
but that's another story.

533
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,560
Both Mexican and American officials
said there was no connection

534
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,731
between Félix's arrest and
the pending certification vote.

535
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,483
Of course there wasn't.

536
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,020
Certification would help polish up

537
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,690
the optics of the big new trade deal

538
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,739
that was being negotiated.

539
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,619
A stamp of approval so big
business could sell more shit.

540
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,290
Ink was barely dry on Félix's arrest
sheet when, what do you know,

541
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,751
Mexico's certification came through.

542
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,836
And just like that,

543
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,924
the last real hurdle to the trade
deal to end all trade deals

544
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,217
had been cleared.

545
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,697
Congratulations.

546
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,702
What the fuck happened here?

547
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,537
The machine turned on him.

548
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,248
Bullshit. He built the machine.

549
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,084
He wore out his welcome with the party.

550
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,169
And the plaza bosses.

551
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,714
Yeah.

552
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,509
So, what happens next?

553
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,846
I guess we'll see.

554
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,559
You know, the deputy director
in D.C. called me.

555
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,728
Told me you requested
me down here by name.

556
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,147
You wanted me here for the arrest.

557
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,358
But clearly, you don't need my help.

558
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,819
So why me?

559
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,196
Everyone likes good headlines, Walt.

560
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,992
After all the shit that went down,

561
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,578
seemed like you could use a win.

562
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,496
You never know when you're gonna
need a friend in our line of work.

563
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,459
I'm not your fucking friend, man.

564
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,128
I can promise you that.

565
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,550
I'll see you around, Walt.

566
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,721
Yes, you will.

567
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:09,313
Operation Leyenda was
a mission for justice,

568
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:13,150
for Kiki Camarena, and all
who have fallen victim

569
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,111
to the scourge of violent
narcotics trafficking.

570
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,824
Today, thanks to the
tireless efforts of the DEA

571
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,952
and our dedicated partners
in Mexican law enforcement,

572
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,206
we're able to say,
mission accomplished.

573
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,000
Congratulations, all around.

574
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,080
Fine work.

575
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,252
Well done.

576
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,129
Great job.

577
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,256
- Great job.
- Ted.

578
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,301
Ted Kaye, State Department.
What an honor.

579
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,261
- Over here, sir.
- We've met before.

580
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,388
Thank you, sir.

581
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,472
One more time.

582
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,809
Exceptional stuff, special agent.
My goodness, exceptional.

583
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,106
That's suitable for framing.

584
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,899
A win's a win.

585
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,027
I hear it helped punch your
ticket out of Sacramento.

586
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,612
I'm in El Paso now.

587
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,531
Back in the game.

588
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,741
Can't get enough of that border, huh?

589
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,787
I know your boss down
there, Jaime Kuykendall.

590
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,206
Yeah, he mentioned the two
of you knew each other.

591
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,084
Let me ask you something.

592
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,212
How's all this sit with you?

593
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,049
That's not the job, Walt.

594
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,262
Good luck in El Paso.

595
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,704
That's all of it.

596
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,998
Move it to the back.

597
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,500
Get the truck out of here.

598
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,933
There a problem, captain?

599
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,060
I paid my cut to the precinct
through next month.

600
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,353
New orders.

601
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,945
This is Arellano Félix territory,

602
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,071
and you, sweetheart,

603
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,990
are trespassing.

604
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,785
Take her away.

605
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,622
It's okay. Move the car.

606
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,507
It's done.

607
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,774
I don't know. I can't decide.

608
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,400
What do you think?

609
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,363
Well, with such lovely legs,

610
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,865
either one will look...

611
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,659
very good on you.

612
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,329
All right, maybe both then.

613
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,914
Why not.

614
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,041
Very well, why not.

615
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,876
I'll get the other pair.

616
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,960
Thank you.

617
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,007
We all know why we're here.

618
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,888
Any business needs understanding
among its participants.

619
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,015
As we've already agreed...

620
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,810
the men at this table

621
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,021
will run their own plazas

622
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,607
independently.

623
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:09,404
Benjamín Arellano Félix
and his family, Tijuana.

624
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,114
Myself,

625
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,325
Héctor Palma,

626
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,204
and our junior partner,
Chapo Guzmán...

627
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:19,957
Sinaloa.

628
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,378
Juan Guerra and his nephew Juan Ábrego,

629
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:25,963
the Gulf.

630
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,758
Amado Carrillo Fuentes

631
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,803
and Comandante Rafael Aguilar,

632
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,387
Juárez.

633
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,100
Gentleman,

634
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,603
as long as we all respect each other,

635
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,480
we can all prosper.

636
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,524
It's that simple.

637
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:51,697
But what we agree to today is to
put the future above the past.

638
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,282
Understood?

639
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,534
Understood.

640
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:56,618
Yes.

641
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,663
Güero, understood?

642
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,707
Yes.

643
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,168
A toast then...

644
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,379
to the future

645
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,632
and to our business, may it
continue for many years to come.

646
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,051
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

647
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,428
Cheers!

648
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,392
Hey, Joaquín...

649
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,895
no more fighting, all right?

650
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,591
Working late.

651
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,512
Yeah. You are too.

652
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,348
You...

653
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,976
You always read standing?

654
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,857
Yeah, my back's been bothering me.

655
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,196
Probably should crack
a window next time.

656
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,741
Oh, right.

657
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,662
How you settling in?

658
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,084
Hear you've been doing a lot of reading.

659
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,838
Yeah, I'm just... I'm trying
to figure out what's next.

660
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,926
That sounds ambitious. Any luck?

661
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,261
Nope.

662
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,305
Yeah.

663
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,934
Well, if that changes,
you make sure you let me know.

664
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,102
Yes, sir.

665
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,898
See you Monday, Agent Breslin.

666
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,942
- Yes, sir.
- You take care of that back.

667
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,612
Sir?

668
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,340
You have any juice

669
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,770
with the Minister of Public
Security down in Mexico City?

670
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,497
I got somebody I need to talk to.

671
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,989
You know who I am?

672
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,117
No, not a fucking idea.

673
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,705
But with that fucking accent,
I'm sure I could guess.

674
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,294
Told myself I'd show you this one day.

675
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,094
He had a family.

676
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,143
Yeah.

677
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,481
Isn't that the agent that was murdered?

678
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,276
It is, right?

679
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,072
They say he was badly tortured.

680
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,911
That they put holes in his entire body

681
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,955
with a power drill. Right?

682
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:36,046
If you think I'm the
reason Camarena's dead,

683
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,466
you're stupider than you look.

684
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,277
The way I see it,

685
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,725
you got sold out for a
fucking trade deal.

686
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,937
Why hold back now?

687
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,274
You got names...

688
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,569
I'm listening.

689
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,823
If I want to kill myself,
I'll use a rope.

690
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,827
Guess I'll have to be...

691
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,338
satisfied with you sitting in this hole

692
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,240
for however long you can hang on.

693
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,335
Enjoy.

694
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,194
What happened? You were leaving?

695
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,447
Okay, asshole.

696
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,616
Tell me...

697
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,121
what happens to the plazas
you used to control?

698
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,624
I didn't control anything.

699
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,502
You're confusing me.

700
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:03,008
But I've heard of a couple of things.

701
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,220
I've heard the plazas...

702
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,349
will become their own cartels.

703
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,769
They'll work separately.

704
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,772
At first...

705
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,193
it won't be so bad.

706
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,947
With luck, they'll work together.

707
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,409
But then...

708
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,289
they'll all want the best routes,

709
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,459
the best product,

710
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,212
access to the top dogs
in the government.

711
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,008
That's when the fireworks will start.

712
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,845
Tijuana will get stronger.

713
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,766
But once they consolidate power,

714
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,934
watch out.

715
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,605
War will break out.

716
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,068
With who?

717
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,737
Sinaloa.

718
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,325
Sinaloa has soldiers...

719
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,787
but needs a border.

720
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,955
And Tijuana

721
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,999
has a border.

722
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,211
If those idiots merged,

723
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,797
no one would stop them, but...

724
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,674
they can't wrap their heads around it.

725
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,845
It's personal with them.

726
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,642
While those two plazas keep
fighting, the Gulf will watch.

727
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,977
Getting stronger,

728
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,647
while those assholes get weaker.

729
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,985
Now I'll raise my glass

730
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:49,572
to toast for the simple pleasure
of making a lot of fucking money.

731
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,491
Stand up.

732
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,617
Let's toast.

733
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,120
Cheers.

734
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,039
But the key to all of it is Juárez.

735
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,501
Once the trade deal is done,

736
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,004
Juárez will be strong enough
to square off with anyone.

737
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,216
If they make the right moves...

738
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,762
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

739
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,642
Learn that name, gringo.

740
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:24,691
He could be the most powerful
trafficker this country's ever seen.

741
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,154
Unless someone with bigger balls

742
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,614
puts a bullet in his head.

743
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,954
It's just an idea.

744
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,461
Got the whole game figured out...

745
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:49,132
but still ended up in here.

746
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,970
I wanted more.

747
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,766
Sinaloans are like that.

748
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,688
What the fuck are you doing here?

749
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:04,898
What do you want?

750
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,775
I mean,

751
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,988
you don't give a shit about him.
He's not your friend...

752
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:14,240
or wasn't.

753
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,078
You don't give a shit about drugs
either. So what are you doing here?

754
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,638
I don't know, maybe I just like

755
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,292
putting assholes in jail.

756
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,670
Really?

757
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,923
I think...

758
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,798
you like to break
things and hurt people,

759
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,677
like most people from your country.

760
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,556
What?

761
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,725
You didn't like what I said?

762
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,395
Did you expect to hear something else?

763
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,441
Well, you're fucked.

764
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,278
The madness has begun...

765
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,614
and no one can stop it.

766
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,990
Without me,

767
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,118
no one can stop it.

768
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:03,039
DEA should've given me a badge.

769
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,128
You'll be drowning in blood...

770
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,173
chaos.

771
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,928
Now you'll see what happens
when the cage breaks open

772
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,640
and all the animals run free.

773
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,357
You're going to miss me.
