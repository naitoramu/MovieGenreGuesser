1
00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:02,862
Previously, on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,954 --> 00:00:05,205
Excuse me, ladies,
I need to ask you a few questions.

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:08,673
And then that dirty Southerner,
he snuck out the back.

4
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:11,225
Do you really think the
diaper sniper got all of it?

5
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:14,454
If you were Bagwell, and you just
got your hands on $5 million,

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,190
where would you go?

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:17,452
All right, listen,

8
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:19,910
- in the Rainbow Room.
- Restaurant in New York City.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,999
I am gonna be
waiting in that spot.

10
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,460
And that's all that I want...

11
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:29,180
In this whole world, is for my two
girls to be waiting there for me.

12
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:41,258
3 dots, 3 letters.

13
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,244
Question is "where"?

14
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,942
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

15
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:53,883
I think I owe you an apology.
Because I lied to you.

16
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,540
About Oscar Shales.

17
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:01,771
Right there.
That's where I put the bullet in him.

18
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,890
What are you doing, man?

19
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:08,732
You've been hired to do a job.
The reasoning...

20
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:10,562
does not concern you.

21
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:12,163
You don't ask any
questions about us,

22
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:15,080
maybe we'll continue to make sure no
one asks any questions about you.

23
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,040
Are we clear?

24
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,582
They all die.

25
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,161
Hey.

26
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:56,113
Hey.

27
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:57,652
Are you new?

28
00:01:58,525 --> 00:01:59,650
Yeah.

29
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,502
No one told me we were
getting a new volunteer.

30
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,701
I've been working, uh,

31
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,813
night shifts, cleanup and...

32
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:10,050
Jimmy said I could
change my shift, so...

33
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,160
You know what you're doin'?

34
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:14,082
Yeah.

35
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:17,122
- I'll see you around.
- Right.

36
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:19,261
- This might be Scofield.
- Copy that.

37
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,192
You take that side.

38
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,491
- Freeze!
- Take it easy, man.

39
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,060
- Stay on the ground.
- What's the deal?

40
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:36,353
He's gone.

41
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,983
How you feelin'?

42
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:46,782
Okay, I guess. Tired.

43
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:51,072
I'm a target, kid.

44
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:53,411
As long as you're with me,
so are you.

45
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:57,413
Things could get a lot worse before
they get better. You understand?

46
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,103
But after we meet up with
Uncle Mike and get to Panama...

47
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:02,731
Panama ain't a sure thing,
your uncle's plan is dangerous.

48
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:06,511
I mean really
dangerous. Listen...

49
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,001
all the charges against
you have been dropped;

50
00:05:10,147 --> 00:05:13,671
you're free and clear to
start a new life. A good life.

51
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:16,171
Not be constantly running,
looking over your shoulder...

52
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:19,262
You want me to leave?

53
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:21,363
No.

54
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,432
No.

55
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:29,002
Good, 'cause I'm not.

56
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,242
Here you go.

57
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,502
Turn the sound up
on the tube, Jenny.

58
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,320
Beth Wilson, Chicago Gazette.

59
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:47,430
Do you have any thoughts on
the death of David Apolskis?

60
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,342
It was unfortunate.

61
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,482
Oh, David.

62
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,812
Was there any opportunity
to subdue him...

63
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:55,791
Let me remind you
that despite his age,

64
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:59,353
David "Tweener" Apolskis was a fugitive
who made a move for my weapon.

65
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,721
I did not want to
have to kill him,

66
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,833
but sometimes things happen that
are just out of your control.

67
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:08,733
That good ole boy's huntin'
'em all down, ain't he?

68
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:11,423
Mr. Mahone, sources claim that you've
recovered Scofield's hard drive

69
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:13,342
and have obtained
substantial data from it.

70
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,123
What sources?

71
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,243
Allegedly you've retrieved
information detailing

72
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:18,760
not only how Scofield broke out,
but how he plans to stay out.

73
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:19,942
- Care to comment?
- No.

74
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,273
The event at Blanding Botanical
Gardens earlier today,

75
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,982
that was a result of
hard-drive data you collected.

76
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,570
No comment.

77
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:30,500
You found other locations where
Scofield might be headed? True?

78
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,333
I believe I said no comment.

79
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,750
There's something
about this guy,

80
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:36,473
it's like he knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

81
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:39,470
What role will the hard
drive play in your search?

82
00:06:43,597 --> 00:06:46,271
Heard it came back from the lab,
any findings?

83
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, 3,200
nitroglycerine ampules.

84
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:52,952
Scofield knew these needed to be
stored in a cool, moist area.

85
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:56,162
Best place for that in the Utah
desert is the Botanical Gardens.

86
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,120
- It's stable?
- All medical grade,

87
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:01,830
safely used by heart patients all
the time. But in the aggregate...

88
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,942
It could take out an entire building.
That box right there.

89
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,850
This is why we can't have...

90
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,352
leaks...

91
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:13,162
coming from this office.

92
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:18,802
God help the agent who goes behind
my back and talks to the press.

93
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:30,790
Can you elaborate on any of
your tactics in this manhunt?

94
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,013
Sun Tzu said,
that if you know your enemy,

95
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,702
you need not fear a hundred battles.
I know these men--

96
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,631
who they are, where they came from,
where they want to go.

97
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:47,592
These convicts are in
a constant battle.

98
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,232
Not only with me,

99
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,710
but with themselves.

100
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,332
Second guessing every
decision they make.

101
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,692
Do I turn left?

102
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,450
Do I turn right?

103
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:08,131
Stay or go?

104
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:14,212
My job is to know how they'll
answer these questions.

105
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,913
The only way to win a war is to
try to know your prey completely

106
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:21,310
and then you get to go after your
enemy with everything you've got.

107
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,373
Our half-priced
stuff is in the back.

108
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,490
I'm looking for
something very specific.

109
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:04,373
Okay.

110
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,542
This is it.

111
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:14,713
- This is exactly what I need.
- Great.

112
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:21,022
We were just inches
away today, inches.

113
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:24,280
I want these blown up, huge.
Put them in my office on the walls.

114
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,062
- What are these?
- Somewhere in there is

115
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,071
information regarding a
rendezvous that Scofield set up,

116
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,863
and we're going to crack
that code today. Lang!

117
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,811
Today's the day
Franklin told his wife

118
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,752
he's going to meet her
at the Rainbow Room.

119
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:34,031
That's right.

120
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:36,993
Wrong. Today's the day Franklin's
going down. Are you ready?

121
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,120
Everything's arranged.

122
00:09:58,026 --> 00:09:59,752
- It's all here?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:08,771
Hey, yo, D. Wassup, baby?

124
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:12,701
- I know that ain't you.
- Ain't a ghost, man.

125
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:14,853
You holding up all right?

126
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:18,212
Yeah. Just catching a whole bunch of
buses just to get here to Chi-town, man.

127
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,220
How you think I'm
supposed to feel?

128
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:25,100
Chris. Jay. Wassup, Flam?
You look like you lost a few, bro.

129
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,502
- Slim-Fast, baby.
- Is that what it is, huh?

130
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,951
The Feds been in your old
lady's business, no joke.

131
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:32,580
Up in your crib,
and following her around sometimes.

132
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:34,113
Yeah, I know, man. I know.

133
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:35,752
Yo, I know you love Kacee,

134
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,202
but I don't know if it's a good idea
for you to be coming around here.

135
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,591
You're a wanted man.

136
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,752
I'm wanted because I
kept my mouth shut,

137
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:43,491
and I kept you
out of Fox River.

138
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,720
See, man, we feel that,
and we owe you one.

139
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:49,113
Good, 'cause I'm
collecting right now.

140
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,173
My wife is waiting
for me today,

141
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,562
and I am not leaving Chi-town
without my family. You understand?

142
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:57,383
Now, y'all going to help me.
Let's roll out.

143
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:12,700
Where you going?

144
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,220
Take my kid to school.

145
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,658
I know about the Rainbow Room.

146
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:21,214
I don't know what
you're talking about.

147
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:22,413
Phone lines are tapped.

148
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:25,333
We heard your entire telephone
conversation with your husband.

149
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,921
And, since you and Dede aren't
booked on any flights to New York,

150
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,910
don't tell me the Rainbow Room
is a restaurant in Manhattan.

151
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:33,312
Now, you can tell me where
you're meeting your husband,

152
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:36,802
or I can arrest you right
in front of your daughter.

153
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,180
You go to hell.

154
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:41,050
I haven't done anything wrong.

155
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:46,150
You spoke with an escaped
felon about meeting him today.

156
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:49,120
You've already done enough to be
charged with attempt to aid and abet.

157
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:51,450
Please, okay? Listen to me.

158
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:54,043
One phone call and
Child Welfare is here,

159
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,680
and you're going to County and
Dede will be in foster care.

160
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:57,881
- No.
- Don't worry.

161
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,273
I hear the families in the
foster system are top-notch.

162
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:10,863
You are asking me to choose
between my daughter and my husband.

163
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,770
Exactly.

164
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:15,350
Anything?

165
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:18,382
I'm on the phone with Fox River.
Checking Bagwell's file.

166
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,740
Hey, what you got for me?

167
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:23,382
Really?

168
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:25,561
52 times?

169
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:27,932
Where?

170
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:32,393
I owe you, Patterson.

171
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,100
We got a lot of road to cover.

172
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,383
We're good?

173
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:07,371
No more stops until
we get to New Mexico.

174
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:12,181
- You forgot your change.
- Yeah, thanks.

175
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,862
- You were in such a rush.
- Thanks.

176
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,461
Keep walking.

177
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:21,231
Keep walking.

178
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,432
Come on, keep walking.

179
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,350
Damn it.

180
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:40,761
You don't have to ditch the car.
We can keep driving.

181
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:44,111
Can't. The waitress made me and the car.
It's useless.

182
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:48,043
Sorry, you know.
Maybe we can find another car.

183
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,703
Cars ain't exactly
growing on trees out here.

184
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,161
We've got 400 miles to go
and no way of getting there.

185
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:56,272
We don't get to Michael in time,
he's going to leave without us.

186
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:57,851
Uncle Mike wouldn't do that.

187
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,821
He doesn't have a choice.
It's a one-shot deal out of the country.

188
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,643
I said I was sorry.

189
00:14:03,655 --> 00:14:05,870
There was a sign back
there for a train station.

190
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,420
- It ain't that easy.
- We'll follow the road...

191
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,451
- It ain't that easy.
- We won't be seen.

192
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,020
Hey, I'm not an idiot.

193
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,361
I was on the run,
too, you know.

194
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,752
Yeah, you were on the
run and you got caught.

195
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,890
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I'm not a
pro at being a con like you, Dad.

196
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:27,541
Maybe I should have just left
when you gave me the out, huh?

197
00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:30,292
- It's not like you care.
- Whoa, whoa.

198
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:31,513
Take it easy.

199
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,473
I'm sorry, all right?

200
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,440
Sorry, I'm just...

201
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,141
Let's get out of here.

202
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,890
Mrs., uh, Mrs. Pamela Mahone?

203
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,421
- Yes?
- I'm Agent Wayne Merrick, FBI.

204
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,221
I'd like to talk to
you about your husband.

205
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm surprised...

206
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:19,730
that you're coming to me for
a background check on Alex.

207
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:20,980
It's standard procedure.

208
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:24,242
We run these kind of checks when an
agent is about to be promoted to a,

209
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,822
to a higher security clearance.

210
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:28,652
No, I know that. I did this dance
the last time he was promoted.

211
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,880
I just figured that
since we were divorced--

212
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:34,380
I mean, I rarely speak to him and I
certainly don't follow his career.

213
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:37,211
I really need to get this done tod,
so, uh,

214
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:39,642
I promise I won't take
up much of your time.

215
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:44,253
I' given enough time to my ex-husband,
Mr. Merrick.

216
00:15:44,356 --> 00:15:46,930
I see. The, uh...

217
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:50,693
The Bureau can take its
toll on your family.

218
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:53,933
I understand that.
My ex-wife is a...

219
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,551
an agent and, um...

220
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:59,643
let's just say I
know how you feel.

221
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:06,051
Promise me that he
won't find out we spoke?

222
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:09,052
Oh, it's totally confidential.

223
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:10,880
Do you mind if I ask why?

224
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:14,123
To be perfectly honest,
he scares me.

225
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,041
Information.

226
00:16:50,186 --> 00:16:52,631
Hi, I need the number for
a Sundown Hotel please.

227
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:54,562
- What state?
- Uh, all of them, please.

228
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,653
- Got one in Pierre, South Dakota.
- Okay.

229
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,722
Another in Sutton,
West Virginia

230
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,160
and one more in Gila,
New Mexico.

231
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:40,321
- What can I do you for?
- A batch of them sunflowers, please.

232
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,862
You don't mind me saying, you do
not sound like you hail from Kansas.

233
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:45,532
You've got a sharp ear.

234
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:49,953
I hail from what we call the,
uh, Yellowhammer State.

235
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,160
What brings you to Tribune?

236
00:17:58,497 --> 00:17:59,291
Sir?

237
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,541
Romance.

238
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,241
Thank you so much.

239
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,451
Somebody's going to get hurt.

240
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:18,002
Feds going to be swinging
bigger bats than these.

241
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:19,150
We gotta have ours.

242
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:22,442
Look, man, that's all we need
is your car, your truck,

243
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:25,310
and some guts, man.
We don't need all of this.

244
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:27,990
- Maybe we should think about it.
- I said no!

245
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,302
What's going to happen, man,
when the bullets start flying, huh?

246
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:34,880
Can you guarantee me that my
family ain't going to get hurt?

247
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:37,970
Johnny Law is going to be strapped up.
I'm going in hot.

248
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,771
I don't think you heard me,
little man.

249
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,410
No, I don't think
you heard me, bro.

250
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,803
I'm not going in naked.

251
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:45,242
I know we said we'd
ride with you on this,

252
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:48,650
but I'm not going in there
without some of these.

253
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,891
You want to punk out, man?
Then punk out,

254
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,222
'cause I can do this myself.

255
00:19:04,678 --> 00:19:08,251
Ain't nobody punking out.
And no guns.

256
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,200
But you'd better be right about this
'cause if bullets do start flying,

257
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:20,242
the only blood being
spilled is going to be ours.

258
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:21,451
Feel me?

259
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,473
I feel you.

260
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:28,882
Agent Kellerman.

261
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:30,901
- Agent Kellerman!
- Yes.

262
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:33,623
That name you wanted me to track,
Kelli Foster.

263
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,853
She booked a flight to New Mexico,
just landed.

264
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:38,251
You got someone on it?

265
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,933
No, but we got an ID
on her rental car.

266
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:44,421
- Should I update Mr. Kim?
- No, I'll take care of this myself.

267
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:50,281
Got a tip from a waitress
who thinks she saw Burrows

268
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,260
and his son outside St.
David, Arizona.

269
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:54,233
Get a road team out
there to confirm.

270
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,711
Once they got a bead on Burrows,
notify me immediately.

271
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:58,433
Everybody out!
Let's go, come on!

272
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:04,803
Yeah?

273
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:08,041
Sara Tancredi just booked a
one-way ticket across the country.

274
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:11,790
- To where?
- New Mexico.

275
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:15,081
Of course.

276
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,930
Any luck breaking that code?

277
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,703
- Uh... this helps.
- Good.

278
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:30,272
Wheeler!

279
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:31,521
Sir.

280
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,962
Every combination
that has NM in it.

281
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,551
I want you to check it to see

282
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,153
if it contains the name of
a location in New Mexico.

283
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,631
And I want it done now.
Yeah, right now.

284
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,873
So, how well do you know Alex?

285
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:47,392
He knows me better
than I know him.

286
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:51,433
He's a closed book, all right.
But he wasn't always like that.

287
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:59,021
In the first few years of our marriage,
he was actually...romantic.

288
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:00,080
Hmm.

289
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:05,810
And then, one day,
out of nowhere...

290
00:21:07,116 --> 00:21:09,502
Out of nowhere what?

291
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:15,982
Everything changed.
He became obsessed with getting out.

292
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,671
Out of the marriage?

293
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,313
Getting out of the marriage,

294
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,992
getting me out of the house,
out of his life.

295
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,720
He left me.

296
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:27,043
He left the both of us.

297
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:32,570
You said you were scared of him.
Why is that?

298
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:34,692
He started acting strange.

299
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:38,401
Started spending all of his
time in the backyard gardening,

300
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,980
of all things.
I mean, the man was a neat freak.

301
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:43,871
He'd throw away a pair of
shoes if they even got scuffed.

302
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,713
But he'd be out there
all covered in dirt

303
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:50,761
and surrounded by these huge
bags of fertilizer and lye.

304
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,901
We'd just put this new sod in

305
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:57,331
and he just tore it all up
and planted a flower bed.

306
00:21:57,426 --> 00:22:02,421
And I went out back once to talk
to him and he screamed at me

307
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:06,880
and said not to come
near the garden.

308
00:22:06,986 --> 00:22:09,002
Said that it was his.

309
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:15,093
I'm sorry. If you, uh...

310
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,681
if you want to take a break...

311
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,980
All I wanted was an explanation

312
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,193
why things ended so suddenly.

313
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:24,171
And all Alex could say was

314
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:30,463
"Sometimes things happen that
are just out of your control."

315
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:33,792
Excuse me.

316
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,530
So the picture in your
daughter's bedroom--

317
00:22:57,636 --> 00:23:01,452
the exact location where it was
taken was a merry-go-round, right?

318
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:02,752
Yeah.

319
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:05,990
So, all you have to do is
wait by the merry-go-round.

320
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:08,432
Right where Benjamin's
expecting you.

321
00:23:10,695 --> 00:23:12,573
Is that necessary?

322
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:15,341
- I mean, Benjamin is not...
- It's precautionary.

323
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:24,471
Look, I do this,
you leave me and my child alone.

324
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:26,581
You have my word.

325
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:52,341
- Is my wife there?
- Yeah, she's here.

326
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:53,860
Well, let's go get her.

327
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,560
In 15 seconds,

328
00:24:22,706 --> 00:24:26,522
a black Jeep is going to pull up
by the parking lot's entrance.

329
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,921
Run to it.

330
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:30,462
Chris?

331
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,571
- Go.
- I can't.

332
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,902
- They're going to take Dede.
- Look, no, they won't.

333
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,390
Is that guy talking to her?
Get a read on him.

334
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:46,542
Look, it's taken care of. Go!

335
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:52,230
Go!

336
00:24:58,715 --> 00:24:59,601
She's running!

337
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:02,412
She's running!
Go, go, go, go, go, move, move!

338
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:12,322
Get in!

339
00:25:12,695 --> 00:25:13,862
Hold on!

340
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:28,962
It's a 2007 black Jeep.
License plates have been removed.

341
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:30,981
We're in pursuit headed... No!

342
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:42,653
Move the truck. Move the truck!

343
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:44,293
I said move it!

344
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:52,582
- Where is my child?
- Here.

345
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,550
- Dede?
- Hey, it's me, baby.

346
00:25:56,737 --> 00:26:00,931
Look, I just want to tell you that
everything is going to be okay.

347
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:03,672
We're going to be a family again.
I promise you that.

348
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:06,421
- Where is Dede?
- He said that you had her!

349
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,873
Whoa, whoa. Easy, baby. Easy.

350
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:11,352
Darius is picking her up
from school right now.

351
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:17,050
Dede Franklin, Dawson Elementary--
I want her pulled from school now!

352
00:26:17,928 --> 00:26:19,471
What the hell is going on, man?

353
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,402
They say she's
taking a test, man,

354
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:23,062
but I think they're stalling.

355
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:29,010
What about, um...

356
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:30,552
What about Oscar Shales?

357
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,252
Oscar Shales?
Why is he important?

358
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:39,212
Well, he's, uh...

359
00:26:39,357 --> 00:26:43,501
he's the only fugitive to ever
successfully elude your, uh...

360
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,092
your ex-husband.

361
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,191
Alex was consumed
with finding him.

362
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:51,841
After what Shales did to all of
his victims, who could blame him?

363
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:55,152
It was all he worked on,
all he did for a year.

364
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,350
But I don't think that it was
the stress of chasing Shales

365
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:00,842
that caused Alex to start
behaving erratically.

366
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:02,481
Why is that?

367
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:05,633
Because Alex changed
after the trail went cold.

368
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:08,202
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

369
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:10,591
He just walked into the kitchen

370
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:13,412
after 12 years of marriage

371
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:17,822
and says that he wanted me
out of the house immediately.

372
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:23,921
I'll never forget the date.
It was June 15.

373
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:27,353
I think I have
everything I need.

374
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:30,782
But you didn't even ask about
social history or education.

375
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:32,253
That's standard
in these checks.

376
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:35,280
That's been handled.
I have to get these reports filed with,

377
00:27:35,435 --> 00:27:37,491
uh, Strategic Operations ASAP.

378
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:39,283
You're with
Strategic Operations?

379
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,293
They handle these checks.

380
00:27:41,488 --> 00:27:44,681
Not since the 9/11 realignment,
Mr. Merrick.

381
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,732
The Chief Information
Officer does them now.

382
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:50,180
They handled Alex's last check.

383
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:55,233
When an agent reaches a level
as high as your ex-husband's,

384
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:58,243
S.O. takes over. Again.

385
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:02,821
Bureaucracies. Thank
you for the coffee.

386
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:12,322
Look, just get
her out of there.

387
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,670
They're here.

388
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:25,381
- No! See, we got to go!
- No, don't worry about it.

389
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,102
Just get the car started,
all right? Go!

390
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:41,931
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby! You ready to go?

391
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:44,470
- Where are we going?
- Disneyland.

392
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,520
You can't take her.
Mr. Franklin, please.

393
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:56,120
Come on, let's go!

394
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,221
Go, baby. Go, baby.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

395
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:04,732
Franklin has the child!
Repeat, Franklin has the child!

396
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:16,431
Evening, Mrs. Hollander.
Don't you look lovely this evening.

397
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,490
You should have told
me what you were!

398
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,653
My God,
I let you near my children!

399
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:24,790
Don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

400
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:25,333
Come on, get away from the road.
You want to get caught?

401
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:28,583
I, uh...

402
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:32,983
I saw you checking out those
girls back at the diner.

403
00:30:33,528 --> 00:30:36,472
- What?
- Come on. Fess up.

404
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,512
No. I was just making sure that
they weren't staring at us.

405
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,701
With what? Their asses?

406
00:30:42,077 --> 00:30:45,741
Beautiful girls in Panama.
They love Americans.

407
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:46,441
Cool.

408
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,423
So, uh,
how long have you known about girls?

409
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,430
Long enough.

410
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:56,720
Since when?

411
00:30:58,116 --> 00:31:02,921
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen? With who?

412
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:05,812
Donna Anselmi.

413
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:08,250
She was the kid next door.
She was about...

414
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:10,032
She's four years older than me.

415
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,201
Your mom was paying
her for French lessons.

416
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:15,290
Well, she earned the money.

417
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:19,681
Come on. Away from the road.

418
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,891
You're still way too close.
Let's go.

419
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,523
You want to learn
some tricks, Gracey?

420
00:31:27,556 --> 00:31:29,191
- Like what?
- Yeah.

421
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:35,963
I let you into my life.

422
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:39,431
Twenty seven!

423
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,432
Evening, Mrs. Hollander.

424
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:25,790
How are you feeling,
little Teddy?

425
00:32:29,778 --> 00:32:30,893
Six.

426
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:12,040
Tomorrow.

427
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:25,910
Pam, I really can't
talk right now.

428
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,380
Maybe I should call back.

429
00:33:31,016 --> 00:33:32,752
Who is this?

430
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:35,000
I think you already know.

431
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:47,130
If you've done
anything to Pam...

432
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,492
or my boy...

433
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:50,600
We both know your
family's fine.

434
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:53,740
Although, Pam did seem a little
upset about you leaving.

435
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:56,880
But then you had to,
didn't you?

436
00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:01,181
'Cause you couldn't
let her find out.

437
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:04,313
- Find out about what?
- Oscar Shales.

438
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:08,671
You remember?
The one that got away.

439
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,321
Except he didn't get too far.
Did he?

440
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:15,903
Uh... you're
slipping, Scofield.

441
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:19,240
Maybe. Let's hypothesize
for a moment.

442
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:22,200
Let's pretend I was the
one who caught Shales.

443
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:27,771
I don't think I could of just handed
that psychopath over to the courts,

444
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:30,503
not after he'd eluded
me for so long.

445
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:32,330
Made me look bad.

446
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:35,603
You've been out in the
sun way too long, boy.

447
00:34:35,787 --> 00:34:37,520
You feds make a nice living,

448
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:40,620
but not so nice you go around
tearing up expensive sod.

449
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:42,750
Not unless you had to
do a little digging,

450
00:34:42,786 --> 00:34:47,543
not unless you wanted to hide
something... or someone.

451
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:52,060
That's what all the lye was for.
Wasn't it?

452
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:56,280
See, because there
are two kinds of lye.

453
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,710
Small amounts, the first kind
can be a garderner's best friend.

454
00:34:59,945 --> 00:35:02,762
And large bags,
the other kind decomposes bodies.

455
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:04,750
Ah, you should write
mystery novels.

456
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:06,642
Now, I don't know about you,

457
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:10,111
but if I buried someone
in my own backyard,

458
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:14,653
I'd think about
it all the time.

459
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:20,472
I'd think...
I'd think maybe I should move that body.

460
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:26,843
But then I remember,
DNA leeches into soil.

461
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,611
So even when the body was gone,

462
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:31,900
the proof of what I'd done
would still be there.

463
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:34,942
I can imagine how it feels.

464
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,873
The pressure...

465
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:42,043
the constant fear.

466
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:46,711
It's more than a man can bear.

467
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:54,643
I'm going to give you a chance.
Back off.

468
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:57,602
Let me and my family disappear.

469
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:02,021
And in return,
I'll keep your little secret.

470
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:08,972
- How does that sound?
- Like a dead man talking.

471
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,900
I know it's not how you
wanted this to play out.

472
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:16,360
But sometimes things
happen that are just

473
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:20,391
out of your control.

474
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:24,090
This is one of those times.

475
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:30,942
- Take care of yourself.
- I'll see you soon, Michael.

476
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:35,981
Oh, and, Michael,

477
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:39,771
it just may be sooner
than you think.

478
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:59,782
Did you have a nice nap?

479
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,832
Visions of 12 year olds
dancing in your head?

480
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,592
You're trespassin'.

481
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:08,701
Nobody lives here
anymore, Goldilocks.

482
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:10,290
Seems the owner hit the bricks

483
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:13,960
as soon as she heard a certain
someone had reentered society.

484
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:16,923
Left in a hurry, too,
even left some stuff behind.

485
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:23,402
So this is where Theodore
practiced Pervert Knows Best.

486
00:37:25,836 --> 00:37:30,313
This... is where he
had his family supper.

487
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:33,291
And that I believe

488
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:37,340
is where you and Ms.
Hollander expressed your love.

489
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:41,090
Tell me, little Teddy,
did you make her wear Dr. Denton's

490
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:45,991
and hold a lunch box to
help you get all worked up?

491
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:49,000
Bradley, I couldn't
possibly expect a grown man

492
00:37:49,148 --> 00:37:51,200
who still lives with his momma

493
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,880
to understand the
machinations of love.

494
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:06,320
You want to know
how we found you?

495
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:10,781
52 mash notes, sent by you,
to this address.

496
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:16,572
All of them beggin' Ms. Hollander
to take your white-trash ass back.

497
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:19,050
And every one of them

498
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:24,050
boomeranged to Fox River
marked "return to sender."

499
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:27,583
Oh, the guards had a real laugh
readin' 'em, didn't we, Geary?

500
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:29,442
Oh, damn right we did.

501
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:34,953
That is one mangy lookin'
paw you got there, slick.

502
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:38,241
What happened,
a Boy Scout fought back? Geary.

503
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:41,912
Now you're going to tell me where
you stashed Westmoreland's money,

504
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:46,901
or I'm going to pluck you like
a chicken, stitch by stitch.

505
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:58,700
Fine, you want to know
where the money is?

506
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:02,511
I did spend a whole bunch of
it last night on your momma.

507
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:06,883
Wrong answer.

508
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:25,861
Come here, baby.

509
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,820
How are you?

510
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:31,511
- Hm? You good?
- Yeah.

511
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:32,542
She's okay.

512
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,560
- Baby.
- Yeah.

513
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:54,292
What do we do now?

514
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:30,042
What are we going to do?

515
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:33,751
Get a ticket on the train.
Come on.

516
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:37,311
Just wait here til
the train comes.

517
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:14,323
Two Caucasian males on foot,
fleeing the Willcox station.

518
00:42:31,706 --> 00:42:33,112
LJ!

519
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:34,843
Don't move.

520
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:38,580
Please. Please.
He's got nothing to do with this.

521
00:42:38,726 --> 00:42:40,413
Face down.
Both of you face down!

522
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:41,620
- Please.
-  Now!

523
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:44,783
Cuff 'em.

524
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:50,870
LJ, I'm sorry.

525
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:55,652
Suspect in custody.
Possible ID: Lincoln Burrows.

526
00:42:59,336 --> 00:43:04,233
I'm sorry. LJ, I'm sorry.

527
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:06,912
