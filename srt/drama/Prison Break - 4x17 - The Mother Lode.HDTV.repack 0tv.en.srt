1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,630
Your mother works for us.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,930
Your mother is alive.

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,000
You know, i'm thinking more and more that this

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,300
Is an inside job. why?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,760
The hardware he brought to the meet.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,460
He could read scylla right on the spot.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,400
Hands on your head.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,100
We've got to get out of here!

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
Michael. Get in!

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,700
Sorry, but right now i want my life back

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
More than i want your money.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,800
Where's scylla?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,460
Let's talk about that, okay?

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,530
Where is it?

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,460
I can get it.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,360
No, he can't.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,500
He's stalling, linc.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,600
it's gone. you're right.

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,730
You have no idea who this guy's working for?

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,730
No, no clue.

21
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,200
Your boy's dead.

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,230
And now

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,600
I'm coming after you.

24
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,360
Who was that?

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,200
It was my son.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,860
Lincoln.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,860
What is this?

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,260
I don't know...

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,700
Just found them on the doorstep.

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,700
Son of a...

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,430
They lay one hand on my mama, i swear on my life...

32
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,560
She's in a state home.

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,430
I thought we were working with these people.

34
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,700
So did i.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm gonna make a call.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,260
Find out what's going on.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,900
Mr. burrows.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,230
We had a deal.

39
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,730
Our deal is contingent upon the retrieval of scylla.

40
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,260
Based on the mediocrity of your performance

41
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,830
On that front thus far,

42
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,730
I thought it best to make sure

43
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,630
you're all properly motivated

44
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,160
Just tell me how your team is progressing.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,630
I swear to god, man, when i,

46
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,930
When i get a hold of you...

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,030
If i were you,

48
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,630
I'd be doing everything in my power

49
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,930
To demonstrate my competence right now.

50
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,060
We killed the guy who came to miami.

51
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,260
We found some keys on him.

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,700
We're looking into them.

53
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,030
Are we done?

54
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,200
Not quite.

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,600
A new competitor

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,160
Has joined the search.

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,500
We're the ones getting scylla.

58
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,800
Well, that's good to hear,

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,060
Because the competing party, is your brother michael.

60
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,560
Michael's with you.

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,330
Michael's getting treatment. With you.

62
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,030
Apparently michael's a little more headstrong than either of us imagined.

63
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,360
But don't worry.

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,500
We have a lead on him somewhere in central arizona.

65
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,330
Mr. oren is waiting in his limousine.

66
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,530
If you speak to michael,

67
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,460
Tell him to find a very good hiding place.

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,700
Because if any of my men spot him,

69
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,930
They've been given a green light.

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,660
2,500 miles to go.

71
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,260
If we take turns sleeping

72
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,800
We can be there by tomorrow night.

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,860
Should we call lincoln? let him know we're coming?

74
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,200
Michael, he took the company's deal

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,830
To save your life.

76
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,100
And for what it's worth, i might've done the same thing.

77
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Then you'd be wrong, too.

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,500
You know, this promises to be a really, really long ride.

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,300
So, how about we just...

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,400
Call truce, all right?

81
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,330
Forgot napkins.

82
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,330
Get down.

83
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,160
Come on.

84
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,200
He comes anywhere near my kid...

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
You know, don,

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,700
You seem to be taking this whole thing pretty well.

87
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,400
Yeah, well, i'm a pretty calm guy.

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,630
All i'm saying is,

89
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,360
My mama, his son, his wife.

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,330
We don't even know who they got on you.

91
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,600
That's 'cause it's none of your business.

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,630
All right, all you need to worry about

93
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,830
Is that i'm here to do a job.

94
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,260
Hold-secure.

95
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,030
The company that manufactures the keys.

96
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,900
It's called hold-secure. listen to this.

97
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,100
Each key they produce is implanted with a computer chip.

98
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,500
That chip sends out a unique

99
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,060
Electronic signal that opens its lock.

100
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,600
Something that high-tech,

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,460
I'm telling you, i'm betting they got a database

102
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,000
That'll tell us exactly where each key's

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,860
Corresponding lock has been installed.

104
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,530
Look at that.

105
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,430
These keys run about 500 bucks each?!

106
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,260
You only spend that kind of money if you're

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,760
Protecting something of vital importance.

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,260
Like scylla.

109
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,460
Someone just tried to access

110
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,160
Carruth's account at hold-secure.

111
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,660
And what information was compromised?

112
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,000
We don't know yet.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,630
And who was trying to access it?

114
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,000
We don't know.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,660
Thank you for bringing that to my attention. good work.

116
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,960
Yes?

117
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,500
It's your son.

118
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,660
We already have safeguards in place to deal with lincoln.

119
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm talking about michael.

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,000
He's escaped company custody.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,630
He's coming to miami right now.

122
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,730
Christina?

123
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,330
If only they understood what it is i'm trying to do.

124
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,200
Thank you very much.

125
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,860
Thanks.

126
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
Okay, what now?

127
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,460
We'll think of something.

128
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,100
Michael, we can't afford to buy a car

129
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,630
And we can't fly.

130
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,830
It's time to call your brother.

131
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,660
Got it.

132
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,800
We've got the locations of those two locks.

133
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,030
One's in little havana.

134
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,500
The other one's down by the water.

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,260
Perfect. lincoln, why don't you and i...

136
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,660
You take self and go to little havana.

137
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,930
We're gonna head south.

138
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,200
Huh, that's a surprise.

139
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
We need suntan lotion.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,030
Be right there.

141
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,430
It's me.

142
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,700
What's your problem?

143
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,730
Look, i need you to hear me out on this, linc.

144
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,600
Everything was all set up and you blew it.

145
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,730
You couldn't just let me handle this, could you?

146
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,130
If by "handle," you mean give scylla back to the general,

147
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,900
Then no, i couldn't.

148
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,860
It's more complicated than that.

149
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,160
Actually, it's not.

150
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,230
Listen to me,

151
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,460
I want my life back

152
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,200
And this is the only way we can do that!

153
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,860
I don't believe that's true.

154
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,100
You know what, man?

155
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,360
You need to grow up.

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,130
Look, if that's how you really feel, linc,

157
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,600
I should warn you i'm going to do everything in my power

158
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,230
To stop you.

159
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,560
I had a deal with the general.

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,260
You blew it.

161
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,600
He finds you, he's gonna kill you.

162
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,460
Surprise, surprise.

163
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,630
I did this for us, michael.

164
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,160
You, me, sara,

165
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,630
Lj, so you could be with sara.

166
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,800
Two seconds, just think of your family.

167
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,100
Feels like family's the only thing

168
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
I can think about these days.

169
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,930
What does that mean?

170
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,160
Michael?

171
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,730
Linc, mom is alive.

172
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,900
What?

173
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,330
Guess i'll see you in miami.

174
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,400
We gotta get out of here.

175
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,300
Sir, you mind if i ask where you're going?

176
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,460
Dallas.

177
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,030
Mind if we hitch a ride?

178
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,500
I got 100 bucks; gas money.

179
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,800
Please?

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,230
Sir?

181
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,030
Cab's not big enough for the two of you.

182
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,160
If you want to ride together

183
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
You're going to have to ride back here.

184
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,800
Done.

185
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,660
Get comfortable.

186
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,330
Gonna be eight hours till we stop again.

187
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,860
Linc...

188
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,030
If scylla really is in there, there's gonna be security.

189
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,460
I need you focused.

190
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,200
Yeah.

191
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,260
All Clear upstairs.

192
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,160
You find something?

193
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,100
Picture of my mom.

194
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,860
Someone must have known i was coming.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,530
Someone who's connected enough to be working with carruth

196
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,930
And who knows you well enough

197
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,030
To get their hands on that picture.

198
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,000
There's only one person i can think of

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
That fits that description.

200
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,500
You're saying my mom's in miami?

201
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,900
If she was operating out of this house,

202
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,400
She certainly had access to money.

203
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
She's a company agent.

204
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
Gretchen said she thought

205
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,500
That this could be an inside job.

206
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,160
Linc...

207
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,760
Your mother could have scylla.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,060
She used to bake cookies when we'd come home

209
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,530
From school,

210
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,760
Play kickball with us in the backyard.

211
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,500
There's just no way that woman was a company agent.

212
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,130
You did read her file, didn't you?

213
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,300
I saw medical reports

214
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,930
That said she had the same diagnosis i did

215
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,060
And that company doctors operated

216
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,000
On her, too.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,560
Now i'm wondering if they took her off

218
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,400
To a log cabin in the woods after they were done,

219
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,900
Introduced her to a friendly shrink.

220
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,460
How else could someone just stand by and watch

221
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,430
Their own children were hunted down like dogs?

222
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,430
Maybe she didn't know.

223
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,600
She knew.

224
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,730
Maybe it was over her head.

225
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,000
Or maybe she didn't care.

226
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,530
Anyway, i'm just surprised

227
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,600
The general waited so long to drop this bomb on us.

228
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Actually, i think that part makes sense.

229
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,460
I mean, for whatever reason,

230
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,530
Your mother didn't want you to know she was alive

231
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,930
Or you would have known years ago.

232
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,960
The general was just keeping that secret, right?

233
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Keeping her happy, keeping her working.

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,860
But now the game has changed.

235
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,860
Yeah, now he thinks you might be useful.

236
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,060
Just like mom.

237
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,330
Beyond question, he possesses the most gifted mind

238
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,760
Of any man i've ever encountered.

239
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,660
Well, i'll try not to take that too personally.

240
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,800
He drilled into your office safe

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,660
And copied your card without you even noticing.

242
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,860
As I recall, you were sitting right next to me.

243
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,230
If we could have turned Michael Scofield,

244
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,830
It would have been like having 30 more years of Christina.

245
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,000
Pull over.

246
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,100
That's my ride.

247
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,700
What's going on?

248
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,500
Good-bye, Jonathan.

249
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,830
This isn't the place.

250
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,030
I could pick that lock with my stump.

251
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,230
No, n-no, n-no.

252
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,630
Remember what they say about books and their covers.

253
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,430
When Harry Winston donated the hope diamond

254
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,800
To the smithsonian, you know how he got it from new york

255
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,730
To dc?

256
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,560
Registered mail.

257
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,260
It's the safest way to go.

258
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,060
After all, who is going to be looking

259
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,260
For the hope diamond at the post office, right?

260
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,630
And who would be looking for scylla

261
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,230
At some run-down storefront church

262
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,360
In little havana?

263
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,460
They got scylla back there somewhere.

264
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,060
You walk in there, reeking that cop stink,

265
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,360
You won't last a second.

266
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,230
That's a good point.

267
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,600
That's why you're going in.

268
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,560
May i help you?

269
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,330
Yes, as a matter of fact.

270
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm Charles Patoshik.

271
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm a professor of anthropology

272
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,430
At southern florida university.

273
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,200
I'm doing some various research on various different kinds

274
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
Of, uh, uh, uh, caribbean religions, and, uh...

275
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,560
Perhaps you could start

276
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,130
Back there where you, you do your, uh, services.

277
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,430
That is our sanctuary.

278
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,160
Only the pure of soul

279
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,900
May venture inside.

280
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
I know.

281
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,330
I-i have been in many such rooms.

282
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,530
Let me see your hand.

283
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,660
Your soul is black,

284
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,260
Stained with the blood of the innocent.

285
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,100
I cannot let you pass.

286
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,630
I have never been so offended in my life.

287
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,730
I suggest that you continue your research

288
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,630
Elsewhere.

289
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,300
If you drop something

290
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,030
By accident,

291
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,000
You leave a fingerprint on it.

292
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,130
She wanted you to find this.

293
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,030
Why? you ever seen it before?

294
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,860
No.

295
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Do you remember

296
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,060
Anything about that day?

297
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,130
I was four years old.

298
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Any idea where it was taken?

299
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,100
No.

300
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,500
You okay?

301
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,600
I mean, if i found out my mom was... listen,

302
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,330
As far as i'm concerned, she's not my mom.

303
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,700
She's just someone in the way of my freedom.

304
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,660
All right?

305
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,760
So, on my sixth birthday,

306
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,800
Um, my father was long gone by then,

307
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,100
So it was just me, mom, and linc, and...

308
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,760
Mom hands me my present--

309
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,800
My, uh, my only present-- and i just know...

310
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,430
I just know it's the millennium falcon.

311
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,100
With the battle alert sound?

312
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,200
Exactly.

313
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
-I totally owned that. -of course you did.

314
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
Anyway, i had been asking for this thing for weeks,

315
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
And the package is just the right size, and...

316
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,200
I rip open the wrapping paper

317
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,960
And... it's a birdhouse.

318
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,230
Oh, no.

319
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,900
Oh, yeah, except it's not even a birdhouse.

320
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,760
It's actually a birdhouse kit.

321
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm so sorry.

322
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,660
I didn't talk to her for two days after that,

323
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,830
But when she finally got me to open the thing,

324
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,260
We sat there together,

325
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,200
Put it together piece by piece,

326
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,060
And it was the first thing i ever built.

327
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,460
And i loved it...

328
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,800
And she knew i would.

329
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,160
She knew me better than i knew myself.

330
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,100
That's what moms do.

331
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah, but the strange thing is...

332
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,660
Even though i haven't seen her for 23 years,

333
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,730
There's this part of me

334
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,160
That feels like maybe she still does.

335
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,730
Your truck looks a little low to the ground.

336
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,730
You mind stepping outside?

337
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,830
I just got weighed 20 miles back.

338
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,260
You highway patrol?

339
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Where are you going?

340
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,860
You've got no business in there.

341
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,000
Unless you show me a warrant,

342
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You get the hell out of there right now.

343
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,260
Thank you.

344
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,900
Goodness.

345
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,930
I got my weigh station ticket

346
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,600
Right here on the dash.

347
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,260
As soon as you see that...

348
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,260
You'll see i got it right here.

349
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,160
Here you go.

350
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,600
I need you to follow me back to phoenix.

351
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,160
Are you crazy?

352
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,800
I got to get this load to dallas.

353
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,930
Well, that's your choice.

354
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,460
I got 'em.

355
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,460
I think we need to call your brother.

356
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,230
No signal.

357
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,860
We must be in the middle of nowhere.

358
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,620
Lincoln said that if the company caught you...

359
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,500
I think i saw a side door back here.

360
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
What about the main door?

361
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,760
You'll never get that open.

362
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,660
I'm sure it's latched from the outside.

363
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,190
Can you open the side door?

364
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,700
Maybe.

365
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,900
Sara.

366
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Help me out.

367
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't think we're going to be able to move this.

368
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,090
Maybe we won't have to.

369
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,030
I have troubling news about general krantz.

370
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,430
He's alive.

371
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,330
I don't see how that's possible.

372
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,930
Yes, well, what i'm hearing is a

373
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,530
helicopter with

374
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,330
From company headquarters in los angeles one hour ago.

375
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,530
It landed for two minutes in canyon country

376
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,800
And now it's back in los angeles.

377
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,130
So you got the corpse?

378
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,160
The helicopter landed back at company headquarters.

379
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,400
You know how important getting rid of him is

380
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,260
To what we're trying to accomplish.

381
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,560
All right, I can still get this done.

382
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,860
Not in our time frame.

383
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,000
All right, I'm pulling the plug.

384
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,360
We need to start dealing with the consequences.

385
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,100
Wait, wait, wait. first things first.

386
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,500
He knows that i've betrayed him.

387
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,600
I need to disappear.

388
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,800
I think that's a good instinct.

389
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,860
I have a house in Sun Valley.

390
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,260
I have another idea.

391
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,600
Do you mind putting me on speaker?

392
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,900
You know, Griff, you're a brave man.

393
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,700
And I thank you for everything you've done.

394
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,660
It's been an honor.

395
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,230
Now.

396
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,330
"Now" what?

397
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,060
The car in this picture has Florida plates.

398
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,460
Did you ever vacation there?

399
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,160
- No.  - Do you know anyone

400
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,430
- From Forida who came up to visit?  - No.

401
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,530
Why did they take this picture in front of that car?

402
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,900
We didn't.

403
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
It's been doctored.

404
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,500
I'm not sure about that.

405
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,630
I mean, the lighting, the shadows,

406
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,960
All sync up perfectly.

407
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,500
This is a '78 zephyr.

408
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,860
Michael was born in '76.

409
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,600
You're the only one who could've picked up on that.

410
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,500
She doctored that for you.

411
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,300
Let's see what else she might've changed.

412
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,260
What's the license plate on that zephyr?

413
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,100
M-I-K 4-4-1.

414
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,760
Martin Luther King boulevard intersects with route 441

415
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,260
About five miles north of here.

416
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,600
Good.

417
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
You guys are here. listen, we're a little outmanned

418
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,460
Down in Little Havana. we could use some backup.

419
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,400
We got a lead on the buyer.

420
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,130
Great, what are we waiting for?

421
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,950
I think I gonna do it myself.

422
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,300
Come on, let's stay together. we're a team, right?

423
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,330
- I said i got it.  - After our little

424
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,860
Special deliveries this morning,

425
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,360
Each one of us has an equal stake.

426
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,900
Whoever started this, we're all going to take them out.

427
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,230
The buyer, we think it's Lincoln's mother.

428
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,660
What?

429
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,400
Like i said, i'm doing this myself.

430
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,660
Linc!

431
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,530
If she has scylla,

432
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,160
She's not just going to hand it over

433
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,000
Any more than the general would have.

434
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,200
You don't know that.

435
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,900
We always thought whoever had scylla

436
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,260
Would do what the general did.

437
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,660
Maybe she won't.

438
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,760
Are you serious?

439
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,600
Your mother is a company agent?

440
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,030
She was.

441
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,400
She might be one of the good guys now.

442
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,760
With all due respect,

443
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,400
I don't think you're in a place where you can make

444
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,030
A clear determination about that.

445
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,160
Listen, this MLK 441 could be nothing.

446
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,230
But at the church,

447
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,330
There could be scylla.

448
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,460
If i need you, i'll call.

449
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,500
This should work.

450
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Christina?

451
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,190
You need to acknowledge that our chance

452
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,860
Of success has substantially declined in the last 24 hours.

453
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,560
There are people out looking for us.

454
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,760
We need to start thinking in terms of contingencies.

455
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,560
Just a little while longer, only a few more days.

456
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,430
General Krantz refused to adjust

457
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,090
When there were credible threats against him.

458
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,090
That's the reason we have scylla now.

459
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,060
Are you honestly comparing me to him?

460
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,060
I understand what you think your role is in all of this,

461
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,700
And I appreciate your efforts.

462
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,160
But if you can't tell the difference

463
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Between he and I, perhaps you need to ask

464
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,530
The general for your old job back.

465
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,560
Oh, look.

466
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,930
Here he is. would you like to take the call?

467
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,060
Jonathan.

468
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,660
Good afternoon, Christina.

469
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,030
It's good to hear your voice.

470
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,460
I assume this means you've retrieved scylla.

471
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,630
Not yet.

472
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,560
Oh, troubling news.

473
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,400
Have any idea where it is?

474
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,030
Where are you, Christina?

475
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,930
Johannesburg. where else would I be?

476
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,530
I've had some of my contacts

477
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,300
In your area check on your house.

478
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,760
There's no one home.

479
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,960
Well, of course not. as long as scylla's in play,

480
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,030
That address is blown.

481
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,500
Where are you, Christina?

482
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,700
I don't like your tone, jonathan.

483
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,900
Excuse me

484
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,430
If I sound a bit abrasive.

485
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,600
But it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me.

486
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,460
Oh, my god.

487
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,190
Are you all right? what happened?

488
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,190
Oren.

489
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,760
"Oren"?

490
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,760
We found his body... executed.

491
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,830
I can only assume that he's working with someone.

492
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,730
Someone who doesn't tolerate failure.

493
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,000
Now, where are you, Christina?

494
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,930
You listen to me.

495
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,830
If you're implying that I had anything to do with this...

496
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,030
Where are you?

497
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,030
After everything i've given to the compeny. My husband, my children...

498
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,690
I think it's time that we had a sit-down.

499
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,900
- And talk.  - Tell you what.

500
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,460
Why don't you gether up the brain trust,

501
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,130
That half-witted daughter and your psychotic mistress?

502
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,000
Why don't you get together and figure out where scylla is?

503
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,230
Then call me.

504
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,430
Mr. Burrows.

505
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,160
May I escort you to your table?

506
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,900
You haven't changed a bit.

507
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,830
I'm glad you got my message.

508
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,860
I know it wasn't the most straightforward

509
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,330
Mode of communication, but I had to be sure it was you.

510
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,300
At least now I know where Michael gets it from.

511
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,060
I'm sure you have many questions.

512
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,000
Where's scylla?

513
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,930
It's safe.

514
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,830
That's all I can tell you for right now.

515
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,630
Then we've got nothing to talk about.

516
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,400
Really?

517
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,200
That's the only reason you came here?

518
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,830
Yeah.

519
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,660
I really would've thought you wanted to know the truth.

520
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,400
I know the truth.

521
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,830
You work for the company.

522
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,100
The same people that set me up for murder.

523
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,360
- Lincoln...  - The same people

524
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,400
That have been trying to kill me and Michael

525
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,730
Ever since we escaped Fox River.

526
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,200
You can think it as much as you want, I'm not a monster.

527
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,230
23 years and not even an apology?

528
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,400
If I thought an apology would do any good,

529
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,830
I would offer it.

530
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,930
Please.

531
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,900
Please sit down.

532
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,060
Leaving you two boys...

533
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,630
Was the hardest thing I ever did.

534
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,660
But you did.

535
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,730
And then you went off and worked for the company.

536
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,830
You know, you think you know what the company is,

537
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,900
But you don't.

538
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,160
It is a body that bends to the will of its head.

539
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,960
And right now, it is bloodthirsty and war-hungry,

540
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,600
Because that's who General Krantz is.

541
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,630
But what if a woman,

542
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,360
A mother, ran it?

543
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,830
Can you imagine the different that would make?

544
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,260
You think you're a mother?

545
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,160
A mother's priority

546
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,200
Is her family.

547
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,530
If I give scylla back to the general, he leaves me

548
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,400
And Michael alone, and I get to spend time

549
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,860
With my son in peace.

550
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,130
Look, I could sit here for days and try to explain to you

551
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,260
Why I did what I did.

552
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,460
Suffice it to say, I couldn't protect you then,

553
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,400
But let me protect you now.

554
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,330
What if general Krantz were no longer in the picture?

555
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,730
Once he is dealt with,

556
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,160
No one would come after you.

557
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,030
But I need time, Lincoln.

558
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,400
I need two days

559
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
To put everything into place.

560
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,760
If you give me two days...

561
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,660
...then I can give you and Michael

562
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,500
Your complete and utter freedom.

563
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,530
All right.

564
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,260
All right.

565
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,760
I'm going to get started right away.

566
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,830
But if Krantz suspects any of this,

567
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,930
He's going to hunt us both down.

568
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,830
And for that reason,

569
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,360
I can't risk being seen with you

570
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,130
Until all of this is over.

571
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,230
How will I get in touch with you?

572
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,000
You can't.

573
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm sorry.

574
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,160
Once we pull this box down,

575
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
It'll push the water machine

576
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,800
Right through the side door.

577
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
We're slowing down. I think we're getting off the highway.

578
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,260
I'm almost ready.

579
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,630
Sara, grab that strap over there.

580
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,160
All right, hold it.

581
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,730
Come on!

582
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
You all right?

583
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,000
After you clear the area

584
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,360
I don't anticipate any problems.

585
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
All right?

586
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,500
Scylla or not here we come.

587
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,530
All right. hold on.

588
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,190
What the hell are those guys doing?

589
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,760
We're not going against any additional people in there.

590
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,190
- We wait until they come back out.  - All right.

591
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,560
So Lincoln's mother is really the buyer?

592
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,700
It appears that way.

593
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,960
I hope he understands,

594
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,960
That if I need to take her out to get to scylla,

595
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
I'm not going to hesitate to kill her.

596
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,460
No question.

597
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,430
Well, let's just hope it doesn't come to that.

598
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,660
You serious?

599
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,530
Yeah. am I serious if we can get scylla

600
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,700
Without killing Linc's mother,

601
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,500
That's the preferable outcome.

602
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,800
Wait a second.

603
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,600
If I'm gonna be in the foxhole with you,

604
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I need to know that you have my back.

605
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,660
Mrs. Burrows has the item,

606
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,100
And the only way to get it is to kill her.

607
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
What is your move?

608
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,730
I pull the trigger.

609
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,500
There they go, Come on.

610
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,900
Don self,

611
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,300
Homeland Security.

612
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,960
We're investigating

613
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,730
A cruelty to animal charge.

614
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,560
I have no idea what you're referring to.

615
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,900
We're referring to ritual Slaughters of chickens.

616
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,560
Okay, that might be allowed where you come from

617
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,000
But here in America, that's no mas.

618
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,660
Chickens? This is preposterous.

619
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,260
This is because I'm Caribbean.

620
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
I swear to god, I smelled chicken blood.

621
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,330
Worse than the place

622
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,700
Down the street we shut down.

623
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,230
You want to turn this into something?

624
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,860
Sit down.

625
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
If there aren't any chickens,

626
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,900
There aren't any chickens.

627
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,000
But we're not going to know that

628
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,200
Until we take a look around.

629
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,000
The smell was coming from back there.

630
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,900
That is our sanctuary.

631
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,160
I cannot let you to disrupt it.

632
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,230
I understand your concerns, but I need to go back there.

633
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,000
I insist, you cannot do that.

634
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,100
Best I can do is have you accompany us, please.

635
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Please.

636
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,200
You,

637
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,530
Come on, let's go outside

638
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,530
Until they're done.

639
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,500
Let's go.

640
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,260
That's not a very heavenly thing to do.

641
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,630
Find anything?

642
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,930
Oh, yeah.

643
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,760
What the hell are they up to?

644
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,460
I don't know.

645
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,560
He just asked to rent that closet.

646
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,260
Did a woman ever come down here with him?

647
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,130
Yeah, once.

648
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,460
I'm telling you,

649
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,800
That's all I know.

650
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,760
Drop it.

651
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,430
Don't.

652
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,100
Come here. Both of you,

653
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,990
On your knees.

654
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,430
I said on your knees.

655
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,400
I told you not to come in here.

656
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,530
Where's the other guy?

657
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,030
He ran. Let's go.

658
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,730
Let's go.

659
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,190
Are you all right?

660
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,400
Yeah.

661
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,560
Let's go.

662
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,080
Come on.

663
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,630
We're not going to make it back to the truck.

664
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,060
I know.

665
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,100
Here.

666
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,060
Take this.

667
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,300
I'll be right back.

668
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,160
Michael!

669
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,360
You all right?

670
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,460
Yeah, thanks.

671
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:10,230
The general should know by now not to mess with us.

672
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,160
The general...

673
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,660
Didn't send me.

674
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,730
Who did?

675
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,730
Who sent you?

676
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,960
Lincoln!

677
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,430
We've got news.

678
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,600
So do I.

679
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,130
We're staying low for two days.

680
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,630
Christina's promised to get rid of Krantz.

681
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,900
I think she's lying.

682
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
I know it sounds crazy,

683
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,730
She said she's going to change the company

684
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,930
In the way it operates.

685
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,430
So what, the company's gonna go nonviolent now?

686
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,730
- Just hear me out. - I'm telling you. I think she's lying.

687
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,300
It's from the church. Some kind of credential.

688
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,360
There were some automatic weapons in there, too.

689
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,960
And trust me, if there's fake IDs and weapons

690
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,330
Something big's about to go down.

691
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,800
Your mom,

692
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,130
She said after two days,

693
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,500
That's when she would make the change.

694
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,600
Yeah.

695
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,100
Take a look at the date on that laminate,

696
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,860
Two days away.

697
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,500
- You think that's just a coincidence?   - Come on,

698
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,730
Lincoln, you can't be surprised

699
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,400
That a woman that would abandon her kids

700
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,760
Would be less than truthful

701
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,460
About her intentions right now.

702
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,430
- Hey, where you going? - I need to talk to her.

703
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,130
Just take a moment. Let's figure this out.

704
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,760
If she's looking to head the company,

705
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,830
There has to a more realistic plan than a one-man

706
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:39,900
Frontal assault.

707
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,930
She'll listen to me.

708
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,430
She asked you not to come back, Linc.

709
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,430
That's a warning.

710
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,630
Lincoln's back at the plaza.

711
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,660
I think we need

712
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,100
To realize he's more of a threat

713
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,360
Than we gave him credit for.

714
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,760
He found the mansion.

715
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,500
His guys got the stash at the church.

716
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,730
He's not going to stop.

717
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,730
I told him to stay away.

718
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,860
Sir,

719
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,960
Alpha is a go.

720
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,200
Christina,

721
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,160
We have a clean shot.

722
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,530
Take it.

723
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,560
Take it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
