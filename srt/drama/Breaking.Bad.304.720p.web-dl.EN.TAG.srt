1
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:43,402
So cigarettes and gas is...

2
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,608
$79.70 cents.

3
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:49,355
Crap.

4
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:52,528
There's an ATM right outside.

5
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:55,537
I don't have a card.

6
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:59,233
You can write
a personal check with I.D.

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,224
Kind of in between banks right now.

8
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:06,502
You think I could just

9
00:01:06,654 --> 00:01:07,757
come back later?

10
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,806
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back. I swear.

11
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:15,240
If it were me, I'd be,

12
00:01:15,794 --> 00:01:17,365
"Totally, you know, no problem."

13
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,245
But my dad is this ginormous
hard ass.

14
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:22,638
He was in Fallujah for a year,

15
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:26,112
and he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like... always.

16
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:28,753
I've got to call him.
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,713
Wait.

18
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,371
Hold on a second.

19
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,505
Maybe if we could,

20
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:39,193
trade.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,172
Ever try it?

22
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:52,318
I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

23
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,362
I party.

24
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:55,698
But...

25
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:58,314
But that stuff's really addictive,
right?

26
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,894
Not really. It's just a media thing.

27
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:02,554
You know?

28
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,165
What's it like?

29
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:14,915
It's awesome.

30
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,678
Everything's

31
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:21,537
maximum interesting.

32
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,640
You get these

33
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,928
really cold

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,820
and sharp-like

35
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,714
action dagger feelings.

36
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,758
It's awesome.

37
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:37,899
Come on.

38
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,710
What do you say?

39
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:14,274
Have a nice day.

42
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:55,692
How does it feel?

43
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:57,610
Does it hurt?

44
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:59,516
It's tight.

45
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,007
But is it painful?

46
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,242
It's hard to breathe.

47
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:07,185
You need your breathing.

48
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:11,426
{\pos(192,225)}Although let's not
lose sight of the fact

49
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,006
{\pos(192,225)}that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio,

50
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:16,531
{\pos(192,225)}so some discomfort
is to be expected.

51
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,254
Let's go with that one.

52
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,789
{\pos(192,225)}And spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

{\pos(192,225)}anxiety, sleeplessness,
you get the picture.

I did for this family.</i>

<i>You just keep telling that.</i>

68
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,729
<i>And what is that supposed to mean?</i>

69
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,399

{\pos(192,205)}Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

82
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,963
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

83
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,453
{\pos(192,205)}I will wait.

84
00:06:13,703 --> 00:06:15,085
It could be a while.

85
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,331
{\pos(192,205)}I have all the time in the world.

86
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,371
{\pos(192,205)}Here we go.

87
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,824
{\pos(192,205)}Excuse me.
Mr. Beneke's not available.

88
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:51,741
- Come on.
- Sir.

89
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,356
Excuse me.

90
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,190
{\pos(192,205)}I can see you.
I can see you

91
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:01,085
standing right there in your office.
Now, come on.

92
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:03,504
Open the door.
Come on,

93
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:06,090
let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

94
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,926
Come on, let's be men about this.
How about that?

95
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,098
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

96
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:15,475
Yes, you are.

97
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,446
So open the door.

98
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,955
You're damn right you are.
You're right in the middle.

99
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:22,473
Just open the door,
and let's talk about it, okay?

100
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,859
Open the door, Ted, right now.

101
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,111
You don't want
to be a man about it? Okay.

102
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:30,031
Plan B. How do you like that?
Plan B.

103
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:42,673
What are you doing?

104
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,230
I'm talking with Ted.

105
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:57,650
Next time,

106
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,348
you'll open...

107
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,853
the door.

108
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:04,702
Damn it.

109
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:12,365
Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

110
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,683
Calm down.

111
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:17,270
{\pos(192,205)}All right, I'm calm.

112
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:41,062
{\pos(192,205)}What do you want?

113
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,007
{\pos(192,205)}Come on.

114
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,606
What the hell is wrong with you?

115
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:51,150
You act like you're the first guy
this ever happened to.

116
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,869
{\pos(192,205)}I caught my second wife
screwing my stepdad, okay?

117
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,851
It's a cruel world, Walt.
Grow up.

118
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:02,258
{\pos(192,205)}I just wanted to talk to him.
Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

119
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:04,284
{\pos(192,205)}Consider this an intervention.

120
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:07,824
{\pos(192,205)}You could have been arrested back there.
You understand.

121
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,957
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours,

122
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:13,134
but speaking
as your business associate,

123
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,178
I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

124
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:20,266
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now.

125
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,320
Let's talk shop

126
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:26,833
because I think
this is a great opportunity

127
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,410
{\pos(192,205)}to channel some of that negative energy
into something positive.

128
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,351
{\pos(192,205)}How did you know?

129
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:33,687
{\pos(192,205)}Sorry?

130
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,128
{\pos(192,205)}About Skyler.

131
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:38,099
{\pos(192,205)}About where to find me just now.
How did you know?

132
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,809
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail.

133
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,000
- The lesson here...
- Did you bug my house?

134
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,633
{\But }I didn't know it was your house, did I?
You had moved out.

135
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,717
- Besides, you basically told me to.
- I told you to?

136
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:58,721
You strongly hinted that I should.

137
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,140
You were worried
about your wife, remember?

138
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,576
You were concerned she might say
something to the police.

139
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:06,893
What? That's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

140
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,802
Let's not get lost in the who,
what, and whens.

141
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,611
The point
is we did our due diligence,

142
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,099
and she didn't talk.
She kept quiet.

143
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,269
She stood by you, which,

144
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:21,869
if you ask me,
is the ironical silver ling here.

145
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:24,392
On the one hand, sure,

146
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:28,147
she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp, and deep.

147
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:29,972
On the other hand...

148
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,103
You're fired!

149
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,313
- You're done!
- Good.

150
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:52,692
I won't cook meth anymore.
You're a crybaby.

151
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,883
Who needs you?

152
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,601
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

153
00:10:56,726 --> 00:11:00,399
- How do you like that?
- I want you to remove those bugs{\ those bugs out of my house } today.

154
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,353
I want them out now!

155
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:05,884
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

156
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,926
Great,
drilled right into the stucco.

157
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,983
A little bit of putty,

158
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,472
you'll be fine.

159
00:11:25,256 --> 00:11:27,613
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

160
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:28,807
A,

161
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,069
these things cost $800 a piece.

162
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,164
B, you're not that interesting.

163
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,122
So yeah, I'll get all of them.

164
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,464
Great line of work, by the way.

165
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,825
Real upstanding field.

166
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,269
I enjoy it.

167
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,236
You're free to leave now.

168
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:00,676
Anytime.

169
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,515
You know,

170
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:09,203
sometimes it doesn't hurt to have
someone watching your back.

171
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,521
What's up?

172
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:48,422
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through,

173
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,503
with all of your health concerns and

174
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,002
the stresses you've been under.

175
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:56,150
Still, as educators,

176
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:59,329
there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here

177
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:03,324
to the school
and to the students themselves.

178
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,563
Of course.

179
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,804
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

180
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,610
Norfolk.

181
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,605
That's surprising.

182
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:22,364
Could you come back over
here and have a seat, please?

183
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,522
Sure.

184
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,332
You've been absent a lot recently,

185
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,192
and when you are here at school,

186
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,676
there have been
some behavioral questions,

187
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,796
and frankly I'm concerned.

188
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,766
Thank you.

189
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,705
Are you feeling okay?

190
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,589
And do you think
maybe I should call Skyler?

191
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,194
Let's just...

192
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,253
keep this...

193
00:15:27,397 --> 00:15:28,997
What's wrong with you?

194
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:14,637
You're the one
who was talking about D.C.

195
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,480
This is how you get there.

196
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:19,287
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

197
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:25,451
Besides,
it's... you know, it's a big deal

198
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:27,226
to get picked for this.

199
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,228
El Paso's like

200
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,259
the Super Bowl.

201
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:37,021
I could get killed
crossing the street, okay?

202
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:38,338
Whatever.

203
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,149
I want to go.

204
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,759
What about last time?

205
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,958
What about last time?

206
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,055
Blue?

207
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,026
Thing is,

208
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,474
Thing is I'm supposed
to be getting on a plane right now.

209
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,581
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

210
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,970
I want to talk to him.

211
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:44,981
Taxi.

212
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,075
I'm sorry.
I need to talk to you,

213
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,158
but you weren't at your apartment.

214
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,366
I moved back home.

215
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,239
That's good, right?

216
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,099
Did you just get fired?

217
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:46,000
More like a sabbatical.

218
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,037
Indefinite.

219
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:03,907
So

220
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:06,163
what's up?

221
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,570
Should we go somewhere?

222
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,518
No. This is fine.

223
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,949
So,

224
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:18,156
I want an intro to your guy.

225
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:19,419
What guy?

226
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,454
Your guy.
Your distribution guy.

227
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:26,749
- The guy Saul hooked you up with.
- Come on, Jesse.

228
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,175
I thought about it,

229
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:31,231
and I want to.

230
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,425
It's the one thing I'm good at.

231
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,200
No, that is just not true.

232
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,743
You're good at a lot of things, son.

233
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:40,343
Like what?

234
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,566
What about your sobriety?

235
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,737
I told you. I'm not using.

236
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:50,594
Ever.

237
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:52,648
I just want

238
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,691
back into the business.

239
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:00,410
I don't.

240
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:02,181
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:04,657
I know, and that's cool.

242
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,493
I'm not asking you to cook.

243
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:12,320
What's this?

244
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,014
In the end, I just went with

245
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,086
two reflux condensers. I didn't
want to lose track of my Ph levels,

246
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,765
but I did everything else
just like you taught me.

247
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,646
Super careful in my amounts

248
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,994
and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

249
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:34,236
So what do you think?

250
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:35,938
It's good, right?

251
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:39,524
What

252
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,700
in the hell

253
00:20:42,593 --> 00:20:43,623
is this?

254
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:45,621
What?

255
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,164
What? This. This.

256
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:50,082
This is my product.

257
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,384
This is my formula.
This is mine.

258
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,810
It's our product,

259
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:59,133
- but yeah, I was going to cut you in.
- You were going to cut me in?

260
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,497
I cut you in.

261
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:05,567
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

262
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,121
Absolutely not.

263
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,038
Why?

264
00:21:11,148 --> 00:21:13,912
Because I am not going to lend
my name to an inferior product.

265
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:15,887
Look at the diameters here.

266
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:18,319
What did you use for reduction?

267
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,541
Don't tell me.

268
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,461
Platinum dioxide, right?

269
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:24,668
Mercury-aluminum amalgam.

270
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:27,078
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

271
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,658
You must've done it wrong, then.

272
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,614
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation, too.

273
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:37,088
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

274
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:39,590
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

275
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:40,955
What?

276
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:46,097
No way. I gave out samples,
and everyone said it was the bomb.

277
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,357
They said it was the bomb.

278
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,723
And who are they? I wonder.

279
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,236
A bunch of meth heads?

280
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:55,855
They should know, right?

281
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:58,155
Sorry.
I can't help you.

282
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,402
Fine, ass wad.

283
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,553
You know what?
I'll contact the guy myself.

284
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:04,483
Good luck with that
because my guy is a pro,

285
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:06,075
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

286
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,307
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

287
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:53,118
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

288
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,776
This day is dragging.

289
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:38,671
I wish I could stay.

290
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,069
So stay.

291
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:46,306
What's stopping you?

292
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:51,969
What?
Like everything, you mean?

293
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:56,052
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

294
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,619
So move in here.

295
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,976
And then my son

296
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,567
hating me even more.

297
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,323
It'll pass.

298
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,108
I went through that with the girls.

299
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,283
They adapt.

300
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:14,704
And now everyone at work

301
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:17,522
thinks I'm an evil,
ladder-climbing whore.

302
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,908
They're all fired
effective immediately.

303
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:21,502
What else?

304
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,929
Aren't you the answer man.

305
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,700
Where did it...

306
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,296
Where did it go wrong, exactly...

307
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,571
you and Walt?

308
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,876
I mean,
I always saw him as kind of...

309
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:50,531
mild-mannered.

310
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:55,546
Something, I don't know,
changed when he got sick, or...?

311
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,910
I don't know what changed, Ted,

312
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:04,156
and I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

313
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:05,717
Sorry.

314
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,796
Just asking out of self-interest.

315
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:12,127
Got to make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

316
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:16,128
I would be amazed.

317
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,320
Just let me see
if I'm following you here, Russell.

318
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:26,951
You got this stuff
from some guy at Gasparza's

319
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,563
who was wearing tan pants
and who you're 80% sure

320
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,236
had a mustache.

321
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,099
That's it, right?

322
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:38,281
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

323
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:46,963
Russell.

324
00:25:48,577 --> 00:25:50,159
Everything all right in there?

325
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:53,409
Mel.

326
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:55,699
The dude's name was Mel.

327
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:58,145
Well, there you go. See?

328
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:00,642
You served
an actual earthly function.

329
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,700
I can't believe I remembered that.

330
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:03,825
Mel who?

331
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,356
Does he have a last name?

332
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,235
Mel.

333
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:11,997
Wait.

334
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:14,784
Was it Mel?

335
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:17,145
Mark.

336
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,820
It was definitely an "M" name.

337
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,815
Man, I'm losing it.

338
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,527
Wait, wait.

339
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:28,762
Yeah.

340
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,197
It's gone.

341
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,758
It's gone.

342
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,968
It was an "M" name, though.

343
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:38,693
I remember the "muh" sound.

344
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:43,900
We'll go with the "muh" sound.

345
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,189
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

346
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,257
He definitely had tan pants.

347
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:54,732
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

348
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:57,860
It's after 9,
so this bar that Girl George is at,

349
00:26:57,985 --> 00:26:59,835
probably wall-to-wall
dirtbags by now.

350
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,635
Let's go have a little looky-loo,

351
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,310
see if we can't find
this M-named clown.

352
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,794
What?

353
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,141
It's a lead.

354
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:12,598
Lead to what?

355
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:14,058
To Heisenberg.

356
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:17,815
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

357
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,540
Here we go, my friend.

358
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,095
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

359
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,370
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

360
00:27:26,318 --> 00:27:27,868
Man, you're reaching.

361
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:32,271
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

362
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,108
How do you know
Heisenberg's gearing up again?

363
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,588
How do I know?

364
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:40,395
Because I know.

365
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:42,498
I don't get it.

366
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:46,051
This is the reason
why you're blowing off the task force?

367
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,781
Chase down teeners?

368
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm getting tired
of all the second guessing.

369
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:55,614
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation,

370
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:58,344
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

371
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,651
What is up with you lately?

372
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,655
Starting bar fights?

373
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:04,642
Turning down El Paso?

374
00:28:05,078 --> 00:28:06,352
And now this bullshit?

375
00:28:06,874 --> 00:28:08,989
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

376
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:11,437
Talk to someone?

377
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,770
Talk to who?

378
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,157
I'm not trying
to step on your toes, bro.

379
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:23,784
I'm just worried about you.

380
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:25,955
- That's all.
- Appreciate that...

381
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:27,687
bro.

382
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,184
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

383
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,929
Yeah, the one that was on TV.

384
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,813
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

385
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:54,421
I'm not looking
for an entire wing here, Mr. Linkas.

386
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:55,908
It could be a nut or a bolt.

387
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,677
It could be a bag of peanuts,

388
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,094
just so long as it caused you pain
and suffering.

389
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,617
Closed.
Calling you back.

390
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,619
You had your chance.

391
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:08,532
I told you to get him cooking again,
and you blew it off, {\and }now it's too late.

392
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:10,807
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

393
00:29:11,354 --> 00:29:13,169
All I wanted was to show you two

394
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:16,046
your potential, and what do I get
in return? A bone contusion.

395
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:19,132
You want to see the scar?
I wish you two had...

396
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:21,433
Hi, there.

397
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:25,551
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...
- I made it.

398
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,109
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

399
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:08,012
Good news is, for a stage three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

400
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:11,297
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

401
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:14,322
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

402
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:17,842
My opinion, he's not coming back,

403
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:19,336
not on his own.

404
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,771
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

405
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:30,246
They drew something
on the street outside his house.

406
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,048
The scythe.

407
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:33,555
Animals.

408
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,293
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

409
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:44,049
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

410
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,028
You're the only thing that stands
between him and an ax in the head.

411
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:49,394
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

412
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:51,173
I want investment.

413
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:54,922
For now,
I'm simply interested in time frame.

414
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:58,062
He will live
for the foreseeable future, yes?

415
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,123
Foreseeable, couple years at least,
barring acts of God

416
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:03,648
and men with axes.

417
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,292
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know

418
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:10,667
the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

419
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:12,988
I don't work with junkies.

420
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:14,861
That's what I thought you'd say.

421
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,586
Probably for the best.

422
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:19,336
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

423
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:22,449
Really?

424
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:25,162
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

425
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:29,555
Do the deal.

426
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:00,795
{\pub}

427
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,560
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

428
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:02,054
<i>Agent Schrader,</i>

429
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,609
<i>you need to be calling me back ASAP.</i>

430
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:07,804
<i>I've got Texas breathing down my neck,
and I'm not about...</i>

431
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,408
Yeah, I haven't seen Matt
since my dad fired him,

432
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:33,763
like, a while ago.

433
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:35,469
Where can I find him{\, you think}?

434
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,078
- No idea. I haven't seen him...
- I know. You said that a few times.

435
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:40,916
{\Yeah, }Because I haven't seen him.

436
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:42,859
I don't know what else to say.

437
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:48,861
What's your name, darling?

438
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,327
Cara.

439
00:33:57,126 --> 00:33:58,866
Where did this come from, Cara?

440
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,620
I... I don't know.

441
00:34:02,906 --> 00:34:04,815
What is it?
Drugs?

442
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,890
{\Look, }I'm just going to come right out
and say it.

443
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,261
You're a bad liar, Cara.

444
00:34:14,537 --> 00:34:15,987
Don't get me wrong.

445
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,526
Not the worst I've ever seen.

446
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,007
Once had a guy try to explain
the dope balloon up his butt

447
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,154
on bad Thai food.
Still,

448
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:28,343
you're not a very good liar.

449
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:31,362
I honestly don't know.

450
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,530
Stop.

451
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:35,103
You look like a good kid.

452
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,037
I'm not here to get you in trouble,
but {\you need to }tell me where this came from{\ right} now!

453
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,572
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

454
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,965
I tried it, and I hated it, so I...

455
00:34:51,343 --> 00:34:53,860
- just gave it to Matt.
- And who gave it to you?

456
00:34:53,985 --> 00:34:56,600
Some guy,
he came in a couple days ago

457
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:01,127
- and wanted to trade it for gas.
- Some guy? What's his name?

458
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,169
What did he look like?

459
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,423
I don't know.

460
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,991
He looked pretty normal.

461
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:13,809
You know? White...

462
00:35:18,097 --> 00:35:21,004
I think his hair was lightish brown.

463
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:24,684
He had really blue eyes.

464
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,213
They were really, really blue.

465
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:29,204
Yeah, he's dreamy.

466
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:31,731
What else?
Piercings,

467
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:34,001
jewelry,
distinctive articles of clothing?

468
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:35,126
Come on.

469
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:37,470
Come on.

470
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,729
Listen to me.

471
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:45,034
It's real important that I find
the person that had these drugs,

472
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:48,064
so if you can remember
anything else{\ about him}...

473
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,079
Come on.

474
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:51,151
Think.

475
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,089
He drove an RV.

476
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:00,702
Okay, good, good.

477
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:03,596
What can you remember?
What kind of RV? What color?

478
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:05,332
Did you spot a license plate?

479
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,162
I don't know the kinds,

480
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:10,887
and I didn't see the license,

481
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:16,882
but the color was, I think,
white, brownish color.

482
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:21,490
I'm sorry.

483
00:36:22,322 --> 00:36:24,267
I know I'm not helping you, but...

484
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,659
Please don't tell my dad.

485
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:42,837
Please tell me

486
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,478
that that camera works.

487
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Dammit.

488
00:37:58,553 --> 00:37:59,553
Bingo.

489
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:22,098
These eggs are good, Mom.

490
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:24,376
Thanks.

491
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,141
You know what's weird?

492
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,559
Dad's website.

493
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,819
It's been three days
since the last donation.

494
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,261
Yeah, well...

495
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:39,983
people lose interest.

496
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:56,206
So how long are you off for?

497
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:02,676
A few weeks.

498
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:05,497
We'll play it by ear.

499
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:10,091
I probably...

500
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:14,407
pushed it, you know,
going back to work so soon.

501
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,907
Think I can get a ride today?

502
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:28,225
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

503
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:39,868
So Dad can babysit now.

504
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:41,798
Right?

505
00:39:43,064 --> 00:39:44,967
You won't have to take Holly to work

506
00:39:45,543 --> 00:39:46,543
every day.

507
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:57,655
Sometime, maybe.

508
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:01,793
We'll see.

509
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:45,907
What's up?

510
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,559
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

511
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:09,652
Wait.

512
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,610
No. Wait.

513
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,068
- What the hell? This is only half.
- That's right.

514
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:27,656
It's your half.

515
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:33,981
Where's the other half, bitch?

516
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,076
I mean, it was...

517
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:40,697
The whole thing was crazy, man.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

518
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:43,866
He actually thought we were
the cable guys, you know?

519
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,203
Anyway...

520
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:50,448
sorry about those miscalls, Chief.

521
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,553
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

522
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,248
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

523
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:57,725
Hell, yes!

524
00:41:58,205 --> 00:42:00,013
With pointed boots and bells on.

525
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,183
Just I got this break
in the Heisenberg case.

526
00:42:02,308 --> 00:42:03,647
The blue meth, you mean?

527
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:05,142
The teenth?

528
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,710
That teenth got things rolling.

529
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:11,319
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

530
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,298
{\Now, }The station's... closed circuit,
was down... surprise, surprise...

531
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,974
but I was able
to pull some of these snapshots

532
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,949
off an ATM security camera.

533
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,216
Now, I always thought these guys
might be camper cooking, right?

534
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,251
First off,

535
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,334
your typical Class C
motor home is gonna

536
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:28,772
grunt at least 5,000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

537
00:42:28,897 --> 00:42:32,593
We're talking appliances, furniture,
built-ins. 5,000 pounds at least, okay?

538
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:35,429
See how high
that suspension's riding?

539
00:42:36,238 --> 00:42:39,141
No way, no how, this thing's
carrying that kind of weight.

540
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,269
I mean,
this thing has been cleared out

541
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,179
and stripped down
to its tight and curlies.

542
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:44,304
For what?

543
00:42:45,161 --> 00:42:46,211
Blood bank?

544
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:48,377
Maybe a bookmobile?

545
00:42:50,152 --> 00:42:52,452
There's no clear view of the plates.

546
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,542
Yeah, well,
you can only get so lucky, right?

547
00:42:55,667 --> 00:42:57,368
But the fact
that there's no front plate

548
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,286
tells me its likely
New Mexico registration.

549
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:00,681
I checked with DMV.

550
00:43:00,806 --> 00:43:04,810
There are only 29 of these early '80s
Bounders registered in the state.

551
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:08,515
Only 29?

552
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,224
So I got to go, you know,
knock on some doors.

553
00:43:21,611 --> 00:43:23,436
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

554
00:43:23,674 --> 00:43:24,824
You bet. I...

555
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:27,485
I'm just going to wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

556
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,985
- So you're refusing the assignment.
- No, I'm not. I'll go. It's just...

557
00:43:31,547 --> 00:43:34,600
- I need some more time.
- You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.

558
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,813
You're out of time.

559
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,859
Are you going to El Paso now?

560
00:43:40,772 --> 00:43:41,772
Tonight?

561
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:48,372
Just a simple yes or no.

562
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
I can't.

563
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,295
But that's only because

564
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,163
I'm really close
to something big here.

565
00:44:18,892 --> 00:44:20,542
Better get to it, then.

566
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:49,363
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque news radio.</i>

567
00:44:49,488 --> 00:44:51,702
<i>KECA news time 10:13.</i>

568
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:53,180
<i>Our top story this hour...</i>

569
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:56,654

573
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:08,278
<i>Police won't say whether or not...</i>

574
00:45:57,985 --> 00:45:58,985
Your half.
