<i>We interrupt our scheduled programming
to bring you breaking news.</i>

4
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,158
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes,

5
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:21,659
KOB has received dozens of reports

6
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,078
of what appears to be
a crashed aircraft,

7
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:27,353
possibly two aircraft...
on Albuquerque's east side.

8
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:29,182
As of yet, details are scarce,

9
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:32,305
but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead,

10
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,928
followed by falling debris.

11
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:38,148
... crash investigators with
the National Transportation Safety Board

12
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:41,123
are expected
on-site as early as this evening.

13
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,172
But officials warn that,
with a debris field of this magnitude,

14
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:46,837
the investigation
and the clean-up may well stretch...

15
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:50,647
... the Boeing 737
was being re-routed or vectored

16
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:53,037
through the airspace,
which is standard procedure,

17
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:54,836
according to a spokesman
for the FAA.

18
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,722
<i>The eight-seat King Air 350</i>

19
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,383
<i>was a charter flight operating
out of Saint George, Utah,</i>

20
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,760
<i>bound for Amarillo, Texas.</i>

21
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,478
It sounded like hail.

22
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,357
Like heavy hailstones.

23
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,950
It was just...

24
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,185
bump-bump-bump
all over the neighborhood.

25
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:16,023
... indicating that the final
death toll now stands at 167.

26
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,011
... 167.

27
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,685
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering

28
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,578
how such an accident
could take place

29
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:26,451
in a system with so many safeguards.

30
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:29,413
Allegations continue that the collision
which brought down Flight 515

31
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,707
was caused by improper
air traffic control.

32
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,981
The bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City today,

33
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:38,588
as the FAA confirmed,
it was, indeed,

34
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,257
a lone air traffic controller's
fateful mistake...

35
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,396
... is Donald Margolis,

36
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,889
a 19-year veteran of the FAA's

37
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,225
<i>Air Route Traffic Control Center
in Albuquerque.</i>

38
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,423
... Margolis recently
returned to work

39
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,348
after a five-week absence,

40
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:57,565
which was due to,
quote, "a personal loss".

41
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,066
While it's now known

42
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,652
<i>that Margolis had recently
lost a daughter...</i>

43
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,474
<i>... to a drug overdose
a month before.</i>

44
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,625
<i>His troubled daughter
Jane Margolis, aged 26,</i>

45
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,464
<i>apparently had a long history</i>

46
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,039
<i>of substance abuse.</i>

47
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,703
<i>Friends of the family say
the death of his only child</i>

48
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:15,117
<i>hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

49
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,217
<i>Coming as it did little more
than a month before,</i>

50
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:21,780
<i>many are questioning
the timing of his return to work,</i>

51
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,972
<i>and are wondering
how much blame truly lies</i>

52
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>with those who let
this grieving father...</i>

53
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,957
{\pos(192,205)}I usually open

54
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,854
{\pos(192,205)}with "So sorry you're here."

55
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,165
{\pos(192,205)}Where would you like to begin?

56
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,349
{\pos(192,205)}I really just need this

57
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,841
{\pos(192,205)}quick and easy, you know?
As quick as...

58
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,865
{\pos(192,205)}something like this can be.

59
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:37,771
{\pos(192,180)}Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

60
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:40,563
{\pos(192,205)}Does he know?

61
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,264
{\pos(192,205)}I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

62
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,118
{\pos(192,205)}Has he moved out?

63
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,654
{\pos(192,205)}We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

64
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,622
{\pos(192,205)}And in the meantime, my...

65
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:53,824
{\pos(192,205)}my son and my daughter

66
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,851
and I are staying with my sister.

67
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:57,536
So you've moved out?

68
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:02,048
{\pos(192,205)}Yes, just temporarily,
only so he could get his things.

69
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,295
{\pos(192,205)}That was supposed
to happen last week,

70
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,481
{\pos(192,205)}but then came the crash, and...

71
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,090
{\pos(192,205)}- God. You weren't one of the...
- Right...

72
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,608
Right beneath the flight path.

73
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:16,693
We had debris land in our yard

74
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:19,041
- and all of our neighborhood, so...
- Terrible.

75
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,616
Apparently, even...

76
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:22,263
you know,

77
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,828
parts of bodies, and so...

78
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:28,387
I certainly
couldn't bring myself to...

79
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,627
- So awful.
- I know.

80
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:32,577
Anyway, I was certainly

81
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,532
not ready to move back,
but it's time.

82
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
And...

83
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:39,620
I'm sure we're driving my sister
and her husband up a wall.

84
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,320
{\pos(192,205)}You definitely want
to maintain residency

85
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:43,624
{\pos(192,205)}in your actual home.

86
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,299
{\pos(192,205)}It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

87
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:48,713
{\pos(192,205)}Two children?

88
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,177
{\pos(192,205)}Holly here, and then I have a son

89
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,740
{\pos(192,205)}in high school...

90
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:55,274
{\pos(192,205)}Walter Junior.

91
00:09:57,662 --> 00:09:59,056
{\pos(192,205)}They need to stay with me.

92
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,112
{\pos(192,205)}- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

93
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:07,189
{\pos(192,205)}And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?

94
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:11,028
Do you own outright?
Do you have a mortgage?

95
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,906
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have...

96
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,698
maybe 15 years on it.

97
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,644
What about other debts

98
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,010
or assets?

99
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,120
Do you feel
you have a good understanding

100
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,539
of you and your husband's
financial situation?

101
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,837
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

102
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:32,885
I'm really not looking
for any, sort of...

103
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,109
loopholes or...

104
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:36,886
- I don't know... just...
- No.

105
00:10:37,162 --> 00:10:38,312
No loopholes.

106
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:40,281
I just intend

107
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:43,558
that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting

108
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,283
of what it is they owe

109
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,108
and what it is they own.

110
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,528
To that end, I say

111
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:51,817
let's leave no stone unturned.

112
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:57,620
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

113
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,792
There you are.
Listen, I...

114
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,267
You know, well...

115
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,367
It's...

116
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:55,611
It's time.

117
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,175
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?

118
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,685
Bar none. Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

119
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,375
I speak with some authority
because we had some shitty weeks

120
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,813
in the past few months.

121
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:12,670
But this here, call, you know...

122
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,033
call freakin' the Guinness
Book of World Records...

123
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,966
Call freakin'...
Am I talking too much?

124
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,799
I am, right? I am.
I know. Look.

125
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:21,010
But this situation
between you and...

126
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,492
I'm not asking, by the way.

127
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:27,276
It's none of my business.
I do not want to get in the middle.

128
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,164
I'm just saying...
Listen, okay?

129
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,830
You beat a little tactical retreat.

130
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,218
And regroup.

131
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:34,864
And then... bong.

132
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,777
Absence makes the...

133
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,933
I'm pulling for you.

134
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,525
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

135
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:57,877
I got it.

136
00:12:58,858 --> 00:12:59,858
Jesus.

137
00:13:00,743 --> 00:13:02,698
What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

138
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,718
Half a million in cash.

139
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:15,423
That's the spirit.

140
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,707
I got it. I got it.

141
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:44,741
Who's here for self-improvement?

142
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,725
Come on, give me a show of hands.

143
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,107
Who among you is here hoping

144
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,850
they can actively
improve who they are?

145
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:01,609
Right.

146
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,413
See, that's your first mistake.

147
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,221
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

148
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:16,940
Honey, you...

149
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,817
You want another waffle?

150
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:23,667
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

151
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:29,026
<i>Hi, you're reached Walt,
Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.</i>

152
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,866
<i>Please leave us a message.</i>

153
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,700
<i>Hey. Hello, everybody.
Good morning.</i>

154
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:36,272
<i>I was just checking in</i>

155
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:39,886
<i>and thought I'd pass along
the current contact information.</i>

156
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,613
<i>I mean, certainly,
you can always reach me on my cell.</i>

157
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,718
<i>I've always got that on me.
But in terms of...</i>

158
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:46,602
<i>a mailing address,</i>

159
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,025
<i>I'm here at The Beachcomber.</i>

160
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,347
<i>And you know what?
It's actually very nice.</i>

161
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:52,657
<i>It's very pleasant.</i>

162
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,074
<i>Not as high end as the Oakwood,
but, you know, not as corporate...</i>

163
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,899
Would you please just...

164
00:14:58,024 --> 00:14:59,424
Hey, Dad. It's me.

165
00:15:01,152 --> 00:15:02,502
No, I'm not okay.

166
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:04,504
I don't know
what the hell is going on.

167
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:06,239
Nobody's telling me jack shit.

168
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,407
Flynn.

169
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:08,492
Whatever.

170
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,042
I don't even care anymore.

171
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,222
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

172
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,047
I'll take you to school.

173
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:16,868
Yeah. No.

174
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,551
I'm ready now.

175
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:20,912
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

176
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,674
All right. I'm here.

177
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,590
See you soon.

178
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,081
May I have your attention, please?

179
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:51,469
As all of you know,

180
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,137
last week our city suffered
a terrible tragedy,

181
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,360
one that none of us
will ever forget,

182
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,512
which is why today
we're going to take a little time

183
00:16:58,637 --> 00:16:59,853
out of our schedule

184
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,021
to gather in the gym and talk.

185
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,918
I just find it,

186
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,503
you know, really...

187
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,837
really hard to concentrate

188
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:13,007
because of all the horrors,

189
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,281
you know, we perceived.

190
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:20,063
It just really gets
inside your brain, and...

191
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:23,140
In college they have
this thing where,

192
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:25,355
if your roommate kills himself...

193
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,911
like, if you come home
and find him hanging

194
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:29,639
in the closet or whatever...

195
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:32,052
it's basically, like,
an automatic "A"

196
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:33,479
for you.

197
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,223
And I just think that
that kind of compassion is...

198
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,989
- Okay.
- is something to...

199
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:40,348
Thank you, Barry.

200
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,853
Who wants to go next?

201
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:46,216
No judgments, guys.

202
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,484
Just feelings.

203
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:51,130
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind.

204
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,739
Anyone?

205
00:17:57,178 --> 00:17:58,328
There you go, honey.

206
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,475
I just keep asking myself...

207
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,167
Honey, could you please stand up?

208
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:12,028
Just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

209
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:15,845
I mean, if there's a God and all,

210
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:19,945
why does he allow all those innocent
people to die for no reason?

211
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,268
Can we just keep it secular, honey?

212
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:26,244
Anyhow, I haven't really
been sleeping much.

213
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:29,359
Does anyone else have that?

214
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,488
I just keep hearing that...

215
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:34,895
that sound.

216
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,508
That... boom.

217
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,453
It just plays over
and over in my head

218
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:44,278
like it won't ever stop.

219
00:18:48,998 --> 00:18:50,434
Thank you, sweetheart.

220
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:52,753
Is there anyone else?

221
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:54,389
Over here.

222
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:00,874
My neighbor,

223
00:19:01,961 --> 00:19:03,411
he heard the crash,

224
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,735
and he ran outside,

225
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,679
and he found, like, this seat...

226
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,187
like an airline seat.

227
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,883
Like one you have on an airliner?

228
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:17,435
Anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard,

229
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,033
right next to his Sea-Doos...

230
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,538
because, like,
he has Sea-Doos... But...

231
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,711
there was still a pair of legs

232
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,236
buckled into them.

233
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,658
Human legs.

234
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:32,428
Jesus H. Christ.

235
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:38,084
- You okay?
- Yeah. Sorry.

236
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,371
I was just moved.

237
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:45,226
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

238
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,525
Certainly this tragedy

239
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,750
didn't only affect our students.

240
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:53,777
Mr. White, would you
like to say something?

241
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:55,945
And by the way,

242
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,386
welcome back.

243
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,793
It's so good to have you back.

244
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,860
I guess what I would...

245
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,604
Sorry. Sorry.

246
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,092
I guess what I would
want to say is...

247
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,926
to look on the bright side.

248
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:46,704
First of all, nobody

249
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,272
on the ground was killed.
And that...

250
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,183
An incident like this

251
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,714
over a populated urban center...

252
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:57,340
That right there,
that's just gotta be

253
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,690
some minor miracle, so...

254
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:01,427
Plus...

255
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,316
neither plane was full.

256
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,617
You know, the 737 was...

257
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,061
Was what? Maybe two-thirds full,
I believe. Right? Yes?

258
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:12,647
Or maybe even three-quarters full.

259
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,015
At any rate,

260
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:16,500
what you're left with

261
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:18,088
casualty-wise is

262
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:21,347
just the 50th worst air disaster.

263
00:21:21,868 --> 00:21:23,853
Actually, tied for 50th.

264
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,193
There are, in truth,

265
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,778
fifty-three

266
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,669
crashes throughout history
that are just as bad

267
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:35,887
or worse...

268
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:37,578
Tenerife?

269
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:40,383
Has anybody hear of Tenerife?

270
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,878
In 1977,

271
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,513
two fully loaded 747s

272
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,976
crashed into each other on Tenerife.

273
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,568
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?

274
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,526
It's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.

275
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,507
Nearly 600 people died

276
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,053
on Tenerife.

277
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:05,983
Doesn't any of you
even remember it at all?

278
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:08,554
Any of you? I doubt it.

279
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,038
You know why?

280
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:11,456
It's because...

281
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,686
people move on.

282
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,774
They just move on.

283
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:21,215
And we will, too. We will move on,
and we will get past this

284
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,051
because that is
what human beings do.

285
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,146
We survive.

286
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:27,317
And...

287
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:31,853
We survive, and we...
We overcome.

288
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:37,238
We survive.
We survive, and...

289
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:41,689
Thank you.

290
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,034
Good.

291
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,400
How's your Aunt Marie doing?

292
00:25:27,483 --> 00:25:28,483
Fine,

293
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:29,779
I guess.

294
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,768
You make sure you say hello
to her for me, will you?

295
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,995
Why don't you just come inside?

296
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,420
It's your house.

297
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,119
No, I...

298
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:17,303
He's gone.

299
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,941
Hey, Flynn!

300
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:24,817
- How's tricks?
- What?

301
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:26,587
Tricks.
It's an expression.

302
00:26:27,474 --> 00:26:28,574
How are you?

303
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:32,087
Why do you gotta
treat him like this?

304
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:35,621
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?

305
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:37,202
Cool down.

306
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:52,597
Out of the mouths of babes.

307
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:00,228
Try not to hold it against him.

308
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,939
I mean,
the poor kid, he's probably just

309
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:06,084
dying of curiosity.

310
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:09,131
And I guess it would be natural

311
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:11,703
for him to wonder.

312
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:13,159
He's probably just wondering

313
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,650
what is it that could
have gone so wrong...

314
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:18,164
- Marie.
- ... that my mother would leave...

315
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,280
I can't help you get
through this, Skyler,

316
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,917
you know, if you won't tell me

317
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,987
what it is that Walt did.

318
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:26,129
You know what?
I don't remember

319
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:27,474
asking you, all right?

320
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,216
So if you want to be supportive,

321
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:33,175
you could be supportive without prying,
that would be really great...

322
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:34,721
and so...

323
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:36,888
helpful.

324
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,087
It's that...

325
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,680
voice inside your head.

326
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:53,124
It's that sneaky,
rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.

327
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:59,364
You guys know what I'm talking about.
It tells you you're not good enough.

328
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,100
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to...

329
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:06,493
be what,
President of the United States?

330
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:09,815
Okay, so maybe you're not that good.

331
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:11,553
But now,

332
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:14,645
are you good enough
to deserve your share

333
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,655
of basic human happiness?

334
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:21,586
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

335
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:23,351
I say yes.

336
00:28:28,535 --> 00:28:30,292
But it doesn't matter what I say.

337
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:33,954
It's your voice, which means
you're the only one that hears it,

338
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,742
which means that you're
the only one that can fight it.

339
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:37,867
Right?

340
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:39,631
Jesse...

341
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:42,097
we never hear from you.

342
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:44,691
What's going on?

343
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:48,165
You can tell me I'm full of shit.
It's okay. I don't mind.

344
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,770
Just... Come on.

345
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:51,731
Let us in on it.

346
00:28:58,733 --> 00:28:59,733
So, like,

347
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,722
what makes you the expert?

348
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:05,860
I don't think
I ever said I was that.

349
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,582
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

350
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,649
Telling us thus and so,

351
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:13,358
be happy, forgive yourself,

352
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:19,046
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

353
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,381
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever,

354
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:25,882
but did you...

355
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:28,088
ever really...

356
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,335
hurt someone?

357
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:35,127
I killed my daughter.

358
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:43,778
It was July 18th...

359
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:46,247
which is my birthday.

360
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:48,160
July 18th,

361
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:50,336
1992.

362
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:52,698
I was...

363
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,920
high on cocaine, and I was drunk.

364
00:29:55,453 --> 00:29:57,894
Cocaine wasn't an issue
because I had bought myself 2 grams

365
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:00,300
the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.

366
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:03,111
But I was out of vodka.

367
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:06,259
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia,

368
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:09,324
where instead of selling
liquor in the supermarkets,

369
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:11,353
they have these ABC stores

370
00:30:11,521 --> 00:30:12,990
which close at 5 p.m.

371
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:16,561
And right then it was, like, 4:42.

372
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,571
So I'm arguing with my wife...

373
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:23,789
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.

374
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:25,617
"It's my birthday.

375
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:26,785
"Come on.

376
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,029
"They're not gonna sell it to me."

377
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:33,037
She's saying, "No, no."

378
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,263
So I'm pissed,

379
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:39,626
and the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

380
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:41,902
She's...

381
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,060
my 6-year-old daughter...

382
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:48,028
She's playing at the end
of the driveway.

383
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,578
How do you not hate yourself?

384
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:03,814
I did hate myself...

385
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:05,532
for a long time.

386
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,464
But it didn't stop me from...

387
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:10,897
drinking and getting high.

388
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:13,122
It just made it that much worse.

389
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,446
Self-hatred, guilt,

390
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:19,929
it accomplishes nothing.

391
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:22,340
It just stands in the way.

392
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,746
Stands in the way of what?

393
00:31:27,088 --> 00:31:28,188
True change.

394
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,506
Is this a good time to talk?

395
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,440
Yeah. Come in, please.

396
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,809
Do you want to start?

397
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:10,405
Why are you doing this?

398
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,867
Why are you even thinking this way?

399
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,640
Is it to punish me?

400
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,289
- I am not punishing you, Walt.
- This is punitive

401
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:20,391
is what this is.

402
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:22,627
We are happily married.

403
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:24,838
I am happily married.

404
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,260
I am happy.

405
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:28,385
We're just...

406
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:35,962
I love you,

407
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,571
and I would do anything for you.

408
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,477
Would you even consider...

409
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,682
I mean, Jesus!

410
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:52,056
You come in here,
and you wave these papers in my face,

411
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:54,389
when there's a whole other

412
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,267
entire side to this thing.

413
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,706
There's your side,
and there's my side.

414
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,719
And you haven't heard my side yet.

415
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:04,761
- You haven't heard any of it at all.
- You're a drug dealer.

416
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:29,617
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

417
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:35,555
Marijuana.

418
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,799
That Pinkman kid.

419
00:34:56,486 --> 00:34:57,486
Cocaine?

420
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:03,622
It's methamphetamine.

421
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:07,621
But I'm...

422
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,809
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.

423
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:14,469
<i>Per se.</i>

424
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,252
It doesn't mean...

425
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:19,043
No, Skyler.

426
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:20,703
Listen to me.

427
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:25,124
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated.

428
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,418
All right?
So please, let's... Please,

429
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,755
let's just sit back down,
and we'll talk it through.

430
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,095
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

431
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,406
I won't tell Hank,

432
00:35:35,848 --> 00:35:37,848
and I won't tell your children

433
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:40,558
or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me,

434
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,851
but only
if you grant me this divorce

435
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,419
and stay out of our lives.
I mean it.

436
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:50,066
Now let me out of here
before I throw up.

437
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:29,484
Your windshield's broken.

438
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:33,591
Yep.

439
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:41,968
A little friction

440
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,085
in the marriage right now.

441
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:45,612
Strictly temporary.

442
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,887
We're just...

443
00:36:47,368 --> 00:36:49,218
just taking a little break.

444
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,377
That's you over there.

445
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:57,167
Listen,

446
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:58,467
money.

447
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:01,314
Saul has got it for you,

448
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:04,689
- so as soon as you're feeling better...
- I'm better.

449
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:06,867
You're better.

450
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:08,472
Really?

451
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,119
What? The rehab?

452
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,307
It helped?

453
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,224
Yeah.

454
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,251
I'm done using.

455
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,783
That's excellent. That's...

456
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,222
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy...

457
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:25,173
Very good.

458
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:28,558
You know, um...

459
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:33,271
in spite of how bad things got,

460
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,174
it really could be looked at

461
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:38,599
like a wake-up call for both of us.

462
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,433
You know, just to get our...

463
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,508
our lives back together again

464
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:47,164
and on the straight and narrow.

465
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,855
You been following
this airplane crash?

466
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,458
Yeah.

467
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:58,303
You know it was

468
00:37:58,428 --> 00:38:01,071
Jane's dad who accidentally
crashed them together?

469
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,282
Because he was so torn up?

470
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:06,327
Let me stop you
right there, all right?

471
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:09,673
You are not responsible for this...

472
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:12,586
not in any way, shape,
or form, all right?

473
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:15,228
Now, I am very up-to-date
on this thing,

474
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:17,453
probably far more than you are,

475
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:19,242
and there are... there are...

476
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,217
many factors at play there.

477
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:22,404
Yeah?

478
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,575
For instance,

479
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,419
there's some sort of collision radar

480
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:30,517
on the jet that may not
have been working properly.

481
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,644
That's public record.
You can look that up.

482
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:34,946
And the whole system is run on...

483
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,571
on 1960s technology.

484
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,689
No.

485
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:39,939
No, really...

486
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,511
I blame the government.

487
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,925
You either run from things,

488
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,950
or you face them, Mr. White.

489
00:38:50,301 --> 00:38:52,451
And what exactly does that mean?

490
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:53,916
I learned it in rehab.

491
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,500
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

492
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:01,449
I accept who I am.

493
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,258
And who are you?

494
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,568
I'm the bad guy.

495
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,034
Is the food to your satisfaction?

496
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:36,538
Very much.

497
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,183
It's good to see you again.

498
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:43,663
May I?

499
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:53,767
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

500
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:57,524
I actually...

501
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,690
am not here to...

502
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:04,112
I'm here

503
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:07,011
because I owe you

504
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:08,907
the courtesy and respect

505
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:11,096
to tell you this personally.

506
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:15,218
I'm done.

507
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:18,750
It has nothing to do

508
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,418
with you personally.

509
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:24,176
I find you extraordinarily
professional,

510
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:26,425
and I appreciate
the way you do business.

511
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:28,188
I'm just...

512
00:40:29,616 --> 00:40:31,427
making a change in my life

513
00:40:31,552 --> 00:40:33,302
is what it is, and I'm...

514
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:37,276
I'm at some...
something of a crossroads.

515
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:39,998
It has...

516
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,965
brought me to a realization.

517
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:47,829
I am not a criminal.

518
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,442
No offense to any people who are.

519
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:55,625
But...

520
00:40:58,648 --> 00:40:59,898
this is not me.

521
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:05,797
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

522
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:09,968
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.

523
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:11,323
$3 million

524
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,316
for three months of your time.

525
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:18,702
Three months,

526
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:19,978
then out.

527
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:27,428
3 million?

528
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,081
May I take this as a yes?

529
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:43,766
I have money.

530
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,770
I have more money
than I know how to spend.

531
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,591
What I don't have is my family.

532
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,395
The answer is still no.

533
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:03,731
Enjoy your meal.

534
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,321
Thank you.

535
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,198
What the hell is going on?
