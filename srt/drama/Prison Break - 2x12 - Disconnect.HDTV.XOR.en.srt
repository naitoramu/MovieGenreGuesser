00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:02,711
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,797
Why don't I just give you half
the money we call it a day?

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,716
All right, 60/40.

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,968
You thieving son of a bitch.

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,440
You better get
down on your knees

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,317
and pray to God that
I don't find you.

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,390
Because if I do, mark my words,

8
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,351
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

9
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:18,852
- Mr. Bellick?
- Yeah?

10
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,520
Do you mind answering
a few more questions?

11
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:24,240
We have a lead as to where Burroughs
will be meeting up with his brother.

12
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,498
It's a place he referred
to as "Bolshoi booze."

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,774
They're numbers.

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,611
Plug 'em into your GPS they'll take
you to a spot in the New Mexico desert.

15
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:34,863
- Daddy!
- Hey, baby, you ready to go?

16
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,991
Go, go, go, go, go!

17
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:39,953
What do we do now?

18
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,123
- She told you anything?
- Not yet.

19
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:48,750
- Then kill her.
- Well, she knows something.

20
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:50,553
You disobey me, you are done!

21
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,111
Put her in the ground, Paul!

22
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,132
You're going to die,

23
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:56,643
and all you had to do was tell
me what your father gave you.

24
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,301
Go to hell.

25
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:02,100
Go!

26
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:06,232
The plane's gonna stop at
the seven-mile marker,

27
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:08,730
Route 4 at sunset.

28
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:10,023
We got to go.

29
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:14,322
- I brought someone. Dad.
- We met before.

30
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,333
- It was you.
- Go easy, son.

31
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:26,793
- Stay away from me.
- What the hell's going on?

32
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:27,710
I know him.

33
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:29,643
What do you mean you know him?
That's impossible.

34
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:31,423
I know him. I know this man!

35
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:42,603
- Michael...
- Maybe that's far enough.

36
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,682
- This doesn't concern you.
- What the hell's going on, Dad?

37
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,480
After Mom died...

38
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,652
you were in juvie.

39
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,490
They put me with this...

40
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,793
this foster father down
on Pershing Avenue.

41
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:10,711
He punished me, locked me up.

42
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,760
If you leave someone alone
in the dark for that long,

43
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,931
their eyes start to adjust.

44
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:23,431
You start to see things,
no matter how small,

45
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:28,980
because if they exist,
they can help you.

46
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,022
Help you do the only
thing you want to do...

47
00:02:33,865 --> 00:02:39,113
when you're alone in the dark.

48
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,930
Sorry, man.
I thought you'd left.

49
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:46,851
No, still here. Here I am.

50
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,781
Yeah, it's just that
a couple of guests

51
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,822
are complaining about
the volume of your TV.

52
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:54,940
Oh, sorry, I fell asleep.
I must have hit the remote.

53
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,862
I'll take care of it.
Thanks. Sorry.

54
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,362
Great. Um,

55
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:01,403
so could you do that
for me now, please,

56
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,030
so it's taken care of?

57
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,243
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

58
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,960
Taken care of.

59
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:22,420
Is, uh,
everything okay in your bathroom?

60
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,723
Excuse me?

61
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,432
Your bathroom.
There's a noise coming from it.

62
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,720
Yeah, my daughter thinks
bath time is playtime.

63
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,062
I will clean it up.
Scout's honor. Sorry.

64
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:38,772
- All right. Have a nice day.
- Yeah, you, too.

65
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:53,082
- Michael, Michael, please wait.
- He did this to you?

66
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:55,122
- Michael!
- Lincoln!

67
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:59,253
He did this to you?

68
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:03,420
He did this to you?

69
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,891
How could you do that
to another human being

70
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,520
with your own hands?

71
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:31,662
It's okay. You're safe now.

72
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,542
He's not going to
hurt you anymore.

73
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,381
Come on.

74
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:51,681
Come with me and
don't look back.

75
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,281
Michael!

76
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,612
Michael...

77
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,833
It's gonna be all right.

79
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,551
Six months.

80
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,133
Six months I was in that place.

81
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:18,930
Where were you?
How long did you know?

82
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:22,193
I found you as soon as I could.
The state kept moving you around.

83
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,850
Then you went away
again, right?

84
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:25,990
You don't think it killed
me to leave you like that?

85
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:27,520
To leave in the first place?

86
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,773
Since the beginning,
I was the problem.

87
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:30,981
Since day one.

88
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:33,162
Your lives are what
they are because of me.

89
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:34,993
Yes, Linc told me
about the Company.

90
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:37,131
Apparently, you were
some kind of analyst.

91
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,713
That's the job you
chose over your family.

92
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,463
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

93
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:43,493
- I thought I was protecting you.
- From what, Dad, from who?

94
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:46,580
The Company had enemies!
I was important to the Company.

95
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:50,502
I became a target. Easiest way to
get to me would be to get to you!

96
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,381
I left as soon as I realized
how corrupt it all was.

97
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:55,272
How they were buying
the government...

98
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,103
You could have come
back at any time!

99
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,223
No, I couldn't!

100
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:00,553
Michael, turning on the Company

101
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,891
put me and you at
even greater risk.

102
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,102
I had to stay away.

103
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:07,980
We were your sons.

104
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:09,813
And you still are, Michael.

105
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,072
We can fix this.

106
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,573
I came back so that
we could fix this.

107
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:18,532
This can never be fixed.

108
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,290
There's a tape.

109
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,961
Gives us everything we need.

110
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,043
Linc will be set
free if we find it.

111
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:34,250
You're not gonna believe
who he thinks has it.

112
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,012
Who?

113
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:38,090
Sara.

114
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes, uh, tall and slender,
brown hair, brown eyes.

115
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:48,442
She'd be pretty banged up.

116
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:52,443
No one matching that description
has been brought into the ER.

117
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:57,902
Kellerman.

118
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:01,412
- No report on Sara Tancredi?
- She's dead.

119
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,423
I'm dealing with
the body right now.

120
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,541
You must be relieved
that it's over.

121
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,120
Yeah. Yeah, I got to go.

122
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:11,791
One more thing: confirmation.

123
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,290
I need a photo of the
body before disposal.

124
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:17,101
Uh, take one with your phone
and send it to me and I'll...

125
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,233
Bill not a good time right now,
all right?

126
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:26,060
Paul, take a breath,
then take the picture.

127
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm waiting.

128
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:40,741
"The trail led to a
very dangerous place.

129
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,490
Now, Arvid knew that,

130
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:45,160
but he held tightly onto
the dragon's leash anyway,

131
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,543
as the creature ran into
the Everdark Forest,

132
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,581
pulling the young
boy behind him."

133
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:52,540
Why didn't he just
let go of the leash?

134
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:55,463
Well, because he
loved the dragon.

135
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,301
Now, when you love someone,

136
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,970
you'll do anything
to hold onto them.

137
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,142
Anything to keep
them safe and happy.

138
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,813
Is that why we're camping?

139
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:10,230
Yep. So we can all be together.

140
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:11,811
I'm happy.

141
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm happy, too.

142
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,573
Here you go.

143
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,970
Well, it's all
working out, huh?

144
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:43,550
Don't say that.

145
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,828
You know, this moment,
right here, right now,

146
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:05,824
it's all worth it.

147
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,913
I love you.

148
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,372
I love you.

149
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:40,902
That's old.
The kids are bigger now.

150
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:42,361
Sorry. I was just...

151
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,630
Getting bored out of your wits
'cause you been waiting so long.

152
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,160
Really sorry about all this.

153
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,382
We don't get a whole bunch
of homicides out here,

154
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:54,502
and, well, we're trying to
play catch-up. Have a seat.

155
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,130
I'm real sorry
about your friend.

156
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,961
Sick world out there.

157
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,010
Ain't that the truth?

158
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:06,260
So you guys out here
in Kansas together?

159
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,181
Yeah. That's right.

160
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:09,640
Doing what?

161
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,801
Well, you know,
just seeing the sights.

162
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,641
You left Chicago to see the
sights in Tribune, Kansas?

163
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:17,481
Last time I checked,
a man could go where he wanted.

164
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:18,901
- Mr. Bellick...
- Brad.

165
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:24,403
Brad. I don't really care
what you were doing out here.

166
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,243
We're both in law enforcement.

167
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:29,241
We can each sniff out
a perp like a hot fart.

168
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,160
Pardon my French.

169
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:34,753
We both know you're
not a criminal, so...

170
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,913
I don't care if you boys were

171
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:39,330
out here whoopin' it
without your wives or...

172
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,461
going Brokeback.

173
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,591
What?

174
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,171
Hell, no.

175
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,760
My point is,
I don't care what you were doing.

176
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,080
I just need to know
where you were doing it

177
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,861
and who you might have
crossed paths with so

178
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:53,852
I can find out who
carved up Mr. Geary.

179
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,690
Geary and I got a lead

180
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,281
that one of the Fox
River Eight was in town.

181
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:09,863
- Which one?
- Theodore Bagwell.

182
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,343
The man who did all those horrible
things to those teenagers?

183
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:13,243
That's him.

184
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:15,711
We were going to bring him
in for the reward money,

185
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,702
but we couldn't get
a handle on him.

186
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:20,183
Geary and I split up,
figured we didn't have a shot, but...

187
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:22,163
- But what?
- Well, after what happened,

188
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:26,380
I'm starting to think maybe Geary
ran into ol' Bagwell after all.

189
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,260
Right here in Tribune?

190
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,892
Now, Brad, do you think you
could answer some questions

191
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:36,270
that might help us track
down Theodore Bagwell?

192
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,643
I'd be indebted.

193
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:41,522
I'll do whatever I can to help
you nail that son of a bitch.

194
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,072
- You think Sara has this tape?
- Government does.

195
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,110
I just saw her yesterday.

196
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:51,521
If she does have anything,
she doesn't know.

197
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:54,833
- Well, where is she now?
- I don't know.

198
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,200
Any way you can get
in touch with her?

199
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:59,661
- We brought cell phones.
- I could call her.

200
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:03,043
Please, please, please, bro,
call her from Panama. Please.

201
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:07,252
We got less than two hours.
I got to make the flight.

202
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,592
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- What?

203
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,561
Run. Run!

204
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,190
Where's this car you
keep talking about?

205
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,651
It's over the ridge.

206
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:29,860
Give me that.

207
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,992
You guys head for the car! Go!

208
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,961
Come on! Go!

209
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:50,843
Go back for him!

210
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,893
Get in! Get in!

211
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,943
Come on! Dad!

212
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,152
We made it!

213
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:15,741
Son of a bitch! We made it!

214
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,003
Linc.

215
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:36,471
Sucre, get us to a hospital.

216
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,523
Out here?
Where the hell am I going to find...?

217
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,891
Just get us to a
hospital, please!

218
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,913
Don't worry.
You're going to make it.

219
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:46,023
It's bile.
He got me clean through.

220
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,941
You're going to be okay!
Just... hold on.

221
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:52,901
Listen to me, both of you.

222
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,111
I'm sorry.

223
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,453
I wish I had never left.

224
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,290
Don't talk. Just breathe.

225
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,710
Okay, so do you want a PB & B?

226
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:16,590
- Not really. My tummy hurts.
- Huh.

227
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:20,973
- Where's her knapsack?
- Her what?

228
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,521
Her knapsack.
Her medicine's in it.

229
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,030
I don't know, baby.
I just grabbed her and ran.

230
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:28,992
She needs that medicine.
She can't go two days without it.

231
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,021
Yeah, I know.
I'm her father, all right?

232
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,110
Where is it?

233
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:37,031
Baby. Baby, look. Calm down.
What are you looking for?

234
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,752
Just tell me what it is,
and I'll go ahead and get it, okay?

235
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,582
Her prescription.

236
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:45,502
It's a backup.
I keep an extra, in case.

237
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,330
Okay. Okay.

238
00:18:47,718 --> 00:18:53,630
Um... so all we need to
do is find a pharmacy.

239
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,470
Don't worry.

240
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:02,100
Hey, looks like we're going on a ride,
sweet pea.

241
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,472
Look, we nail Bagwell,

242
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,181
he might still have some
of Geary's things on him,

243
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,823
like his backpack,
which has his personal stuff in it.

244
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,111
I know his wife would
love to have it.

245
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,620
If we find Bagwell,
you can give it to her personally.

246
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:17,461
It's the least I can do considering
how you're helping me out.

247
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,571
Though some of the guys on the
force are concerned about...

248
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,622
- What are they concerned about?
- Nothing.

249
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,372
But you know what?

250
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:28,763
Why don't you tell me what you know,
we'll track down Bagwell,

251
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:30,433
we'll get Geary's effects
back to his family,

252
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:33,140
I'll make sure that everybody involved
knows that your help was invaluable.

253
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,382
I'll even recommend
that you get most of,

254
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:37,922
if not all of,
that reward money.

255
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:41,723
What is it exactly that the guys
on the force were concerned about?

256
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:45,351
Well, some of them thought that

257
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,563
you weren't being totally
upfront about your head injury.

258
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:51,443
I mean, to be fair,
it does seem a little off that

259
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,192
you didn't see the guy who hit
you smack-dab on the forehead.

260
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,490
You got me.

261
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:05,780
Geary and me had a little dustup over
how to go about finding Bagwell.

262
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:09,292
It got physical, and he hit me.

263
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,503
The two of us,
we fought like brothers.

264
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,461
I didn't want to rat
him out to the cops.

265
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:19,380
After the fight, we split up.
And then...

266
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,143
Well, you know what
happened to him.

267
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,851
I just wish to hell we'd never fought,
you know?

268
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:34,733
- Maybe then he'd still be...
- Brad, you can't blame yourself.

269
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:40,110
Why don't we refocus
our energy on

270
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,111
finding the man who
killed your friend?

271
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,992
That's what Roy
would've wanted.

272
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,312
All right, baby.

273
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:14,231
- Insurance card?
- Uh, no, I don't have insurance.

274
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,482
You're paying for dexamethasone
without insurance?

275
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:20,613
You got Medicaid,
Medicare or something?

276
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,203
Nope. Um, I'll just pay cash.

277
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:26,873
It's $125.

278
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:38,462
Excuse me?

279
00:21:40,348 --> 00:21:41,711
Excuse me?

280
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:46,012
Um, oh, sorry.

281
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:57,983
Sorry I don'have
anything smaller.

282
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:02,990
Um, I have to go to the back
to get change for $100.

283
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,030
So... I'll be right back.

284
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,672
- Right there! Hospital!
- I see it. I see it.

285
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,971
- Just get us there.
- No, you'll be caught.

286
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:26,221
Then we'll be caught.
I'm not gonna let you die.

287
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:31,432
Then listen to me.
You find Sara Tancredi.

288
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:37,771
She can end this.
It's up to you now.

289
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,123
Yeah, I want an alarm
out on a dark blue Sedan.

290
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,161
License: AE9268.

291
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:57,831
40 miles southeast of Los Carces.
Do it now.

292
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,213
Oh, come on!

293
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:08,681
What? What hospital?

294
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,972
He came in with a bad GSW.

295
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:17,392
Docs called us in.
He's in here.

296
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:19,980
We ran his name.

297
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:23,611
Came back with two federal drug
smuggling warrants out on him.

298
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:27,650
Heard you wanted to talk to me.

299
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:34,120
I got some information
the Feds want...

300
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,251
about Michael Scofield.

301
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,040
Like where he's
catching a ride.

302
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:44,710
And where would that be?

303
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:50,721
It's not just the
"where" but the "when."

304
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,683
That "when" is coming up soon.

305
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:57,100
But I want to cut a deal first.

306
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:01,980
Give us a minute.

307
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:15,203
Anything you want to say?

308
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,831
One day. That's all we had.

309
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:49,191
Back then,
when things were at their worst...

310
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:53,530
there were days I thought
I'd never see the sun again.

311
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:56,992
But he saved my life.

312
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:04,580
I just wish he could have
let us be a part of his.

313
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:10,802
Yeah.

314
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:22,353
I'll tell him. Okay.

315
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,773
Here's the deal.

316
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:31,870
All charges dropped and the
government picks up medical costs

317
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,741
until you're fit
to be deported,

318
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,743
all contingent upon your
information being accurate.

319
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,122
Where's Scofield?

320
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:44,673
No deportation.
I want citizenship.

321
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:46,711
Citizenship?

322
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:51,591
A little incentive,
and I want it in writing.

323
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:54,512
I'm so tired of playing games.

324
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,591
Well, start typing.

325
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:05,482
No external pacemaker.

326
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:09,862
Oh, this is a good one--
no morphine drip. Huh?

327
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,070
What are you doing?

328
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,530
FBI. Out. Out! Out.

329
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,793
- What the hell are you doing?
- Giving you a little incentive.

330
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,282
Come on!
Come on, you son of a...

331
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:24,793
And they found nothing?
Okay, thanks.

332
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:26,891
Well, your instincts
are great, Brad,

333
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:29,930
but the precinct actually sent a unit
over to Hollander's house today.

334
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:33,230
An anonymous caller said they saw
an intruder but no one was there.

335
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:34,672
Damn it.

336
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,930
If you knew about
Bagwell and Hollander,

337
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,341
why didn't you just head
over there yourself?

338
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,760
We couldn't find the house.

339
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:46,193
Really? It's listed.

340
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:53,402
Excuse me.

341
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:02,491
Thank you.

342
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:08,423
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

343
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:13,503
Brad, have you ever been
to the Fauntleroy Hotel?

344
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,353
- It's about 15 minutes from here.
- Never heard of it.

345
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:17,970
Well, that's strange,

346
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,521
'cause they found this
receipt in Geary's hotel room.

347
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,303
It's from your credit card.

348
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:27,683
I don't know how
that got there.

349
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:35,033
I think you're being evasive.

350
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:37,630
You should tell me the truth,
Mr. Bellick.

351
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:39,282
What happened to "Brad"?

352
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,331
About seven years ago,
I got my first homicide case--

353
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,300
a woman, pretty.
She was brutally attacked.

354
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:47,581
Animal boyfriend
left her for dead,

355
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,582
but she was still
breathing... barely.

356
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:54,461
But she punched into her cell
phone the killer's number,

357
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,553
so she solved the crime for us.

358
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:59,342
When we found the
receipt, Brad,

359
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:02,440
it was in Geary's hand,
his finger pointing to your name.

360
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,213
With his ounce of strength,
he told us you killed him.

361
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,390
Okay, listen. Geary and I found
Bagwell at Hollander's house.

362
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,652
We roughed him up till he
told us where he'd hid

363
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,361
the five million bucks we
knew he dug up in Utah.

364
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,972
When we found the money,
Geary double-crossed me.

365
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,113
He hit me in the head
and took the cash.

366
00:28:19,245 --> 00:28:22,251
I had nothing to do with Geary's death.
You hear what I'm saying?

367
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,121
I'm the victim here,
not that son of a bitch!

368
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:37,840
Come on, come on, come on.

369
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,090
Where are you at, baby?

370
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:47,811
Hey, uh, could you hurry it up?

371
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,721
It's just it's getting really late--
I got to get home.

372
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,860
Here you go.

373
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:03,741
And, um, that's $20, $40,
$50, and $20 is $70.

374
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:09,203
One, two, three, four...
five... seventy-five.

375
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,461
Excuse me.

376
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:25,640
You got to be kidding me.

377
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:36,732
Ma'am.

378
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:39,440
Afternoon, Officer.

379
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,990
Do you have any ID with you?

380
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:47,570
Uh, no. I walked over here,
so I didn't carry anything with me.

381
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:49,951
Did you? Where'd you walk from?

382
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:53,043
Is there a problem, Officer?

383
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,961
There's only a problem if you make one,
Ms. Franklin.

384
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,500
You want to tell us
where your husband is?

385
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,670
I don't know.

386
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:06,182
Place your hands behind your back,
please, ma'am.

387
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:18,403
Baby, I'm so sorry.

388
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,700
Oh, my God.

389
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,671
Where's Mommy?

390
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:46,660
Mommy, uh,
Mommy is going to meet us later. Okay?

391
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:54,763
- Yes.
- Where's the photo?

392
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:57,721
Bill, there was
a tactical error.

393
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,050
I don't want terminology from the
Cover Your Ass Handbook, Paul.

394
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:02,543
What happened?

395
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:04,920
There were
unforeseen circumstances,

396
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,761
things that could
not be predicted.

397
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:07,961
Where's Sara?

398
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:10,891
She's gone, isn't she?

399
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:20,452
Yes, she got away,
but there's no way that she could...

400
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:22,010
Bill.

401
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,302
I'm not going to let you die.

402
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,901
I love you.

403
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,681
You know that, don't you?

404
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:02,960
Too many.

405
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:08,571
Too many people died because
I wanted you to be free.

406
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:11,612
You couldn't have
known, Michael.

407
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,971
You couldn't have know it...
would have ended up like this.

408
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:16,130
But it did.

409
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:20,483
They wanted him.

410
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:26,342
They wanted him in the ground,
and they got their wish.

411
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:29,933
This thing is not going
to end here, Michael.

412
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:32,901
I know.

413
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:35,330
It's going to keep spreading.

414
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:39,393
Their hands are going to
get more and more bloody.

415
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:44,083
Well, the question is,
is the blood on their hands...

416
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:46,132
or ours?

417
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:55,962
I'm sorry, guys. We got to go.

418
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,502
Get back on with Border Patrol.

419
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,841
Call the Navy Reserve
air station in Dallas.

420
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:22,341
They've got planes on alert.
We need an intercept of a

421
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:25,511
white, single engine A-36 Beech
heading toward the border.

422
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:28,452
Call Mexico, get clearance
for an international pursuit.

423
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:31,402
Tell them if they got to take
the plane down, just do it.

424
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,643
Come on, guys!

425
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:20,840
Guys, come on. Come on, guys.

426
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,853
What?

427
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:29,070
We're staying.

428
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:32,193
- Ay, vamonos!
- Esperate, esperate, esperate.

429
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:38,012
Michael, this is what
we've been waiting for.

430
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:40,682
Maybe we'll see you
down there somewhere.

431
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,461
I can't talk you out of this one,
can I?

432
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:53,943
Well, I hope so.

433
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:55,380
Be good.

434
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,790
Thank you, Michael.
Thank you for everything.

435
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:08,112
- Take care, all right?
- I will.

436
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:09,882
Fly safe, papi.

437
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,243
Give 'em hell.

438
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,423
- Panama would've been good.
- Are you ready for this?

439
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:39,161
- Been waiting years.
- Good to hear it.

440
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:41,883
'Cause today is the
day we stop running.

441
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:57,913
- What now?
- We go back to the car.

442
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,820
I drive to a border town,
find a cell phone signal.

443
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:03,111
And dall Sara.

444
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:17,341
Where the hell are those jets?!

445
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:30,293
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

446
00:37:33,477 --> 00:37:34,873
Pull over.

447
00:37:47,418 --> 00:37:49,661
Oh, God,
they're going after Sucre.

448
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:52,412
They're gonna take him down.

449
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,730
- How'd they find out?
- I don't know.

450
00:38:00,296 --> 00:38:01,653
Michael.

451
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:34,503
I want to know what
the hell's going on.

452
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,823
If you could've arrested me,
you would've already done it.

453
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:37,932
I'm out of here.

454
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:40,213
Not really an option for you,
Mr. Bellick.

455
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:42,341
What do you got, a receipt?
He left it in his pocket.

456
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:43,721
A fight? Big deal.

457
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:46,313
I got ten pals in Chicago tell you
Geary and I threw down once a month.

458
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:47,373
You're right.

459
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:49,911
Any of those things on their own,
probably not enough.

460
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:53,741
- But when you add this...
- What the hell's that?

461
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:56,322
You left a message
for Mr. Geary.

462
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:59,833
You thieving son of a bitch,

463
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:01,531
you better get
down on your knees

464
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:03,403
and pray to God that
I don't find you.

465
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:05,442
Because if I do, mark my words:

466
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,371
I'm gonna gut you bow to stern.

467
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,162
You want to hear it again?

468
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:16,740
Now at this juncture, Brad,

469
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:20,352
things will go a whole lot easier
for you if you admit to the crime.

470
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:24,951
Now you listen to me,
you manipulative little bitch.

471
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:28,463
I did not kill Roy Geary!
You understand what I'm telling you!

472
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:31,703
Bagwell set me up!
Get your hands off of me!

473
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,531
Bradley Bellick,
you are under arrest

474
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,872
for the first-degree murder
of Roy William Geary.

475
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,412
You have a right
to remain silent.

476
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:39,611
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

477
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:41,691
You have a right to
talk with an attorney

478
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:44,472
and to have him present with
you when being questioned.

479
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:57,763
- President Reynolds' office.
- This is Agent Paul Kellerman.

480
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:00,593
I need to speak with the
president right now, please.

481
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:04,273
I'm sorry, this administration isn't
familiar with an Agent Kellerman.

482
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,553
June, it's me.
I need to speak with Caroline now.

483
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,113
June, if you don't put me through,
I'll make certain that

484
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:13,292
the president knows that you were
the one who did not allow me

485
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,220
to provide her with some very
important information. Now.

486
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,942
I'm sorry, this administration
isn't familiar with an Agent...

487
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,862
Please leave a message
after the tone.

488
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,820
Bill, don't do this.

489
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:41,880
I've dedicated my life to this country,
to Caroline.

490
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:43,943
Everything I have, I give.

491
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:47,592
Every photo, every file.
Get rid of it all.

492
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,271
Make him a ghost.

493
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,952
I've been a perfect soldier.

494
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,251
I've never asked
anything of you, ever.

495
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:58,501
But I'm asking now.
Bill, don't do this.

496
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:05,883
I don't see him.

497
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:08,881
Trust me,
we haven't lost him yet.

498
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,950
- Linc?
- Hmm.

499
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:20,820
- Stop the car.
- What?

500
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,152
We got to stop the car.

501
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:31,092
That's a radio
tower over there.

502
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:33,680
It must be picking up some
kind of analog signal.

503
00:41:33,817 --> 00:41:35,961
We got to get closer.

504
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:37,460
Turn around.

505
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,931
What about your
friend back there?

506
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:41,800
If we're gonna go down,

507
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:44,091
might as well go down swinging.

508
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:57,303
Come on, come on, come on...

509
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,810
We are in business.
It's going through.

510
00:42:06,287 --> 00:42:08,061
Come on, Sara, pick up.

511
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:34,432
Sara.

512
00:42:57,397 --> 00:42:58,700
Hello?

513
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,541
Hello? Michael?

514
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:05,010
Michael? Michael?

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
