1
00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:01,873
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:05,236
- So where to?
- Anywhere we want.

3
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:11,024
I'm not the brother you remember.
I've changed.

4
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:12,614
And I am gonna do something

5
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:15,573
that a lot of people are
gonna think is horrible.

6
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:19,664
And you just remember the
brother you grew up with.

7
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:21,620
She's not here.

8
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,591
- Yeah?
- The ship is leaving.

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,283
I'm already on board. Love you.

10
00:00:32,056 --> 00:00:34,120
Why are you telling
me this now?

11
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:39,720
If I had to it all over again,
I'd do it different, you know?

12
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:44,918
Collar bone and rotator cuff.
Six inches to the right, you're dead.

13
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,554
You've come so far.

14
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,323
How much further
would I have to go?

15
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,911
Well, you're lucky.
For this you only have to go to Panama.

16
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:53,670
- He found him.
- Where?

17
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:55,923
He just boarded a
plane to Panama City.

18
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,561
What the hell's he
doing in Panama?

19
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:58,680
You like wigs?

20
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,781
For the right money,
I like anything.

21
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:09,020
What about the message board?
The goldfinch thing?

22
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,641
There is a message from Sucre.

23
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,693
- Still running, huh?
- Says the Bag still has the bag.

24
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:17,080
He's in Panama City at
the Fin Del Camino Hotel.

25
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:20,091
If you're there and want to help
put that bird back in the cage,

26
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:21,443
let me know. Sucre."

27
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:23,500
See ya soon.

28
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:38,390
Michael!

29
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:41,170
Michael!

30
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,342
Michael!

31
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,563
Scofield...

32
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:10,590
one thing's for sure,
you're just as pretty as advertised.

33
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:11,942
Prettier, even.

34
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,430
You got to help me, please.

35
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,533
I'm coming for you.

36
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,462
Are you ready?

37
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:27,651
No!

38
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:41,762
You say a word, I'm gonna cut
your throat out, you old whore!

39
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,092
Scofield!

40
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:53,360
- Hello?
- Pam, it's me.

41
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:56,792
- Cam's napping.
- Yeah? How's he doing?

42
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:59,563
Good, it was his first
day back at school.

43
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,063
- That's great.
- Where are you?

44
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:07,190
- I'm, uh, out of the country.
- Is everything all right?

45
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,103
Remember how I always said
that the day would come

46
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:16,741
and I'd be done?
Leave the Bureau and never look back?

47
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:19,753
- Yes.
- Today's that day.

48
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:23,873
I have one more thing to do,
and once I do it,

49
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:28,790
everything is going to fall into place.
And I'll be done.

50
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,752
I hope you mean it.

51
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:35,450
Pam, if I didn't have this
job hanging over me anymore,

52
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:38,081
if I were free,
if I were free...

53
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,712
Alex...

54
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,532
I need to know.

55
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,323
I'm not saying no.

56
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:51,931
I will make this right,
I swear to God.

57
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:55,031
And you and me and Cam...

58
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,403
I have to go.

59
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,760
I never stopped loving you,
Pam, ever.

60
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:04,200
Just be safe, Alex.

61
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,602
- You in position?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,463
- I'll be there in ten minutes.
- Got it.

63
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:34,321
Es bueno?

64
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:35,710
Es bueno.

65
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,411
Gracias.

66
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,663
- Necesitas los otros?
- Son tuyos.

67
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:44,913
- Gracias.
- De nada.

68
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:55,581
- Michael...
- What's wrong?

69
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,813
Que paso, Scofield?

70
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:03,273
Come on. Move it.

71
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:10,220
I love it.

72
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:14,720
Mr. Above It All down here trying
to sniff out that $5 million

73
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,500
just like the rest
of us riff-raff.

74
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,513
See? You ain't no better
than me, Scofield.

75
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,472
I want T-Bag locked up.
It's the only reason I'm here.

76
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:24,140
Aw, Dudley Freakin'
Do-Right, huh?

77
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,160
I didn't know you were
gonna be here, Michael.

78
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:28,072
What are you talking about?
You e-mailed me.

79
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:30,141
You said T-Bag was here.
It's on the Web site.

80
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:33,180
What? No.
I didn't write anything on the Web site.

81
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,090
- To you or anybody else.
- Is T-Bag in that hotel?

82
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:40,951
Yeah, a couple feds staking
it out across the street.

83
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:43,612
Well, then you're gonna
help us get it then.

84
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,432
Maybe you missed the
part about the feds.

85
00:07:45,837 --> 00:07:48,563
I don't care. I didn't travel
2,000 miles down the diarrhea trail

86
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:51,853
to get to this backward-ass
country to not get my $5 million!

87
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:53,340
Well, that's too bad

88
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:55,501
'cause this is looking more
and more like a setup.

89
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:58,640
Then get that little college
boy brain of yours to work then.

90
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,271
And if you don't
think I'm serious,

91
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:03,611
just ask your old cellie
here what length I'll go to.

92
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:06,600
He's got Maricruz
locked away somewhere.

93
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:09,362
You're gonna help
him get the money

94
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,133
or she's dead.

95
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:15,412
Yeah, I'm a big jerk, Scofield.
Shame on me.

96
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:20,150
Michael, I'm in no position
to ask you for anything.

97
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:24,322
I need your help, papi.

98
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,700
I do.

99
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,602
Are you in or what?

100
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:09,030
- Get the gun off me.
- I asked you a question.

101
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,223
I said get the gun
off me or I walk.

102
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,470
All right,
you'll get your $5 million.

103
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:23,880
You get Maricruz,
and I get T-Bag.

104
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:26,701
- Win, win, win.
- But you got to do actly what I say.

105
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:31,520
Thank you, bro.

106
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:38,143
Alright, Einstein,
what you thinking?

107
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,533
And it's the third day of testimony
in trial of Dr. Sara Tancredi,

108
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,440
daughter of the late
governor Frank Tancredi.

109
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,632
So far, pundits feel the
prosecution is well on its way

110
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,031
to meeting its burden of proof

111
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,142
and getting a conviction
on all counts.

112
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,291
Defense counsel,
you may proceed.

113
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:01,272
Your Honor, at this time I ask this
tape be marked "Defense Exhibit D."

114
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,650
Objection. Your Honor,
this tape is the very propaganda

115
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:07,943
that Michael Scofield and Lincoln
Burrows released to the media

116
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,861
that was summarily debunked.

117
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:11,520
The jury still has
a right to hear it.

118
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,942
The tape is hearsay.

119
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,771
Unavailable witness exception,
Your Honor.

120
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,872
The witness is only unavailable
because he's a fugitive on the run.

121
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:19,450
Be that as it may,

122
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:22,691
his statement on this tape
exonerates Dr. Tancredi.

123
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:23,672
Your Honor...

124
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,692
The tape is allowed.

125
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:29,410
The State's objection will
be noted in the record.

126
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:35,391
Much blame has been placed
on another innocent person--

127
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,431
Dr Sara Tancredi.

128
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:39,861
She had nothing to
do with our escape.

129
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,103
Sara, if you're listening,

130
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,212
I know I can't ask
you another chance.

131
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:46,981
I only hope by now you've
found your safe heaven.

132
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:52,001
The trial of the late Governor
Tancredi's daughter, Dr. Sara Tancredi.

133
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,151
Continues today in Cook County.

134
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:57,581
Dr. Tancredi,
whose medical license has been suspended

135
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:00,973
pending outcome of the trial,
is facing multiple counts...

136
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:13,392
- I'm gonna kill him.
- And go right back to prison.

137
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:14,373
I don't care.

138
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:17,441
Once we get the money and he tells me
where Maricruz is, I'm gonna kill.

139
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:20,280
If you find Maricruz,
you're going marry Maricruz

140
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:22,203
and live happily ever after.

141
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,641
Yeah, after I sink a
knife in Bellick's chest.

142
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,261
Bellick and T-Bag will get theirs,
trust me.

143
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,790
Didn't Fox River teach
you anything, man?

144
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,570
Cause the same rules
apply out here.

145
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:34,998
It doesn't make a difference
if you're guilty or innocent.

146
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,074
- It's who survives.
- You're not that guy.

147
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,381
That son of a bitch took my girl,
locked her up somewhere.

148
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:43,421
I am that guy now, Michael.
Look at me.

149
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,202
The only reason I'm not five
miles away from here right now

150
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:49,292
is because I want to help you
find Maricruz, not kill Bellick.

151
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:52,293
And if that's your game,
I'm gone.

152
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:01,240
Believe me, I understand the
impulse to pull the trigger.

153
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:05,592
But if we lose ourselves,
we lose everything.

154
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:12,503
It's been a week.

155
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,091
I don't know where she is.

156
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:17,270
- I'm scared.
- We'll find her.

157
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,073
We'll find her.

158
00:13:42,215 --> 00:13:43,383
What the hell's this?

159
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:48,303
Atención, caballeros y damas,
este edificio esta en fuego.

160
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:53,522
Por favor, siguen hasta la salida
mas cercana en una manera cuidadosa.

161
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:18,493
Now, if you start
acting like a cowboy,

162
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:21,210
this whole thing's going south
real fast, remember that.

163
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:40,630
Here we go.

164
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,442
You're not going to like
how this ends, Lincoln.

165
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:16,462
I'm giving you a chance.

166
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:18,271
Right now.

167
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,570
Just... back away, all right?

168
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:24,342
Just back away.

169
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:27,851
From the son of a bitch
who killed my dad?

170
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:30,001
You're done.

171
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:58,863
Those bullet holes don't heal too good,
do they, Mahone?

172
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:01,772
Toss me the handcuffs.

173
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:07,140
Hand 'em over or I swear to God
I'll blow your head clean off.

174
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:34,371
Americans?

175
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:39,010
Oh, thank, God. Do you know
where the Cathedral Guadalupe is?

176
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:40,290
Never heard of it.

177
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,930
I was supposed to meet my old
lady there a half hour ago.

178
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:43,610
That's great.

179
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,713
They say you can't miss it,
but I missed it.

180
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,352
I was wondering you had maybe a
travel guide or something on you?

181
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:49,981
Why don't you just
keep on walking, pal?

182
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,760
Well, excuse me for
thinking I could ask

183
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,700
for a little help from
some fellow Americans.

184
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,110
Listen, beat it.

185
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,561
So how we doing today?

186
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,791
Sucre, the gun.

187
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:09,872
Come on.

188
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:13,393
Get in the alley.

189
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,161
It is a global problem.

190
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:56,493
48% of North American lakes are
eutrophic. It's 53% in Europe...

191
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:57,750
- Kristine.
- Yeah?

192
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,142
- It's your brother, Paul.
- What, what's going on?

193
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:05,812
Hello.

194
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:09,612
He's in this building right here.
We got to move.

195
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:11,622
Let's see your I.D.

196
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:17,782
Feds?

197
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:23,161
No, if these guys were,
they'd be after T-Bag. You guys Company?

198
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:26,673
Come on, Sucre,
let's wrap these numb nuts up.

199
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,231
What are you guys doing here?
What do you want?

200
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,671
I don't like this.
Something's up.

201
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:44,553
Come on, Sucre, let's move it.

202
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,480
Now, let's go, come on.

203
00:20:58,176 --> 00:20:59,713
Let's go, Michael.

204
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,602
We know you're in
here, Bagwell!

205
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,682
Three to one...

206
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:38,312
do the math.

207
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:42,661
Okay, okay,
I don't want any trouble.

208
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,470
Slide the gun over.

209
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,283
We can work
something out, boys.

210
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,170
Slide the gun over.

211
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,052
Where's the money?

212
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,122
Who called the cops?

213
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:28,722
You got three
seconds, hillbilly.

214
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:30,353
- One...
- In there.

215
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:33,970
Get it.

216
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:37,860
You want it, you get it.

217
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,083
We don't have time
for this, Bellick.

218
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:42,341
Nothing stupid now.

219
00:22:43,727 --> 00:22:45,512
You're not playing a game.

220
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:47,790
Open it.

221
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:56,683
Sucre, move your ass!

222
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:06,203
Michael!

223
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:25,023
It's a trap.

224
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:48,862
Freeze, Bagwell!

225
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:56,901
Get the money!

226
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,791
You want the girl,
get the money!

227
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:15,582
Don't.

228
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:18,680
Don't.

229
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:20,872
We can work something out.

230
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:23,601
Move.

231
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:29,101
- Somos la policia!
- Aah! Innocente!

232
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,070
Sucre, we got to go.

233
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:34,140
Theodore Bagwell-- he's the one you
want for that dead chick in there.

234
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:39,732
Anybody speak English?
I didn't do it!

235
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:43,303
I swear to God I didn't do it!
No, please, please!

236
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:46,422
We can do a little
divvying right here,

237
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,151
then we'll go our
separate ways.

238
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:49,781
Sucre, I want you
to get us a car.

239
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,522
What's going on?
What's the plan?

240
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,150
I said, get us a car.

241
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,232
Looks like you've made
some friends lately.

242
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:00,632
I don't follow.

243
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:04,583
That little set-up back there--
just a little out of your league.

244
00:25:04,907 --> 00:25:06,832
Looked almost professional.

245
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:10,442
Let's say that's the case.
What's it worth to you to find out?

246
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:12,873
Because I am

247
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:16,343
in possession of some information
that you might need, pretty.

248
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:20,813
Okay. Tell me what you know.
Maybe I'll let you walk...

249
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:22,493
without the money.

250
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,863
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

251
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:28,760
You're gonna let me
traipse on out of here?

252
00:25:28,897 --> 00:25:32,381
Depends on the information.
Who's pulling your strings?

253
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:37,422
You know, I got a hunch you're
speaking with a forked tongue, pretty.

254
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:39,632
So I'm gonna tell you what,
we go someplace public

255
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:42,292
with a car waiting for me to leave,
and then...

256
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,802
then I'll tell you. Deal?

257
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,050
No.

258
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,361
Oh, my God.

259
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:19,513
Paul.

260
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,690
That is only the second time...

261
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,962
a weapon has ever jammed on me.

262
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,321
First time was during
training for Gulf One.

263
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,801
As soon as it happened, the commanding
officer, he got in my face and he said,

264
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:39,703
"Son, a weapon jam
on the battlefield,

265
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,430
you might as well
call that suicide."

266
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:10,701
Kristine, I've, uh...

267
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,190
done things...

268
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:23,253
Damn!

269
00:27:23,998 --> 00:27:24,642
Damn.

270
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:28,630
I love you, Paul,
whatever it is that got you here.

271
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:32,043
And there's a way out,
believe me.

272
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:37,353
My...

273
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:40,303
entire... my entire adult life,

274
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,141
I've followed orders...

275
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:46,541
And I did terrible things,

276
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,731
because I thought they
were right, and...

277
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:54,042
it turns out I did those
things in service of nothing.

278
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:58,543
So that's what I'm
left with-- nothing.

279
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,253
You have me.

280
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:05,630
Yeah, okay.

281
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:09,583
And you have a clean slate.

282
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:12,861
Anything. Everything.

283
00:28:13,198 --> 00:28:15,352
It's available to you
starting right now.

284
00:28:15,497 --> 00:28:18,212
- The things I've done, Kristine...
- Undo them.

285
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:21,680
Paul, there's always a way.

286
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:25,741
Maybe that gun
jammed for a reason.

287
00:28:29,118 --> 00:28:30,043
Come here.

288
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:45,472
Don't...

289
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:48,001
let your pride get in
the way now, pretty.

290
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:48,843
Save it.

291
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:51,771
Locking me up ain't gonna
help your situation none.

292
00:28:51,905 --> 00:28:54,352
I have information.

293
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:00,800
- What's the plan?
- We're gonna take him to the embassy,

294
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:03,490
we're gonna make
sure he's deported,

295
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,263
then we'll go looking for Bellick,
all right?

296
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:06,952
Si.

297
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:09,871
Meanwhile, I want you to
ride in the back with him.

298
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:13,751
I'm telling you, you are being
penny-wise and pound-foolish.

299
00:29:14,126 --> 00:29:15,103
Get in the car.

300
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:33,823
Pound-foolish. Pound-foolish.
Pound-foolish...

301
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,680
I'll tell her about the offer.

302
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:43,361
- Well?
- 12 years.

303
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,443
No.

304
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,262
No. The jury heard
Michael's tape.

305
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,183
They heard a
convicted felon lie

306
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:52,193
for a woman that he clearly cares for.
He's got no credibility.

307
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:56,211
Sara, we need to take a hard
look at what they're offering.

308
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:59,640
Due respect, Marty,
we aren't going to prison, I am.

309
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:02,742
They've made it very clear that they
want somebody to hang for this, Sara,

310
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,840
and unfortunately, you're the only
one they've got in their grasp.

311
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,950
There's no avoiding it.

312
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:13,943
This is the plea agreement. We can
walk you through it if you'd like.

313
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:17,200
12 years?

314
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:23,870
He didn't answer.

315
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,761
I certainly hope your brother
makes it back to that boat.

316
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,441
And if he doesn't?

317
00:30:31,817 --> 00:30:33,451
You should see yourself.

318
00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:36,033
You look like you're hanging
in there by a thread.

319
00:30:38,908 --> 00:30:41,203
I just want this over with.

320
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,311
Then you should never
have come down here.

321
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:49,953
In case you hadn't noticed,
me and my brother don't quit for no one.

322
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:51,920
Thank God for that.

323
00:30:52,846 --> 00:30:55,710
Because it's guys that are
accused of things like you are

324
00:30:56,037 --> 00:30:58,093
that guys like me in business.

325
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:01,382
Kept...

326
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,861
guys like me in
business, rather.

327
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,101
It's gonna end
bad for you, man.

328
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:13,121
Couple of things in
this world I'm good at.

329
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:17,430
One of them's looking into a man's
eye and knowing when he's beat.

330
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:29,033
- How far to the embassy?
- Just hang in there, buddy.

331
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:32,780
- And then what?
- We're gonna turn him in.

332
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,843
And how do we not get busted?

333
00:31:34,987 --> 00:31:36,860
Before we get there,
I'll pull over.

334
00:31:37,045 --> 00:31:38,540
We'll hog-tie him
with duct tape,

335
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,372
and we'll dump him out,
and hit the road,

336
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:42,660
and I'll call the cops,
tell 'em where we left him.

337
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,202
- Then how do we get Bellick?
- Don't worry, we'll find him.

338
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:47,733
Y'all ain't getting
within a mile of Bellick.

339
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:48,991
Nobody asked you.

340
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:52,380
He's got a point,
though, Michael.

341
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:56,283
- Just keep the gun on him, okay?
- I mean, if Bellick's locked up,

342
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:58,163
what's good the money
going to be to us?

343
00:31:58,397 --> 00:31:59,701
Buddy, I told you we'll fix it.

344
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:02,932
- My girl's life is on the line here.
- Sucre, you better pull it together.

345
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:29,981
Ambulancia!

346
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,560
Ambulancia!

347
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:41,532
Shh, shh, shh.

348
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:44,873
Easy. Easy.

349
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:48,083
Buddy, you're
gonna be all right.

350
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:09,721
Go get the money.

351
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,872
Please. Quick.

352
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,621
Venga! Venga!

353
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:18,240
Bueno. Bueno, bueno.

354
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:20,563
Por favor...

355
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:23,711
- Pressure. Pression.
- Si, si, si.

356
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:45,680
What exactly is it
that you want, Pretty?

357
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:56,990
I'm turning you in.

358
00:34:58,336 --> 00:35:00,210
Is that it? Really?

359
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:02,502
It ain't about the money?

360
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,652
'Cause, if it is,
you can tell me.

361
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,372
Ain't nobody here but us cons.

362
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:10,740
You can walk or get dragged.

363
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:13,620
But it's up to you.

364
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:19,061
No. See, when you had the gun on me,
I afforded you a certain respect.

365
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:23,250
But here?
Well, the scales are tipped back my way.

366
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:26,252
So I'm going to spell
out the present options.

367
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:32,671
Either we split this money,
and you can go get your legs tattooed

368
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:34,403
or whatever the hell
it is you want,

369
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,240
or they're going to find your corpse
slumped over that there chair

370
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,883
with your pants down
around your ankles,

371
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:42,641
'cause it's been a long
time coming, Pretty.

372
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:54,130
Well, I got my answer.

373
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:57,571
Whenever you're done yakking.

374
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:01,420
Bring it, bitch.

375
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:30,362
Who are you fooling?

376
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:34,670
You ain't going to kill me,
Mr. Michelangelo.

377
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,860
You ain't got it in you,

378
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:38,922
so why don't you let
me do the killing?

379
00:36:49,648 --> 00:36:50,523
All right.

380
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,061
Thank you.

381
00:37:01,398 --> 00:37:02,791
Okay, Sara.

382
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:06,163
Now, here's how the plea
is going to go down.

383
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:09,582
The judge is going to need you
to allocute to the charges.

384
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,150
He's going to ask you if you
intentionally left the door open.

385
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:15,070
- You will say yes.
- Right.

386
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,222
Then he's going to ask you if
you gave support and comfort

387
00:37:18,407 --> 00:37:21,880
to Michael Scofield and Lincoln
Burrows since the escape.

388
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,430
You'll say yes.

389
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:26,710
And the sentence will be
immediately handed down.

390
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:29,561
The prosecution is asking
that you do your time

391
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,102
in a maximum security facility.

392
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:36,761
I think the judge is
going to agree to that.

393
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:41,401
Okay. Um...

394
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:49,182
With good behavior, how many years of
my sentence can I expect to serve?

395
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,332
On a 12 year sentence?

396
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:54,590
You'll do nine years.

397
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:00,261
I'll be out before I'm 40.

398
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm sorry, Sara.

399
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,752
Sara? Are you ready for this?

400
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,480
What?

401
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:11,870
A very credible witness
has just came forward,

402
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,060
and he's willing to testify.

403
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:16,882
He'll corroborate everything
you've said about this conspiracy.

404
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,140
Who?

405
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:52,631
Help!

406
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:16,203
Linc!

407
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:31,731
Linc!

408
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:48,202
Hola. Uh... Do you...
do you speak English?

409
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,571
Good. Good. I need to, uh...

410
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:53,801
I need to get in contact with every
hospital in the Panama City area.

411
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:55,661
A friend of mine was, uh...

412
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:58,180
A friend of mine was
in a car accident.

413
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,020
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to call you back.

414
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:05,122
Linc?

415
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,543
I'm sorry, Michael.

416
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:08,873
What's wrong?

417
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:14,662
Hello, Michael.

418
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:18,471
If you touch my brother,
you're a dead man.

419
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:21,903
Oh, please.
You don't have to worry about that.

420
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:27,160
But, when it comes
right down to it,

421
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:29,443
he's just like you.

422
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:33,353
He has a heart that
won't kill a man.

423
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:37,350
Give me the handcuffs

424
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:40,020
or, I swear to God,
I'll blow your head clean off.

425
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:08,283
- What do you want, Alex?
- I'll tell you exactly what I want.

426
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:10,013
But first things first.

427
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:13,423
When the authorities
captured Bagwell today,

428
00:41:14,536 --> 00:41:17,820
the money was
nowhere to be found.

429
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:24,763
Now, I can only assume that
you've got the money...

430
00:41:25,876 --> 00:41:28,691
aboard the Christina
Rose right now.

431
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:30,561
It's an amazing plan, Michael.

432
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,281
Take the money, take the boat,
disappear forever.

433
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:35,740
But you...

434
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:39,563
are not the only one
that needs to disappear.

435
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:42,560
- You still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

436
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:46,551
Good. Because I'm going to say this,
and I'm going to say this once.

437
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:49,603
Bring me the money,
bring me the boat.

438
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:54,181
- You are out of your mind.
- Not really.

439
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:57,082
We both have something
the other person needs.

440
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,702
It all comes down
to this, Michael.

441
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:02,611
Your brother for your plan.

442
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:07,141
Five minutes.
That's what you have.

443
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:11,141
