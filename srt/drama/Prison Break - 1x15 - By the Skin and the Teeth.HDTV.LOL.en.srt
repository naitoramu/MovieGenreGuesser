1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,461
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:06,548
I'm through.

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,050
See you on the other side.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,805
It can't be done.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,514
We're not getting out of here.

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,507
There's only one person who
can really stop this execution.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,938
Would you talk to your father...
for me?

8
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,013
I'm the last person in the
world that my father listens to.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:29,571
The governor has reviewed your case.
He's not granting clemency.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,906
Let's proceed.

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,991
I came in here a man, give me the
strength to walk out of here a man.

12
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,838
Doctor... you can leave now.

13
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:19,935
It's him.

14
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,685
Mi... Michael...

15
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,605
What's he saying?

16
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,441
Michael... turn around...

17
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,818
It's him.

18
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,570
What do you think he's saying?

19
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,198
Michael... turn around.

20
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,686
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

21
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,939
What's happening?

22
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,610
What the hell's
going on in there?

23
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,107
I can't tell you how sorry I am that
you've had to go through all this.

24
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,239
Lincoln...

25
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,584
- What happened in there?
- Judge Kessler called.

26
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,795
- The execution's been delayed.
- What do you mean, "delayed"?

27
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,893
Apparently, some new
evidence has come to light.

28
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,883
- What evidence?
- I don't understand.

29
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,219
How long do we have:
one day, two days?

30
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,597
That's all the information I
have at the moment. I'm sorry.

31
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,892
I'll give you a minute.

32
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,519
You okay?

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,857
I need to know how
much time we have.

34
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,026
I'll go and see the
judge and find out.

35
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,490
You're with Michael;
you'll be okay.

36
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,869
- Did you see him?
- Who?

37
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,454
The guy in the viewing room.

38
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,330
No.

39
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,708
It was Dad.

40
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,380
It was Dad.

41
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,833
It was him; I know it was.

42
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,712
- That's not possible, Linc.
- It is possible. I saw him.

43
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,047
I don't know how
you could have.

44
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,978
There were only a half a
dozen people in that room--

45
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:45,012
me, Veronica,
and a bunch of reporters.

46
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,723
- He wasn't there.
- You don't know that.

47
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,683
I do.
I would have recognized him.

48
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,394
You don't remember what he looks like.
I do.

49
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,106
This is a man who took off,
what, 30 years ago?

50
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,195
Why would he come back now,
at the very last minute?

51
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,031
I don't know.

52
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,284
Why is he still alive?

53
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,580
It appears that some information was
anonymously slipped to the judge.

54
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,290
Anonymously?

55
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:18,128
It was your fat little friend, Hale.
If you had taken care of him sooner--

56
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,714
- It wasn't Hale.
- How do you know that?

57
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,549
If Hale had given
Veronica Donovan

58
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,646
anything that could have
gotten a stay of execution,

59
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,233
I think she would have brought it up
when she made her argument in court.

60
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,598
It didn't come from him.

61
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,195
Well, who else on
your end knows?

62
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,031
Who else on your end knows?
Why all the finger-pointing at us?

63
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,909
Are you sure that the leak didn't
come from your end? From The Company?

64
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,150
Hey, we are all on the
same team, remember?

65
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,569
Absolutely.

66
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,242
Just find the leak...
and plug it.

67
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,204
Thank you, ma'am.

68
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,918
One more thing--

69
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,755
the next time you're
in my office,

70
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,384
I expect you to stand when
you're addressing me.

71
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,803
Absolutely.

72
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:17,896
All I can tell is... I was working
late in chambers, I left at 11:00,

73
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,400
and there it was,
right under my door.

74
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,027
One is Terrence Steadman's
autopsy report.

75
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,823
In it, his appendix is noted
as present and unremarkable.

76
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,786
The other paper is an operative report
from when Mr. Steadman was 12 years old.

77
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,706
The procedure was
an appendectomy.

78
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,680
- That's impossible. Let me see this.
- I want the conviction overturned

79
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,890
and Lincoln Burrows immediately
released from custody.

80
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,298
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast.

81
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,228
These records haven't
even been certified.

82
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,312
The hospital can tell you.

83
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,971
The hospital does not keep records
going back that far. I checked.

84
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,443
So, as far as we know,
these documents could be a hoax

85
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,475
from some anti-death
penalty advocate,

86
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,686
or, dare I say it,
defense counsel.

87
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,479
Oh, please.
You're preposterous.

88
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,896
Let's just all take a
deep breath here, okay?

89
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,453
I don't know what
these papers mean,

90
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,039
and, for that reason,
I'd like to err on the side of caution.

91
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,072
I'm going to delay the
execution for two weeks.

92
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:12,993
That should give us more than
enough time to exhume the body.

93
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,661
Exhume the body.

94
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,247
Your Honor, all due respect--

95
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,749
that is a drastic measure.

96
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,721
It's also the only way
we're going to know

97
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,296
if that body in the ground
is really Terrence Steadman.

98
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,471
So that's not Steadman
that was buried?

99
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,056
We don't know.

100
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,767
If it isn't, Lincoln's free.

101
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,520
If  it is,
we're back where we started.

102
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,563
Take care of yourself, Michael.

103
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,986
So that body--
what if it's him?

104
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,447
Well, I'm not going
to sit around hoping.

105
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,116
What does that mean?

106
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,119
That means we get back to work.

107
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,372
God, I was hoping
you would say that.

108
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,832
They're digging
up the body, huh?

109
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,587
To  be honest, I've never been in
a situation like this before.

110
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,799
If nothing else,
you can be glad that

111
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,761
you've got people who'll go to extreme
lengths to get you out of here.

112
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,179
No kidding.

113
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,265
Oh.

114
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,310
Warden... um...

115
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,814
at the execution,

116
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,149
there was a man in
the viewing room.

117
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,903
I was just wondering if you or anyone
in the prison had spoken to him.

118
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,408
Well... according
to this, uh...

119
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:39,162
those present were your brother,
his attorney, and three reporters--

120
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,039
two women and a man.

121
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,542
The man-- who was he?

122
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:48,881
Um... he was from the Headline Press.
William Prall.

123
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,133
You know him?

124
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,343
No.

125
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,102
Hmm. Guard.

126
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,906
Hold it steady, please.

127
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,439
What exactly are you
looking for in all that ink?

128
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,702
A new way out of here.

129
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,662
You know all those
plans by now?

130
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,122
No.

131
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,375
Memorizing it would be like
memorizing the phone book.

132
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,337
Yeah, but why not
just tat up Route 66?

133
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,963
Contingencies.

134
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,258
Contingencies?!

135
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,428
You saying you
found another way?

136
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,848
- Maybe.
- What do you mean, "maybe"?

137
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,019
There's always been another way,
but it's suicide.

138
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,574
Man, it's so cold,
my hands are stinging.

139
00:10:57,668 --> 00:11:00,308
You know what they say about
weather in the Midwest--

140
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,622
if you don't like it,
wait an hour.

141
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,679
We're still going out
through the infirmary,

142
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,598
and we're still going to do
it from the guards' room.

143
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,351
It's just the in-between that's
going to have to change.

144
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,561
Wait a minute.
Why are you changing plan, man?

145
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:16,488
We're already through that
room beneath the infirmary.

146
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:18,985
That's all we gotta do is to get
through that pipe and we're home free.

147
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,069
There's a reason they replaced
it with a 12-inch pipe, Darwin.

148
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,499
People can't get through it.

149
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,573
The only way we're getting into
that infirmary is from beneath.

150
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,772
We're going to have
to find another way.

151
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,400
The Psych Ward?

152
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,540
It's the only building that shares a
subsurface line with the infirmary.

153
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,113
You telling me

154
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,242
to get to the infirmary,
we gotta go through the whack shack?

155
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,817
Unless you got a better idea.

156
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:46,206
And there's a subsurface line that runs
from the guards' room to the Psych Ward.

157
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,541
Sort of.

158
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,835
Oh... what do,
what do you mean "sort of"?

159
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,141
We can go into that hole
in the guards' room.

160
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,821
About 40 yards up Route 66, there's
a grate that'll get us halfway there.

161
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,813
What about the rest of the way?

162
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,636
We  gotta do it above ground.

163
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,763
Oh, so just a bunch of cons

164
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,945
taking a stroll in the middle of
the night for all the guards to see?

165
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,767
Yep.

166
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:12,733
You're right. It is suicide.

167
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:20,532
This grate that you're talking about,
it's hidden, right, partner?

168
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,619
- The C.O.s can't see it.
- Not exactly.

169
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,372
- Well, where is it?
- You're standing on it.

170
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,043
Hell no!

171
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,420
When we come up on
that ground there,

172
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,505
that tower there...

173
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,799
that tower there...

174
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,095
that tower behind me
is going to see us.

175
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,693
We'll be like ducks on a shooting range.
You feel me?

176
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,517
Hurry it up, cons.

177
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,686
You plan sucks, Snowflake.

178
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,501
I gotta go back into
the walls tonight.

179
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,335
Why?

180
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,848
I gotta get over to Psych Ward,

181
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,381
familiarize myself with
the pipes beneath,

182
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,843
make sure we can get through.

183
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,470
I don't know, Michael.
C-Note's got a point.

184
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:28,267
We come up in the middle of that yard,
we're sitting ducks.

185
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,853
I know.

186
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,657
Hmm... I might have an idea.

187
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:52,332
My family and I are more than
dismayed by Judge Kessler's decision

188
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:56,545
to allow the exhumation
of my brother.

189
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,134
This stunt by Lincoln Burrows'
defense counsel is an affront

190
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,970
and an insult to the
memory of my brother,

191
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,932
a good man who tried to make
positive change in this country.

192
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,977
This is being done in the name

193
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:16,815
of trying to release a
convicted killer from prison.

194
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,155
Steadman asked for a "green burial",
no embalming,

195
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,242
biodegradable coffin,
it's very environmentally aware.

196
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,038
Or smart if you don't want
the body to be identified.

197
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,836
We haven't hung in months,
and now you want a favor.

198
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,881
You know I love you, cous,
but that's a big ask.

199
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,508
I gotta say no.

200
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,427
- You can't say no.
- Whatever.

201
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,721
If my mom, or worse your mom,

202
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:51,225
knows I did anything in here to
get you in trouble, forget it.

203
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,989
I'm in prison, pendejo.
How much trouble can I get into?

204
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,938
A lot. Geez.

205
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,606
You owe me.

206
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,484
Like hell I do.
It's your turn, not mine.

207
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,028
Miss Mangene's broken window.

208
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,822
The Terrado sisters.

209
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,158
Your brother's
"lost" El Camino.

210
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,869
Oh, the church
collection basket.

211
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,412
The donkey.

212
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,626
Yo.

213
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,838
We took an oath, bro.

214
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,131
Don't make me break it.

215
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,334
Come on, Linc,
we want to catch batting practice.

216
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,516
Let's hurry. Take my hand.

217
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,109
Great seats, huh?

218
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,444
See #11 over there?

219
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,029
Keep your eye on him.

220
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,406
Watch him closely.

221
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,253
You got it?

222
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,297
Where is it?

223
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:04,965
Oh, he's cool.

224
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,826
You get caught with this,
they'll kill you.

225
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,556
Hey, I'm going to need
this back by morning.

226
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:14,989
They'll know if something
like that is missing.

227
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,935
And cous...

228
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,146
...now you owe me.

229
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,554
Hey, you dropped something.

230
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,515
Does that say "Iraq"?

231
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,059
Thanks.

232
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:13,742
Let's look busy.

233
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,287
What the hell?

234
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,040
Oh, sh...

235
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,544
Damn, bro, what did you do?

236
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,046
It's the cement we dug up.

237
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,974
My God, you cons are slower than
a spelling bee full of stutterers.

238
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,645
Y'all  think you can slow-walk this job,
play grab-ass in here?

239
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,730
Drag it out for months?

240
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,148
Get to work.

241
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,775
You got it, boss.

242
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,696
How about it, eight ball?

243
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,575
Get to work.

244
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,205
Oh, you know, boss,
my leg just fell asleep.

245
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,040
You disobeying me, convict?

246
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,792
The man said get to work.

247
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,171
What the hell is your problem,
old head?!

248
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:11,383
My problem is young con punks who
don't know how things work around here.

249
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,343
Construction is a sweet gig.

250
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,096
You want to clean toilets,
be my guest.

251
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,141
- Otherwise, grab a hammer.
- All right.

252
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,854
Still got some piss and vinegar
in those old veins, huh, Charles?

253
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,273
I like it.

254
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,408
Close one, huh?

255
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,206
Whoa.

256
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,295
Oh, man.

257
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,430
What are we gonna do with this?

258
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,135
It was Ole Miss,
right, Ole Miss?

259
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,387
Nah, it was a
Midwestern school.

260
00:18:57,513 --> 00:19:01,183
- Iowa.
- No, not Iowa. Hold on a second.

261
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,143
Hey, Bagwell.

262
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,780
Hey, do you know what school
Art Schlichter played for?

263
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,701
Not really sure there, boss.

264
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:29,127
I really ain't much of a football guy,
boss. Too much violence.

265
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,058
Come on,
you know the guy I'm talking about.

266
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,227
Art Schlichter, the quarterback,
got nailed for gambling.

267
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,092
No, doesn't really ring a bell.

268
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,551
Bet if I asked you what his ass
looked like, you'd remember.

269
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,764
Maybe someone in the
brain trust knows.

270
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,935
Stolte, come on, man,
let's grab some lunch.

271
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,210
Hold on, I just want to figure this out.
It's driving me crazy.

272
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,773
Ohio State!

273
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:58,240
That's right. He was a Buckeye.

274
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,828
You're not completely worthless,
after all.

275
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,003
How's  your stomach?

276
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,796
Any more vomiting?

277
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,550
Just nauseous.
Must be the nerves.

278
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,635
That's understandable,
considering.

279
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,232
I can give you
something for it.

280
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,847
No, it's fine.

281
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,183
All right.

282
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,217
You, uh, you let me know if
there's anything you need.

283
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,024
Can I ask you a question, Doc?

284
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,734
Yeah. What?

285
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,151
With all that went down yesterday--
head pounding, heart racing--

286
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,710
could that cause me to see
something that wasn't there?

287
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,699
Uh, yeah.

288
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:44,578
Yeah, anxiety attacks are often
accompanied by flashes of light,

289
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,495
black spots...

290
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:49,416
No, no, no.
I saw someone in the viewing room.

291
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,960
There were people there.

292
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,977
This person couldn't
have been there.

293
00:20:56,507 --> 00:21:00,177
Yeah, Lincoln, you've heard of
post-traumatic stress disorder, right?

294
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:01,595
Yeah.

295
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,901
I'm going to call you
a prime candidate.

296
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,612
I don't think a lot of people have
been through what you just did.

297
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,228
So if you,
if you thought you saw someone,

298
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,993
it's possible that it was your
subconscious giving you what you wanted.

299
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,483
Whoever it was that

300
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:19,404
you wanted to be there with you
in that moment to comfort you.

301
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,410
Who was it you thought you saw?

302
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:32,376
Thanks, Doc. Thank you.

303
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,089
Sure thing.

304
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:53,146
Seen a lot of
rackets in my time,

305
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,328
but if you're doing what I think
you're doing with those postcards,

306
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,694
yours definitely
takes the cake.

307
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,083
Yeah, how about saving the small talk,
old head,

308
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,363
'cause you and I ain't
got nothing in common.

309
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:05,158
What do you do?

310
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:08,579
Write them here and then
send them to a pal in Iraq

311
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:10,706
and have him mail
them your wife's way?

312
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,710
Why don't you just
shut your word hole

313
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:16,849
'cause you don't know
nothing about my racket.

314
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,798
A con pretending he ain't
in the hole to his family.

315
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:23,343
I seen that once or twice,
but Iraq?

316
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,263
Yeah, you the one to talk.

317
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,183
Dede-- is that your
wife or your kid?

318
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,643
Now, you listen.

319
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:37,649
I don't even want you to say her
name in this prison. You feel me?

320
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:42,029
A daughter.
Definitely a daughter.

321
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,992
Ah, what'd you know?

322
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,494
'Cause I got one myself.

323
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,079
You know...

324
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,582
after you break
outside these walls,

325
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,878
that's  the first place they're
gonna look for you-- family.

326
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,672
Now, why is it you think

327
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:03,634
that I'm that dumb that I
would go directly there?

328
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,513
'Cause that's exactly the
first place I'm gonna go.

329
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,685
Turns out maybe we got
something in common after all.

330
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,075
See #11 over there?

331
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,576
Keep your eye on him.

332
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,036
Watch him closely.

333
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,666
Mid-level reliever at best.
But he's always working at it.

334
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:39,753
That's why he's your old man's
favorite player. Work ethic.

335
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,933
William Prall.

336
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,102
You know him?

337
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,692
The pipe system beneath
the Psych Ward is...

338
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:03,902
well, it's complex.

339
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,405
Be real easy to get lost.

340
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,410
- How complex can it be?
- Very.

341
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,623
When they build this place in 1858,
the pipes were lead.

342
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,585
A century later,
they discovered lead was a health risk

343
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,297
so they went to copper.
They never removed the lead pipes.

344
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,631
Cost too much.

345
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,354
There's thousands of yards of
the stuff still down there.

346
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,982
Then a few years ago,
they switched to industrial plastic.

347
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,848
Again it was cheaper just to
lay it over the old stuff.

348
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:38,312
If I make a wrong turn down there
tonight, I won't make it back by count.

349
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,482
You won't make the
wrong turn, right?

350
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,176
I don't believe my eyes.

351
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:17,804
One of the blues actually
coming into Psych Ward.

352
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,224
Yeah, I gotta hit the head, and

353
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,757
I didn't want to walk all
the way back to A-Wing.

354
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,728
Mind if I use your facilities?

355
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,438
Yeah, be my guest.

356
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,933
I don't know why you guys are
so scared of the whack shack.

357
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,791
I mean,
between the killers and the crazies,

358
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,281
I'll take the crazies.

359
00:27:36,365 --> 00:27:37,794
Because a crazy
steps out of line,

360
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,953
all I gotta do is shoot him
with 40cc's of "shut your trap"

361
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,829
and it's beddy-bye.

362
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,083
So, uh,
which way is the bathroom?

363
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,212
Down the hall,
through the door, make a right.

364
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,646
Hey, blue.

365
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,190
What you doing down there?

366
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,858
Hey. Uh...

367
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,527
I was just looking
for the bathroom.

368
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:01,987
Down here?

369
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:06,074
Yeah. You said down the hall,
through the door and to the left.

370
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,953
No, I said through the
door and make a right.

371
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,955
Ah. My bad.

372
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,250
Have a good night.

373
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,553
Blue! Hold up.

374
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:31,016
Don't you still
gotta take a leak?

375
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,811
Yeah. Which way was that again?

376
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:37,606
With decomposition
this extensive,

377
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:41,109
the most accurate identification
tool is dental records.

378
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,946
We made an imprint of
the deceased's teeth

379
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:47,366
and compared them to the dental
records of Terrence Steadman.

380
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,367
And?

381
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,035
They were a perfect match.

382
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,830
Thank you, Doctor.

383
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,556
That can't be
Terrence Steadman.

384
00:31:55,666 --> 00:32:00,212
If you like, you can bring in a
forensic examiner of your own choosing

385
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:03,382
to examine the body,
but I can tell you now,

386
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,093
they'll come to the same
conclusion that I have.

387
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,471
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,605
I hope you're proud of this.

389
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,736
You've gotten your
pound of flesh.

390
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,780
Are you done now?

391
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:30,993
Or would you like to hurt
my family some more?

392
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:33,036
Come on.

393
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,758
Hey, Mack, you there?

394
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,469
- Yeah.
- What's your 20?

395
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,775
Uh, I got to stop by
maintenance real quick.

396
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,139
I'll be up in a minute.

397
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:08,317
You okay?

398
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:12,905
I'm burned.

399
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,406
Oh, god

400
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,118
All right,
help me take this off.

401
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,882
No, it's, like,
burned into your skin.

402
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:20,662
Take it off.

403
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:23,051
Are you kidding me?
I can't, it's melted into your skin.

404
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,429
If the guards catch me wearing this,
I'm a dead man.

405
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,503
- Bro, it's just...
- Do it.

406
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:29,213
Please do it.

407
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,092
Ready?

408
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:35,761
One...

409
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:37,596
two...

410
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,472
three!

411
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,448
Michael, it's Sara.
How are you feeling?

412
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:57,991
Groggy.

413
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,118
It's the anesthesia.

414
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,333
Why did I have anesthesia?

415
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,335
We had to perform a procedure.

416
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:15,634
So you got so sick of
Scofield's smart mouth

417
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,387
that you decided to deep fry him,
is that it?

418
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,362
I didn't do anything to him,
I swear.

419
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,682
Let's review.

420
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,600
A locked cell.

421
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,395
Two inmates.

422
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:29,898
One gets branded like
a South Dakota steer.

423
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,151
You think we should call
Matlock in on this one?

424
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:36,780
Who's Matlock?

425
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:40,587
Fernando, you're only going to make
things more difficult if you
don't cooperate.

426
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,786
I told you I didn't burn him.

427
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:45,789
- I found him like that.
- You found him like that?

428
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,555
He was acting kind of weird when
we lined up for final count.

429
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,885
He was sweating, you know?

430
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:54,173
But he's not a big talker anyway,
so I didn't think much of it.

431
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:55,716
Middle of the night,

432
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,802
I get up, you know,
to shake hands with the president,

433
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,722
and there he is,
face down on the floor.

434
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,475
My... ass.

435
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:07,698
Ask him yourself when
the doc's done with him.

436
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,396
I didn't touch him.

437
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,861
Painkillers.

438
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,280
How bad is it?

439
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:21,158
Uh, I'd take the pills.

440
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,036
Do I get to see it?

441
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,747
No, the bandage stays on for now.
Take your pills.

442
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,877
Your cell mate do this to you?

443
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,797
Sucre? No.

444
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,008
Who did?

445
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,639
This is the part where
I don't answer you.

446
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,979
All right.
I'll have you sent back to your cell.

447
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:54,733
All yours.

448
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:07,411
Hey, Katie, it's me.

449
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:10,052
Listen, uh, can you come up
to my office for a second?

450
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:12,042
I got something I
want to show you.

451
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,002
What the hell am
I going to do now?

452
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,128
I'm a dead man.

453
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,339
I'm sorry, cous.
It was an accident.

454
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,270
Bull's going to see
this and flip his lid.

455
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,053
Hey, Slim!
You got my uni ready?

456
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,974
Um, there's been a bit
of a problem, boss.

457
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:29,142
What the hell is this?

458
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,270
I left the iron on it too long.

459
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,107
You are as stupid as you are fat,
do you know that, D-Cups?

460
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,985
My new shirt's coming
out of your kick.

461
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,397
You're going to
tell me right now.

462
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,366
Tell you what?

463
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:48,453
What the hell you've got going on
that's got you burning up guard suits?

464
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,373
Trust me, Primo,
the less you know, the better.

465
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,803
Any news?

466
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,556
No. No, not yet.

467
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,808
Testing takes a couple of days.

468
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,252
What do you remember of Dad?

469
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,189
- Your dad?
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:16,648
I didn't know him.

471
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:21,107
Your mom said some pretty horrible
stuff about him when we were growing up.

472
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,613
I think I saw him.

473
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,198
When I was in the chair.

474
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,283
Lincoln...

475
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,786
It was him. I know it was.

476
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:31,622
How would you know?

477
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,064
You haven't seen his
face in 30 years.

478
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,793
The name that was used--
William Prall.

479
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,503
So?

480
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,142
It's the name of this guy who
threw for Chicago back in the day.

481
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:43,422
Dad and me were really into him.
But I'd forgotten all about him.

482
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,928
It's really weird.

483
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:49,097
Been having these
dreams, memories,

484
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:52,142
things I guess I suppressed
when he left, but...

485
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:56,146
This man who came
to the execution,

486
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,106
how do you know he
used that name?

487
00:39:58,315 --> 00:39:59,399
Pope told me.

488
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,069
Was that before or
after you had the dream?

489
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:07,032
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

490
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,285
I don't mean to challenge
what you're saying,

491
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:13,580
but your dad's been MIA
almost your entire life.

492
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,541
I know what I saw, V.

493
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:19,211
I know what I saw.

494
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:29,721
This is the security camera
footage of the courthouse

495
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:33,747
from the night that Judge Kessler got
those documents. Now check out this guy.

496
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:36,603
He is very skilled.

497
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,690
He moves casually enough
to avoid suspicion,

498
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:43,652
and you see how he shifts his hat when
he turns corners to hide his face?

499
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:46,572
He knows exactly where
those cameras are.

500
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,368
Wait. Right there.

501
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:54,121
See that reflection?
Rewind it, rewind it.

502
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,959
Right, can you blow that up?

503
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,347
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

504
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:15,517
I know that guy.

505
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:21,815
What is it?

506
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:24,499
It was fused into
Michael Scofield's skin.

507
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,707
I removed it during the
debridement procedure.

508
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,030
What about it?

509
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,930
Well, this fabric doesn't come from
a standard issue prison uniform.

510
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,452
Where'd it come from then?

511
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,787
As far as I can tell,
a guard's uniform.

512
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,385
Open on 40!

513
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:55,891
Close 40!

514
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,021
How you feeling?

515
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,050
What's wrong?

516
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,011
The blueprints--

517
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:37,329
the ones we need to get from the
Psych Ward to the infirmary...

518
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,102
our map out of here...

519
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:43,438
they're gone.

520
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:49,938
