1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,103
I didn't kill that
man, Michael.

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,173
If you didn't kill
Terrence Steadman,

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,890
how the hell did someone
make it look like you did?

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,898
- I'm getting you out of here.
- That's impossible.

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,928
Not if you designed the place,
it isn't.

6
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,244
Better be open, bro.

7
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,465
You're asking me
to break the law.

8
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,498
I'm asking you to make a mistake;
forget to lock up.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,417
We're in.

10
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,380
Who killed Terrence Steadman?

11
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:51,880
Nobody.

12
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,648
Terrence Steadman's
still alive.

13
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:54,884
Hello, Terrence.

14
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:56,430
Sound the alarm!

15
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:06,851
What's going on?

16
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:15,782
Hey!

17
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,911
No! No!

18
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:24,750
- What do we do now?
- We run.

19
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:34,881
The escapees, who were they?

20
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:36,721
Got a list right here.

21
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:39,050
Read it to me, if you could.

22
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:43,972
Michael Scofield, structural engineer,
five years for armed robbery.

23
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:48,233
Benjamin Miles Franklin,
former U.S. Army,

24
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:51,191
eight years for possession
of stolen goods.

25
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:58,283
John Abruzzi, don of the
crime family of the same name.

26
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,830
Life without parole for
conspiracy to commit murder.

27
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,493
Charles "Haywire" Patoshik,

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,501
60 years for
second-degree murder.

29
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,080
Fernando Sucre,

30
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:15,460
five years for
aggravated robbery.

31
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:19,050
David "Tweener" Apolskis,

32
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,850
five years for grand larceny.

33
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:25,972
Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell,

34
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:32,152
life for six counts of kidnapping,
rape and first-degree murder.

35
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:35,572
And Lincoln Burrows,

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,493
scheduled to die next week for the
murder of President Reynold's brother.

37
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:48,713
How long has it been since
they got over the wall?

38
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,621
8:00 last night.

39
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,342
Scofield-- he and
Burrows were brothers.

40
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:54,590
That's right.

41
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:58,342
And he's the mastermind
of this whole thing.

42
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:00,681
That's what they're saying.

43
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,431
I want everything
they've got on him.

44
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,763
Where are they?

45
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,220
What the hell is that?

46
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,891
Let's go.

47
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,541
All we got to do is make
it to the other side.

48
00:03:58,576 --> 00:03:59,193
What?

49
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:00,943
Make it to the other side.

50
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:05,490
Come on, guys!

51
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:10,872
Pick it up!

52
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:18,922
The thing is
gaining speed, man!

53
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,722
It's going too fast!

54
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:24,800
Go through!

55
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:26,051
- What?
- Go through!

56
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:34,772
Go!

57
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:43,821
Freeze!

58
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,572
I will gun you down, Scofield!

59
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,040
Where's the aerial
and the others?

60
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:09,010
They're back on the
ground refueling.

61
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,353
Son of a bitch.

62
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,930
Sir, Media's ready.

63
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:24,762
I'd like to, uh, talk about John
Wilkes Booth for a moment if I could,

64
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:26,881
Abraham Lincoln's killer.

65
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:30,931
12 days,
that's how long it took to find him.

66
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,151
In his journal during this period,
he wrote that

67
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,893
the shadow was his friend,
the night his domain.

68
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,023
He acknowledged that
whatever neuroses

69
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:43,612
drove the criminal to commit the
original crime is compounded,

70
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:50,570
magnified by flight,
by the sounds of dogs at his heels.

71
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,452
Fear becomes paranoia,

72
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:56,751
paranoia ultimately psychosis.

73
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,871
I bring this up,
because, in 140 years,

74
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:05,053
the fundamental mind of the
escaped man has not changed.

75
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:07,380
The escaped man is still human.

76
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,763
He is still afraid,

77
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,472
and he will stop at nothing
in his attempt at flight.

78
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,433
Fortunately for us,

79
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:22,193
while our quarry has shadow
and night as his ally,

80
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:24,481
we have something far greater:

81
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,783
television.

82
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,113
I would encourage
everyone who is watching,

83
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,532
everyone in this country to take
a good look at these faces.

84
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:40,251
These men right here are now the
eight-most-wanted men in America.

85
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,803
I thought I thought this out.

86
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,852
You saw all those
guys back there?

87
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,641
The key is they're back there,
and we're up here.

88
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,362
Yeah, and how long is
that going to last?

89
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:57,280
Yeah, especially since we
don't have a pot to piss in

90
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:59,660
thanks to Abruzzi's
magically disappearing jet.

91
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:02,071
Hey, you were never going to
be on that plane, brother.

92
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,280
And don't think I don't know where
you were going either, Scofield.

93
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,570
- Where am I going?
- Oh, I don't know. Utah?

94
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,582
When were you planning on
telling us about the money, man?

95
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:12,821
What money?

96
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:18,081
$5 million that Westmoreland
planted in the desert in Utah.

97
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:20,762
You don't know what
you're talking about.

98
00:08:20,796 --> 00:08:22,660
You wish I didn't know.

99
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,631
Wait, wait. What money?

100
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:28,711
Warden?

101
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:33,103
It's a little early for the FBI to
be showing up, don't you think?

102
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,341
Look, I get it.

103
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,942
It's still your investigation,

104
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:38,783
but once those criminals cross state
lines, it'll become a federal matter.

105
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,320
Yeah, well,
that is not going to happen.

106
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:41,641
I hope you're right.

107
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,663
That's why I was going to
suggest that we cut through

108
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:47,060
any interagency politics from
the outset. Full transparency.

109
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,691
- Absolutely.
- Good.

110
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,823
Then maybe you can tell
me about Dr. Tancredi.

111
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,321
There's nothing to tell.

112
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,882
From what I'm hearing,
she may have abetted the escapees;

113
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:02,202
opened the door that
allowed them to get out.

114
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,410
Like I said,
there's nothing to tell.

115
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:06,141
You're not being very
transparent, Warden.

116
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,343
Look, I don't discuss my staff.

117
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:12,631
Maybe you should, because she
may be the key to this thing.

118
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,681
We need to speak with her.

119
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:21,682
Right now, Mr. Mahone, she's not
going to be speaking with anyone.

120
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:30,190
How are we doing?

121
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,533
Well, the IVs are
hydrating her.

122
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,203
We got her on a naloxone infusion,
half milligram per hour.

123
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:38,313
What do you think
the chances are?

124
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:42,050
Well, we've done everything on our end.
It's really up to her.

125
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:47,173
Either she fights and lives,
or she quits and dies.

126
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,550
Hey! What do you think...

127
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,850
Do whatever thing
you got to do, man.

128
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,281
Oh, and... boy...

129
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:59,483
you call the cops,
I will put this thing right here...

130
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,743
...in your eye.

131
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:08,331
Thank you.

132
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,101
Structural engineer, huh?

133
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,913
Not the kind you'd expect
to get that much ink.

134
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:32,692
Not the kind at all.

135
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:37,073
How long do you think it'd take
to get something like that?

136
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,401
Hundred hours... 200.

137
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:43,492
Tattoo artist who gave it to him must
have spent a lot of time on him then.

138
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,953
I'll find out who it was.

139
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,543
- Mr. Bellick.
- Don't talk to me.

140
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,222
Fine, but it's going to make
collaboration kind of hard.

141
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,213
Collaboration? I got men
out here in harm's way,

142
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,173
and you're giving
press conferences.

143
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,590
The press is a tool.

144
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:03,400
It'll bring those men back
quicker than bloodhounds will.

145
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,018
We don't need you.
We're hot on these guys' trail,

146
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:07,994
and it's just a matter of
time till we nail them.

147
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:10,022
The problem I find
with being on a trail

148
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:14,101
is that by definition you'll
always be behind your prey.

149
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,823
We'll see about that.

150
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,831
I'm not armed.

151
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:29,972
You'll have to excuse me if I'm a
little short on trust at the moment.

152
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:33,960
I assure you, young woman,
I'm the furthest thing from a threat.

153
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,840
I think the Percocet
pretty much ensures that.

154
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:41,723
Good, then you won't mind if I
capture this moment for posterity.

155
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,512
Won't do you any good.

156
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,773
You don't care that someone's
going to be executed

157
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,321
for your murder while
you're just sitting here.

158
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:50,311
I'm not the one choose Lincoln
Burrows as the fall guy.

159
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:53,441
Who did?
Your sister, the president?

160
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,071
You don't understand.
I'm a prisoner to all of this.

161
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:58,403
Oh, come on.
You could have come forward.

162
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:01,333
You could have stopped this
thing before it even got started.

163
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:06,112
No, I really am a prisoner.
And now, you are, too.

164
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:09,160
The moment you let that
door shut behind you.

165
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,251
Didn't it strike you as curious

166
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,513
that there wasn't any
security out there?

167
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,221
The doors only open
from the outside.

168
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,510
The glass is two inches
thick, bulletproof.

169
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,890
There's no getting out of here,
young woman.

170
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,731
We got to dump them now.

171
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:43,030
Can't. They know about Utah.

172
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,110
All the more reason
to dump them.

173
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,633
If they get caught, they feds will
know exactly where we're going.

174
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:48,870
They'll tell them.

175
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:50,593
We just got to make
sure they stay afloat

176
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:55,623
until we're off in Utah,
doing what we got to do.

177
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,753
You really think the
money's going to be there?

178
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:03,143
Charles might have had a flexible
relationship with the truth,

179
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,720
but at the end...

180
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,051
at the end, there'd be no
reason for him to lie about it.

181
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:11,263
I figure once we bag it,
we cross over into Mexico,

182
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:14,891
take a whole bunch of bumpy second-class
bus rides till we hit Panama.

183
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:18,162
You really got a fix on
this dive shop thing, huh?

184
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:18,902
Yeah.

185
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:24,990
Right now, I wouldn't mind swinging in
a hammock for the next ten or 20 years.

186
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:26,713
We got half the
country after us.

187
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:28,781
We ain't making it
to Panama or Utah.

188
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,492
Not without help.

189
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,582
Veronica can't help us.

190
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,310
How can you say that?
We don't have money, clothes...

191
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,083
I already got all that.

192
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,810
I thought the plan
was Abruzzi's jet.

193
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:42,670
Abruzzi's jet was Plan A.

194
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,172
- Then we got...
- Everything we need.

195
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:46,970
Where?

196
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,301
Storage.

197
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,151
Scofield designed the tattoo,
not you?

198
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,903
He brought the entire thing in,
every element.

199
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,680
I mean, look at it;
it's the freakin' Sistine Chapel.

200
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,250
I knew the guy was an
engineer or whatever,

201
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,243
but man,
his skill as an artist was unbelievable.

202
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:15,053
What else? What can you tell
me about him as a person?

203
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,621
Uh, he was cool, you know.

204
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,373
But talk about a detail nazi.

205
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:23,712
Everything had to be perfect,
exactly as he drew it.

206
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:25,523
I always sort of had the
feeling that the whole thing

207
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:29,382
was some sort of inside joke
that only he was in on.

208
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,812
- We have your number, right?
- Yeah.

209
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,643
I may be calling you.
Thank you.

210
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:43,773
Foley!

211
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:49,253
What was the name of that long
road we took to get to the prison?

212
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:50,823
English Street.

213
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:58,002
And out in front of the prison,
the two streets that intersect with it?

214
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:01,542
- Fitz and Percy. Why?
- Thank you.

215
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:07,381
- Saddle up.
- Where we going?

216
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,483
Somewhere where we can stop being
cons and start being civilians.

217
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,560
You know, why don't you cut
out all the riddles, Snowflake,

218
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,812
and just give it
to us straight.

219
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,892
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

220
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,273
Hi.

221
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,523
Hi.

222
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:26,113
Hey... little one.

223
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:29,480
- What are you doing?
- Well, uh...

224
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:32,910
We're just fishing.

225
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:35,870
With no poles?

226
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,541
Well, we like to
fish with our hands.

227
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,293
Yes, eh... hand-fishing.

228
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:48,671
I think the question is,
what are you doing out here?

229
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,420
Hunting.

230
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,380
Gracie?

231
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,011
Gracie, get away.

232
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

233
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,140
You're those guys
from Fox River.

234
00:16:59,147 --> 00:17:02,230
Don't any of you move
a freakin' muscle.

235
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:08,611
Get away from her.

236
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:09,902
Get away from her!

237
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,743
Okay, okay, just..
relax, relax.

238
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,240
Sir...

239
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,741
You stay where you are.

240
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:20,623
- Let her go.
- Put the gun down!

241
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:22,910
- Right now.
- You let her go!

242
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:24,332
John, let go of the girl.

243
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:26,293
- Shut up!
- Let her go.

244
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,841
Put it down. Drop the gun!

245
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,132
You drop the gun.

246
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:32,762
Drop it now.

247
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,180
Put the gun down.

248
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:37,302
One.

249
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,760
I'll pull the trigger.

250
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,561
Two!

251
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:47,150
Good boy.

252
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,362
Get the gun.

253
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,483
Pick it up!

254
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:55,503
Don't you hurt her,
don't you...

255
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:56,151
Hey!

256
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,871
You're going to be
all right. Okay?

257
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:03,911
Run to Daddy.

258
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:08,641
I ain't going to say anything,
to anybody, man.

259
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,813
You're not gonna get
hurt so just calm down.

260
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,602
- Where's your car?
- Up on the road.

261
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,131
I need your keys.

262
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,360
You're being considered an accessory
to this; you know that, don't you?

263
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,821
I know very little right now.

264
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:35,710
You opened the door
to the infirmary

265
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,990
that allowed Scofield to escape,
didn't you?

266
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:39,741
No.

267
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,921
Did you have a sexual
relationship with Scofield?

268
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,451
No.

269
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,122
But you had feelings for him.

270
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,752
Seven other men got out,
you know.

271
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:51,543
Who?

272
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:09,442
Oh, I am sorry, sir.
It's Saturday; we're not open.

273
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:11,560
Well, that's sort of the point.

274
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:13,610
Sorry, sir?

275
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,692
See, I'm going to
need some work done,

276
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:19,240
and I'm going to need
it done privately.

277
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,742
I'm sorry,
you said you needed the work done?

278
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,870
This is a medical clinic,
isn't it?

279
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,963
Well, of course it is,
sir, but for animals.

280
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:36,592
Oh, man, what happened to you? You
need medical attention. Sir, listen...

281
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,552
I'm going to get an ambulance.

282
00:19:41,686 --> 00:19:44,890
Nobody's going to be doing
any calling here, Doctor.

283
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:48,100
- Fine.
- That's right.

284
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,480
What do you want?

285
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,610
You know what? That's it.

286
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,880
I want Eye-Tie out of
the car right now, man.

287
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:05,032
That was a little girl!
Don't you have a heart?

288
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:08,580
God! I have a daughter.
I have a little girl!

289
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:14,630
I got one, too.
But if I hadn't done what I had to do,

290
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:17,920
we wouldn't be on our way to
see 'em right now, would we?

291
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,922
Turn right up there.

292
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:22,052
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.
Where we going?

293
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:23,552
Oswego.

294
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:27,560
That's west, man. We need to go east.
My family's back in Chicago.

295
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:30,060
And you think the cops
don't know about it?

296
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,610
You think they're not
just sitting there,

297
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:35,982
waiting for you to come
running back home?

298
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:37,982
What's the matter with you?

299
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,692
Well, what about New York?

300
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,993
- What about it?
- My girl's pregnant, bro.

301
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:46,330
Understand your love is
your weakness right now,

302
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,740
and they know about it.

303
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,910
Doesn't mean it
has to stop you.

304
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,162
You just got to be
smart about it.

305
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,541
Get to Oswego.

306
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,043
Oswego was not on
the way, Snowflake.

307
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:59,592
It's not where Oswego is.

308
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:03,552
It's what's in Oswego.

309
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:07,143
Captain, Scofield's credit
card transaction history.

310
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:10,991
Spent a lot of money here in Will
County before he was incarcerated?

311
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:11,850
Exactly.

312
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,192
He was from Chicago.

313
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,990
Why does a guy from Chicago
come all the way out here and

314
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:17,831
spend north of eight grand in all
these places in little over a month?

315
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,791
Car wash, voice mail,
storage, car rental...

316
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,080
- We got guys looking into it.
- Good.

317
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,041
Hey, Captain, what about the Feds?
Should we tell them?

318
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:23,971
What do you think?

319
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:24,832
Captain Bellick?
Captain Bellick?

320
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,710
We got something.

321
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,432
Hunter up by Tamarack just
ran into five of the cons.

322
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:37,291
So this is where
Scofield lived?

323
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:40,960
Yeah, up until about two months
ago when he was incarcerated.

324
00:21:44,556 --> 00:21:47,090
Mother's dead,
father's a deadbeat.

325
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:52,272
You got nothing in the whole
world but your brother.

326
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:01,782
So you plan.

327
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,251
And you scheme for months...

328
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,291
...till you get it right.

329
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,132
Every single element.

330
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:32,510
And then you destroy
all the evidence.

331
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:46,400
I want divers down
in the river.

332
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:52,031
You won't get cell coverage.

333
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:53,912
We're in the middle of nowhere.

334
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:57,000
Digital carriers
don't have cell towers

335
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,211
way out here in
Western Montana.

336
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,973
How about shutting
up, Terrence?

337
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:02,563
Just trying to save
you some effort.

338
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,381
They're like a web,
these people.

339
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,230
The harder you struggle,
the worse it gets.

340
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:09,131
Sounds to me like a coward
trying to justify himself.

341
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:12,261
If I stay out of the way and stay quiet,
I stay alive.

342
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,443
That's what they said;
that's what they told me.

343
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:16,323
And you're willing
to live like this,

344
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:19,071
in a hermetically-sealed box while
everything out there goes to hell?

345
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,403
Self-preservation is
a strong motivator.

346
00:23:21,986 --> 00:23:23,772
So is the truth.

347
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:28,403
Don't.

348
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:32,241
Young woman?

349
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:37,080
Do not.

350
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:40,583
Don't.

351
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,051
How you doing, buddy?

352
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,473
I'm pretty freaked out,
that's how I'm doing.

353
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:51,683
They took your car, didn't they?
1978 Grand Cherokee.

354
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:53,853
- Yeah.
- Which way did they go?

355
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,183
Up that way north
toward Oswego.

356
00:23:56,317 --> 00:24:00,143
Oswego. Pardon me.
Scofield's paperwork-- get it, Jimmy.

357
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:03,023
- The credit card stuff.
- Right here, Captain.

358
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:09,703
Of course.

359
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:13,360
Where is he going to put all
the crap you need to disappear?

360
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,741
We're going to Oswego, boys.

361
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,340
You have a visitor.

362
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,462
Thank you.

363
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:38,101
Thanks.

364
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,520
You look disappointed.

365
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:45,770
No. I thought you were
going to be my father.

366
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:47,652
You heard from him?

367
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,533
His office.

368
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:54,283
Well, brought you a
change of clothes.

369
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,412
- Figured, you know...
- Thanks.

370
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:00,662
And your purse.

371
00:25:01,296 --> 00:25:03,792
You left it in the infirmary.

372
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,381
I'm in a lot of trouble,
I think.

373
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:16,052
I, um...

374
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:21,141
I need to apologize to you.

375
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:37,411
They threatened my job
if I didn't talk, and...

376
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,911
No, no, no, no. No.

377
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:42,932
One thing you learn when
you're walking the steps

378
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:47,082
is that you never outsource a blame
that belongs in your own backyard.

379
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:55,183
Well, you're not the first correctional
worker that fell for a con,

380
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:56,261
trust me.

381
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:01,601
He never cared.

382
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,180
Not one bit.

383
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:12,693
What are you thinking about?

384
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,072
Mistakes.

385
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:18,660
You had to do it.

386
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:20,832
Not like I did.

387
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,250
I ruined her life.

388
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:28,221
Well, there's nothing
you can do about it now.

389
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:29,711
That's not true.

390
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,840
You fell for her, huh?

391
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:41,312
- Where's Oswego?
- Half mile maybe.

392
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:43,102
Good.

393
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:47,602
What are you going to do,
Terrence, shoot me?

394
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:50,152
Blow my guts all over this house?
Then what?

395
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,150
You can't leave, remember?

396
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:55,191
You kill me,
you're stuck with me.

397
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:59,281
- I'm safe here.
- You're a prisoner here.

398
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:01,411
But I'm still breathing.

399
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:04,910
If I go outside...

400
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:08,622
one step, I won't be.

401
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:12,790
You look at me...

402
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:14,511
like I'm the devil.

403
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:17,880
I gave up my family.

404
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:20,640
My teeth.

405
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,141
I eat Percocet all day

406
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:26,062
just to dull the pain of
my miserable existence.

407
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,191
You have no idea what
I've been through.

408
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,563
What you've been through?

409
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,531
This isn't about you, Terrence.

410
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:35,613
Don't.

411
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:41,910
Blackfoot Sheriff's Department.

412
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:45,583
Hello? Blackfoot
Sheriff's Department.

413
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:48,593
Hello. My name's Veronica Donovan.
I need you to send a unit

414
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:51,521
to the house at the end of
Light Road as soon as possible.

415
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,341
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but are you calling to report a crime?

416
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:56,381
Yeah.

417
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,973
By the President of
the United States.

418
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,012
Send the car.

419
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:05,142
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't think I can do this.

420
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:06,393
There are nerves...

421
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,141
Look, you need a
specialist, okay?

422
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:09,982
I don't...

423
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,871
You need somebody who
knows what they're doing.

424
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,992
I don't have the luxury
of choice here, Doctor.

425
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,373
My hand has been in that box
for hours now. It is dying.

426
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,241
Sir, I am not capable
of doing this.

427
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:19,741
I only have one hand,

428
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,542
but I could stick this in your
neck before you get to that door.

429
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,463
Now, if that's not
incentive enough for you,

430
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:26,513
I see that you have a Mrs.
Gudat out there.

431
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:28,673
With a name like that
in a county like this,

432
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,673
old Mrs. Gudat would not be too
hard to find now, would she?

433
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,042
Fine.

434
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:36,423
I can promise you nothing.

435
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:39,633
Story of my life.

436
00:28:40,477 --> 00:28:41,931
I'll have to put you under.

437
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,681
Do I really look that stupid?

438
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:49,273
Sir, I cannot do a procedure
like this without an anesthetic.

439
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:50,982
I have to cut away dead flesh.

440
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:55,062
Nobody can undergo a procedure
like this without an anesthetic!

441
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,190
I ain't nobody.

442
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:02,171
Schweitzer was the
plumbing company

443
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,882
that made the toilet Scofield
took off to get out of his cell.

444
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,493
Allen bolt was the fitti.

445
00:29:06,588 --> 00:29:08,290
It's all here, isn't it?

446
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,952
It's amazing.

447
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:15,722
Ripe Chance Woods. There a place
in the vicinity with that name?

448
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,060
Got someone looking into it.

449
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:19,761
DOC's moving on a storage
facility in Oswego.

450
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:39,443
Captain, manager says that
Scofield's got a lease on unit 164.

451
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,531
It's still active.

452
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,750
We got guys on 8th Street,
3rd Street, then the alley.

453
00:29:42,787 --> 00:29:45,131
If they're in there,
Captain, we got 'em boxed.

454
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,672
We push right up the gut, then.

455
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:49,342
Any one of them makes a threatening
move, put a hole in 'em.

456
00:29:49,377 --> 00:29:50,622
You got it.

457
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:53,752
Officer...

458
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,343
This is my collar, smart guy.
Back the hell off.

459
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:10,390
Close the door.

460
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:18,233
Still nothing on this place?

461
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,362
Nope. They're coming
back with nothing.

462
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,902
No place by that name
anywhere in this country.

463
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:27,740
Or any other country,
for that matter.

464
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:42,250
Let's go.

465
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,610
Son of a bitch set us up.

466
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:35,392
Not one word.

467
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:38,600
Officer...

468
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:45,903
Nothing.

469
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,360
Oh.

470
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,321
Oh, that kid's clever.

471
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,621
It's not a place, it's a name.

472
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,870
Your PDA, you got it?

473
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:58,831
Yeah.

474
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:03,003
Bring up the census
of this county.

475
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:04,882
Far back as it goes.

476
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:09,221
Somebody's going to see us.

477
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,550
Keep digging.

478
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,512
We're gonna go to hell, guys.

479
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:16,061
Swear to God,
we're gonna go to hell.

480
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:21,233
Help me out.

481
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:31,361
You are one sick cat,
you know that?

482
00:32:34,747 --> 00:32:36,623
What are you looking for?

483
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:43,251
We got to go to
the cemetery. Now.

484
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:51,650
Originally, this was supposed to be a
week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.

485
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:54,730
But, uh, figured you all need
just as much help as we do, so...

486
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,280
You're just doing this out of
the goodness of your heart, Fish?

487
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,813
That's right, John, the heart.

488
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,320
You remember what that is,
don't you?

489
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,111
Damn, Snowflake,
this is tight, man.

490
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:06,521
It's like I said, we got to stop
being cons, start being civilians.

491
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:28,093
Nice. Trousers are a little
bit too short, don't you think?

492
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:30,551
Chop your feet off.
You're good at that.

493
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,403
This jacket ain't exactly the best
thing, you know what I'm saying?

494
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,263
You want variety, hit Target.

495
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,523
Linc.

496
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:43,313
What do we got?

497
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,023
Money, passports...

498
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:48,822
pre-paid phone cards.

499
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:52,613
- Archie Ryan?
- Did you see mine?

500
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,361
Phineas McClintock.

501
00:33:57,378 --> 00:33:59,121
Whoa. These?

502
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:03,210
Keys to a car that's waiting for us
a couple hundred yards from here.

503
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:04,763
That a two-of-us or five-of-us?

504
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:06,541
That's a two-of-us.

505
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:10,003
- They know?
- Not yet.

506
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,763
Guy-Guy-Guys, we got company.

507
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:08,691
Guys, we got to roll.

508
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,060
How did he know?

509
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:03,033
We're civilians; remember that.

510
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:04,872
Civilians.

511
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:09,211
I'm sorry, uh.
Do you know what time it is?

512
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:10,541
No, sorry.

513
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:29,071
I can't go outside. They'll kill
me as soon as I show my face.

514
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:30,733
You're wrong about that.

515
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,701
As soon as you show your face,
this whole thing is gonna be over.

516
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:35,631
You can have your
life back, Terrence.

517
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:38,780
- Promise?
- I promise.

518
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,913
- Hello.
- V, it's me.

519
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,622
We're out.

520
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,753
Thank God you're okay.
I saw the news.

521
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:51,623
You got to stop.
I need you to turn yourself in.

522
00:36:51,755 --> 00:36:52,423
What?

523
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:55,880
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.

524
00:36:56,137 --> 00:36:58,302
You're going to be exonerated.

525
00:36:58,806 --> 00:36:59,973
Come in.

526
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:03,093
Steadman... What are you talking about,
you found Steadman?

527
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,793
Terrence, come on, let's go.

528
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:05,642
Afternoon.

529
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:07,221
- Veronica.
-

530
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:07,693
The police are here.

531
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,673
Look, I need you to
stay where you are.

532
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:10,562
Ma'am.

533
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:11,931
I don't want to lose you.

534
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,853
Ma'am, put the phone down.

535
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:14,901
What?

536
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,273
Mr. Steadman,
take a few steps back.

537
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,783
Ver... Veronica.

538
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:22,821
Veronica.

539
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:24,662
Oh, my God.

540
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,491
Veronica!

541
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,512
I thought you knew that all calls to
the local station are routed through us.

542
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:13,370
This is federal land, remember?

543
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:13,911
Mm.

544
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:18,462
And, uh, as for your little toy here,
it's contraband.

545
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,313
You gonna tell us how
you got it in there?

546
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:23,223
I brought it when I got here.

547
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,091
- Whatever for?
- To protect myself.

548
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:31,010
Mm. That's what we're
here for, remember?

549
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:37,371
There's a plan to make
all of this right.

550
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:43,880
In less than a day,
the trail has gone cold

551
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:46,193
in the pursuit of what
are now being called...

552
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:48,271
Yeah, that's fine.
Stay on top of it, all right?

553
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,060
DOC's still doing
a sweep of Oswego,

554
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,613
but the guys have
basically vanished.

555
00:39:51,646 --> 00:39:53,571
I wouldn't be so sure about that,
Mr. Ives.

556
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,403
I don't know how you
can be so confident.

557
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:57,530
It's not like these guys left
a map where they're going.

558
00:39:57,566 --> 00:39:59,523
Actually, that's
exactly what they did.

559
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:04,072
Scofield had the entire
thing on his body--

560
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:08,151
how to get out that prison,
how to disappear afterward.

561
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,072
That's all there.

562
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:13,953
I promise you that it's only a
matter of time before we know

563
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:17,793
everything that is
in Scofield's head--

564
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,711
where he plans to run to,
how he plans to get there.

565
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:23,882
So when the time comes
that he does get there,

566
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:27,171
we'll be waiting for him.

567
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:36,172
