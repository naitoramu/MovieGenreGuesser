1
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,574
Poor guy.

2
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:05,735
So I guess you know what this is,

3
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,696
Comandante Verdín.

4
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:12,951
We are going to ask you some questions.

5
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:14,995
Answer them,

6
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:17,956
and when you get to the States,

7
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,167
you get the full deal.

8
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:23,670
Immunity.

9
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:25,880
Witness protection.

10
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:27,674
Money.

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,636
It's the best and only
deal you're going to get.

12
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,266
And better than you deserve.

13
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:42,063
What do you want to know?

14
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:55,265
We know you were there.

15
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:57,287
You're on the tape.

16
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,914
We want to know who's in charge,

17
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,250
who was calling the shots,

18
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,127
and how high did it go.

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,796
Give us some names.

20
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:17,432
And if I don't?

21
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,601
We don't want to hurt you.

22
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:21,853
But we will.

23
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,823
The first rule of interrogation.

24
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,744
Keep the subject in the dark.

25
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,622
Make him think...

26
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:44,000
you already know everything.

27
00:02:46,544 --> 00:02:48,755
But I can see that you know nothing.

28
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:53,718
Well, here's what I know.

29
00:02:55,095 --> 00:03:00,725
That you kidnapped a
federal policeman in public.

30
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,854
You drove to this
location without detours.

31
00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:10,485
A total driving time of 14 minutes.

32
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:15,365
So I know that I'm very
close to where I was taken.

33
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,243
I know...

34
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:22,413
that you left witnesses alive.

35
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:26,126
Witnesses who heard
you speaking English.

36
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:28,211
Witnesses who will talk.

37
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,547
More importantly,

38
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:34,717
I know you lack the will
for what you're doing.

39
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:39,180
You couldn't kill even at
the risk of your own lives.

40
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:43,101
And now, you expect
me to be afraid of you?

41
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:50,275
So let me tell you
what is going to happen.

42
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:56,322
It is 7:00 a.m.

43
00:03:56,906 --> 00:04:01,244
My people will soon turn this entire
city upside down looking for me.

44
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,080
You cannot move me until dark.

45
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:07,667
I believe they will get
here long before then.

46
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,211
And when they do,

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,465
I won't have told you a thing.

48
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,511
You don't have me.

49
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:21,431
I have...

50
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:23,600
you.

51
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:19,984
Hey.

52
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,279
I'm looking for Don Juan.

53
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,198
Uncle Juan's inside, sir.

54
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,214
Good morning.

55
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,093
I'm looking for Don Juan.
Is he here?

56
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:46,260
Go ahead.

57
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,113
Wait here.

58
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,795
Good morning.

59
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:29,679
Try it.

60
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:32,890
Masita tamaulipeca.

61
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:35,475
Let's see...

62
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,397
It's very good.

63
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,566
You're being kind.
It needs more salt.

64
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:42,775
Try now.

65
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,034
Better?

66
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:53,744
Hand me a napkin, please.

67
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:57,999
Pleasure to meet you, Don Juan.

68
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,460
I'm glad we can take
this opportunity to...

69
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,920
To talk business?

70
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:04,922
And we will.

71
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,925
But first, we must talk life.

72
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:09,927
Óscar!

73
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:12,597
- Yes, Don Juan?
- See that this gets to the party.

74
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,682
Don't be eating any of it,

75
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:16,934
'cause I want to see you
stuffing your face tonight.

76
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:23,107
All right.

77
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,985
Let's take a ride. I have
something to show you.

78
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:27,820
Let's go.

79
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:38,414
Any money for us, Uncle Juan?

80
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:42,210
Not today, kids.
Don't have any on me.

81
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,462
Got any coins?

82
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,255
I don't have any money.

83
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:47,548
I owe you, kids.

84
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:50,563
If the señor will tell
us your destination,

85
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:52,446
- we can send men in advance.
- Give me a break.

86
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,200
It'll be a cold day in hell

87
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:56,158
when I fear for my life in
my own hometown. Let's go.

88
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:59,352
- Are you getting in or not?
- Stay here.

89
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:01,103
Yes, sir.

90
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,699
Who called you in?
Who was in charge?

91
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:22,291
Give me a fucking name.

92
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:41,936
This guy's ex-DFS, trained by the CIA.

93
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,814
How to interrogate and
how to resist it, man.

94
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:47,400
So you don't think he will crack?

95
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:50,987
Not betting on it.

96
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,823
The gringos don't have what it takes.

97
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:56,993
Well...

98
00:10:57,952 --> 00:10:59,954
I hope he does.

99
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:03,666
Fuck it.

100
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,793
It's a paycheck.

101
00:11:06,335 --> 00:11:08,671
Walt bails, I'll find another one.

102
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,883
Still got your badge?

103
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,761
Jalisco State Police, right?

104
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,306
Always pays well to carry a badge.

105
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:23,394
They give up...
and go home, this thing ends.

106
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:26,534
Pretty soon, people
start asking questions.

107
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:28,899
Who helped them?
Who worked with them?

108
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,569
That guy in there's seen your face.

109
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,821
So either he talks...

110
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:37,158
or you and everyone
you care about dies.

111
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:40,244
You got into this for a paycheck?

112
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,789
Man, don't be fucking stupid.

113
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,626
We're all in this with our lives.

114
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:29,919
It's called the Gateway
International Bridge.

115
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:32,421
I was 11 years old
when they finished it.

116
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,715
1926.

117
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:39,845
Five years later, I was
going back and forth,

118
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,391
moving alcohol across it.
That's how I started.

119
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:48,729
When the Americans
stopped needing booze,

120
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:53,442
we moved on to smuggling
other things, people, coffee...

121
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,154
opium.

122
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,910
An endless appetite.

123
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:06,580
The gringos always need something.

124
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:12,294
Who could blame us
for giving it to them?

125
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,680
It pays to have friends.

126
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,977
It pays well, Miguel Ángel.

127
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:31,605
Yeah.

128
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,776
You've done amazing
things here, Don Juan.

129
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:38,654
Which is why I've come.

130
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,699
The game has changed.

131
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,910
I believe that it's time
to rethink our relationship.

132
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,413
A union between our two
organizations would make...

133
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:49,165
Do you know anything about Rome?

134
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:51,417
- Excuse me?
- Rome.

135
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:54,795
Rome? Yes, of course.

136
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,132
They presided over the largest
empire the world had ever known.

137
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,217
A beacon in the world.

138
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:07,057
They conquered barbarians from what
is now Germany, France, England.

139
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:11,145
Rome bested these savages,
brought them under their own flag.

140
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,147
Gave them an identity.

141
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:16,722
Just like you did when you
turned a disorganized rabble

142
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:20,780
of Sinaloan dealers
into your own empire.

143
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:25,785
It served all of us to band together.

144
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,369
As a union.

145
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,706
I'm sure I wasn't the
first to think of it.

146
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,583
But the first to do it.

147
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,835
And that is a huge feat.

148
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:42,426
Look, Miguel Ángel, the
little I do know about you...

149
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,429
doesn't tell me very much.

150
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,726
When you want something,
you take it.

151
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:55,064
Nothing comes between
you and what you want.

152
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:58,734
But what a man wants tells us nothing.

153
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:01,111
What a man needs...

154
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:04,615
tells us everything.

155
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,953
I know that you want to
talk business, and we will.

156
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:11,705
If there is a deal to
be made, we will make it.

157
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:17,336
But first, I want you to know
who I am, what defines me.

158
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:19,839
What I need.

159
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:25,219
Hopefully, I will learn
the same about you.

160
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,252
Where's your boss?

161
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:03,257
He hasn't come back.

162
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,634
And not a fucking thing is
happening since he's been gone.

163
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:08,095
Even on the runways that are working.

164
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,392
One of Matta's planes
tried to land at Samalayuca,

165
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:16,770
but there was nobody there to unload it.

166
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,230
So they flew away.

167
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:20,232
Couldn't some of your
guys have unloaded it?

168
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:23,360
We're cops, man.

169
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:26,322
We don't handle that shit.

170
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,657
The one responsible for this mess...

171
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:30,618
is Acosta.

172
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,370
He's the boss.

173
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:34,747
He splits...

174
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,625
everyone splits.

175
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,753
That's how shit works in Juárez.

176
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:43,589
Yeah, I get it, but do you understand,

177
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:48,093
if we don't get this dump up and
running, there won't be any more shit.

178
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,345
You don't say?

179
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:53,807
We have to go out there, to
Ojinaga, and bring him back here.

180
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:55,851
- Got it?
- We?

181
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,187
Yes, we.

182
00:16:59,396 --> 00:17:00,898
Not we. You.

183
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,985
I have important federal
business back in the city.

184
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,236
What kind of business?

185
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,614
The fuck is it to you?

186
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:10,574
Call me when you find Acosta.

187
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,744
Let's get out of here!

188
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,568
Y'all got the best cocaine in the world.

189
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,052
We're the best chefs in the world.

190
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:32,513
This is my brother, Benjamín.

191
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,040
Benjamín, these gentlemen

192
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,437
came all the way from Los Angeles

193
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:38,727
to show us something marvelous.
You're going to love it.

194
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:40,104
Please continue.

195
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:42,106
Right.

196
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:43,357
So we cooking this up.

197
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,359
Whip it like stir-fry, you feel me?

198
00:17:45,943 --> 00:17:47,319
Got to be clockwise.

199
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,738
Hit it with a little bit of
baking soda to fluff it up.

200
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,534
Then you got the gel.

201
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:57,287
You let this dry.

202
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,498
I'm gonna sit this
back here for a second.

203
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,209
Let it cool. Got some
finished product to show you.

204
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:06,255
Yeah, so a couple
grams of coke cost $400.

205
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:07,756
It's not in today's business.

206
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,010
We don't got $400 in the hood, but
people still trying to get high.

207
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:16,849
I took your $400 worth
and made a hundred rocks.

208
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:18,600
That's $20 a pop.

209
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:21,437
$400 turns into $2,000.

210
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:25,065
You make more selling
Toyotas than Cadillacs.

211
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:26,989
This shit's spreading
all around America.

212
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:29,194
We'll have the West Coast
locked down in no time.

213
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:30,899
Yeah, man, that's great, that's great.

214
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,991
But to do this, you need a supply.

215
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,411
I mean, you can't be fucking
around with Colombians anymore.

216
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:41,290
You need it directly.
And we can give it to you.

217
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:42,541
If you say so, lady.

218
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:45,335
Looks like we have a
great opportunity here.

219
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:51,717
Please continue.
I'll be back shortly.

220
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,885
Thank you.

221
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:59,391
- Have you lost your mind?
- Excuse me?

222
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,186
Who do you want to kill us first?

223
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:03,812
The Colombians or Félix?

224
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,816
We don't deal directly with dealers
in the States. You know that.

225
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,276
And still you do it, Enedina?

226
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,112
For God's sake, I was
exploring the future.

227
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:14,156
Our deal with the
Colombians is Félix's deal,

228
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,659
and Félix won't hold on
forever. It's smart business.

229
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,578
It's not smart.

230
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:22,623
And it's not your fucking
place. Stick to your business.

231
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:23,957
- My business?
- Yeah.

232
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,186
- My business is this family.
- That's right, the family.

233
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,462
What the fuck are they
doing here? This is my home.

234
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,423
Francisco is getting out of jail today.

235
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,985
You should be planning his party,
not doing this shit, Enedina.

236
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,887
You're doing such a great
job, Benjamín. Look around.

237
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,097
Bravo!

238
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:44,019
We don't smoke this shit ourselves now.

239
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:45,437
But if you want to try it...

240
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:49,066
- He wants to try first.
- Yes. Yes. Yes, I want.

241
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,863
Come close.

242
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,741
You hear that?

243
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:01,411
That's why it's called crack.

244
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:03,580
Daddy like it.

245
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:05,749
Ramón, how is it?

246
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:14,633
Hey, our brother just got
out of jail in California,

247
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,802
and we're having a party
tonight. You should come.

248
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:18,679
- Yes.
- For sure.

249
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,931
Bring more of this shit, man.

250
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,147
Where the fuck is Acosta?

251
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:39,533
You telling me that none of you
motherfuckers know where your boss is?

252
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,035
I know.

253
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:43,912
Yeah? Well, where is he?

254
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:46,832
He's at Mimi's.

255
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,585
Where can I find this Mimi?

256
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,588
She's in Texas.

257
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:03,223
Interrogation is harder than it looks.

258
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:07,394
In the old days, people
didn't know shit about it.

259
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:12,608
The thinking was, cause someone
enough pain... and they'll talk.

260
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,484
But there's a lot more to it than that.

261
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,822
Sergio Verdín was a good
torturer. An excellent one.

262
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:23,493
And he used all his
skills on Kiki Camarena

263
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,037
to try and get him to talk.

264
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:28,665
So if you're feeling sorry for
him now that it's his turn...

265
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,792
don't.

266
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,211
He's got it coming.

267
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:39,051
Come on, man.
Give me a fucking name.

268
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,231
Ernesto Fonseca.

269
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:54,024
Caro Quintero.

270
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:57,527
Read the fucking newspaper.

271
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:01,490
Bullshit. They went down for it,
but we know it was Félix.

272
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,743
Who's protecting him?
Who's he working with?

273
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:06,662
Give me a fucking name.

274
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:45,367
There's his fucking truck.

275
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,952
Yeah, he's here.

276
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:48,078
Acosta!

277
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,420
Acosta!

278
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:02,718
Go around back.

279
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:04,303
But be careful.

280
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:05,762
We're in the States now.

281
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,810
Hey.

282
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:30,119
Motherfucker!

283
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,205
Next one goes in your fucking head!

284
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:35,500
Hey. Don't shoot.

285
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:38,271
- What do we fucking do, boss?
- Nothing, dipshit.

286
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:41,131
We're not going to shoot a gringa
in the States. Don't do anything.

287
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:42,466
Hey, lady!

288
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,092
Don't shoot!

289
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:46,928
Don't shoot!

290
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:56,355
Let me see those hands!

291
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,776
Hey, it's okay.

292
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,152
Hey, no shoot, no shoot.

293
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:05,572
No shoot, okay?

294
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,283
Pablo Acosta. Amigo.

295
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,952
Friend with Pablo. Okay?

296
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:16,124
Pablo! You know these guys?

297
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,714
Oh, yeah, I know him.

298
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,467
Hey, Amado.

299
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,311
Are you fucking kidding me? Were
you up there the whole time, asshole?

300
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:30,889
Yeah. I'm just doing
some roofing up here.

301
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,307
Roofing?

302
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:33,934
Why didn't you fucking answer me?

303
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:35,560
I wanted to see what happened.

304
00:24:35,644 --> 00:24:37,687
I could have shot her!

305
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:39,606
I don't think so.

306
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,192
Amado, this is Mimi.

307
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,153
Mimi, this is Amado.

308
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:47,447
He is always dressed
like this. Like a crow.

309
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:51,410
Stay here.

310
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,370
What the fuck?

311
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:55,163
There's been a delay.

312
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:57,290
I told you yesterday
to move this shit.

313
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:00,293
- Well, the trucks...
- What about the trucks?

314
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,963
The Sinaloans have them. Our
guys went to get them back.

315
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:04,566
The Sinaloans have our fucking trucks?

316
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,692
They reminded me of the arrangement.
They said they...

317
00:25:06,716 --> 00:25:08,635
I know the fucking arrangement, Néstor.

318
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,392
How long have they been gone?

319
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:18,103
Since last night.

320
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:19,563
- Cochiloco...
- Last night?

321
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:23,024
And you're only telling me now?

322
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,569
Are you fucking kidding?

323
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,904
Relax, brother.

324
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,907
Don't tell me to fucking relax.

325
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:34,244
Did that shit you smoked
already rot your fucking brain?

326
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:35,912
The longer this product stays here,

327
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:38,832
the better the odds of something
bad happening to it. We lose it...

328
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,416
we pay for it.

329
00:25:41,793 --> 00:25:45,172
If those fucking trucks
aren't here in five minutes...

330
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:47,716
What do we have here?
Okay, go in.

331
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,509
See, problem solved.

332
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:56,600
Close the doors.

333
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:00,520
What the fuck are you waiting for?

334
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:02,814
Now get this shit
loaded and out of here.

335
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,065
Yes, boss.

336
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:06,359
- Boss!
- What?

337
00:26:07,235 --> 00:26:08,635
I think there's something in there.

338
00:26:09,821 --> 00:26:10,989
What are you talking about?

339
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,539
Open it up.

340
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,376
- Fucking do it.
- Get moving.

341
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,140
I get it. Crazy Pig.

342
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,100
That fucking...

343
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:40,519
Cochiloco...

344
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:43,939
and those fucking Sinaloan monkeys!

345
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:48,443
They think this is a big fucking joke?

346
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,654
I will shove this up their asses.

347
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:53,865
We're done sharing our
shit with these assholes.

348
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,826
If they have a problem with it...

349
00:26:58,245 --> 00:26:59,704
I'll fucking kill them.

350
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:03,583
Néstor, get this fucking mess
cleaned up and ship the product.

351
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,086
Yes, boss. What should
we do with the pig?

352
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:10,173
Ramón, shoot this fucking thing.

353
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,136
What are you looking at?

354
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,513
What's so funny?

355
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:40,787
Mimi's like American royalty.

356
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,457
Her uncle's a senator.

357
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:47,126
Senator?

358
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
Yeah.

359
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,924
That's not a good thing.
You know that, right?

360
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:02,726
A person can't help
where they're born.

361
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,561
Or to whom.

362
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:08,023
Only how they live

363
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:10,483
and who they are when they die.

364
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:15,238
You're having very deep
fucking thoughts today.

365
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:18,700
So you've decided to die here in Texas?

366
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:23,954
Hey.

367
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,000
A drink? Hey, for me?

368
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,878
Get yourself one.
The bar's over there.

369
00:28:31,046 --> 00:28:32,672
Mimi was an art major.

370
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:37,010
- Who did you say I looked like, baby?
- Van Gogh.

371
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,762
That's right. Van Gogh.

372
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:41,389
He cut off his ear,
then painted himself.

373
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:43,058
Right?

374
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:46,186
Cut off his ear and then
painted himself, right?

375
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,563
Very interesting.

376
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:50,400
Hey, Mimi, do you think you
can give us some time alone?

377
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:51,900
I need to talk to Pablo.

378
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,236
Mimi knows about my business.

379
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:57,364
Say what you need to say.

380
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,453
Beyond the fact that...

381
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:08,750
one of Mexico's most wanted
traffickers is on U.S. soil...

382
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,958
you also know that
nothing is getting done

383
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,630
back in Juárez while you're gone.

384
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:17,175
Nothing is getting built.
Product isn't moving.

385
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,720
You see, baby?

386
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:22,681
They need me back in Juárez.

387
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:24,391
Of course they do, baby.

388
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,268
Mimi doesn't want me to go back.

389
00:29:27,352 --> 00:29:29,187
She wants me here.

390
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,107
Pablo should be able
to do what he wants.

391
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:37,320
I don't think Mimi understands
who you are and what you do.

392
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,406
I don't know.

393
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,282
Mimi understands a lot.

394
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:45,453
You need to stop playing house
and come back to Juárez now, man.

395
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:48,974
The Colombians will think we
aren't serious about our business.

396
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:50,959
Fuck the Colombians.

397
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:54,129
- I don't work for them.
- No, but you work for Félix.

398
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:58,591
New airstrips and storage were
supposed to be built by now.

399
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,719
And none of it's happening, Pablo.

400
00:30:00,802 --> 00:30:02,762
That's you and Aguilar's
shit. You handle it.

401
00:30:02,846 --> 00:30:06,433
No way, asshole. You run the plaza.
The men take orders from you.

402
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,036
There's a shitload of
business to take care of,

403
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,820
and the guys aren't
lifting a fucking finger.

404
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:12,856
Well, I got business to
take care of out here!

405
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,441
Fixing roofs?

406
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,360
I mean, in Ojinaga.

407
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,988
I'm not going anywhere
till it's resolved.

408
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:23,283
What could you possibly need
to resolve in that shithole?

409
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:26,035
Things you wouldn't understand.

410
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:27,620
Try me.

411
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,832
It's complicated.

412
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:34,335
Some trouble between
me and someone else.

413
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,134
- Who?
- My business. None of your concern.

414
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,475
You want me to get 50 men together
and pulverize this fucking guy?

415
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,854
Knew you wouldn't get it.

416
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,108
This is a feud between
families. Between men.

417
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:58,818
It's about honor.
And you have none.

418
00:31:01,237 --> 00:31:04,949
What kind of man lets a bunch
of sicarios do his work for him?

419
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,995
And who, besides ass-kissers like
you, would follow a man who did that?

420
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:10,580
I'm serious, man.

421
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:13,424
Whatever bullshit you gotta handle,
let's go fucking do it, right now.

422
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,627
I'm not going back to
Juárez without you.

423
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:27,305
To keep Kiki from passing
out during his torture,

424
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:30,683
Verdín and the good doctor
kept jabbing him with adrenaline.

425
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,143
Cute trick, right?

426
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:34,055
It's one of hundreds that Verdín knew.

427
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,064
And do you know where he learned them?

428
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:37,899
From us.

429
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:41,069
We wrote the fucking
book on interrogation.

430
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:44,113
In fact, we got so good at it,

431
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,033
we started our own special school,

432
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:50,386
where we could share what we
learned with our friends down south.

433
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:53,081
We called it... get this...

434
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:55,250
the School of the Americas.

435
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,003
There, we taught some of
Latin America's best torturers

436
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:00,922
how to be all they can be.

437
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,924
But the fucked up thing is,

438
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:04,884
while we were teaching
them our technique,

439
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,763
we were also giving them
ideas on how to resist it.

440
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:21,418
This ain't working, Walt.

441
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,735
You busted him up.

442
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:24,737
Probably broke a few ribs.

443
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:26,238
He ain't talking.

444
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,366
We gotta go to plan B.

445
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,201
I don't have a plan B.

446
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,663
All I got's a fucking plan A,
and without it, we got shit.

447
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:37,166
We still have a play. We wait until
dark, then we move him up north.

448
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,168
When he's looking at
real time, he'll crack.

449
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:42,422
We can't wait till dark. You
heard him. His guys are coming.

450
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:46,050
He was bluffing. Hoping
we'd get scared and split.

451
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:47,736
Didn't sound like he was bluffing.

452
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,972
Okay, so maybe his guys are coming.

453
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:52,891
But we take the risk,
we move him now,

454
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:56,019
show him what the rest of his life
in a cell in the States looks like.

455
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,743
We're good.

456
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:14,996
He's got us here, and he knows it.

457
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,081
What he knows is that he's safe.

458
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:19,208
That you won't hurt him.

459
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,462
- Not for real, no de verdad.
- You want to hurt him, de verdad?

460
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:24,923
- Somebody should.
- Yeah, well, we don't do that.

461
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:26,716
Well, let somebody else do it.

462
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,510
That's the American way, no?

463
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:34,807
Let's move him. Now.

464
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:38,102
We need a name.

465
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:42,023
We need the next name, the
guy that ties it all together.

466
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:44,609
We start this, you know where it ends.

467
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:48,363
Look, if he goes to the goddamn
States without giving us a name,

468
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:49,530
we got no next move.

469
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:52,617
All right?
At that point, we're out.

470
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,202
It's over for us.

471
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:56,329
This isn't about us, man.

472
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:01,209
We need the next name.

473
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,251
Now.

474
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:09,342
Danilo, give me your blade.

475
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,681
- What the fuck are you doing?
- This motherfucker's gonna talk.

476
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,683
Come on, man. Don't do this.

477
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,476
Ossie, come on.

478
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:24,190
Grab the block, bring it here.
Put his fucking hand on it.

479
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,692
This is your last fucking chance.

480
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,405
Put his fucking hand on there.

481
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:34,826
All right, look at me.
Who was in charge?

482
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:38,663
Who was calling the shots?

483
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:41,416
This is your last fucking chance.

484
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,835
All right.

485
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:04,814
All right, motherfucker.

486
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:07,650
Come on!

487
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:09,485
I'm gonna throw some
hot water on you two.

488
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:12,113
- Hello, Don Juan.
- No shame.

489
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:14,741
I'm here.

490
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,784
Good afternoon, Don Juan.

491
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:20,455
- Poncho!
- How's it going, boss?

492
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:22,331
Look at these beautiful horses.

493
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:24,375
Do you know how to ride one?

494
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,625
Yes.

495
00:35:25,668 --> 00:35:26,753
That's good.

496
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:29,922
There's a horse show tomorrow in town.

497
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:32,675
We provide many of the
horses for the children.

498
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,010
Esperanza!

499
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:37,221
Look who I brought you!

500
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,305
Woman!

501
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:41,017
Esperanza!

502
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:44,228
My queen.

503
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:47,065
So beautiful. Come here.

504
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:55,073
- My Esperanza.
- Nice to meet you.

505
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:57,784
- Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.
- Nice to meet you.

506
00:35:58,743 --> 00:36:00,703
So is that bridge still there?

507
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:02,497
Here we go again.

508
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,373
She takes it for granted.

509
00:36:04,457 --> 00:36:06,751
But we know differently, don't we?

510
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,420
Kids!

511
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,839
Now that Grandpa is back,
we can start.

512
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:15,009
All the kids are here!

513
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:17,637
- Grandpa! Grandpa!
- Here you go.

514
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,514
A little present.

515
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:23,392
Let's go have a beer.

516
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:28,064
Am I drinking these alone or what?

517
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:32,819
Tiring, isn't it?

518
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,615
The trick to overcoming torture

519
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:42,203
is not to think about the pain itself,

520
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,872
but about what it protects.

521
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,875
I don't have children.

522
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:51,504
I don't have a wife.

523
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,340
But I love my country.

524
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:59,762
And I know that you
are trying to hurt it.

525
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:05,518
So I prefer that you hurt me.

526
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:09,188
You love your country?
Bullshit.

527
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:10,432
And what?

528
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:14,485
The Americans give you your
honor because you work for them?

529
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,029
You're their trained monkey.

530
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:18,406
Their dog.

531
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:21,450
And when they go home,

532
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,662
they leave trash like you behind.

533
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:28,082
And they fucking laugh at you.

534
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,834
Nobody laughs at me.

535
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,419
Hey.

536
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:32,795
They do.

537
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:35,006
But that's okay.

538
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,925
Because when you and I meet up again...

539
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:40,052
in a room like this...

540
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,347
there won't be any laughing.

541
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:48,477
I will hurt you in ways
you can't even imagine.

542
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:53,399
I will find out what you care about.

543
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:55,860
Who you care about.

544
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,821
And then I will go to work on them.

545
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:01,741
Mom...

546
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:03,826
dad...

547
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:06,037
wife...

548
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:08,539
kids...

549
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:13,336
And when they ask me why I am
doing these awful things to them,

550
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:19,967
I will tell them, because Danilo
chose the Americans over you.

551
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,603
He's sensitive. Weak.

552
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:32,938
Walt...

553
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,066
this is the end.

554
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,902
You maybe have two hours...

555
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:46,035
- What the fuck?
- Motherfucker wasn't talking.

556
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,055
You know he's no use
to us if he doesn't.

557
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,639
- Now we gotta move him.
- Where to? The morgue?

558
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,750
Walt, if we lose him, we got nothing.

559
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:54,126
Kenny, leave him.

560
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,171
Stand back.

561
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:04,387
See, you've gone and gotten
yourself shot in the gut.

562
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:07,848
That shit hurts like hell.

563
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,934
But it bleeds slow.

564
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:14,272
You got about two hours
before it kills you.

565
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,316
That's not enough time
for your boys to get here

566
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:20,528
but just enough time for
us to get you some help.

567
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:25,658
You love your country so much,
you can die for it. Your choice.

568
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:18,753
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

569
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:40,274
Hey, beautiful. How are you?

570
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:41,984
- Fine. And you?
- Nice to see you.

571
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:44,070
- I'm very well. Thank you.
- Hey!

572
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,868
That's half the Brownsville
Sheriff's Department.

573
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:52,995
Off duty, of course.

574
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:58,459
- He's a very popular man.
- He is.

575
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,420
He has the respect
and love of his people.

576
00:41:01,504 --> 00:41:03,130
And their obedience.

577
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:04,673
I'm Juan Ábrego.

578
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:07,885
The nephew.

579
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:12,098
- I've heard of you.
- Really?

580
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,309
- Yeah.
- And I've heard of you. Of course.

581
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,479
Are you enjoying the party?

582
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,857
I didn't come here for a party.

583
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,276
I came to talk business with your uncle.

584
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,403
Yes.

585
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:29,281
You came to try to convince
my uncle to get into cocaine.

586
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,787
My uncle is an opium trafficker.
A lot of years in that game.

587
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,248
And for good reason.

588
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:41,127
He knows that product is safe for us.

589
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,461
We grow it.

590
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:45,506
Harvest it. Control it.

591
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:48,217
No Colombians to deal with.

592
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,261
No airplanes through Honduras.

593
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:54,390
But more importantly... no headlines.

594
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,727
Cocaine scares America.

595
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:03,274
And my uncle wants to
keep his American friends.

596
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:07,153
So convincing my uncle won't be easy.

597
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,990
And you? What do you think?

598
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:14,535
I think there is only one
reason not to get into cocaine.

599
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:18,956
You.

600
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,795
Stop the music for a moment.

601
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,650
The local children's choir

602
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:32,011
has prepared a song in
gratitude for Juan Guerra.

603
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:33,471
Go ahead, children.

604
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,654
They even sing in English.

605
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,719
I'm gonna need more.

606
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,999
Who hooked up Gallardo
with the government?

607
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,793
I don't know, man.

608
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,837
I didn't recognize anyone.

609
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:53,884
I'm sorry.

610
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:57,471
Now, please,

611
00:43:58,556 --> 00:43:59,890
get me to a doctor.

612
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:03,435
No, man. You're holding
out on us, I know it.

613
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,397
Just give me a name.

614
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:10,651
Just give me a name, and
I will get you some help.

615
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,990
I can't.

616
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,535
Do you think they're
gonna kill you if you talk?

617
00:44:20,411 --> 00:44:23,289
You are going to bleed to death
in under an hour if you don't.

618
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:25,749
You don't have a choice.

619
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:27,835
Give me a name.

620
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:39,805
Zuno. Rubén Zuno Arce.

621
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:41,389
Who?

622
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:43,642
Zuno.

623
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,981
He owned the house where we did it.

624
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:50,858
He knew everybody.

625
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,068
You know this Zuno guy?

626
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:55,404
Yeah, he's some rich asshole.

627
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:57,990
Very connected.

628
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,993
Related to people high
up in the government.

629
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:05,623
All right, man.

630
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,375
You done good.

631
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,003
We're gonna get you some help now.

632
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:13,922
All right? You hang in there.

633
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:30,105
- We got a name.
- Is he alive?

634
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,690
Barely.

635
00:45:31,774 --> 00:45:33,233
We gotta get him some help.

636
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,397
What we ought to do is dump
him in a ditch somewhere.

637
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:36,987
Not a fucking chance.

638
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:39,490
He gave us what we needed,
now we get him to a doctor.

639
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:42,159
Come on, Walt, man.

640
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:45,287
We can't kill this guy,
no matter what he's done.

641
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,293
Okay.

642
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:53,003
Fucking great.

643
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:44,430
And here is the guest of honor.

644
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:48,267
I think you're always
the guest of honor here.

645
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:50,143
Sure.

646
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,980
Do you know why?

647
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:58,861
Because I've been
doing this a long time.

648
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,716
What we've built here in the east
is nowhere near what you've built

649
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,116
in the rest of the country.

650
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:07,995
But it has all that I need.

651
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,956
And none of what I don't.

652
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:15,252
What you're asking
of me, of my people...

653
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,172
is a big deal.

654
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:22,468
We aren't barbarians.

655
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:25,012
I know that.

656
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:27,639
That's why I'm here.

657
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,725
Look, Miguel Ángel,

658
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,519
the opium business
has been good to us.

659
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:37,983
Lots of profits and
reliable users in the States.

660
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,276
Most of them undesirables.

661
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,445
Blacks.

662
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,406
Former soldiers.

663
00:47:45,741 --> 00:47:48,285
People the government
doesn't give a shit about.

664
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:53,749
It makes it easier for the
Americans to look the other way.

665
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,127
But cocaine?

666
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,797
What? Scares the Americans?

667
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:02,841
That's bullshit.

668
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:05,552
What scares the Americans
is how much they love it.

669
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,263
They're obsessed with that shit.

670
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:10,641
America will get its cocaine.

671
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:14,269
One way or another. Better
that it's through us.

672
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:15,854
Us?

673
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,232
Us?

674
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,319
My nephew likes cocaine.

675
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:26,657
He doesn't care that famous people
are killing themselves on it.

676
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,827
He likes the margins,
you know? How can you not?

677
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,748
But do you know why
we never got into it?

678
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,626
Because of people like you.

679
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:43,257
We saw what you did to your
partners, let alone your competitors.

680
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:46,677
And now you're inviting us in?

681
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:50,305
So I have to ask myself,
why am I so lucky?

682
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:55,769
A white storm is coming.

683
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:59,731
They will try to stop it,
but they will fail.

684
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:04,111
The Caribbean corridor
is closing forever.

685
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,779
No one can change that.

686
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:09,331
When that happens, we
will be the only way in.

687
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,995
With your eastern network
repurposed for cocaine...

688
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:15,122
fuck...

689
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,249
we can take full advantage.

690
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,210
What do you need?

691
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:21,503
A union.

692
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:26,216
More cocaine means more money.
A fucking monopoly.

693
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,427
Where we set the terms.

694
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:30,429
More money means...

695
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,472
- The future.
- Good.

696
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,808
What about the past?

697
00:49:36,018 --> 00:49:37,144
For example,

698
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:40,939
the thing with the agent, Camarena.

699
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:44,276
I have a lot of people on
the other side of the border.

700
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:48,196
They won't like me
being in business with...

701
00:49:49,406 --> 00:49:51,241
someone who killed one of theirs.

702
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,744
What do I tell them?

703
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,581
Tell them what everyone already knows...

704
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,043
the men responsible are behind bars.

705
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:07,174
That might work with people
who don't care about the truth.

706
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:11,011
Tell them that there is
more money to be made.

707
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,512
Money?

708
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:13,639
Is that all?

709
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,977
You have money, Miguel Ángel.
I have money. They have money.

710
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,688
You're talking about more money.

711
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,150
At a cost that I'm not willing to pay.

712
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:29,363
I'm sorry that you wasted your time.

713
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:30,739
Sit down!

714
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,493
You want to know what I need, right?

715
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,454
Okay, then, I'll tell you, Don Juan.

716
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:39,581
I need leverage.

717
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,794
I saw what you wanted me to see.

718
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,837
It's fucking great.
What did you say?

719
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,423
The love and respect of his friends.

720
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:51,593
The Americans put on a good show.
You have them in your pocket.

721
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,387
Impressive.

722
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:56,598
But don't act stupid, Don Juan.

723
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,476
You're small-time.

724
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,315
And so am I.

725
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:08,777
You told me...

726
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:12,447
that I brought my people, my
federation, out of the darkness.

727
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:16,451
Well, that's true. But the
darkness is still there.

728
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:19,097
And if the Colombians have their
way, we would slide back into it.

729
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:21,361
All of us. You too.
With all your friends.

730
00:51:21,362 --> 00:51:22,962
Your people. Chopping
each other to bits.

731
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:26,962
This whole country is
one step away from chaos.

732
00:51:27,587 --> 00:51:29,560
A fucking free-for-all
of independent operators

733
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:31,633
who think they can do it alone.

734
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,094
And the Colombians love it.

735
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:37,848
They would rather deal
with us separately.

736
00:51:38,598 --> 00:51:40,150
Play us off of one another.

737
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:41,951
Keep us under their
thumb by paying us slowly.

738
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:50,193
We're middlemen to them.
Baggage handlers.

739
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,157
We deliver their coke
across that fucking border

740
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:54,239
to more Colombians
waiting on the other side

741
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:56,642
so they can mark it up and
sell it for ten times the money.

742
00:51:57,909 --> 00:52:00,579
But we are the only ones
who can move their shit,

743
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,040
so we should be able
to rewrite the rules.

744
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,625
It's time we tell them
how it's going to be.

745
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:14,885
Finally, here's the man
I've been waiting to see,

746
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,887
the man I've heard so much about.

747
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,057
Very well.

748
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,059
And this leverage?

749
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,560
What would we do with it?

750
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:26,730
We force them to start paying us
in cocaine. We get into retail.

751
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:31,151
What'd I tell you, Juan?
This guy is a genius.

752
00:52:31,777 --> 00:52:33,445
Why would the Colombians
let us do that?

753
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:36,198
They won't have a choice.
Félix will have a monopoly.

754
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:38,492
When they want to negotiate,

755
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:41,328
fine, we'll negotiate.

756
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:43,580
What would we ask for?

757
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:45,791
We keep half the loads.

758
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,270
Then we start selling it ourselves,
up north, using our people.

759
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:51,630
How many Colombians in the States?

760
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:53,173
No more than 800,000.

761
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:54,466
And our people?

762
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,720
At least 15 million.

763
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:04,935
Well, I am impressed.

764
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,192
I have to say, I thought
I had figured you out.

765
00:53:12,275 --> 00:53:14,277
You've surprised me, young man.

766
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:16,238
I'm glad.

767
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:17,781
Just one thing.

768
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:20,033
You have a lot of enemies.

769
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:22,744
I get it.

770
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:28,208
But a man isn't defined by his
enemies. He is defined by his friends.

771
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:30,293
His family.

772
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,129
His people.

773
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,548
From now on...

774
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,135
my family is yours.

775
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,224
Partners?

776
00:53:44,307 --> 00:53:48,061
I need a few weeks. I want
my people to hear it from me.

777
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:51,189
But yes...

778
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:53,150
partners.

779
00:53:55,193 --> 00:53:56,945
That's great. Right?

780
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:58,655
We got it done.

781
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:14,796
Get out of the way.
Here I come.

782
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:19,467
Long live love, motherfuckers!

783
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:37,861
WELCOME HOME

784
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:40,071
Love the sign, bro.

785
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:41,489
Thank you.

786
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,325
I did it myself.

787
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:45,327
But you've gotta try this shit.

788
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,537
It's called crack.

789
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,080
Let me heat it up.

790
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:51,958
I spent 18 months drinking
wine made in a toilet.

791
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:53,877
Oh, no, no, no, no.

792
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,378
Hey, my little witch.

793
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:58,673
Welcome home, brother.

794
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,134
Popeye.

795
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,722
This is my man, David Barron.

796
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:06,932
He's from San Diego.

797
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:11,186
This motherfucker had
my back on the inside.

798
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:12,896
He's family.

799
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:15,523
Welcome to Tijuana, bro.

800
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,026
So from San Diego?

801
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,444
- Logan Heights.
- Oh, yeah?

802
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,489
Oh, shit. Take it.

803
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:23,573
You okay?

804
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:28,703
I know you ain't gonna
understand this, but...

805
00:55:28,787 --> 00:55:32,249
I'm going to tell you,
like a bad bitch told Tony,

806
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:36,002
Don't get high...
on your own supply.

807
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,256
That's Michelle fucking Pfeiffer.

808
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:42,634
That's Scarface.
Have you seen Scarface?

809
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:43,885
Scarface?

810
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:47,305
Tony should've listened.

811
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:06,491
What the fuck are you doing here?

812
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,828
Oh, Mín...

813
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:12,455
is that any way
to greet an old friend?

814
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,375
Come on, a kiss.

815
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,171
- If somebody sees you...
- Nobody saw me, don't worry.

816
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:22,632
What do you want?

817
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,349
To talk business.

818
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,522
Wipe that stuff off your face, Tigre.

819
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:40,734
Hey?

820
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:46,614
Get up. Get out of here.

821
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:53,038
Assholes.

822
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,418
Who are those guys?

823
00:56:58,501 --> 00:57:00,253
Sinaloan crew.

824
00:57:02,505 --> 00:57:04,341
Trash.

825
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:07,052
Ramón! Hey, kid.

826
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:10,055
What's up, Ramón?

827
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:14,184
- What are you doing here?
- This is our club. We own it.

828
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:15,894
You really didn't know?

829
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:17,812
Owners?

830
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:20,607
Oh, man. Thank God, bro.

831
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:23,151
I was worried it was a gay club.

832
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,196
Did you guys get my present?

833
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:30,075
You motherfuckers keep
our trucks all day,

834
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:32,535
fucking up our business,

835
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:34,496
and then you come here
and disrespect us

836
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:37,999
on the day my brother is released
from prison? What the fuck?

837
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,126
Hey, quiet.

838
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,711
Shut the fuck up.

839
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,631
We're sorry. We didn't know.

840
00:57:44,714 --> 00:57:46,257
You're right.

841
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:50,845
Cheers to your family, your brother,
and his continued freedom.

842
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,932
And I'm sorry about the pig.
It was a joke.

843
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:56,035
You can send it back
if you don't want it.

844
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:57,059
I shot it.

845
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:00,814
Can't take a joke.

846
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:04,692
Some dogs only behave on the leash.

847
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:07,070
Cheers, kid.

848
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:10,156
All good?

849
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:12,659
Got them on a leash.

850
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:14,911
- All good?
- Yes.

851
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:16,913
What's the problem? Let's party.

852
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:20,166
I have some cocaine to move.

853
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,435
I'd like to move it through your plaza.

854
00:58:25,338 --> 00:58:27,048
Talk to Miguel Ángel.

855
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:30,760
It's such a small amount.

856
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,720
I don't think Félix even needs to know.

857
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:35,265
Besides, I'd much rather
pay you for the privilege

858
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:36,808
than someone who...

859
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:38,518
has no faith in me.

860
00:58:40,353 --> 00:58:42,230
That is, unless you're scared.

861
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:47,902
I heard he threw
himself a birthday party.

862
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,237
Didn't invite me.

863
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:53,533
Made you all attend too.

864
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,161
Like peasants.

865
00:58:56,244 --> 00:58:59,497
Bro, I think maybe you
should come downstairs.

866
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,180
Look, the only reason
Félix didn't kill me

867
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:06,254
for the move we made against him

868
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:08,089
is because he still needs me.

869
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,012
The only reason he didn't kill you...

870
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:18,804
is because you don't matter
in the slightest to him.

871
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:24,314
For your sake, I'm going to pretend
we never had this conversation.

872
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,150
You can go out the way you came in.

873
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:28,485
Don't let anyone see you.

874
00:59:57,138 --> 00:59:58,264
Bring the stretcher!

875
01:00:23,998 --> 01:00:25,416
We brought you a present.

876
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,294
A toast, to your family.

877
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,421
To blood and the ties which bond us.

878
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:32,173
Cheers!

879
01:00:33,841 --> 01:00:36,135
And to Francisco Arellano Félix,

880
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:38,221
who sucked more dicks than any inmate

881
01:00:38,304 --> 01:00:40,431
in the history of the
California prison system!

882
01:00:57,865 --> 01:00:59,367
What?

883
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:04,747
Motherfucker!

884
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:41,659
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

885
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,800
Welcome back, boss.

886
01:01:58,301 --> 01:01:59,385
It go well?

887
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:01,679
It did. Very.

888
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:02,764
Good.

889
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,516
Did the señora eat yet?

890
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,354
She took Amalia to Cuernavaca
for the night with some friends.

891
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:13,940
Good.

892
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:15,902
Can I get you anything?

893
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:18,529
No, I'm good.

894
01:02:19,947 --> 01:02:21,574
Okay. Good night.
