1
00:00:00,647 --> 00:00:02,597
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:08,317 --> 00:00:10,065
Did you see the
guy in the mirror?

3
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:10,817
No.

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:11,902
It was Dad.

5
00:00:14,287 --> 00:00:15,521
I know that guy.

6
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:23,950
What is it?

7
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,083
It was fused into
Michael Scofield's skin.

8
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,121
Where'd it come from?

9
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:29,292
As far as I can tell,
a guard's uniform.

10
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:30,891
What's wrong?

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,831
The blueprints,

12
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:34,748
the ones we need to get from
the psych ward to the infirmary,

13
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:35,915
they're gone.

14
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:48,441
Hey, that's looking good.

15
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,840
You're making some
real progress.

16
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:52,688
The plaster adds
a lot of weight.

17
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,406
I may have to
add reinforcements.

18
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:57,400
Whatever it takes, as long as you
get done in time for the anniversary.

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,331
It'll be done. Hold this.

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,305
You know,
the Shah loved his Taj so much

21
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:06,078
that he built another temple just like
it on the other side of the river.

22
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,708
It was an absolute
mirror image.

23
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:10,559
Except it was darker,
it was like a black Taj Mahal.

24
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:12,446
Never heard of it.

25
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,733
Well, that's 'cause it
was never completed.

26
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:18,435
He was overthrown by his favorite
son before he could finish it.

27
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,664
- Sounds like a myth.
- No, it's 100% true.

28
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:24,654
I think.

29
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:28,734
Excuse me, Warden. Dr.
Tancredi is here to see you.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,243
Thank you.

31
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:35,912
Adams, please escort Mr.
Scofield back to his cell.

32
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,117
Doctor, what can I do for you?

33
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:44,634
Uh, actually,
it's about Scofield, sir.

34
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:46,841
Come in.

35
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:53,713
What about Scofield?

36
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,783
The burn on his back
is fairly serious.

37
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,438
He seems to be recovering.

38
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,295
At first I assumed he was being
assaulted by another inmate,

39
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,722
but it found this embedded
in the skin in his back.

40
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:05,650
What's this?

41
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:07,298
It's fabric.

42
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,895
Came from a guard's uniform.

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,340
What are you doing?

44
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:28,765
I'm trying to remember
those blueprints...

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,501
what we lost to the burn.

46
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:36,486
Without them, we'll never be able to
navigate those pipes beneath the
psych ward.

47
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:39,329
- Any luck?
- No.

48
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:44,441
I spent a lot of time
studying those blueprints...

49
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,663
tracing them night after night,

50
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:51,233
considering every possible
route to the infirmary.

51
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:55,065
It's like trying to take a test
you studied for ten years ago.

52
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,965
P.I.!

53
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,375
How do they get like that,
I got no idea.

54
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,745
I do.
Tuggin' on too many pockets.

55
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,356
She tug on your pocket?

56
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:26,118
I may be social, but that's a
boundary line even I won't cross.

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,840
So how about it, Fish?
When we rolling out?

58
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,696
One hiccup left,
but I'm working on it.

59
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:33,876
Yeah, and what is that?

60
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,451
Our road map's a little
incomplete at the moment.

61
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:41,666
I don't get it.
Why not just go down there again?

62
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,247
'Cause one, I don't have
the guard's uniform anymore,

63
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,893
which means I can't get across
the yard or past the orderly.

64
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:50,449
And two, even if I did,
it's a mess down there.

65
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,519
I need this.

66
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:54,332
You think you're
gonna remember it?

67
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:55,978
Not with you hounding me.

68
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,511
Time to wrap it up. We're going
to have you start exterminating.

69
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:05,702
We're not done in here.

70
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:06,980
Well, you look done to me.

71
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,348
Nah, CO,
we still got the carpet to do, man.

72
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:11,685
No, Bellick is going to bring
professionals in to do that.

73
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,215
Wants the job done right.

74
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:17,006
- When's that going to happen?
- Tomorrow.

75
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,221
We got a real problem on our hands,
don't we?

76
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:27,892
Rug monkeys gonna come in here,

77
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:30,460
tear up that carpet and that hole's
gonna be smiling up at them.

78
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,644
- We'll have to fill it in.
- We just dug that bitch.

79
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,208
All we need is a
piece of plywood

80
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:37,158
and a couple inches of that
fast-setting concrete on top of it.

81
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,631
The carpet guys will never know
there's anything beneath it.

82
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,131
And the night we break out,

83
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:43,474
we'll just smash through
with a sledgehammer.

84
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,746
Well, okay. Let's get on it.

85
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:51,505
We've only got a couple
hours to get this thing done.

86
00:04:57,353 --> 00:04:59,733
Hey, Tweener. You met Avocado?

87
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:02,518
Yo, what's up?

88
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:06,298
Lookit. She's just a baby.

89
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:09,446
Hit road.

90
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,785
Have a seat.

91
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:21,860
So...

92
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,932
Scofield. What's the 911?

93
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:30,892
It's 411, and I don't know, man.
I ain't up in his car.

94
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,088
You know,
Avocado's looking for a new cellie.

95
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:35,561
Boss, come on, man, I'm tryin'
to break bread with the man but

96
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,209
I can't jack unless I
can get to the table,

97
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:39,677
you know what I'm sayin'?

98
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,297
Scofield got his own peeps, up in P.I.
He don't need me.

99
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,141
How long this
stuff take to dry?

100
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,705
One, two hours.

101
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:52,674
Fire  on the line.

102
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,361
This place is sweet.
I heard we're getting satellite.

103
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,596
All the porn you
can watch, boss.

104
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:21,925
Good, good.

105
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,165
You know,
you girls have done such a good job,

106
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:27,145
I thought you could use an
extra pair of hands on the crew.

107
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:38,296
S'up?

108
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,951
Hey, man, look at my brush.
It's all sticking together.

109
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,083
Somebody  needs to
go clean them out.

110
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:31,953
According to rank,
that would be, uh, be you.

111
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,293
What I gotta do?

112
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,575
There's a hose out by the shed
in the yard. You can use that.

113
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,620
Clean those, too.

114
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:48,802
A'ight.

115
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:52,597
Sorry I busted up
the party, yo.

116
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,294
Who is he?

117
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:16,308
For your purposes, all you need
to know is that man in the photo

118
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:18,573
used to work for the company.
He went rogue.

119
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,666
And how's he involved
in this situation?

120
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,276
He's Burrows' father.

121
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:24,784
Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:27,322
You picked the son of a
company man to be our patsy?

123
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:28,917
The company know?

124
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:32,107
The company did know.
That was the whole point.

125
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,917
How about you
elaborate on that?

126
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,047
How about you stop with
all the questions?

127
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:40,184
You're a glorified bodyguard,
that's it.

128
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:43,845
The job's to be seen, not to be heard.
Is that understood?

129
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,094
- How close are we?
- Oh, we're good to go, baby.

130
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,847
- Got another badge.
- What is this, happy hour?

131
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:13,029
Scofield? Pope
wants to see you.

132
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:15,422
The rest of you round up,
you're done in here.

133
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,789
Hey, CO Patterson said we had till
the end of the day finish up.

134
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,201
And I say yu're done.

135
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,840
There's a couple hours of work I want
done in the yard before sundown.

136
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,072
Come on, let's go.

137
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,890
- We're dead.
- We're not.

138
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,709
- I'll get it done.
- It's gotta be done tonight.

139
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:34,066
I said I'll get it done.

140
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,048
Scofield, Pope's waiting.

141
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:42,090
Hey, Linc.

142
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:47,532
You going to let me out?

143
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,759
No, Linc,
just came to let ynow set a new date.

144
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,871
DOC refiled all the paperwork.

145
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,168
Execution's a week from
Friday at midnight.

146
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:56,775
You going to let me out
in the yard or what?

147
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:58,927
Unless I hear it from the Pope himself,
I can't.

148
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:02,438
Come on, man, ten minutes.
That's all I'm asking. Ten minutes.

149
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:04,594
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:12,128
Some guy just walks
into the courthouse,

151
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:15,262
drops off some medical records,
Lincoln gets a stay of execution, then--

152
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,243
poof-- he disappears
into the cold.

153
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:20,605
Who do you think it could be,
some anti-death penalty fanatic?

154
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,743
Come on, in this case,
I doubt it.

155
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:25,660
But without a name or a paper trail,
we got no way of getting to him.

156
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,258
So once again we have nothing.

157
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:30,209
I wouldn't exactly call a
2-week stay nothing, okay?

158
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:31,834
It's more than we
had yesterday.

159
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,144
Can I ask you a question?

160
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:36,208
Do you really think that you're
going to get to the bottom of this?

161
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,054
That they'll you get
to the bottom of this?

162
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:39,792
These  guys don't exist.

163
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:43,575
You go after them with the law,
and they'll just use it against you.

164
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,988
We're doing the
best we can, okay?

165
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,972
Law's the only we're gonna
bring them to justice, LJ.

166
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,726
They gunned my
mother down, man.

167
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,767
You think I give a
damn about justice?

168
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:55,256
I want them.
I wanna do to them what they did to me.

169
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,376
Come on, LJ.

170
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,475
It's for the courts to decide,
not us.

171
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,088
Look they're gonna
slip up, okay?

172
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,369
They're gonna leave a piece of
evidence that can't be refuted.

173
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,983
And we're going to be
waiting when they do.

174
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,593
Maybe they already slipped up.

175
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,466
Up at the cabin, at the well.

176
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,204
Quinn.

177
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:17,593
Somebody covered it up.

178
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:19,448
They must have come
and gotten him.

179
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:21,996
There's only one
way to find out.

180
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:36,179
Look, there's his cell phone.

181
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:40,808
Easy.

182
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:48,848
Okay, a little lower!
A little more.

183
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:57,241
Okay, I got it.

184
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:07,728
You okay?

185
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,663
Yeah, I'm fine.

186
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:13,236
Pull me up.

187
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,728
Will you give us
a minute, Gary?

188
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:34,103
Michael, I want you to be
absolutely honest with me.

189
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:41,289
Dr. Tancredi found this embedded in
your flesh when she was treating you.

190
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:44,341
Apparently, it came
from a guard's uniform.

191
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,433
Have you been assaulted
by an officer?

192
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:53,720
Michael, Michael,
I need an answer.

193
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,990
This is not about sticking to
the inmate's code anymore.

194
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,879
This is about officer misconduct.
That's my responsibility.

195
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,100
You wouldn't want to see me
lose my job now, would you?

196
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,030
No, of course not.

197
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:06,120
You have been very good
to me and my brother.

198
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:09,626
But I need to know where
you got that burn right now.

199
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:14,807
Otherwise, your ass is going
to solitary. You understand?

200
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,091
It's your choice.

201
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:22,440
- Listen to me.
- Cool down!

202
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:25,495
Listen to me, don't do this!
Don't do this!

203
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,616
Michael!

204
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,625
No!

205
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,020
Michael.

206
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:54,330
Michael? Michael?

207
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:00,172
Linc?

208
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:02,111
What the hell are
you doing in here?

209
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:07,223
Linc, we're in a
lot of trouble now.

210
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,200
What happened?

211
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,613
The Pope asked some questions
that I couldn't answer.

212
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,077
About what?

213
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:20,563
He's got proof that I was
where I wasn't supposed to be.

214
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,655
He doesn't know it,
but sooner or later

215
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,806
he's going to put the
whole thing together.

216
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,411
There's no way out of this.

217
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,533
Yeah, there is.
You just got to keep the faith.

218
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,951
No.

219
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:34,622
I put my blood into this,
and it's coming apart.

220
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,822
Listen to me.

221
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:40,100
The whole point of solitary is
to break you, make you crazy.

222
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:43,138
You got to keep strong,
you hear me?

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,417
Don't let them break you.

224
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,793
I put my blood into this.

225
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,956
Look, baby, I'm so sorry it took
me so long to get back to you.

226
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:01,047
Turns out that our division is not
getting mobilized for a couple
more days.

227
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:04,013
When I didn't hear from you,
I didn't know what to think, baby.

228
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:08,007
I got so worried. I started watching
the news, looking for casualties.

229
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:11,403
I'm so sorry about all this.
You gotta believe that.

230
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:14,801
I started calling the
Rear Detachment Office,

231
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,134
asking if there was some sort
of problem with the 117th.

232
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:24,721
Uh, no.
There's not a problem with the 117th.

233
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,338
We're coming back.
It's a snafu, that's all.

234
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:30,128
A couple more days,
and we'll be on those hops, baby.

235
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,103
That's not what the Rear
Detachment officer said.

236
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:36,853
He said the 117th wasn't coming
home for another six months.

237
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:40,857
What? Uh, no.
That can't be right.

238
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:45,156
-  That's what he said.
- Ah, you know what it is?

239
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,905
It's because we're transpo.

240
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:50,089
You know, technically we're
on a loan-out from the 140th.

241
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,989
I mean,
that's why he said that.

242
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,224
- The 140th?
- Yeah, yeah.

243
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:59,687
It's just a few more days.
That's all. I mean...

244
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:04,094
You don't need to go calling anyone.
I'll be back, okay?

245
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:08,505
I will call you as soon
as I know the exact date.

246
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:13,061
- Okay? I love you.
I love you.

247
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:26,767
Michael's in the SHU.

248
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:29,148
Oh, God,
the hits just keep comin'.

249
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:32,137
Last thing we wanna do
now is panic, fellas.

250
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:34,370
Oh, it's panic time, old head.

251
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:37,465
We got an unfinished hole
in that room over there

252
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:39,380
that Scofield was
supposed to fill tonight.

253
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,651
Come tomorrow 8:00 a.m., they rip
up that carpet, our game is over.

254
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,740
Unless someone else fills it.

255
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:49,275
Uh-uh.

256
00:16:49,414 --> 00:16:52,962
He's right, papi. You're the only one
with a toilet open to the outside world.

257
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,662
You're saying I go out
there by myself tonight?

258
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:55,987
That's exactly
what we're saying.

259
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:57,361
Are you kidding?
That's impossible.

260
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,409
Look, I don't wanna hear
impossible from you right now.

261
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:00,839
I got people waiting on me--

262
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:04,064
people that I'm gonna lose unless you
man up and get some  cojones, comprende?

263
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:06,632
That's easy for you to say, pendejo.
It ain't your ass on the line.

264
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:08,517
All of our asses
are on the line.

265
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:11,453
And you're the only cat that
can do something about it.

266
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:15,785
Yeah, maybe I can
get out of my cell.

267
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:17,322
And maybe I can get
into the guards' room.

268
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,781
But even if I do,
and I fill that hole in,

269
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:22,159
I'll still be in that room.

270
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:24,405
I'll be sealed in.
There's no way out.

271
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,265
Scofield must've had a way.

272
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,297
He did.

273
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,356
The grate at the sally port.

274
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,268
Oh, that's right. The one out
there in the middle of the open?

275
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,880
Yeah,  so you better
lace up, amigo,

276
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,210
'cause you're gonna have
to make a run for it.

277
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:38,718
That's ten years on my
bid if I get caught.

278
00:17:38,748 --> 00:17:41,177
Better figure out a
way not to get caught.

279
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,257
Line it up!

280
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,372
Tonight, primo.
It's gotta be tonight.

281
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:25,848
Michael.

282
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:29,451
You okay? What you doing?

283
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,127
Trying to remember what's
beneath psych ward.

284
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:35,327
You're thinking about
the wrong thing.

285
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:38,213
You got to think about
how to get out of here.

286
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,230
Michael.

287
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:20,487
Man, come on. Talk to me.

288
00:19:46,188 --> 00:19:49,575
Uh-uh. Absolutely not.

289
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:53,446
If I'm gonna be the one doing that
running, you gotta do some lifting, too.

290
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,570
I mean,
you know what you're asking of me?

291
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:04,536
You gotta do it for the team.

292
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,034
Hey, sister.
Your bloomers are showing.

293
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,700
They aren't showing, baby,
they're flying. Proudly.

294
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,568
I take it you are a party girl.

295
00:20:52,526 --> 00:20:54,309
L.J.? Come on, were leaving.

296
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:55,090
Okay.

297
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:03,201
We get Quinn's phone powered up it
could be a gold mine of information.

298
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,623
No. Doesn't fit.

299
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:07,733
We just need to find
the right adaptor.

300
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:10,344
What about Quinn?
Are we just gonna leave him here?

301
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,653
You mean the guy who
shot me in the back?

302
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,093
Yeah, we're just
gonna leave him here.

303
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:29,275
You tell anyone about this,
and I...

304
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:35,638
Capitol Hill saw its
first deadlock of the term

305
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,190
on the Senate
floor this morning.

306
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,805
The hotly contested energy
bill ended up in a 50-50 tie.

307
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:45,057
That means it will now be up to Vice
President Reynolds to cast the
deciding vote.

308
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:48,610
I know I sound like a broken record,
but you work too hard.

309
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:51,194
You need to get out,
hang out with your friends more.

310
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:52,218
What about men?

311
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:56,535
If this is your exposé on my social
life, it's about to be a real sad one.

312
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:01,390
I, uh... I've had some bad luck
when it comes to relationships.

313
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,841
You had bad luck or
you had bad boys?

314
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,192
I think I've managed to
have a little of both.

315
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:11,831
Yeah, you know, you're right.
I don't tend to go for the nice guys.

316
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,018
I like the ones with the
deep-seated emotional issues

317
00:22:14,048 --> 00:22:16,351
I can internalize
and make my own.

318
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:17,228
Mm-hmm.

319
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:20,920
- Like Scofield?
- Nope, not like Scofield.

320
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:24,088
Don't lie to me.
Every time he comes in for his shot,

321
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,338
you spend 20 minutes
rolling up his sleeve.

322
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,608
You know what?
I think he's interesting.

323
00:22:30,356 --> 00:22:33,747
And I think he's attractive,
but he's still an inmate.

324
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:34,934
Promise you one thing.

325
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:38,785
And  that's that you will never see
anything happen between me and
an inmate.

326
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:36,229
Michael.

327
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,201
What? What'd you say?

328
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:48,882
I put my blood into this.

329
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,309
Stop! Freeze right there!
Get down on your knees!

330
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,601
Please don't shoot!

331
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:50,806
The State of Illinois doesn't look too
kindly upon prisoners who try to escape.

332
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:01,564
Charges are filed, you get sent
back to county for three months.

333
00:27:01,658 --> 00:27:04,308
Come back here with ten more
years added to your bid.

334
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:05,896
I wasn't trying to escape.

335
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,527
Sure you weren't.

336
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,432
You were just out there
howling at the moon.

337
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:19,444
If I were you,
I'd start talking. Mano.

338
00:27:22,094 --> 00:27:24,317
I stayed out after yard today.

339
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,072
I waited under the
bleachers until it got dark.

340
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,230
Something was gonna
come over the walls.

341
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:31,044
Drugs is almost
as bad as escape.

342
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:35,970
Last guy had heroin slingshot over the
wall got a nickel added to his bid.

343
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:37,067
It wasn't drugs.

344
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,100
Then what the hell was it?!

345
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:41,170
Frisk him!

346
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,239
What do we have here?

347
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,710
A pair of grunds?

348
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:04,861
You risked going to the
SHU for a pair of grunds?

349
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,799
Hell, you risked adding
extra time to your bid

350
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,704
all for a pair of panties?

351
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:13,012
My girl just wanted me to know
she was thinking about me, boss.

352
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:18,270
You got a real beefer on your hands,
don't you?

353
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:21,048
I know, boss.
It's the dumbest thing I've ever done.

354
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:25,301
I'm just scared that being here,
I'm gonna lose her.

355
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,131
- He did it for love.
- Then you understand.

356
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,712
Yeah, sure, Sucre.
I understand.

357
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,991
Don't let me catch you
alone next time, okay?!

358
00:28:47,854 --> 00:28:49,035
Sucre!

359
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:50,752
Sink?

360
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:52,908
Sucre.

361
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:58,238
- Where's Michael?
- Other side of you.

362
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:04,333
Michael. Michael!

363
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,542
Michael!

364
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:08,294
Michael!

365
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,383
Michael!

366
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,009
Michael, come on.

367
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:16,730
Badge!

368
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,374
Badge!

369
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,264
Yeah?

370
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:25,756
Check out my brother.
He's not responding.

371
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,576
What?

372
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:29,764
Scofield. Check him out.
He's not responding. Please.

373
00:29:35,427 --> 00:29:41,324
Scofield. Scofield.

374
00:29:46,343 --> 00:29:47,839
I need a medic in 12 now.

375
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:49,363
- What?
- I repeat, now.

376
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,433
An electronics store on Eighth Avenue.
Grab his phone.

377
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,113
We'll be back in ten minutes.
Stay on the couch.

378
00:30:41,384 --> 00:30:44,768
You've reached Owen Kravecki.
I can't come to the phone right now.

379
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:48,879
You really think you're gonna get to
four buttons before I get to one?

380
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:51,457
Leave a message,
and I'll return your call.

381
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:53,628
Thanks. Have a great day.

382
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,541
Light on 12.

383
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,475
Would you wait outside, please?

384
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:18,805
Michael?

385
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:26,932
Okay, you're going to feel
my fingers on your wrist.

386
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,442
Come on, I need your eyes.

387
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:49,717
I'm going to take a
look at that hand.

388
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,468
You're going to be okay.

389
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:03,543
You're going to be okay.

390
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,337
- Sucre got...
- I heard.

391
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,611
Papi better had
did us right, man.

392
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:24,009
Hope he had enough time.

393
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:27,069
Looks like we
about to find out.

394
00:32:39,817 --> 00:32:41,022
Make it fast.

395
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:43,014
I thought we picked Lincoln
Burrows off the street

396
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,344
because he was some lowlife
who couldn't defend himself.

397
00:32:45,374 --> 00:32:46,912
Now I learn it's all
about his father,

398
00:32:46,942 --> 00:32:49,573
some old spook the company's
trying to settle a score with?

399
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,314
Well, fortunately for us,

400
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:55,547
the company's agenda and our
agenda have the same endgame.

401
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:57,522
Caroline, I've been
doing this for 15 years,

402
00:32:57,552 --> 00:32:59,279
and it's never been about
anything other than you,

403
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:02,075
your family, and most importantly,
this country.

404
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,356
I need to know who
I'm working for here.

405
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:09,771
- You are working for me.
- Promise me that.

406
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:13,387
I promise you, Paul.
I got to go now.

407
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,847
And to what do I
owe this honor?

408
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:24,331
To the vote on the Senate
floor this afternoon.

409
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:30,235
Look, I get it. The vote comes down
to me, and I vote no. It'll get done.

410
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:34,611
Well, actually, we are going to
need you to vote "yes" on this one.

411
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,559
I want to make sure
I heard you straight.

412
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:43,070
You want me to vote on the
environmentalists' side?

413
00:33:43,242 --> 00:33:44,842
This isn't about a vote.

414
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:47,887
This is about you and
how you look to voters.

415
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:51,806
Now, we have a nation that is growing
increasingly hungry for
alternate energy,

416
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:54,394
so if you come across
as more centrist,

417
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:56,489
you'll appeal to the broadest
swath of the electorate--

418
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,520
the very people who will
get you elected next year.

419
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,760
Besides, once that bill hits the
president's desk, he'll veto it.

420
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,331
Then we'll get precisely what we
always wanted anyway, won't we?

421
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,782
You probably don't have a
hair on your body, do you?

422
00:34:22,412 --> 00:34:24,547
Just back your punk-ass up.

423
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:28,652
Hey, Tweener! Get over here.

424
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,901
Looks like Avocado has
taken a shine to you.

425
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:44,371
I could set you up as
cellies if you want.

426
00:34:44,518 --> 00:34:46,169
Stop it, all right?

427
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,865
I got something
for you this time.

428
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:52,424
Scofield and his boys--
they're up to something.

429
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:54,530
How about being a
little more specific?

430
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:59,178
Whatever it is, it's got to deal
with that room they're fixing...

431
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:01,904
something to do
with the carpet.

432
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:25,725
Excuse me, fellas.

433
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,136
Out of the way!

434
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:20,796
Michael!

435
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,177
Michael! Michael!

436
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:46,627
He's totally nonresponsive,
so start him on chlorpromazine.

437
00:37:46,675 --> 00:37:48,451
I believe he's in danger
of a psychotic break.

438
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:51,531
I want you to notify me immediately
if and when that happens.

439
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,170
Clean him up.

440
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:07,792
You scared me.

441
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,616
Put it down.
You're not a killer.

442
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,999
You don't want to make
any rash mistakes here.

443
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,393
Don't move!

444
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:20,749
- Go easy, go easy...
- Shut up!

445
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:24,105
LJ, there's other ways out of this,
you know, okay?

446
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:26,314
I can help you beat this rap,
but if you pull that trigger,

447
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:29,852
you really will be a killer,
and then I can't help you, okay?

448
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:32,323
I'm government, LJ. There's a
lot of things I can do for you.

449
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:34,974
The only thing you
can do for me is die!

450
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:36,579
Drop your weapon!

451
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:39,601
I said drop your weapon!

452
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:44,327
Guess you're going to have to take
a rain check on that one, huh?

453
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:48,720
Drop the gun now!

454
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:06,066
No. I did what you said.

455
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,692
You brought me a pile of crap.
There was nothing there.

456
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:10,754
Well, it's cool, man;
I need some more time.

457
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,576
You had your time.
You're a waste of my fries.

458
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,302
Open on 88!

459
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:24,048
Dude, just give me
another chance.

460
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,362
Close on 88!

461
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:35,936
Have at it.

462
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:38,922
Boss.

463
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,077
Boss!

464
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,452
You were lucky.

465
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:50,794
Kid's got a warrant
for double homicide.

466
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:52,672
Oh, dear. Are you serious?

467
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,440
Did you have any prior
contact with him?

468
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,789
Any idea why he
chose your house?

469
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,765
No, none. I mean, he was screaming
something like, "You killed my mom,"

470
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:02,731
and going on about me being
a government agent, and...

471
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:05,800
I don't know, it just seemed like
that kid was on drugs or something.

472
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,930
What do you do for a living,
Mr. Kravecki?

473
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,103
I'm a, uh, regional sales manager
for a dehydrated meat distributor.

474
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,943
What, you mean like jerky?

475
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:17,019
- Yes. You a fan?
- What kind?

476
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,090
Buffalo.

477
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:25,156
Have some. Really.
I'm swimming in the stuff.

478
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,846
One hour till lunch.

479
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:51,547
- What's the problem?
- You're looking at it.

480
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:54,839
- What, Haywire?
- Yep. He's my new cell mate.

481
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,863
I think I have schizoaffective
disorder with bipolar tendencies.

482
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:10,158
- Your tattoos.
- What about them?

483
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:12,360
- What are they of?
- They're just tattoos.

484
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,145
The man's got a
maze on his skin.

485
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:17,214
Why would he do that?
Why would he put a maze on his skin?

486
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:20,835
It's a pathway.
Where does it lead?

487
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:28,093
Hello, roomie.
You were right about my tattoo.

488
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:31,656
It is a path,
just like you thought.

489
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:36,100
And I need you to remember
when you saw it, Haywire.

490
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:38,411
I need you to remember
what it looked like.

491
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:40,423
Do you think you
can do that for me?

492
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:44,747
Who are you?

493
00:42:51,022 --> 00:42:55,931
