1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,672
<i>My name is Brilliant Chang.</i>

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,200
Mr Thomas...

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,194
...it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,109
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i>
out of Shanghai.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,959
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,835
Canals are the idea, right, Chang?

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,636
I believe we've friends in common.
We should postpone our war.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,992
Your message said you wanted to seal
our truce with some business.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,238
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,034
I need your signature as a guarantor
on the transaction

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,312
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,353
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.
We've made peace.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,960
We're gonna do business together.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,816
<i>There's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself</i>

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,719
<i>and I keep finding myself there.</i>

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
<i>And only the</i> January
<i>can get me away.</i>

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,552
His name was Frederick.
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,957
He just listened.
And now he has no face.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,912
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,558
- Clear that shit. Clear it!
- All right.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,909
Take her.

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,311
Go outside. Till it's done.
Till it's done, brother.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,234
Linda, I would have taken your bullet.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,800
I deserved the bullet.

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,515
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!

26
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,636
Linda!

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,955
Linda, look at me.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,639
Linda, you've got a kid.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,434
If you die, he'll come to us to raise.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,789
You hear me?

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,999
I used a derringer.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,713
- Shh!
- Right.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,960
- Shh!
- It's still in there.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,480
It's above the bone.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,239
Mr Shelby, your guests.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,589
Get him out. Arthur!

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,076
Family only. Get him out!

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,598
- Mr Shelby...
- Get out!

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,440
Get out!

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,037
Lizzie, go to the kitchen
and get some iodine. Now! Go!

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,595
Shh...

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,989
Linda...

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,600
You'll have to bite on this.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,110
- Linda... Arthur.
- Bite! Come here.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,311
Now, it's really gonna hurt.

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,594
One, two, three...

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,279
You're all right. You're all right.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,631
- It's all over.
- Hold her.

49
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,236
Is she going to be all right, Tom?
Is she going to be all right, Tom?

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,430
Yeah.

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,835
Oh, Jesus.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
Arthur, come here. Come here.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,518
If you love her, go to the library,
get some opium.

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,030
- Go on. She'll be fine. Go sort it.
- Right.

55
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,439
Actually, you can use mine.

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,870
Brought a bit to celebrate
the wedding proposal.

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,958
Oh! He proposed, eh?

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
One knee.

59
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,510
Congratulations, Poll.

60
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Linda...

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,200
Linda...

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,993
- You're gonna have to drink this.
- No.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,600
I don't want anything you've touched.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,798
25 seconds. 25 seconds
and the pain will be gone.

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,798
Even the pain in your head.

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,400
Right, here you go. Drink.

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,429
Cushion, Poll.

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,434
Right.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,274
Oh, Jesus Christ...

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,198
Arthur...

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,839
She's gonna be fine.

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,919
I gave her something
to get her to sleep.

73
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,315
She's gonna be fine.

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,996
You should have... You should have
let her do it, Poll.

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,157
You should have let her do it.

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,760
Arthur...

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,554
You should have let her do it.

78
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,399
Look at me, brother! Look at me!

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,352
You've got things to do.

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,960
You've got a kid.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,912
- Yeah.
- We need you!

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,271
- All right? You understand?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,960
Aberama wants you as best man.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,196
You hear that?

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,156
I save his life, he hugs him.

86
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,276
Oh...

87
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,994
I'll do it.

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
No take.

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,632
Right, fine. Let him be. Let him be.

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,038
Ladies and gentlemen...

91
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,070
Ladies and gentlemen...

92
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,594
...I would like to extend our gratitude
to the musicians

93
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,758
and the dance company
for your wonderful performance.

94
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Hear hear!

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,670
This has been a wonderful evening.

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,358
And not only
for the music and the dancing.

97
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,269
It has also been about us,
the people gathered here.

98
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,553
English people
in the very heart of England.

99
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,994
There are no people
I would rather be among,

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,478
no place I would rather be
and no time I would rather be alive,

101
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,399
because ever since
the terrible events of October,

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,751
when the money markets betrayed us all...

103
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,080
...I have known that change is coming.

104
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,794
The human species has never faced
such immense possibilities,

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,115
such choices.

106
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,279
In the lives of great nations...

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,437
...there are moments of destiny...

108
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,112
...which have swept aside
small men of convention

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,311
and discovered men of the moment.

110
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,071
- Hear hear!
- And our host is such a man.

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,559
For him...

112
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,311
For him, the little calculations
of little men mean nothing.

113
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,160
He is a man well suited to
the mighty mood that England is now in.

114
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,278
The only reason I say this now,

115
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,472
at this moment, on this stage,

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,877
is because I have some news.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,310
Good news, I think.

118
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,039
I'm sure our host will forgive me
if I use this platform,

119
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,110
this gathering of friends and like minds,
to give you, his trusted allies,

120
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,880
an early announcement
of a long-overdue event.

121
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,432
I want to tell you good folk first...

122
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,077
...that with the dawn of a new decade...

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,075
...I will be setting a new course.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,594
Setting up a new political movement
here in the very heart of England.

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,235
And Mr Shelby will be with me,

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,953
shoulder to shoulder.

127
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,639
Hear hear!

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,515
It will offer
a new conception of politics

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,677
in which the great character
of the British,

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,110
our true character,

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,391
will be reborn.

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,916
Many of you lost fortunes
in the recent stock market crash.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,475
The men of money,

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,956
the capitalists in New York,

135
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,719
the Jews...

136
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,913
...the money-power, they... they run
an international system

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,838
in which the infinite mobility of money,

138
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,670
its capacity to create financial chaos
and panic,

139
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,670
can bring down any government
that dares for one moment to oppose it.

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,073
For generations,
the efforts of hard-working men like you

141
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,432
have equipped our competitors against us.

142
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,074
The cotton mills of India.

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,793
The cotton mills of Asia.

144
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,877
Created with British money

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,516
but used for the destruction
of Lancashire and Yorkshire!

146
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,074
Disgraceful!

147
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,991
The usurers of New York,
the sweated labour of the Orient

148
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,080
combining to destroy
the iron and steel factories

149
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,396
of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

150
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,560
These are policies that could not
be pursued by British statesmen

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,197
unless they were mad
or the servants of Jewish finance!

152
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,432
<i>They</i> are the ones
who took your money,

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,791
but it is I and those who know this truth

154
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,517
who will light a flame
the atheists cannot extinguish!

155
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,479
The ranks of our heroes
of the Great War

156
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,879
have been betrayed
again and again by politicians!

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,758
But hear this - those of you who fought
the Jew war for nothing,

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,997
you brave men,

159
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,352
you will join hands
with the angry youth of Birmingham

160
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,279
and Manchester and London
and Liverpool

161
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,314
and declare that England lives tonight

162
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,636
and marches on!

163
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Well said!

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,634
I say all this to you now...

165
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,600
...because I believe
it is in places like this,

166
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,391
with people like you, that we will have
to pass on our message directly.

167
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,319
Our message can be summarised
with these words -

168
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,511
Britain first.

169
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,035
And because this is our message,

170
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,516
I doubt it'll be reported
fairly in the press.

171
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,031
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country

172
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,110
are owned by the same vested interests
who took your money.

173
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,910
They sell to the people false news...

174
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,919
...to raise the interests of the faction
and the section

175
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,111
above the interests of the nation.

176
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,074
- Good man!
- So hear my words

177
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,716
and pass them on
to those with ears to hear.

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,800
And be reminded
that when the new decade begins,

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,709
there will be the birth
of a new political party

180
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,718
which will speak <i>for</i> you.

181
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,160
Well said, sir.

182
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,350
Well said!

183
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,713
This party, this new movement,
this revolution...

184
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,676
...will be called
the British Union of Fascists.

185
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Bravo!

186
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
Good man!

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,996
What the fuck are you doing,
dealing with a man like that, Tommy?

188
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,954
Yep.
You're going to have to trust me.

189
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,355
Again.

190
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,112
I'm going to fuck the swan.

191
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,675
Somebody go and tell her
to come to my room.

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,439
How do you know she'll come?

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,513
Because they always do.

194
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,633
Now, forgive me.

195
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,956
I'm going to borrow your husband
for a little while.

196
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,080
This way.

197
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,920
Things like tonight, that shooting,
a family dispute in public,

198
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,430
things like that will have to stop.

199
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,279
It's very lower class.

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,710
It's all been cleared up, Mr Mosley.

201
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,034
So, did you learn anything
from my speech tonight?

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,879
Yes.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
Yes, I learned many things.

204
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,718
Religion was a beast,
but it's dead.

205
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,276
You have to ride the new thing
when it comes.

206
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,039
Like a horse.

207
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,315
You grab it.

208
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,279
I looked into the audience
and I saw medals

209
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,357
and Savile Row suits,

210
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,755
and bitterness.

211
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,634
<i>They</i> are my people.
Your people will be different.

212
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,316
Oh, do see the funny side, Shelby.

213
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,554
I do.

214
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,233
I do see the funny side.

215
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,713
Do you enjoy strategies?

216
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,071
Yes, I do.

217
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,476
Things will begin to happen now.

218
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,795
So...

219
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,720
...there are some things
we need to discuss.

220
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,400
I've been looking
into your companies.

221
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,196
The Shelby portfolio.

222
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,755
Your company lawyer is a Jew.

223
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,439
He will have to go.

224
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,313
Of course.

225
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,796
Also, our friend Jimmy McCavern

226
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,790
has asked for control of the racecourses
north of Wincanton.

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,833
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

228
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,158
so I said yes.

229
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,036
In return for what?

230
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,913
No return.

231
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,554
None.

232
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,472
When our campaign begins, the country
will be divided into distinct areas.

233
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,672
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

234
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,156
controlling rallies
and breaking up demonstrations.

235
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,398
In the Midlands, it'll be you.

236
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,072
The south... Well, I have yet to decide.

237
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,350
Please understand what I'm offering you
as we go forward, Mr Shelby.

238
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,793
When we succeed,
even the King will not be above us.

239
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,269
Power.

240
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,352
Like plugging into the mains.

241
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,433
A lighthouse beam.

242
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,439
Your millions of dollars
safe in Switzerland,

243
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,156
and access to every dirty-minded swan
in England.

244
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,400
Oh, and also, Shelby... drink less.

245
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,159
Put it on.

246
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,393
Put the costume back on.

247
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,351
The ballerina and I were wondering
whether perhaps...

248
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,438
...you might want to join us.

249
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,916
If I told Tommy,
you wouldn't see the morning.

250
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,032
Oh, I doubt that very much.

251
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,517
You see, he is being seduced,
just as you were.

252
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,796
Tommy.

253
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,359
Tommy!

254
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,711
- Tom!
- What?

255
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,951
Lizzie... What?!

256
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,600
Tommy, I swear to God, you're bad.

257
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,871
That man is fucking evil.

258
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,195
Lizzie...

259
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,553
I'm only doing this...

260
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,353
...to bring the bastard down.

261
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,915
Yeah, but why?

262
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,232
Tommy? Why?

263
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,837
I am supplying the British Government

264
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,874
with information on his organisation,

265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,359
and in return, they are giving me
favourable terms on defence contracts.

266
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,880
No.

267
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,714
You're doing it because you think
somebody should stop him.

268
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,479
I saw your face when he was speaking.

269
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
You're doing it because you think
it's the right thing to do.

270
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,794
All this time, you just did things
that feel nice...

271
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,639
...because you can afford it.

272
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,719
Lizzie, please. Please. Please stop.

273
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,520
Don't scare me...

274
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,639
...by saying you see things in my face.

275
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,076
I still want things that feel nice.

276
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,235
Linda...

277
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,880
Shh. Shh.

278
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,360
Linda...

279
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,589
Let's go.

280
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Hmm?

281
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,797
Let's go, let's leave.

282
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,233
Let's get in the car.
We'll go and pick up Billy.

283
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,952
We'll drive to the docks.

284
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,480
Any dock you want.

285
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,680
We'll get on a boat.

286
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,314
We'll sail away.

287
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,760
You and me.

288
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,999
Any destination.

289
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,193
Be careful, it's...

290
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,879
It's broken everywhere.

291
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,157
We leave tonight. Hmm?

292
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,513
We'd leave this place.

293
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,279
We never come back, Linda.

294
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,199
We never come back.

295
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,953
I mean that.

296
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,718
We go before it gets light.

297
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,634
Say yes.

298
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,873
I've got a better idea.

299
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,840
You stay here...

300
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,631
...living inside your head.

301
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,875
Inside your life. Inside your war.

302
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,440
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

303
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,757
It would have been a kindness.

304
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,115
Now get out.

305
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,634
Please...

306
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,233
An evening with a bunch
of fucking Gypsies.

307
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,839
Peter! Peter! Kick it here!

308
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,758
Kick it here, mister!

309
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,958
This is a cheque guarantee,
signed by Mosley...

310
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,034
...on behalf of a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

311
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,594
A cheque for what?

312
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,713
Well, I said it was
for the sale of a gin distillery.

313
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,479
But it doesn't matter.

314
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,356
It is direct evidence of a link
between Mosley

315
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,518
and the head
of an organised criminal network.

316
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,077
A relationship he will try to deny...

317
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,516
...after the bonfire of all conventions.

318
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,838
It also contains the names of MPs
who have signed up to the movement,

319
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,919
and those MPs who are sympathetic

320
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,432
but will not show their hand until
the organisation is announced officially.

321
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,233
On 2nd January.

322
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,469
In Grosvenor House. You might want
to write some of this down.

323
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,116
I am experiencing resistance
from my superior officers too.

324
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,912
This isn't intelligence, Younger.

325
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,719
This is evidence.

326
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,274
Give it to the Branch.

327
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,629
Special Branch?

328
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,719
Half of whom spend their lives
defending the Union against Fenians,

329
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,336
and the other half who spend their lives

330
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,034
defending men like Mosley
against socialists.

331
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,516
I heard about his speech
at your house the other night.

332
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,030
Was favourably reported as
the passionate

333
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,598
and spontaneous outpouring of a man
moved by the emotions of a ballet.

334
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,870
Reported where?

335
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,719
<i>Daily Mail. Morning Post.
Daily Mirror.</i>

336
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,038
It's upper, middle and working class,

337
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,356
all united in admiration.

338
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,200
Also, I'm being asked the source
of my information on Mosley.

339
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,640
Which you don't divulge?

340
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,955
No.

341
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,272
And as a result, my six-monthly review
was unfavourable.

342
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,271
They're talking about moving me to
a black and coloured desk in Johannesburg.

343
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,031
I also suspect there are
specific threats to me personally

344
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,437
from an organisation called Section D.

345
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,876
I believe you've had a dispute
with them in the past.

346
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,360
Sit down, Younger.

347
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,360
Yeech...

348
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,398
We are now Section D.

349
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,193
And I fucking beat them.

350
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,720
You're a soldier, I'm a soldier.

351
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,869
There are elements within the state
who are prepared to kill.

352
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,072
We need to meet them unafraid.

353
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,239
Spoken like a true believer.

354
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,558
My superiors also ask why
the information on Jessie Eden

355
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,751
and the Communists
has apparently dried up.

356
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,432
Why has it dried up, Mr Shelby?

357
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,077
Your sister has an interesting theory.

358
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,919
She thinks perhaps at last

359
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,478
Tommy Shelby has actually started
to believe in something.

360
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,599
Younger.

361
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,752
Please don't listen
to my sister's opinions of me.

362
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,839
They are always... hopeful.

363
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,439
Therefore they are always wrong.

364
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,994
Can you hear me? Look at me.

365
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,112
You're going to be all right.
I'll be back.

366
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,435
You'll be OK.

367
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,994
Look at me. Look at me.

368
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,349
It's OK.

369
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,595
Fuck!

370
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
Call an ambulance!

371
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,754
Call Moss!

372
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
Find out where I can reach Ada.
Come on, love.

373
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,240
Up you get. Good girl.

374
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,238
Come on, take her. Take her.

375
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,918
Come on. Up you get. Up you get.
Good boy.

376
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,190
Come on.

377
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,710
In you go. Inside. Stay inside.

378
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,032
Tommy?

379
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,389
Let's sit down, Ada.

380
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,795
What's happened?

381
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,553
Here, sit down, eh?

382
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,078
Ben Younger is dead.

383
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,192
Someone put a bomb in his car.

384
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,152
I don't know how you felt about him
or how bad this is gonna hurt...

385
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,433
...but whatever happens, just remember
you've a baby inside of you.

386
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,399
Oh, God.

387
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,796
Anyone you touch...

388
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,992
Which means anyone I touch.

389
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,272
Which means anyone any of us touch.

390
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,511
He never knew I was pregnant.

391
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,314
I hadn't told him.

392
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,474
I didn't love him.

393
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,634
But I liked him.

394
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,560
He was decent and good...

395
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,835
I wasn't gonna marry him.

396
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,515
The baby was a mistake,
but that's OK.

397
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,310
I didn't ask anything of him.

398
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,829
God, he didn't deserve us.

399
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,640
Well, I've spoken to his family -
they're gonna take care of the funeral.

400
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,795
It will go down as an IRA assassination
of a British military officer.

401
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,957
And what was it really?

402
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,440
It was...

403
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,912
...a consequence of good intentions.

404
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,793
My good intentions.

405
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,790
I pushed him to report on the fascists.
I thought it was the right thing to do.

406
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,160
And as a result,
Section D or the Branch or Intelligence

407
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,680
had him killed.

408
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,753
There was a kid...

409
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,031
...died in the explosion.

410
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,914
He was ten years old.

411
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,800
It's funny...

412
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,316
...isn't it, how it works?

413
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,876
Look, Tommy.

414
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,394
Don't give yourself this excuse.

415
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,638
He was ten years old.

416
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,271
If I'd have stuck to what I do,

417
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,279
he'd still be kicking a ball
in the street.

418
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,755
It's funny, isn't it?

419
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,833
Push the button.

420
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,957
Unlock the door and come home to me.

421
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,155
Chinese lanterns. Brass on deck.

422
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,632
God fucking help us.

423
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,959
Chang will be waiting at the dock
with the cargo.

424
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,754
We weigh it,
we load it, we fuck off.

425
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,593
Where the fuck is Chang?

426
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,719
Isiah, take point.

427
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,715
Look lively.

428
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,519
Right, there's your lanterns.

429
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,030
Where the fuck are the Chinese?

430
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,072
All right, Charlie.

431
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,431
Arthur, it's Chang!

432
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,239
Christ!

433
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,312
Get over! Get over. Get over!

434
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,077
I knew we shouldn't trust these fuckers
and their fucking lanterns.

435
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,516
If it's the police, hold fire.

436
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,474
Chang, where's the stuff? Where is it?

437
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,399
They didn't look like police.
Smelt of gin.

438
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,513
They said they were taking the opium
on behalf of the King.

439
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,233
Then they saw your boat coming.

440
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,033
So, were they Italian?

441
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,595
- Were they Italian?
- Irish.

442
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,074
Irish, I think...

443
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,554
Oh, fuck.

444
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,751
Fuck! Charlie,

445
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,155
my gun. Give me the gun.

446
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,509
Give it up, that's it.

447
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,597
Listen. Listen to me.

448
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,677
They're Titanic boys out there, right?

449
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,359
They're out of Poplar.

450
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,915
In the war, they were very capable.

451
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,838
Very capable soldiers.

452
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,679
So was I.

453
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,315
I was a fucking capable soldier, too.

454
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,395
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastards!

455
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,389
Arthur! Arthur!

456
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,399
Stop firing! Arthur, they've gone.

457
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,437
To any of you still alive,

458
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,836
you do not fuck

459
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,477
with the Peaky fucking Blinders!

460
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,399
Huh!

461
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah.

462
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,509
Here we go.

463
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,794
Chang?

464
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,235
Purest ever in Europe.

465
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,510
Arthur?

466
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,916
There's a dead man in a copper's uniform.

467
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,599
Should I throw him in the cut?

468
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,235
No.

469
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,431
No, he'll float, won't he, eh?

470
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,791
Even Irishmen fucking float.

471
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,709
No, go and fire... go and fire the kilns.

472
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,718
But there are men working them.

473
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,675
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?

474
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,393
And razor blades in your cap?

475
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,789
Cos you're a Peaky fucking Blinder,
that's why.

476
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,152
You take that body
and you burn it to the bone.

477
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,595
And if anybody speaks to you on that...

478
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,917
...you offer them the chance
to burn in that furnace with him.

479
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,269
Right?

480
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,550
Yes, Arthur.

481
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,798
Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,879
Do we know the people
who tried to trick us?

483
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,195
The uncles will be mad.

484
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,913
Fuck your uncles.

485
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,271
And your aunts, your cousins,
all of them, right?

486
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,676
Curly! Load this up onto the boat.
Let's get back to Birmingham, eh?

487
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,395
Get back to fucking civilisation

488
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,512
and find out who's been talking.

489
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,313
Yeah! Now look,

490
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,716
the Titanic heard about this, right?

491
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,198
That means every gang from Poplar
to Birmingham will want to be here.

492
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,393
Well, let 'em come, eh?

493
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,989
Let 'em come, Aberama.

494
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,440
Yeah.

495
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,597
Oh, let 'em fucking come!

496
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,593
Hat and coat off.

497
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,591
Stand up against the wall.

498
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,472
For your own safety, I need to search you

499
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,116
for items that could potentially
be used as weapons against you.

500
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,353
Oh, that's nice.

501
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,872
He was my friend.

502
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,356
Yeah, well, he's nobody's friend any more.

503
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,631
He's a fucking animal.

504
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,229
Laces out of your shoes.

505
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,114
Table.

506
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,717
Barney? Visitor.

507
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,719
This one's real.

508
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,240
You can wait here.

509
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,079
No. I can't.

510
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,040
It's your funeral.

511
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,833
- I'll have to lock you in.
- Yeah.

512
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,354
Hello, Barney.

513
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,840
Arthur says to say hello.

514
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,440
Sergeant Major?

515
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,189
You're alive?

516
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,391
Arthur's alive, John's dead,

517
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,352
Danny's dead, Freddie's dead...

518
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,956
...Jeremiah preaches the gospel barefoot.

519
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,716
Yeah.

520
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,995
And I'm alive.

521
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,549
Them as have gone are the lucky ones.

522
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,236
Thanks for the letters you send,
Sergeant Major.

523
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,956
Yeah, Arthur mostly writes them.
I just... just sign them.

524
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,920
How the fuck do you write back?
With your fucking teeth?

525
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,759
No, they stick the pen up me arse.

526
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,838
Someone in here said your name.

527
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,239
They said
out there you are a politician now.

528
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,874
Sometimes I am.

529
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,077
I didn't know if it was real, comrade.

530
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,151
I see rats coming out of bodies
like at the black wood.

531
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,511
The shit they give me in here...

532
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,039
Hey, Barney, look at me.

533
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,311
Barney, this here is opium and cyanide.

534
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,520
It'll bring on a heart attack.

535
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,997
They won't even check the cause.
You won't feel a fucking thing.

536
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,110
So, here.

537
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,159
You're in here forever, brother.

538
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,632
You don't have the use
of your fucking hands.

539
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,353
You're still in the tunnels.

540
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,673
I can give this to you now.

541
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,152
Do you want it?

542
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,710
No.

543
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,113
Why not?

544
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,754
I know.

545
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,879
I know.

546
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,234
You still remember...

547
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,397
...that French waitress.

548
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,717
You still going on about that, Tom?

549
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Yeah.

550
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,456
Did you fuck her before me?
Because whoever did

551
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,756
gave me the fucking clap.
But I'm guessing it was you.

552
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,111
- Yes, I fucked her before you did!
- Yeah.

553
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,152
- She was beautiful.
- She was.

554
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,509
She was.

555
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,200
And I reckon

556
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,232
I was second best after Barney.

557
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,478
Why did you bring the capsule, Tom?

558
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,319
You're in here, Barney,

559
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,672
you have no hands, there is no daylight...

560
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,474
...and you don't wanna die.

561
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,000
No, I don't.

562
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,155
Because one day things might change.

563
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
Yeah.

564
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,873
Things might change.

565
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,679
Maybe they already have.

566
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,672
Come here, Barney.

567
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,074
Come here.

568
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,033
What if I could break you out of here?

569
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,793
Why would you break me out?

570
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,757
See, the trouble with the people in here
is the fucking meds they keep you on.

571
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,680
Ten years since we were back,

572
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,678
Barney, ten fucking years.

573
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Maybe the storm has passed.

574
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,759
Passed for you, then, has it, Tom?

575
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,958
What would the world do with me
if I was out?

576
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,355
I've a job for you.

577
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
Fuck!

578
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,350
Barney...

579
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,516
Barney, you were the best fucking sniper
in our company. Never missed.

580
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,877
I can use that man.

581
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,039
I'll get you the latest BSA,
fucking... telescopic sights.

582
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,316
Who am I shooting?

583
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,000
Fuck do you care, Barney?
Get that fucking thing off,

584
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,351
get you free.

585
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,631
- Are you all right in there?
- Grand in here.

586
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,914
What do you say, Barney?

587
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,479
I'll come for you...

588
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,517
...after midnight on Wednesday.

589
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,233
I don't keep track of days, Tom.

590
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
Don't have to.

591
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,393
You'll know it will be Wednesday,
cos there'll be a big fucking bang.

592
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,073
All right.

593
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
Big fucking bang.

594
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,673
Big fucking bang.

595
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,154
Big fucking bang.

596
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,960
It's fucking Wednesday!

597
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,116
Big bang on Wednesday!

598
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,040
They called from the Black Boy in Knowle.

599
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,719
They'll be here any minute.

600
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,791
I hear you agreed to give up the north.

601
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,274
I hear... there needs to be
some certainty in the south.

602
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,677
Some of my people were attacked
by members of the Titanic,

603
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,031
who've heard about a cargo.

604
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,311
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion

605
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,239
regarding who he can rely on
to offer him support in London.

606
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,872
Well, I would suggest the most competent
organiser of men in the south...

607
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,912
...is Alfie Solomons.

608
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,032
He's dead.

609
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,354
And he's Jewish!

610
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,955
And I'd say as far as
our boss is concerned,

611
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,471
him being dead would be less
of an obstacle than him being Jewish.

612
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,315
I think he'll give London to the Italians.

613
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,591
He likes Italians.

614
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,077
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

615
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,193
but you're going to have
to accept it, tinker boy.

616
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,555
I like Wincanton.

617
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,313
It's a grand old racecourse.

618
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,830
And that brother of yours,

619
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,600
the one who left me a hand grenade...

620
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,074
...he'd be the first of you tinkers
I'd go for if our truce should end

621
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,554
and the whistle blew.

622
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,434
Good. He's in the mood for a quarrel.

623
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,078
- We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.
- Yeah, I heard.

624
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,194
Yeah. Fun night. Got noisy, though.

625
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,116
And to think they all said I was mad
to take me dad with me, eh?

626
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,390
Your dad? Who's your dad?

627
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,796
This is my fucking dad.

628
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,838
Right here.

629
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,519
This is my fucking dad.

630
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,960
Where's Aberama?

631
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,117
He got off at Solihull.

632
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,358
Said if he sees Billy Boy here...

633
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,471
...he'll cut his fucking throat.

634
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
Tell the tinker

635
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,791
he's welcome to come and try it
any time.

636
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,195
Mm.

637
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,470
Is it all aboard?

638
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,470
Yeah.

639
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,829
It's all there.

640
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,479
We weighed it at the wharf.

641
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,920
We used cockney scales.

642
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,077
I wouldn't trust 'em.
They're probably crooked.

643
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,994
- But, er, I reckon seven tons.
- Curly?

644
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,349
Put ten sacks of flour

645
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,279
- onto Mr McCavern's boat.
- Tom!

646
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,754
I-I don't think it's really flour.

647
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,156
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.

648
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,555
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

649
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,796
Curly?

650
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,990
Hey, Arthur?

651
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,510
Someday, yes?

652
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,915
You and me.

653
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,600
Oh, Tommy, hey?

654
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,279
Fascists, hmm?

655
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,078
Look at 'em.

656
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,312
I fucking hate 'em. Always have done.

657
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,512
But you...

658
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,994
You, Billy Boy...

659
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,471
...oh, you're special.
Y'know, I fucking like him, Tommy.

660
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,478
I like yer.

661
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,353
I do. You're a man after me own heart.

662
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,517
- Someday, Mr Shelby.
- Yeah.

663
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,756
- Someday.
- Yeah.

664
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,950
Yeah.

665
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,992
You just tell me when, Tom.

666
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,514
You just tell me when.

667
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,953
So, er...

668
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,152
- ...so you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?
- Yeah.

669
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,640
Barney Thomason...

670
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,559
...is gonna kill...

671
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,878
...Oswald Mosley,
shoot him in the fucking head.

672
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,200
Yep.

673
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,999
While he's on stage.

674
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,873
While I'm stood next to him.

675
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,279
And then I will take over
as leader of the party...

676
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,711
...and you and Aberama can take care
of that bastard McCavern.

677
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,110
I had more complicated strategies in mind
for Mr Mosley.

678
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,270
Then he spoke badly

679
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,754
to my wife.

680
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,631
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

681
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,955
Yeah.
