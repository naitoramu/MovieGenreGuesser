2
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,281
You got nothing on me.
All right, you can call my lawyer,

3
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,598
Saul Goodman.

4
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:44,826
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

5
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:48,412
You hear me. I got nothing to say.
I told you. You can call my...

6
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:55,413
You had my cell phone number!
You had my wife's name!

7
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:56,727
How'd you do it?

8
00:04:56,852 --> 00:04:59,340
Talk!
Who you working with?

9
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,095
If you're ready to talk,

10
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,724
{\pos(192,210)}they want to get a statement.

11
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,827
{\pos(192,210)}Your side of what happened here.

12
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,074
Or we can hold him off
till another time.

13
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:41,106
Maybe you'll want to talk
to a lawyer.

14
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,650
There it is.

15
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:56,628
Yo, Adrian.

16
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,377
Rocky called.
He wants his face back.

17
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:03,155
{\pos(192,210)}Come on.
I got to cheer you up.

18
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,298
{\pos(192,210)}You see that?

19
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,053
That's your Get Out of Jail Free card.
You understand Get Out of Jail {\Free }card{\, right}?

20
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,349
{\pos(192,210)}Just blink once if you're following.

21
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,170
{\pos(192,210)}The D.A.'s worst nightmare

22
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,668
{\pos(192,210)}is that face out in public.

23
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,767
{\pos(192,190)}They're going to have to steer
a wide berth of young Master Pinkman

24
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:22,401
{\pos(192,190)}for fear of the P.R. poop storm
that will rain down on them

25
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,347
if this story ever gets out.

26
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:26,153
I mean, this beating?

27
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,119
{\pos(192,210)}Best thing for you.

28
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,991
{\pos(192,210)}You're home free.

29
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,518
Good, right?

30
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
Right.

31
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,328
{\pos(192,210)}You're now officially
the cute one of the group.

32
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,726
{\pos(192,210)}Paul, meet Ringo.
Ringo, Paul.

33
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,571
I am so sorry for this.

34
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:14,369
This should not have happened.

35
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,475
{\pos(192,210)}But it did.

36
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,565
No thanks to you.

37
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:26,978
{\pos(192,210)}But the plan did work.

38
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:30,454
{\pos(192,210)}We would have been locked up
right now if we didn't lure him away.

39
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,345
This, I just...

40
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,931
{\pos(192,210)}I never saw this coming.

41
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:47,735
What happens now?

42
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,519
What happens now?

43
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:53,446
{\pos(192,210)}I'll tell you what happens now.

44
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,233
{\pos(192,210)}Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished,

45
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,444
done.

46
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:02,416
You understand?

47
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,151
I will own him when this is over.

48
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,792
Every cent he earns,

49
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,384
every cent his wife earns,

50
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:15,547
is mine.

51
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,385
Anyplace he goes,

52
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,746
anywhere he turns,

53
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,895
I'm going to be there,

54
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,269
grabbing my share.

55
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:30,539
He'll be scrubbing toilets
in Tijuana for pennies,

56
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,220
and I'll be standing over him

57
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:35,206
to get my cut.

58
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,698
He'll see me when he wakes up
in the morning

59
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:41,154
and when he crawls to sleep

60
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,802
in whatever rat hole's left for him

61
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:46,599
after I shred his house down,

62
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,831
I will haunt his crusty ass

63
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:53,474
forever

64
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:55,668
until the day

65
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,504
he sticks a gun up his mouth

66
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,837
and pulls the trigger

67
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:04,848
just to get me out of his head.

68
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,009
That's...

69
00:10:09,252 --> 00:10:11,769
what happens next.

70
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:21,586
My advice...

71
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:25,779
that's probably not a good strategy.

72
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,879
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

73
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,547
But if you hit them,

74
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,800
they're forced to hit back hard.

75
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,888
They will turn over every rock
hither, thither, and yon

76
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,140
until someone spills
the beans on you

77
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,053
and anyone associated with you,

78
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:44,588
present company included.

79
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:47,730
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

80
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,722
Move on with your life.

81
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,307
Leave it behind, all of it.

82
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,877
Nothing changes.

83
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,580
Once I walk out of here,

84
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,554
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

85
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,812
How exactly do you think

86
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:10,857
you're going to get away with that?

87
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,421
They will catch you.

88
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,589
So what?

89
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,895
I have a Get Out of Jail Free card.

90
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,803
I may have overstated the...

91
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:21,722
the power of your face.

92
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,657
Not this.

93
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,186
If the cops catch me...

94
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:31,545
I give them what they want the most.

95
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
You.

96
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,229
They nab me,

97
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:46,826
I make a deal

98
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:51,827
to give up the great Heisenberg

99
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:56,450
and his million-dollar drug ring.

100
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:02,527
You're my free pass,

101
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,307
bitch.

102
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,314
You're so sure.

103
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:16,464
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him senseless,

104
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:17,987
he's never going to talk.

105
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:20,723
What do you think that was
in there, a bluff?

106
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,491
He wants your brother-in-law.

107
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,663
And there's going to be a {\parade of }many lawyers
creaming their underoos for {\a case like that}this case.

108
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:30,403
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

109
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,128
And him cooking again.

110
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:34,874
When, not if, he gets caught,

111
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,380
and he's facing 20 years,

112
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,546
what'll he do then?
Believe me,

113
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:41,010
there's no honor among thieves.

114
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,027
Except for us, of course.

115
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:46,652
No, he'll...

116
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:48,526
He'll come around.

117
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:51,837
And if he doesn't,

118
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:54,273
there may come a time
to talk options.

119
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:56,025
Options?

120
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:14,285
I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman
was involved in the manufacture

121
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,594
and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine,

122
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,919
specifically what we're calling
the blue meth.

123
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,715
I tracked him to a scrap yard

124
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,282
where he stored
an early '80s camper,

125
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:25,407
an RV.

126
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:29,046
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle,

127
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:31,821
which I believed to be
a rolling meth lab,

128
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:34,156
I received a telephone call

129
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,983
telling me my wife Marie

130
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:39,442
had been injured in an accident.

131
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,671
Upon hearing the news,

132
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,878
I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle

133
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,453
to tend to my wife.

134
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:50,079
After arriving at the hospital,
I learned the emergency call was a hoax.

135
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,407
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

136
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,789
So I immediately went back
to the salvage yard,

137
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:00,414
but the RV was gone.

138
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,741
Most likely destroyed on site.

139
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,554
And it was at this point that you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

140
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,276
I think we're done here.

141
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,594
Agent Schrader needs to get home,

142
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:24,239
get some rest.

143
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,507
That's fine.

144
00:14:25,756 --> 00:14:27,256
But just to confirm,

145
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,912
- you're taking the Fifth here?
- Yeah. That's correct.

146
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,757
We just want
to give you all a heads up.

147
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:39,109
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

148
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,547
He's given a detailed version

149
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,095
of events as he sees them.

150
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,424
- The word of a meth head.
- We know all about his history.

151
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:48,899
We're well aware,

152
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,799
but toxicology on Pinkman...

153
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,156
his blood is clean, he's not using.

154
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,840
The kid is even refusing
his doctor-ordered pain meds,

155
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,607
as far as we can tell.

156
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,792
Where do we go from here?

157
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,666
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down,

158
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,690
probably tomorrow morning.

159
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,789
Janice will give us
an exact time on that.

160
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:18,218
And you men will be
continuing your investigation.

161
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,707
- Thanks for your time.
- Right.

162
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:25,550
We just need one more thing.

163
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,219
Photo of Agent Schrader's hands,

164
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,307
for the record.

165
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:33,227
Yes, of course.

166
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,019
Bandage off, if you would.

167
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,075
On the table is fine.

168
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,640
Flat on the table is fine.

169
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:29,503
It's all going to work out.

170
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,578
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

171
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:35,787
I hope it goes without saying
that we're not

172
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,212
talking to anybody about this, okay?

173
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,098
Marie, who?

174
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,927
Do you have a minute?

175
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,050
Sure.

176
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,661
I guess crime does pay.

177
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:51,380
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

178
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,409
We need to talk.

179
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,063
You heard about Hank?

180
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,768
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

181
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,620
Yes, I know.

182
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,569
Whatever Hank was investigating,

183
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:12,256
him trying to find an RV,

184
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:14,456
is there any danger

185
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:17,156
that could lead back to you?

186
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,410
Why would it?

187
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:27,083
Is this why you're here?

188
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:30,586
I'm here to talk about Hank.

189
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:37,270
You know what's going to happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

190
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:42,241
Hank could lose everything.

191
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:47,371
I thought maybe...

192
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:51,734
There's a way you could help him.

193
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:53,642
How?

194
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:56,643
Contact Pinkman.

195
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,302
Get him to drop the charges.

196
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,796
Look, I don't know
what kind of relationship

197
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:04,048
you picture me having
with this person.

198
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,244
I'm not asking.

199
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:08,457
He's not my friend.

200
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,321
I mean,
it's not as if we were even close.

201
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,012
I'm not asking.

202
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,851
But there must be something
you could say.

203
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,875
Isn't it even worth a try?

204
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,892
Hank is your family.

205
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:27,310
Not currently.

206
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,801
I said not currently.

207
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,537
I'm late. I have to go.

208
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
I was starting to get worried.

209
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:15,853
Car trouble.

210
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,111
That's a bummer.

211
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,787
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

212
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,279
No sandals today?

213
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,250
I just thought...

214
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,475
a bit more professional.

215
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,507
Everything is on track.

216
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:44,178
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

217
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,950
Let's get our trays ready.

218
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:48,057
Clean, no moisture.

219
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:48,939
Done.

220
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:53,861
Is our...

221
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:56,649
Our solvent filtered?

222
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,233
I thought you might ask that.

223
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,111
Done.

224
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:03,931
That's good.

225
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:05,741
That's good.

226
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,670
Hand in glove.
That's what we strive for.

227
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:12,115
You know,

228
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:15,459
this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

229
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,452
So, you the gentlemen?

230
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:57,023
Lucky you{\* boys called me}. I got a load to pick up.
I'm taking the 40 {\straight }through to Memphis.

231
00:22:57,148 --> 00:22:59,549
I could hammer it out in about 15,
but there's a girl down there.

232
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:01,573
Lainie or Lolly or something.
Maybe Fran.

233
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,194
She's got one of these fetish things.
Wants to get peed on.

234
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,303
I was hoping to see her tonight,
but she wants to sleep before 10.

235
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,369
So I want to wrap it up here ASAP

236
00:23:09,494 --> 00:23:11,974
because traffic can be a wild card,
rubbernecking and such.

237
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,305
The surprising thing is

238
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,275
women who like to get peed on always
tend to be from the warmer climates.

239
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,352
You'd think the ones in the colder
zones would be more inclined.

240
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:23,067
Maybe it's a shock to the system
if the body's not properly acclimated,

241
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:26,665
but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

242
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,140
Science is a mystery.

243
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:31,647
Take a gander.

244
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,120
Prices are negotiable.
{\Buying in }A bulk gets you a discount.

245
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,992
I'm running a special
on these little honeys.

246
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:41,928
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known by the natives as Black Death.

247
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,878
Check it out. You like that?
So sweet, you want to lick it.

248
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:47,329
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat for panache.

249
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:50,094
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact.

250
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,640
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

251
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,601
Keep it. On the house?

252
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,562
{\Anyhow, }I've been windjamming long enough.
{\Why don't you boys }Tell me what you're looking for?

253
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,439
What do you need?
What can I do you for?

254
00:24:01,051 --> 00:24:01,899
Vests.

255
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:03,050
Vests?

256
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,925
Hell, yeah, we got vests.

257
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:06,436
Right here.

258
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:12,015
Sleek, comfortable,

259
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,445
thermally bonded
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

260
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,715
Stop a bullet like a soft wank
against a Quaker girl.

261
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,446
Just ain't getting through.

262
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:19,734
And lightweight?

263
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,086
Damn, so lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

264
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,089
They work?

265
00:24:25,943 --> 00:24:27,543
Sure as shit, they do.

266
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:30,251
I don't leave home without it.

267
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,459
What the hell?

268
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:44,522
You broke my freakin' rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

269
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,209
You're welcome!

270
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:40,110
What temperature did you set here?

271
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:41,235
There?

272
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,012
Station Five... 75 C.

273
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:48,877
I said 85.

274
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:50,800
8-5.

275
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:57,308
I wrote it down.
You said 75.

276
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,851
- I wrote it.
- Then you wrote it wrong.

277
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,104
That's not what I said.
I said 85.

278
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:06,524
It's always been 85...

279
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:09,914
not 75, not 95.

280
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:11,446
85.

281
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,624
This is chemistry.
Degrees matter.

282
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:20,204
I'm sorry.

283
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,294
I'm very sorry.

284
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:24,682
Great. You're sorry.

285
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:28,143
Meanwhile, you've just brewed
50 gallons of useless sludge.

286
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:29,464
Congratulations.

287
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,008
Just dump it. Dump it all.

288
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,726
This batch is ruined.

289
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,560
You look nice.

290
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:12,957
I look like a TV weatherman.

291
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:16,792
You want a coffee?

292
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,019
Nah.

293
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,915
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

294
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,451
I'm all right.

295
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,880
What are you going to tell them?

296
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,881
Here's what you're
going to tell them.

297
00:27:46,006 --> 00:27:48,018
He attacked you.

298
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,499
He attacked me?

299
00:27:51,196 --> 00:27:53,246
He swung at you with something.

300
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:56,622
Attacked you with a pipe.

301
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,189
With a pipe?

302
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:02,751
It happened fast.
He resisted arrest,

303
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:06,853
and muscle memory kicked in,
and you had to disarm him.

304
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,221
Muscle memory.

305
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,862
Yes.
It happens all the time.

306
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:14,303
Years of training, and your body
acted faster than your brain.

307
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,224
You had no choice but to hit him.

308
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,739
You had to fight back...

309
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:25,038
I'm not going to go in there
and lie.

310
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:29,210
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

311
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:32,895
Doing the job you're supposed to.

312
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:37,189
Why should you be the one who pays

313
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,332
for doing the right thing?

314
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:41,757
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

315
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,919
It's not what the job is.

316
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:48,721
I'm supposed to be better than that.

317
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:52,480
And you made one mistake.

318
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,130
No, it wasn't one mistake.
I've been...

319
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,121
I've been...

320
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,874
unraveling, you know?

321
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:13,492
I don't sleep at night anymore.

322
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:16,459
I freeze.

323
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,699
I freeze up.

324
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:24,013
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

325
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,391
I panic.

326
00:29:33,245 --> 00:29:35,345
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

327
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:38,157
Tuco Salamanca.

328
00:29:38,282 --> 00:29:41,612
If ever a scumbag deserved
a bullet between the eyes.

329
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:48,523
It changed me.

330
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:55,991
And I can't seem to control it.

331
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:01,696
I tried to fight it.

332
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:07,637
But then El Paso.

333
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,699
And it's just gotten worse.

334
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,559
What I did to Pinkman...

335
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,630
that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

336
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,382
All this...

337
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,413
everything that's happened,

338
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,213
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe

339
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:40,542
is trying to tell me something,

340
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,209
and I'm finally...

341
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,460
ready to listen.

342
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,348
I'm just not the man
I thought I was.

343
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:02,151
I think I'm done as a cop.

344
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:15,895
Now, this is not an easy decision,

345
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,976
but it is one that I have to make.

346
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:20,422
I'm sorry.

347
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:22,408
This whole...

348
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,036
Gale situation...

349
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:28,105
He's just not working out.

350
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,759
Yes. Now.

351
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,897
It may sound unorthodox,

352
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,072
but I think

353
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:41,974
our first best option...

354
00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:46,455
Is Jesse Pinkman.

355
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:00,604
No, look. There's...

356
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:04,445
There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

357
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,020
experience together

358
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:08,877
at a level that, quite frankly,

359
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:11,552
I'm just never going to reach
with Gale.

360
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,535
Look, Mr. Fring,

361
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,738
when I accepted your offer,

362
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:25,064
I was told the lab is mine.

363
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,526
And I know best how to run it.

364
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:34,413
Thank you.

365
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:38,927
Thank you.
Yes, I will. I will.

366
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,850
Good-bye.

367
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,178
Listen, something's come up.

368
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,329
I think it's a good opportunity.

369
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,336
There's been a job opening.

370
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:02,773
I need a new lab assistant.

371
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:07,572
I already did my time.

372
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,073
Why don't you just go
get yourself a monkey?

373
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,589
I don't want a monkey.
I want you.

374
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,415
Oh, gee, thanks.

375
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:21,459
Well, not interested.

376
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:23,753
I got my own thing

377
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:24,921
going on.

378
00:33:25,777 --> 00:33:26,873
Nice try

379
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,717
saving your ass head brother-in-law.

380
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:36,321
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

381
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,042
There's more.

382
00:33:39,842 --> 00:33:41,742
It's more than an assistant.

383
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:44,774
Partners.

384
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:48,260
We'll be partners again.

385
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:51,163
Split everything 50-50,
just like before.

386
00:33:53,829 --> 00:33:57,752
$1.5 million each.

387
00:34:12,113 --> 00:34:15,012
- I don't think you heard...
- I've heard...

388
00:34:15,568 --> 00:34:16,568
you fine.

389
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,821
I said no.

390
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,289
Let me understand this.

391
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,610
You're turning down $1.5 million.

392
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:33,914
I am not turning down the money.

393
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,044
I am turning down you.

394
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:38,951
You get it?

395
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:43,020
I want nothing to do with you.

396
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,171
Ever since I met you,

397
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:51,709
everything I have ever cared about

398
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:53,668
is gone...

399
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,973
Ruined, turned to shit,

400
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:02,928
dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

401
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,639
I have never been more alone.

402
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,964
I have nothing!

403
00:35:11,828 --> 00:35:13,060
No one!

404
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:16,782
All right?
It's all gone!

405
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,125
Get it?

406
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,221
Why...

407
00:35:24,808 --> 00:35:28,205
Why would you get it?

408
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:31,763
What do you even care
as long as you...

409
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:34,126
get what you want?

410
00:35:35,185 --> 00:35:36,302
Right?

411
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:40,666
You don't give a shit about me.

412
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,274
You said I was no good.

413
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:48,098
I'm nothing!

414
00:35:49,558 --> 00:35:51,886
Why would you want me?

415
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:56,741
You said my meth is inferior,

416
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,032
right?

417
00:35:58,797 --> 00:35:59,597
Right?

418
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,829
You said my cook was garbage!

419
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,146
Screw you, man!

420
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:16,180
Your meth is good, Jesse.

421
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:18,674
As good as mine.

422
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,259
<i>50-50.</i>

423
00:37:24,572 --> 00:37:25,995
Yes. 50-50.

424
00:37:31,189 --> 00:37:32,187
Partners.

425
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:40,085
Good.

426
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,187
This is the statement
you want to give?

427
00:38:33,086 --> 00:38:34,086
Yes, sir.

428
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,721
Hank, you don't have to do this.

429
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:41,131
I do.

430
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:43,751
I'm good.

431
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:51,643
So we understand if we write it up
like that, you'll sign it.

432
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,299
That's the way it happened.

433
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,173
I accept the consequences.

434
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
In the light of these facts...

435
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:10,642
As of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

436
00:39:11,344 --> 00:39:14,644
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

437
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,359
Yes, sir.

438
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,170
Hold up.

439
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:51,651
Yes, sir?

440
00:39:52,963 --> 00:39:54,645
I just want to tell you something.

441
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:57,050
And to be clear,
you didn't hear it from me.

442
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,941
I don't want you
to get your hopes up,

443
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:02,152
but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

444
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:04,863
Why not?

445
00:40:05,031 --> 00:40:06,652
Who the hell knows?

446
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:10,346
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

447
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:33,959
It went fine.

448
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:38,772
Well, fine means what it means.
Yeah.

449
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:44,319
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

450
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't know, baby.
I just think...

451
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,775
I think we may be okay.

452
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,791
Okay. I love you, too.

453
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,468
<i>I need you to listen very carefully.</i>

454
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:24,401
<i>Two men are coming to kill you.</i>

455
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:26,096
Come again?

456
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:28,129
<i>They're approaching your car.</i>

457
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:29,754
<i>You have one minute.</i>

458
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:33,174
I don't get the gag, jerk off.
Who is this?

459
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,549
<i>They're coming.</i>

460
00:41:55,398 --> 00:41:57,422
Gomie, {\it'is Hank. }I don't know
what that call's supposed to be,

461
00:41:57,547 --> 00:41:59,186
but it's dumb
even by your standards,

462
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,319
so call me when you get this.
