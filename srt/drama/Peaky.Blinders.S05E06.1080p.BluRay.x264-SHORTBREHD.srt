1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,196
There are some things
we need to discuss.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,155
Our friend Jimmy McCavern has asked
for control of the racecourses

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,475
north of Wincanton.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,034
I said yes.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,073
- In return for what?
- No return.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,636
None.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,596
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,791
It would have been a kindness.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,840
Now get out.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,394
This is a cheque guarantee.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,352
Signed by Mosley.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,672
On behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,472
<i>The consequence of good intentions.</i>

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,074
<i>My good intentions.</i>

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Push the button.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,916
Unlock the door and come home to me.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,479
I have a job for you.

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,473
I'll come for you...

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,398
...after midnight on Wednesday.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,954
Barney Thomason...

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,677
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,519
While he's on stage.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,154
While I'm stood next to him.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,834
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,317
<i>It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.</i>

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,076
Mmm.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,117
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,194
Yes, Mr Churchill.

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,715
Irish over Scotch.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,271
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,511
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,760
Grandmother in a tent.

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,712
My mother on a narrow boat.

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,516
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,877
A man needs to prove he is better than me

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,310
rather than show me his birth certificate.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,992
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,079
You speak beautifully in the House.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,873
- Thank you.
- And believe

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,832
not a word of what you are saying.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,918
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,350
You read Greek literature.

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,834
I have trouble sleeping.

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,834
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,516
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,840
So I made some enquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall,

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,352
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,239
You are spying on him.

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,158
Yes.

50
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Why?

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,154
The honest answer is...

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,355
...I'm no longer sure.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,757
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a gardener.

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,800
In fact, I have three gardeners.

56
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,677
Three generations of men
with no ambition...

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,117
...who are happier than I will ever be.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,075
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,715
that there are certain species of weed

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,116
that no matter how much you tug at them,

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,674
poison them,

62
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,076
they continue to grow back.

63
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,070
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the topsoil,

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,873
create a field of mud

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,834
and blow up and burn
the exposed taproots.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,915
That's what you and I did in France.

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,670
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,556
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,991
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,237
That's why you oppose him.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,829
Yeah.

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,395
Your mystery solved.

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,874
What is your strategy?

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,157
I won't burden you with it.

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,078
You're going to break the law.

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,716
I need to sleep.

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,272
You said you don't sleep.

78
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,278
I said I have trouble sleeping.

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
As do I.

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,236
As do I.

81
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
Mr Shelby...

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,280
...I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,394
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

84
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,557
both working to the same end.

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,034
We are in the same exact situation
here in Westminster.

86
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,039
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,795
And if you need anything, call me.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,719
There are some times, some nights...

89
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,995
...when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh.

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
That old dance routine.

92
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,799
I put out a cigar,

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,072
and an hour later I want another.

94
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,673
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,150
But use it anyway.

96
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,318
A tent.

97
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,715
Then a boat.

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,354
Then a house.

99
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,392
Now a mansion.

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,512
That's something.

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,676
Isn't it?

102
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, that is something.

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,552
By the way...

104
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,636
...was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

105
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
I forget his name.

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,793
Major Campbell.

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,515
Yes, Campbell.

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,279
No.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
It was my aunt.

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,355
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,278
and spend an evening with your family.

112
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,473
They sound interesting.

113
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,080
Yes.

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,078
They'd like that.

115
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,594
I got to Harold French, refereeing Liverpool.
He just wants cash.

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Tom the tatter,
reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,560
and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

118
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,956
The clap doctor said go easy
on the whiskey, yeah?

119
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,235
Finn.

120
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,310
You don't knock?

121
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,074
No, Finn.

122
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,317
I don't knock.

123
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,190
Right.

124
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,030
Hello, Billy.

125
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,873
How are you, mate?

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Good, Mr Shelby.

127
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,751
Yeah, you look good.

128
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,156
That's a nice suit.

129
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,634
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

130
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,240
He earned that suit.

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,592
We made more on the matches
than we did on the races last Saturday.

132
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
He's a good man.

133
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,480
Yeah, I know that. Mm.

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,592
You're coming up in the world, I like it.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,837
How's the missus, hmm?

136
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,879
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,150
She moved out.

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,272
Oh, that's a shame.

139
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,631
Mind if I join you, eh?

140
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,039
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?

141
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,473
You're a good man, Billy.

142
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,113
You're a good man, eh?

143
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,079
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

144
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,157
And what did we do, eh?

145
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,435
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

146
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,995
reveals himself.

147
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,430
The truth is young, Billy boy.

148
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,994
Yeah.

149
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,554
Here, look.

150
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,036
What have we got here? Oh, look.

151
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,550
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

152
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,239
Then there's some snow there, look.

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,036
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

154
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,958
Now, I know you like that, hmm?

155
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,309
Well, I do too.

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,592
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have
a little line together?

157
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,951
Eh? Why don't we do
a little bit of snow together?

158
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.

159
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,111
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.

160
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,709
Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

161
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,194
I do apologise.

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,357
And you. Hmm?

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,550
Look at you.

164
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,117
Sitting here with your mate, eh?
Your best mate.

165
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,833
Well, while you're sitting here,

166
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,236
talking about our business,

167
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,273
drinking whiskey, smoking and sniffing...

168
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,198
- Hmm?
- And working.

169
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,711
You remember, you tell this man

170
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,309
about our family business...

171
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,153
...and it's his life you're risking.

172
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,919
Cos people talk, Finn.

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,555
We... we only ever talk about football
and women, Mr Shelby.

174
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,396
Football and women,

175
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,816
we only ever... we only ever talk
about football and women.

176
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,559
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,353
It's...

178
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,675
Hmm.

179
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,914
Yeah.

180
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,800
Come on.

181
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,354
Family meeting, let's go.

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,816
You're not eating right.
You're not eating right.

183
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,914
You're not getting the natural things
in you, boy, that's what it is, always.

184
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,711
You bearing up, Arthur?

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,399
Bearing up for what?

186
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,831
Bearing up to being free, Pol.

187
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,673
Another glass, eh?

188
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,917
Another glass of so what.

189
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,632
Are you all right, Charlie?

190
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,880
Mad bastard Barney kicked me
in the shin when I woke him up.

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,320
Where is the mad bastard?

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,469
He's tied to a lamp-post outside
with three Lee boys,

193
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,592
shitting themselves.

194
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,233
A drink.

195
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
First of all,

196
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,830
an apology from Lizzie -
she can't be here.

197
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,510
Charles has a violin concert.

198
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,351
Also, a welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.

199
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,951
He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks, with my blessing.

200
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,994
From now on, Aberama will be welcome
at our meetings.

201
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,033
First item of business, a bereavement.

202
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,000
Colonel Ben Younger,

203
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,557
who may perhaps have become
a member of this family,

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,194
was taken from us,

205
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,391
four days ago,

206
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,193
by dark forces.

207
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,630
We've made some investigations,

208
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,717
and we think we know
who planted the bomb.

209
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,480
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,354
and the baby inside of her,

211
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,871
who may one day sit at these meetings,

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,550
but hopefully
under happier circumstances.

213
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,115
Let's drink to happier circumstances.

214
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,594
Yeah.

215
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,269
To Ada.

216
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,791
- To Ada.
- Ada.

217
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,395
Item number two.

218
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,954
An announcement,

219
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,150
regarding Michael.

220
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,239
Before you go on, Tommy,

221
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,195
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

222
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,313
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,909
According to your own estimations,

224
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,716
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

225
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,753
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

226
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,031
Therefore,

227
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,550
due to the amounts involved,

228
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,717
I think this company
should be restructured.

229
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,629
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

230
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,955
Restructured in what way?

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,037
Because of the amounts
of money involved,

232
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,992
shipment and dispatch will become

233
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,589
the primary source of income
to the company.

234
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,235
It's simple mathematics.

235
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,589
And with the help of my wife,

236
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,554
I will organise an expansion into America,

237
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,752
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

238
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,634
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,

239
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,390
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

240
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,281
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

241
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,434
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

242
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,914
with a regular supply

243
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,713
of pure opium from China,

244
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,116
within a short space of time,

245
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,998
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

246
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,151
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

247
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,191
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

248
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,879
they're on the inside,

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,514
not on the outside.

250
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,836
And as a member of the new generation,

251
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,749
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

252
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,397
A new decade is coming.

253
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,592
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

254
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,313
More money than we've ever had before.

255
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,673
Tommy,

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,032
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,279
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

258
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,756
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

259
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,439
Fuck Linda.

260
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Finn.

261
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
You've proved yourself.

262
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,039
You're part of the new generation.

263
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,917
You could come to New York with me.

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,278
Here is my proposal.

265
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,957
A full restructuring of the company.

266
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,152
I will be managing director.

267
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,431
And you can be nonexecutive chairman.

268
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,553
But under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

269
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,199
I've found the name of a dead man.

270
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,392
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

271
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,749
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

272
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,433
and you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

273
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,191
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

274
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,439
At least read it with an open mind.

275
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,995
It's cold in here, Michael.

276
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,831
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.

277
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,314
Item number three.

278
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,716
Tell him the truth.

279
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,876
Go on.

280
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,798
He can take it.

281
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,711
Tell me the truth, Michael.

282
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,354
The Americans don't want to deal with
an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.

283
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,437
Those days are done.

284
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,235
Tommy. He's bitten through
the fucking rope.

285
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,656
They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

286
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,558
Go and get him!

287
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,558
Fuck the Americans.

288
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

289
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,520
It's time.

290
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,436
And you know it.

291
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,439
Tommy, Mum's leaving...

292
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,878
...John's dead, Arthur needs help,

293
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,550
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard
because you fucked up.

294
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,751
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

295
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,360
Like the good old days.

296
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Or...

297
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,836
...see this for what it is.

298
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,234
A natural succession...

299
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,953
...that someday must happen.

300
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,109
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

301
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,794
Don't be here when I get back.

302
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
You.

303
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,720
You can tell your family...

304
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,797
Let me guess.

305
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,559
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

306
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,120
Right?

307
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,797
Well...

308
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,160
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

309
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,917
They're not fucking voices!

310
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,158
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

311
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,478
- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!

312
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
Barney!

313
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,230
Barney!

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,356
Put down the gun. At ease.

315
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,836
Finn.

316
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,953
At ease, soldier. At ease.

317
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,992
Look at me. You're on our side.

318
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,032
You're at home.

319
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,355
You're at home.

320
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,711
Yeah? Yeah.

321
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,674
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?

322
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,632
Yeah.

323
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

324
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,680
The devil will now be an angel.

325
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,712
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

326
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,910
Come, brother.

327
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,633
Let me give you the good news.

328
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,035
Jesus loves you.

329
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,474
So, where the fuck is he?

330
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,670
All right, boys.

331
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,750
A subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

332
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,071
Right.

333
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,714
Let's have the good stuff.

334
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,991
None of that shit ponces' drink.

335
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,077
Here we go, look.

336
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,954
All right, so item number three.

337
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,912
An introduction.

338
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,159
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.

339
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,112
In France, he was a comrade.

340
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

341
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,115
He's a man we can use, Johnny.

342
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear
and take bets on the outcome?

343
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,039
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

344
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,712
Aberama,

345
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,754
that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.

346
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,917
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

347
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,272
which will make his actions explicable
to the police.

348
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,198
What actions?

349
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,754
A killing.

350
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,120
And since when
did you worry about the police?

351
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,676
Barney Thomason...

352
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,833
...is gonna kill an MP.

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,794
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

354
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,230
What the fuck, Tom?

355
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,552
After the killing,

356
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,195
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

357
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,470
and Intelligence forces.

358
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,393
There will be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

359
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
We need there to be no connection to us.

360
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,556
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

361
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,070
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

362
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,032
He has known grievances.

363
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,120
No-one will question
that the assassination was carried out

364
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,596
by a single gunman acting alone.

365
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,918
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

366
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,271
If they catch him,

367
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,677
they won't hang him
on grounds of insanity,

368
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,440
just send him back to where I found him.

369
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,233
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

370
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,716
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

371
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,797
And where will this killing take place?

372
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
There you go.

373
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,350
He'll be on stage.

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,631
With lots...

375
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
...of witnesses.

376
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,191
During the rally,

377
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,994
there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

378
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,033
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

379
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,833
And we're organising this demonstration?

380
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,076
Yeah.

381
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,919
Where will you be, Tom?

382
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,431
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

383
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,000
...while the life drains from him.

384
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
Then I'll make a speech...

385
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,789
...saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

386
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
...continue safe in my hands.

387
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,436
Holy fuck.

388
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,114
Tommy...

389
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,273
...does your ambition have no limits?

390
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,394
Jimmy McCavern will be running security
at this event.

391
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,160
He'll probably be in the wings.

392
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
You can take his life
whichever manner you choose.

393
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,952
What do you want us to do, Tom?

394
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,072
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

395
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,760
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

396
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,111
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

397
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

398
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,832
No. I will medicate him.

399
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,431
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

400
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,792
In France, he never missed...

401
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,433
...no matter what they gave him.

402
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,189
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

403
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,039
Before he takes the shot,

404
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,200
Arthur here will give him some cocaine
to sharpen him up.

405
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,913
So just...

406
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,713
You're gonna be up on the stage

407
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,958
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

408
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,357
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

409
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,352
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

410
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,791
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

411
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,914
After the killing,

412
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,431
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

413
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,711
Use that opportunity

414
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,151
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge locks.

415
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

416
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,478
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

417
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,718
£250,000.

418
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,353
Every man in this room
will receive $30,000 in cash,

419
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,358
in recognition of extra services.

420
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,791
Holy Mary, Mother of God, Tom!

421
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,160
Anyone who wants to leave,
leave now.

422
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,672
Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

423
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,760
backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.

424
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,510
Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.

425
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,756
Good.

426
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,636
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

427
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,831
Johnny, bring the van round.

428
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,953
What's the fire for, Tom?

429
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,712
There is an item number four.

430
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,350
It's time.

431
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,113
Jeez, Mr Shelby.

432
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,994
If I'd have known, I'd have come in early
and served you drinks, huh?

433
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,634
Here, Micky.

434
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,670
Sit down there.

435
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,434
So I'll have a drink, will I?

436
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,154
Here you go, have a drink.

437
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,752
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.

438
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,435
To collect some cargo.

439
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,752
I was met by the Titanic boys.

440
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,952
They knew I was coming.

441
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,909
Yeah. When, where, what time.

442
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,156
They even knew...

443
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,856
...the cargo I was picking up.

444
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,075
Jesus.

445
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,112
Four days ago, Micky...

446
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,520
...a soldier was killed...

447
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,914
...outside my office...

448
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,270
...by a bomb.

449
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,030
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.

450
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,320
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

451
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,239
No. It weren't the IRA.

452
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,270
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

453
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,516
They're friends of mine.

454
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,595
I asked them what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

455
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,995
They told me that...

456
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,240
...30 minutes before the explosion
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill

457
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,876
who has connections
to the Ulster Volunteer Force.

458
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,356
He now offers his services for cash.

459
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,278
Paddy Rose.

460
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,630
Yeah, me and my brother,
we spoke to Paddy.

461
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,070
At length.

462
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

463
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,316
Yeah, we spoke to him.

464
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,998
We killed him, Micky.

465
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,394
Paddy Rose is dead.

466
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,637
We weighed him down,

467
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,752
we sunk him...

468
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,031
...to the bottom of the Grand Union Canal.

469
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,751
The girls at the exchange
gave me the number

470
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,031
of the man that called, Micky,
before the explosion.

471
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,435
That was your number.

472
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,519
Micky, it was you who called him.

473
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
You tipped him off.

474
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,756
You were told to call him

475
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,440
if a black man of a certain description
ever came to Small Heath.

476
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,636
We know you've... you've been giving
the Titanic boys information as well.

477
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
We know that.

478
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,994
Yeah.

479
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,079
You've been working behind the bar, hmm?

480
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,672
Seeing what goes on, listening,
taking notes,

481
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,555
and selling your stories
to the highest bidder. Hmm?

482
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,232
Yeah.

483
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Come on.

484
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,270
Come on, man.

485
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,520
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

486
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,354
I'm sorry, Mr Shelby.

487
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,636
Don't look at Tommy.

488
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
The ceiling would be cheaper, brother.

489
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,109
Micky!

490
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,799
Fucking hell, Arthur.

491
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,149
Eh?

492
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,272
Shaking like the hand of a normal man.

493
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,276
What about item five, Tom?

494
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,436
Huh?

495
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,478
There is an item five, right, Tommy?

496
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,592
I'm fucking sinking here, man.

497
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,240
I'm fucking sinking, Tom.

498
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,837
You... you... you said there's an item five.

499
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,553
Say it, Tommy.

500
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,594
Item five could start now, Tommy.

501
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,997
It could start this year, a new decade.

502
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,634
M-M-Michael...

503
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,150
Michael could be right -
we could go, Tommy.

504
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,999
We could go.

505
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,077
We could fucking leave this place.

506
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,919
We could leave it to the kids.

507
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,475
Michael's... He might be right.

508
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,512
- He might be fucking right.
- Arthur!

509
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,554
There is no item number five!

510
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,397
Go and check
that Polly is still on our side.

511
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,239
I have to go to Margate.

512
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,635
All right, Tom.

513
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,875
All right, brother!

514
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,872
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

515
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,394
You out there, Tommy?

516
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,431
Yeah. I'm here.

517
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,589
I was just having some oil rubbed
into the bits that really hurt, mate.

518
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,792
What do you think of that view, eh?

519
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,312
It's Margate. What can you do?

520
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,256
I'll tell you something, Tommy, right?

521
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,557
I sit all day every day in that chair,

522
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,515
on that balcony,
contemplating the fact, right,

523
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,917
that life is so much easier to deal with
when you are dead!

524
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,713
- Hello, Alfie.
- Yeah.

525
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,832
Did you... did you look
through the binoculars?

526
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,030
Yeah.

527
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,231
I watch ships. No two are the same.

528
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,192
Yeah.

529
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,757
That is how God sees us both, in his eyes.

530
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,234
God, eh?

531
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,840
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you know.

532
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,759
Someone's responsible
for all this fucking mess.

533
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Now...

534
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,199
How soon did you know
that I was not dead?

535
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,834
You wrote me a letter, Alfie.

536
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,155
Did I?

537
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,033
Yeah, you asked about your dog.

538
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,720
They gave me a lot of drugs at first.

539
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,400
Hmm. Yeah, all right.

540
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,159
I was lying out there,

541
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,193
and the tide had come in,
and it woke me up.

542
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,994
I remember looking around
and thinking, you know...

543
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,390
..."Fuck...

544
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,398
"...if this is hell...

545
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,478
"...it looks a lot like Margate."

546
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,593
Maybe that's just what hell looks like,
eh?

547
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,509
No, no, not according
to this holy book right here, yeah?

548
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,758
It gives a very, very vivid description.

549
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,678
You and I are both fucked, mate.

550
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,392
Do you read the papers, Alfie?

551
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,352
No, don't be silly.

552
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,836
But you've heard.

553
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,713
What, fascism, yeah?

554
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,756
Three,

555
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,473
two,

556
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,319
one,

557
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,920
bang.

558
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,110
No?

559
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,760
Fine.

560
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,475
Good Lord, your fucking condition
has got worse, mate.

561
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,354
Mine, on the other hand,

562
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,119
I've been living the dream.

563
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,233
Sometimes, I will shoot
at the side of a ship.

564
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,114
And sometimes I'll sit here,
I may shoot at the old seagull.

565
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,435
Alfie...

566
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,711
...I'm gonna shoot Oswald Mosley.

567
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,069
Right, well...

568
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,233
...I hope you do a better job on him
than the one you done on me, yeah?

569
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,357
I mean, what... what were you thinking?
Was your mind somewhere else, Tommy?

570
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,799
Yes, it was, actually.

571
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,231
Yeah, all right.

572
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,999
Oh, look.

573
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,196
A ship.

574
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,159
Why do you want to shoot him?

575
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,198
I need to organise a riot, Alfie.

576
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Right.

577
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,280
And I hear you still have some... standing

578
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,710
in the Jewish community.

579
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,197
Let me be clear, right?

580
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,676
Since my resurrection,

581
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,589
I am considered to be a god, all right?

582
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,953
In the Holy Land,
someone has made an image of me

583
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,437
out of rock embedded in the sand,
so I'm told,

584
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,076
and I am planning to make
a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.

585
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,389
Are you going to shoot him
because this man is evil?

586
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,954
I need men who can fight.

587
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,829
Mosley uses men from Glasgow.

588
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,034
So if the men causing the trouble
are Jewish it will be... explicable.

589
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,800
Since when did you need explanations,
Tommy?

590
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,798
Since I entered politics.

591
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,479
Oh, that's right, yeah.

592
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,672
Oh, yeah.
And how has that been for you, Tom?

593
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,952
Gangs, wars, truces...

594
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,037
Nothing I didn't already know.

595
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,995
So you think if you kill him, you...
you will kill the message, yeah?

596
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,637
I will kill the man,

597
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,513
then I will kill the message.

598
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,594
How much you paying?

599
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,536
I thought you might do it for the cause,
Alfie.

600
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Fuck off.

601
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,558
Each man will get £20.

602
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,558
You'll get £5,000.

603
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,239
You know, as a god, Tommy, right,

604
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,038
I am now able to just rise above
those kinds of insults, mate.

605
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,674
Ten?

606
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,149
How is my dog?

607
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,750
Your dog is fine.

608
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,312
In that case, ten should be enough.

609
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,556
Where do you want the men?

610
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
Birmingham.

611
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,790
No. No.

612
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,673
20 will not be enough

613
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,190
for my lads to step inside
that fucking shit-hole.

614
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,154
It will have to be 25 at least.

615
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,880
25 it is.
You can take your dog back, then, eh?

616
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,469
No, it's better for him
to think that I am still dead.

617
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,076
As it is also with the police.

618
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,189
Right.

619
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,198
So you're still at it, eh, Tommy?

620
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,118
Hmm.

621
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,197
You ain't got no Margate to go to.

622
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,954
No.

623
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,157
And I have no interest
in shooting seagulls.

624
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,114
Oh, you have
in shooting Cabinet ministers?

625
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Yeah.

626
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,840
And their paid informants.

627
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,633
Mm.

628
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,160
I was on a lot of drugs at first, right,
due to the pain, you know,

629
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,760
on account of it...

630
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,399
Well, you know,
being shot in the face by... some cunt.

631
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,399
I won't bore you with the details
of the trivia.

632
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,752
Nonetheless, I had a recurring dream.

633
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,070
I saw you in a field, right?

634
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,600
With a big black horse.

635
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,636
And you said goodbye, and then... bang.

636
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,120
All right, then. Well, what now?

637
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
I will continue...

638
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,836
...till I find a man that I can't defeat.

639
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,794
Hmm.

640
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,031
Arthur asked whose side I was on.

641
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,240
There will be a war.

642
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,960
And one of you will die.

643
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,795
But which one, I cannot tell.

644
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,919
Hmm.

645
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,630
He's gonna do it anyway.

646
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,680
- Yeah.
- You should know,

647
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,474
if Aberama takes his side,
I will kill him.

648
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,275
What about me?

649
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,237
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

650
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,754
Kill... and kill.

651
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,431
It's the only way to make people listen.

652
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,350
Soon you'll have a stage to stand on.

653
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,438
Millions of people will listen to you.

654
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,634
And you will run the country
like you run this family.

655
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,877
It appears to be what people want.

656
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
But not me.

657
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,593
Not any more.

658
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,598
My resignation.

659
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,995
If it's Barney you're worried about,
he's sleeping.

660
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,476
But I can't sleep
because my fucking leg is cracked.

661
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,957
Tell me how my mother went, Charlie.

662
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,433
You know.

663
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,880
She drowned.

664
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,591
I know it wasn't by accident.

665
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,999
Tell me the truth, Charlie.

666
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,839
The truth, Tommy, yeah?

667
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,519
The fucking truth.

668
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,516
Fuck's sake.

669
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,553
She just stepped into the canal.

670
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,720
Your dad was no use.

671
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,832
It was me trying to stop her,
for three days.

672
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,396
In the end, she did it anyway.

673
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,438
- Did she say why?
- Nothing that made sense.

674
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,756
Tell me the things
that didn't make sense.

675
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,030
She said it were the Gypsies
made the nails for Jesus's cross.

676
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,913
That's why we're cursed and restless.

677
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,191
Yeah, go on.

678
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,915
You have to move around
or the guilt catches up with you.

679
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,075
I said,
"Well, why not go on the road for a bit?"

680
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,554
She went to Worcester.

681
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,279
She came back with a white pony.

682
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,835
That one she gave to you.

683
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,510
You used to ride it round, remember?

684
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,715
Well, she seemed happy for a bit,
watching you ride it.

685
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,789
And then she was gone.

686
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,997
None of it made any sense.

687
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,476
Afterwards, whenever I looked
at that white pony, I saw her.

688
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,471
You see, I was in love with her, Tom.

689
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,554
No-one knew but me.

690
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,629
Broke my fucking heart
to pull her from the cut.

691
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,838
You know, your grandfather,
he went the same way.

692
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,917
Suicide.

693
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,191
Sometimes, these things run in the family.

694
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,071
Fuck family, Tom.

695
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,954
You just have to get on with it.

696
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,196
You're a Gypsy.

697
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,551
You have to move around,
or it all catches up with you.

698
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,277
Didn't need all them tablets,

699
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,837
just needed another fucking war, eh?

700
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,240
Perish Judah.

701
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,680
Perish Judah.

702
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,796
Shalom, my friends. Shalom.

703
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,559
Shalom. Shalom.

704
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,234
In you go, buddy.

705
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,592
Show these fascist bastards no mercy,
brothers.

706
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,994
The Jew and the Gypsy united.

707
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,476
Look, I have got to go, yeah?
I have to go.

708
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,829
Go where?

709
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,633
They're shooting a fascist tonight.

710
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,035
You're gonna do what?

711
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,310
Ssh.

712
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,797
Mosley's in town.

713
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,274
Really?

714
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,154
Look, go into town,

715
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,272
get some drink and some girl

716
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,596
and listen to the radio.

717
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,473
We will not stand by and let this scum
have free rein in our city!

718
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:13,117
Fascism must not be allowed to voice
its creed of hatred.

719
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,632
Out the fucking way!

720
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,879
We have a right to protest!

721
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,275
Get back!

722
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,438
Anybody heckles you,
beat the fuck out of them.

723
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,912
We have a right to protest!

724
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,111
We got another one. Let's go. Get, get!

725
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,435
Calm yourself down.

726
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,837
It's not against the law to protest.

727
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,959
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Out of the way.

728
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,080
Let her go.

729
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,056
- I don't need the help of a fascist.
- Yes, you do.

730
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,073
At Steelhouse Lane,
they'll do whatever they want to you.

731
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Let her go.

732
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,558
I'm Tommy Shelby, and I'm ordering you
to let her fucking go. Go on.

733
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,470
Fuck you.

734
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,594
Jessie, you can do more damage
from the inside.

735
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,712
Do you understand?

736
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,400
You can do more damage from the inside.

737
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,233
Come on.

738
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,476
Come on.

739
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,399
Out of the way. Out of the way.

740
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,954
Shut up!

741
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,073
Here, look.

742
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,839
There, look.

743
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,433
I'll join you.

744
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,074
Play high.

745
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,776
Now, you know what you're doing,
don't you?

746
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,951
Yeah. Tommy checks his pocket watch,

747
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,116
I count ten,

748
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,879
then I blow the other bloke's head off.

749
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,593
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

750
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,995
There, that's for after.

751
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,271
Thank you. Thank you.

752
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,232
- See you later, Arthur.
- Oh, soldier.

753
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,990
Soldier, you do that, you run like fuck.

754
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,839
- Don't stop.
- Run like fuck.

755
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,838
- Yeah.
- Run like fuck.

756
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,074
In here.

757
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,394
Here, for your face.

758
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,193
At least I have only one face.

759
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,199
What did you mean,
"damage from the inside"?

760
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,640
I have a strategy.

761
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,319
You always have a strategy.

762
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
But it's dangerous,

763
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,955
and it can't be shared
without sharing the danger.

764
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,355
You think I'm afraid?

765
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,871
No, but it's only gonna put you
in more danger.

766
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,118
Jessie, before the speeches start,
just go home.

767
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,879
There's gonna be lots of arrests.

768
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,336
You have a mark against your name.

769
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,999
Why?

770
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,315
What's going to happen?

771
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,640
I'm gonna do a good thing.

772
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,353
Whenever I do a good thing,

773
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,517
innocent people get hurt.

774
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,676
So go home.

775
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,237
After this evening, we can meet,
discuss strategy.

776
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,558
That beast out there, he's just a beast.

777
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,478
It's like a horse.

778
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,513
It's the rider that decides
what direction it takes.

779
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,869
And who will be the rider?

780
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,509
Just go home.

781
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,316
Full?

782
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,193
To the fucking brim.

783
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,680
Trouble?

784
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,439
So far, a few communists.

785
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,195
Bullers helped our boys clear them away.

786
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,074
Well, a few hecklers are a good thing.

787
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,590
We can illustrate
how we deal with opposition.

788
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,430
There is a rumour a gang of Jews
are coming up from Digbeth.

789
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,119
No sign of them yet.

790
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,833
Well, let them come.

791
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,553
Welcome them appropriately.

792
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,872
There are a few Peaky boys around.

793
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,349
They are your allies.

794
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,597
There'll be no rifts between us.

795
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,439
Keep your powder dry.

796
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,278
Mr McCavern?

797
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,631
Perish Judah.

798
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,879
No joke, Mr McCavern.

799
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,960
Perish Judah.

800
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,555
You turn the radio on
and turn up the volume.

801
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,399
I want to listen to the news.

802
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,431
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

803
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,916
Mr Oswald Mosley.

804
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,870
Perish Judah!

805
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,995
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

806
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,954
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

807
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,551
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah!

808
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,153
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

809
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,954
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

810
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,474
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

811
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,638
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

812
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,353
Perish Judah!

813
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,316
Welcome, men and women
of Birmingham.

814
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,275
Thank you for coming here
on this cold, dark night,

815
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,076
in spite of the obstruction
and provocation of our enemies.

816
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,473
Our enemies deal in bricks and stones

817
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,470
and bottles. We deal in reasoned
principle, argument and fact.

818
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,272
Among those enemies,
we can number Mr Winston Churchill,

819
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:42,475
who last night condemned me
in the House as a threat to democracy.

820
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,277
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

821
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,840
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

822
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,511
But then Mr Churchill has never been
a friend of the common people.

823
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,871
Faced with the alternative

824
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,469
<i>of saying goodbye to the gold standard,</i>

825
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,069
<i>and therefore to his own employment,</i>

826
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,352
<i>he characteristically selected the latter,</i>

827
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,960
<i>but of course...</i>

828
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,754
<i>...not all attending tonight</i>

829
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,872
<i>will be convinced of our cause.</i>

830
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,597
<i>Some will have come here tonight
to find out for themselves</i>

831
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,837
<i>what we stand for.</i>

832
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,634
Whenever you're ready, Tom.

833
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,719
So here are our guiding principles.

834
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,754
Every citizen shall serve the state.

835
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,351
Not the banks, not factions,

836
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,756
not the Jews!

837
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,275
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

838
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,034
The barriers of class will be abolished

839
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,913
and a greater Britain will be born

840
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,920
of the national socialist
and fascist creed.

841
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,476
It is useless to hide from ourselves
the fact that ever since 1918,

842
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,990
when our heroes returned from France,

843
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,911
our empire has shown all the signs
of disintegration,

844
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,432
and our people are threatened
by gathering disaster.

845
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,433
Get out of my way!

846
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,789
Out of the way!

847
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,274
Go. Go.

848
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,958
Ten.

849
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,390
Nine.

850
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,159
Eight.

851
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,719
Seven.

852
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,513
Six.

853
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,600
Five.

854
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,871
Four.

855
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,639
Three.

856
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,274
Two apple crumble...

857
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,074
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man,

858
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,873
until this thing is sorted.

859
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,476
The coppers are here, Arthur.
You gotta get away from the body.

860
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,080
What the fuck are you doing here?

861
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,236
What happened?

862
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,680
I don't know what happened.

863
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,872
I don't know what fucking happened.
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

864
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,469
Wait. Fuck, it's us.

865
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,511
Aberama's dead, he's gone.

866
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,757
He's gone, and they came for me, too.

867
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,355
What the fuck is she doing here?

868
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,199
Arthur, they got to Barney.

869
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,674
They knew everything.

870
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,473
They knew fucking everything.

871
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,796
Who? Who knew, Tom?

872
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,354
Johnny, get this woman out of here.

873
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,596
- I want to know.
- Yeah.

874
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,712
Get her out of here. Get her out!

875
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,760
Doesn't make sense.

876
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,034
Doesn't make fucking sense.

877
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,958
Who? Who? Who?

878
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,437
The Chinese, the Italians...

879
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,591
...the Branch, Intelligence,
McCavern, Mosley...

880
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,315
Mosley knew nothing!

881
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,510
He knew nothing!

882
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,753
Who?!

883
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,599
Jesus fucking Christ.

884
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,394
You're fucking frightening me, Tom.

885
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,795
Doesn't make sense.

886
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,434
Who?

887
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,876
Who? Who?

888
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,832
Who?

889
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,600
Who? You know, Tom, you must know.

890
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,350
You're fucking scaring me,
what are you doing?

891
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,757
Talk to me.

892
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,318
Maybe I've found him, Arthur,
the man I can't defeat.

893
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,032
- Mosley?
- I don't know.

894
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,310
I don't fucking know.

895
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,400
Doesn't make sense.

896
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
Let's...

897
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,755
Let's go inside.

898
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,749
We'll work it out...

899
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,832
- ...have a drink.
- I need to walk.

900
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,877
The work is all done, Tommy.

901
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,673
It's all done.

902
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,793
We can walk away from all of this.

903
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,513
It's so easy.

904
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,359
It's so soft.

905
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,437
Such a small change.
