1
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,359
That's it.

2
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:30,155
Can I just, you know, look at it for a minute?

3
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,283
You're an artist, Sid.

4
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,248
You're telling me you're just gonna walk out of here and I'm never going to see it again.

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,875
There's a good chance of that, yes.

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,088
Most guys, you know, for the first one, they start with something small.

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,299
"Mom", girlfriend's initials, something like that.

8
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,051
Not you.

9
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,638
You get a full set of sleeves, all in a couple of months.

10
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,891
Takes guys a few years to get the ink you got.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,261
I don't have a few years.

12
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:03,528
Wish to hell I did.

13
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:59,415
The vault. Open it.

14
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,122
We can't. The branch manager's not here.

15
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,750
Where is he?

16
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,877
It's lunchtime. He's at White Castle.

17
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:07,794
White Castle?

18
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,254
It's a fast food restaurant.

19
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,174
They serve those little square burgers.

20
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,926
I know what it is.

21
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,764
I'm not playing games. Open it.

22
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,475
Sir, you have a half a million dollars cash in your bag.

23
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,102
Don't you think it would be better...?

24
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,158
This is the police. You are completely surrounded.

25
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,037
Put down your weapon.

26
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,208
Put down your weapon now.

27
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,508
Rarely in the case of armed robbery do we hear a plea of no contest.

28
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,885
Are you sure about this, Mr. Scofield?

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,006
I'm sure, Your Honor.

30
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,523
Your Honor, we'd like to recess if we could.

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,516
My client's a bit confused at the moment.

32
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,518
- I'm not, Your Honor.
- He is, Your Honor.

33
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,312
Perhaps you should heed your representation's advice,

34
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,148
take some additional time to consider your response.

35
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,775
I've already done that, Your Honor.

36
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,492
I'll retire to my chambers to determine sentencing.

37
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,744
Court's recessed until 1:30.

38
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,205
Come on, Let's go.

39
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,748
Uncle Mike?

40
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:30,586
I didn't want you to come.

41
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,254
Go home, LJ.

42
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,506
I didn't want you to see this.

43
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,298
He's not gonna take this well.

44
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,786
Can you blame him? He's your nephew.

45
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,521
He's beginning to get that anybody he attaches himself to is gonna end up in prison...

46
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,900
and he's not the only one who's starting to feel that way, Michael.

47
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:55,861
Will you give us a minute?

48
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:56,862
One minute.

49
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,281
Don't you understand?

50
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:01,391
You just put the book in that woman's hand

51
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,535
and she's gonna lob it at you like a grenade.

52
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,787
Justice and punishment are the same thing to her.

53
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:06,991
I know.

54
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,855
Then will you please tell me what's going through your head?

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,959
We've been over this.

56
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,336
I've known you my entire life.

57
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,617
You don't have a violent bone in your body,

58
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:16,665
and I know you didn't need the money.

59
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,549
Veronica.

60
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:19,563
Why won't you let me help you?

61
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,971
You've been good to me. My whole life, you have...

62
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,433
but you've gotta let me deal with this. Okay?

63
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,645
Given your lack of prior criminal conduct,

64
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,980
I am inclined toward probation.

65
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,983
However, the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon

66
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,070
during the commission of the crime suggests malice to me.

67
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,112
For that reason,

68
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:43,283
I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

69
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,870
It says here that you've requested to be incarcerated

70
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,956
somewhere near your home here in Chicago.

71
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm willing to honor that.

72
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,209
The closest level one facility to...

73
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,168
Level one?

74
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,170
That's maximum security, Your Honor.

75
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,673
I would ask counsel to refrain from interrupting me.

76
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,341
As I was saying,

77
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,220
the closest level one facility would be Fox River State Penitentiary.

78
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,265
As for the term of your sentence, I'm setting it at five years.

79
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,976
You'll be eligible for parole in half that time.

80
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,894
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

81
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,368
All right, people, step inside the door and check yourself for bugs.

82
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,121
When you hear the knock, step out. Keep the line moving.

83
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,039
We ain't got all day to get this done.

84
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,122
No more talking in line.

85
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:36,183
Move it. You got less than five minutes to take a shower.

86
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:38,839
Keep the line moving. Keep it moving. Move it. Right now.

87
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:39,756
Let's go. Move, move.

88
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,245
Next!

89
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:42,593
Next down in the banks, dress. Let's go.

90
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:43,978
Name and back number.

91
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,380
Scofield, Michael. 94941.

92
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:46,817
Are you a religious man, Scofield?

93
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:47,972
Never really thought about it.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,699
Good, 'cause the Ten Commandments don't mean a box of piss in here.

95
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:53,605
We got two commandments and two only.

96
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,371
The first commandment is you got nothing coming.

97
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,648
What's the second commandment?

98
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,192
See commandment number one.

99
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,444
Gotcha.

100
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,779
You talking out the side of your neck?

101
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,072
Come  again?

102
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,074
I said, are you being a smartass?

103
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,244
Just trying to fly low, avoid the radar, boss.

104
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,496
Do my time... and get out.

105
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,958
There isn't any flying under my radar.

106
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,335
Good to know.

107
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,969
Hey, can a brother get some air conditioning up here, coach?

108
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:42,636
It's hotter than a crack ho's mouth, man.

109
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,030
To  hell with the A.C., man. Give me the crack ho.

110
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,117
Come on!

111
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,790
Yo, Fish! What you looking at?

112
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,459
You look kind of pretty to be up in here, man.

113
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:58,919
Fish!

114
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,631
I suggest you take a seat, Fish.

115
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,260
Ain't nothing to do up in here but serve time.

116
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,345
Ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.

117
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,988
Welcome to Prisneyland, Fish.

118
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,891
You wanna talk about it?

119
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,268
No, it's not worth talking about.

120
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,145
If it's keeping you up, it is.

121
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,438
Oh, it's just...

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,732
it's nothing, you know.

123
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,443
Michael's case.

124
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,862
You did the best you could.

125
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,447
Yeah, but he didn't.

126
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,326
He just sort of rolled over. He didn't put up a fight.

127
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,577
It's not like him.

128
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,081
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about him.

129
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,918
Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind, right?

130
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,254
Good night.

131
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,516
All wings, guard coming out.

132
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,684
All wings, guard coming out.

133
00:08:41,463 --> 00:08:44,223
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops.

134
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,318
Nortenos got the bleachers.

135
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,278
Woods got the weight pile.

136
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,989
The C.O.s got the rest.

137
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,199
I'm telling you,

138
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,952
the guards are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.

139
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:56,745
The only difference between us and them...

140
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,996
is the badge.

141
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,581
Who's the pet lover?

142
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,549
He'll deny it, but he's D.B. Cooper.

143
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:05,700
Parachuted out of a plane 30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.

144
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,041
Doesn't look like the type.

145
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:08,138
Who does?

146
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:11,265
Hey! What up, Wholesale? You okay?

147
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,553
Gonna be greater later.

148
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:13,095
Yeah.

149
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,013
What you doing with this fish, man?

150
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,602
He's my new cellie.

151
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:19,393
Wholesale's got it wired up out of commissary.

152
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,239
Anything you want, he can get it for you.

153
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,032
You keep handing out my jacket,

154
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,674
I swear I'm gonna bust your grape.

155
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:26,900
Man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa with a set of cleats on.

156
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,065
What are you talking about?

157
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:29,417
Man, you want to bump your gums.

158
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:31,445
Oh, no, no. Now you're talking, talking, talking...

159
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,891
I'm looking for someone.

160
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,020
Guy named Lincoln Burrows.

161
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,396
Linc the Sink?

162
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,104
That  what they're calling him now?

163
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:06,690
Yeah.

164
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,694
As in, he'll come at you with everything but the kitchen... Snowflake.

165
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,283
Where can I find him?

166
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,240
Man killed the vice-president's brother.

167
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,247
and in a month, he's getting the chair,

168
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:20,092
which means no one up this river is more dangerous than him,

169
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,788
'cause he's got nothing to lose now.

170
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,662
What are they gonna do? Kill him twice?

171
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,167
There a way I can get to him?

172
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,630
Oh, no. The only time those boys get out is for chapel and P.I.

173
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,298
- PI? What's that?|- Prison Industry.

174
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,425
The guys that get along, get to work.

175
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,929
You know, painting, scrapping, making mattresses, you name it.

176
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,140
I wouldn't get excited, though, if I were you, Fish.

177
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,351
You ain't sniffing none of P.I.

178
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,571
Why's that?

179
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,402
'Cause John Abruzzi runs it.

180
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,855
John Abruzzi John Abruzzi?

181
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,233
John Abruzzi John Abruzzi.

182
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,871
Why you wanna see Burrows so bad anyhow?

183
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,823
Because he's my brother.

184
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,262
They denied the motion.

185
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,012
Then do it again.

186
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,430
I can't. That's it.

187
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,432
May 11. That's the date, man.

188
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,644
That's the date they, uh... you know... execute me.

189
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:26,854
I know.

190
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,862
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

191
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,655
The evidence says you did.

192
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,286
I don't care what the evidence says. I didn't kill him.

193
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,951
Swear to me.

194
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,705
I swear to you, Michael.

195
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,838
But how did they get it wrong then?

196
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,840
The courts, the appeals...

197
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,925
Don't know. Don't know.

198
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,013
I keep thinking, looking back on it is, uh... I was set up.

199
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,015
And, whoever it was that set me up

200
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,893
wants me in the ground as quickly as possible.

201
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:12,149
What's another word for "love"?

202
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,358
What's the context?

203
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,860
Oh, you know.

204
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,612
The "I love you so much

205
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,198
"I ain't never knocking over a liquor store again" context.

206
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,574
Except, you know, classy.

207
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:21,783
Mmm.

208
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,801
I'm proposing to my girl, if you gotta know.

209
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,871
In a letter?

210
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,068
You got a better way?

211
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,332
Face-to-face works pretty good.

212
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,668
This place ain't exactly the romantic spot.

213
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,338
I'm gonna have her go get on the Staten Island Ferry.

214
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,965
Then, once she can see the Empire State Building,

215
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,300
She opens the letter.

216
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,885
It's like almost being there.

217
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,262
Except for the fact that I won't be there.

218
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,681
Try "passion."

219
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,143
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion. Passion" That's dope. Passion.

220
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,606
How do you spell that? Is it "pash..."?

221
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,609
No "h"?

222
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,535
LJ, hold up. Hold up.

223
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:07,204
I don't think I can go through with this.

224
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,916
Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.

225
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,678
We understand each other, then?

226
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:23,261
Yeah.

227
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,889
Friday. Not Saturday. Not Sunday. Friday.

228
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,266
Totally understood.

229
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,518
I don't want hundreds, I don't want fives, I don't want ones.

230
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,394
I know, I know.

231
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,395
Tens and 20s only.

232
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,948
It's on.

233
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,628
Police!

234
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:23,030
Abruzzi, I need you to hire me a P.I.

235
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,616
Beat it.

236
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:28,493
Maybe you ought to hear what I got to say.

237
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,786
You got nothing I need.

238
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,131
Wouldn't  be too sure of that.

239
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,627
My mistake.

240
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,422
Just what I need... a duck.

241
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,050
A P.I., Abruzzi.

242
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,761
You might find I can be of more assistance than you think.

243
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,556
Mull it over.

244
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,601
Come find me when you're ready to talk.

245
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,944
All right, guys, pick it up!

246
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:03,695
I want to get home tonight!

247
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,821
Maggio.

248
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,288
Yeah? So?

249
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,207
That's the son of a bitch at fingered Abruzzi.

250
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,876
That's Fibanacci?

251
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,963
I thought the punk was gone forever.

252
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,714
Evidently, somebody found him.

253
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,883
Somebody messing with us?

254
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,760
This you're not gonna believe.

255
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:31,598
What is it?

256
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,063
Tattoo looks fresh.

257
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,943
I guess, being a diabetic, you don't mind needles.

258
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,987
I'm Michael, by the way.

259
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,114
Scofield. I read your report.

260
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,866
And you are?

261
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,784
Dr. Tancredi will do.

262
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,953
Tancredi like the governor?

263
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,206
You're not related, are you?

264
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:03,589
Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.

265
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,507
As a doctor, no less.

266
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:08,760
I believe in being part of the solution, not the problem.

267
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:13,515
Mmm. "Be the change you want to see in the world."

268
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:17,644
What?

269
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,565
Nothing. That was just my senior quote.

270
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,150
That was you?

271
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,444
This whole time, I was thinking it was Gandhi.

272
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,487
You're very funny.

273
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:28,947
Sit tight.

274
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,283
Put direct pressure on that. I'll be back in a sec.

275
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:47,097
So,  how do we play this?

276
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,259
You hook me up with a few weeks' supply?

277
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,469
Nice try.

278
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,012
No hypos on the floor.

279
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:54,473
I'm the farthest thing from a junkie. Trust me.

280
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,391
I got news for you, Michael.

281
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,353
"Trust me" means absolutely zero inside those walls.

282
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,528
The only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it.

283
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,192
Guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other, then, huh?

284
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:06,735
I guess so.

285
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,000
We're all clear on the Burrows execution.

286
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:22,751
Good.

287
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,877
Except for one thing.

288
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,088
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.

289
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,468
He's got a lot of influence with the governor.

290
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,512
They went to prep school together, apparently.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,098
Look, the closer it gets,

292
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,225
the more I'm worried that the bottom

293
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,435
is going to fall out of this whole thing.

294
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,609
Well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit with the good bishop then.

295
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,280
Look, in one month,

296
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,865
it will all be over.

297
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,077
The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men

298
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,204
and be crucified

299
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,415
and the third day, rise again.

300
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,502
And they remembered his words, and so should you.

301
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,838
Good day, gentlemen. May God be with you.

302
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,643
Michael.

303
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,775
Why?

304
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,153
I'm getting you out of here.

305
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,156
Burrows, roll it up. Happy hour's over.

306
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,366
It's impossible.

307
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,703
Not if you design the place it isn't.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,959
Too formal.

309
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,005
Too greeting card.

310
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,550
We gotta make a decision sooner or later, you know.

311
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,551
We have time;

312
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,054
We don't, actually.

313
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,933
I mean, at some point, we gotta pull the trigger on this thing.

314
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,018
I don't want to rush this.

315
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,585
We're only going to do it once. We have to get it right.

316
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,695
Honey, can I ask you something?

317
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,655
Of course.

318
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,366
Are you putting this off?

319
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,325
What do you mean?

320
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,744
I mean, are you having second thoughts?

321
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,622
No. Honey, no.

322
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,207
I'm not.

323
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,292
I don't know.

324
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,422
I just can't help thinking this is about...

325
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,774
It's  not.

326
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:32,673
I love you...

327
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,843
and I want to be your wife.

328
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:41,723
Passion? What were you thinking?

329
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,016
Hey, you went for it.

330
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,143
She probably thinks I went sissy up in here.

331
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:48,537
"Passion." Got more than one syllable, too much talkin'.

332
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:50,691
That's me from now on.

333
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,077
One-syllable Sucre.

334
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,737
Yes. No. Love. Hate. Love.

335
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,781
- Give it time.
- Are you kidding?

336
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,533
I proposed to her.

337
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,495
That doesn't take time. Si or no. One syllable, man.

338
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,917
She's supposed to come around for a conjugal on Tuesday.

339
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,032
She's always calling me beforehand, letting me know she's coming.

340
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,215
This time, man, I ain't heard a peep.

341
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,634
You spooked her.

342
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,972
Scofield... get it together. Pope wants to see you.

343
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:27,227
No good, Fish.

344
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,688
No one gets an audience with the Pope.

345
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,566
Not unless he's real interested in what you got going on.

346
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,111
Top of your class at Loyola.

347
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,071
Magna cum laude, in fact.

348
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,284
I can't help wondering what someone with your credentials

349
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,869
is doing in a place like this.

350
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,706
Took a wrong turn a few months back, I guess.

351
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:50,332
You make it sound like a traffic infraction.

352
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,253
Like all you did was turn the wrong way up a one-way street.

353
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:57,264
Everyone turns up one sooner or later.

354
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:00,552
The reason I called you here...

355
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,556
I noticed in your I-file, under occupation,

356
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,153
you put down 'unemployed.'

357
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,061
That's not true, now, is it?

358
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,275
I know you're a structural engineer, Scofield.

359
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,573
Shah Jahan built the Taj Majal as a

360
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,451
monument to his undying love for his wife.

361
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,037
My wife is quite fond of the story.

362
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,540
It appeals to the romantic in her.

363
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,877
Being married to someone in Corrections...

364
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,212
terrible job.

365
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,047
Wouldn't wish it on anyone.

366
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:42,636
And yet, in 39 years my wife has never complained.

367
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,498
And the worst part about it is, I've never thanked her.

368
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,185
So, because I couldn't say it,

369
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,776
I thought, you know, I could build it.

370
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,441
Come June, it's our 40th anniversary.

371
00:21:58,777 --> 00:21:59,820
But here, look...

372
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,239
you see, the problem is...

373
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,657
I build anymore,

374
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,535
it's all gonna come down like a house of cards.

375
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,496
That's where I was hoping you could be of assistance.

376
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,834
For the favor, I can offer you three days of work a week in here.

377
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,253
And it'll keep you off the yard.

378
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,595
I can't do it.

379
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:31,810
Son, it's better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one,

380
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,270
I can promise you that.

381
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:34,938
I'll take my chances.

382
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,860
Then we're through here.

383
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:41,904
Guard!

384
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,658
Two pounds of pot?

385
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:49,786
What were you trying to do, set a record?

386
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,664
It's not funny, LJ. You could be going to jail.

387
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,960
It's pretty obvious to me you need some guidance.

388
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,671
Hey.

389
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,174
Thanks.

390
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:06,011
From who, old Daddy Warbucks?

391
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,638
Give him a chance. He's a good man.

392
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,264
We got nothing in common.

393
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:11,808
Where is this coming from, LJ?

394
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,229
Last semester you were getting almost all A's and now...

395
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,858
It's your father, isn't it?

396
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,401
I don't have a father.

397
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,446
It wasn't an immaculate conception, honey. Trust me.

398
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,660
Maybe it's time we went and saw him.

399
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:31,870
Mom...

400
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,413
Ma...

401
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:34,957
Don't.

402
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,792
I'm about as excited by the prospect as you are,

403
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,335
but something's gotta give.

404
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:41,129
You have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this.

405
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,971
What if they'd sent you to Taylorville or Marion and not here?

406
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:51,723
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing here.

407
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,476
Eating Jell-O, drinking Kool-Aid...

408
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:56,331
I know what you're doing.

409
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,189
It's not luck of the draw that you're in here with Lincoln.

410
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,651
You forget I know you. Both of you.

411
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:06,113
You two have the most dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.

412
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,866
What, he beats you up to keep you off the streets,

413
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,618
so you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?

414
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:12,870
To what?

415
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:13,996
Save him?

416
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,668
I deserve to know. I loved him as much as you did.

417
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,546
Past tense for you, maybe. Not me.

418
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,597
I gave him a shot when I got back from college. I did.

419
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:27,885
Even with all the stuff that was going on with him,

420
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:30,762
I did everything I could to make it work. And he threw it away.

421
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,908
You ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place?

422
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:35,934
Don't do this.

423
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,145
Whatever it is you're doing, don't do it.

424
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,606
There's a better way. I'm already appealing your case.

425
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:41,773
I told you to leave alone...

426
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,593
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln. The bishop...

427
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:46,695
That won't stop it. It'll only delay it.

428
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,743
You want to do something?

429
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,745
You find out who's trying to bury him.

430
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,291
Nobody's trying to bury him.

431
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,293
The evidence was there.

432
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,005
The evidence was cooked.

433
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,549
Visiting hours are now over.

434
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,932
Take care of yourself.

435
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,852
Someone wants him dead, Veronica.

436
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,812
Something more is going on here.

437
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,317
This is desperation, Michael. You're grabbing at straws. You're in denial.

438
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,112
Maybe. But I can't watch him die. I won't do that.

439
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,477
Gentlemen...

440
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,554
What is it about the Burrows situation that I can help you with?

441
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,984
It's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor.

442
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,821
I wouldn't say it's great or influence.

443
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,364
We're friends.

444
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,167
It's also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty.

445
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:17,721
I'm a man of God. How could I not?

446
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,581
In this case, we're hoping you'll suspend that position.

447
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:21,999
At least temporarily.

448
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,961
If the inmate appeals to me for intervention,

449
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,255
how can I turn my back on him?

450
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:31,258
You have a habit of answering a question with a question.

451
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,428
And you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions.

452
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:40,559
Are you saying you won't do it?

453
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,628
I'm not a man to equivocate.

454
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,191
You're what...

455
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:49,318
62 years old now, Your Excellency.

456
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,152
That's right.

457
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,195
I would assume, then,

458
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,633
that you'd be well-versed in how our government's tax system works.

459
00:26:54,652 --> 00:26:57,409
Taking personal capital gains under the church's tax shelter...

460
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,400
well, that would be fraud, wouldn't it, Your Excellency?

461
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,833
I will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs.

462
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,794
Not by you or anyone else.

463
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,172
Admirable.

464
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,132
Good day, Excellency.

465
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,593
Mr. Kellerman...

466
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,723
What is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?

467
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,392
The man killed the vice-president's brother.

468
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:32,694
- What'd he say?
- You heard me.

469
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,279
Someone found Fibanacci.

470
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:36,365
I'm looking at the photos right now.

471
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,034
Son of a bitch has a beard, sunglasses...

472
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,673
Witness Protection, if I ever saw.

473
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,454
Who was this someone?

474
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,706
There's no return address on the envelope.

475
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:50,420
Just... this folded-up bird made of paper.

476
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:54,091
Like origami?

477
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,342
Yeah, like that.

478
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,135
Like origami.

479
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,297
You're Charles Westmoreland, right?

480
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:34,798
Do I know you?

481
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,925
I knew your wife before she passed.

482
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,511
- You knew Marla?
- You mean Anne?

483
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,847
How'd you know her?

484
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,016
We talked together in Boston.

485
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:46,643
- East Farmington.
- You mean West Wilmington?

486
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:48,729
No more tests.

487
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:50,439
I promise.

488
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,692
Seems you know everything about me.

489
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,195
- Who are you?
- Michael Scofield.

490
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,530
How'd you get it in here?

491
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:00,532
First off, she's not an it.

492
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,744
She's Marilyn and she's grandfathered

493
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:07,372
back from the days when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.

494
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,917
I heard you were D.B. Cooper.

495
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,712
Every new fish comes in here,

496
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,083
first thing they hear,

497
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,466
is that Charles Westmoreland is D.B. Cooper.

498
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,927
I'll tell you like I tell them...

499
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,180
You want the Cooper story?

500
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:26,308
I can't give it to you, 'cause I'm not him.

501
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,351
It's too bad.

502
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:30,562
Sort of wish it was true. The man's a legend.

503
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:33,732
Nowhere near as much as I wish it was true, friend.

504
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:36,485
I'd have a million-five waiting for me on the outside.

505
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,157
I'd put some grass under 'em if I were you.

506
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,036
This thing would go a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.

507
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,705
What is this all about?

508
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,458
Say you were able to get outside those walls?

509
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,244
Would you have the people in place to make sure you disappeared forever?

510
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:57,582
- Why do you care?
- Just curious.

511
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:59,842
Where's Fibanacci?

512
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,552
That's not the way it works.

513
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,225
They come at me, John...

514
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,685
I'm coming after you.

515
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,645
I doubt it.

516
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:15,774
Fight, fight, fight...

517
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,102
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.

518
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,146
I didn't think you were agitating type.

519
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:57,274
Behavior like that will not be tolerated in my prison.

520
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:58,734
90 days in the SHU!

521
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,944
That ought to be enough time to convince you of that fact.

522
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:01,820
90 days.

523
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:02,654
That's right.

524
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,164
Something you want to say?

525
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:13,999
It's just...

526
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,169
I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.

527
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,253
Value?

528
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,255
Hm-mm... the Taj.

529
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:23,467
It'd be a shame for the 8th wonder of the modern world to collapse

530
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,719
because the stress is improperly propagated.

531
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:27,095
Improperly propagated?

532
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,555
Improperly propagated.

533
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,224
The joints are overloaded.

534
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,725
They won't provide anywhere near

535
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:34,561
the sheer strength the completed structure will need.

536
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,523
How much work are we talking?

537
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:39,566
You want it by when, in June?

538
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,400
Yes.

539
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:43,028
Then we'd better get started, wouldn't you say?

540
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:11,849
Who's there?

541
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,283
Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.

542
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,410
Someone shot him while he was sleeping.

543
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,912
I thought you'd want to know.

544
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:35,831
Thanks.

545
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,423
Michael was right.

546
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,787
Sink, you got a visitor.

547
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:29,760
He was arrested.

548
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,638
For what?

549
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,264
Possession of marijuana.

550
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:40,562
I figured he could use some fatherly advice before it's...

551
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:43,190
Gone forever.

552
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,316
I didn't mean that.

553
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,652
I know you didn't. Thanks, Lisa.

554
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:49,655
Sit down.

555
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:55,994
Dope, huh?

556
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:57,955
Using or dealing?

557
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,415
What's the difference?

558
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,125
Then what, you, uh,

559
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:04,211
think it gives you some kind of street cred?

560
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,674
You got a piece of the good life. Take advantage.

561
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:10,884
Look, I get it.

562
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,427
The whole thing.

563
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,847
She drags me in here,

564
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:18,016
you give me a big speech, I walk away a changed man.

565
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,393
Straight "A's."

566
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:22,229
Harvard. Grow up and be a dentist.

567
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,606
It's better than being here.

568
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,026
You got to realize who's getting punished

569
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,695
when you're doing the things you're doing.

570
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,613
You think it's me; it's you.

571
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,031
I did the same thing--

572
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:35,008
punished the old man 'cause he was gone.

573
00:34:35,055 --> 00:34:36,326
Look where it got me.

574
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:42,332
I'm not asking you to love me.

575
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,043
I already screwed up that chance long ago.

576
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,588
I'm asking you to love yourself.

577
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,715
You can still put the brakes on this thing.

578
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,303
So, that's what fatherly advice is like.

579
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:56,680
Where are you going?

580
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:58,599
I got homework.

581
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:01,977
They're putting me to death, LJ.

582
00:35:02,144 --> 00:35:05,647
In a month's time, I'll be dead. You get that?

583
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,151
You're already dead to me.

584
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:35,719
Yes.

585
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,097
What? You mean yes yes?

586
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,807
Yes! Yes!

587
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:41,642
Yeah!

588
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:45,561
Oh, there's just one thing.

589
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:46,146
Of course.

590
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,903
My mom say we gotta wait till you get out.

591
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,024
Of course, mi amor.

592
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,537
She wants it to be in in a church.

593
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,610
Okay. Esta bien.

594
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:52,736
A Catholic church.

595
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:55,578
Wouldn't want to mess with the Catholic roots, would we?

596
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,746
You went to Loyola.

597
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:04,331
You've been checking up on me.

598
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:05,832
I like to get to know my patients.

599
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,460
I went to Northwestern. Graduated two years after you did.

600
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:12,297
Maybe we met before-- you know, drunk, out at a bar somewhere.

601
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:13,507
I would have remembered.

602
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,133
- That a compliment?
- No.

603
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,221
What?

604
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:22,432
Your blood glucose is at 50 milligrams per deciliter.

605
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:23,350
So?

606
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:24,726
That's hypoglycemic.

607
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:27,646
Your body's reacting to the insulin like you're not a diabetic.

608
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,784
You're sure it's Type One diabetes you've got?

609
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,483
Ever since I was a kid.

610
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:33,026
All right.

611
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,612
You're not experiencing any tingling sensation, cold sweats or...

612
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,742
Infirmary.

613
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:41,869
Yes.

614
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,788
Yeah. I did.

615
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,125
No, I did and I do; I need them.

616
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:53,547
Okay. Um, great, well, I'll call him after lunch, then.

617
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,257
Thanks; I'm with a patient. Okay.

618
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:58,677
I'd like to run some tests next time you're in.

619
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,381
Last thing I want is to be administering insulin to a man who doesn't need it.

620
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,765
Yeah; sure.

621
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:05,475
Okay.

622
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,109
How'd you get here, by the way?

623
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:16,028
Oh, you know.

624
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,822
I don't; that's why I asked.

625
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,242
- You know. Hector.
- What?!

626
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:25,528
I didn't have any money for the bus, so he offered me a ride.

627
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,706
He was really sweet.

628
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:30,774
Honey, he's just a friend.

629
00:37:30,812 --> 00:37:32,252
No, he's not "just a friend."

630
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,893
I know Hector; I know men.

631
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:35,837
Men and women can't be friends.

632
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:38,343
A guy doesn't drive a girl 500 miles across state lines

633
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,049
because he wants to be friends.

634
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,303
Casanova, wrap it up.

635
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:47,726
Hey, you got nothing to worry about, okay? It's you I'm marrying.

636
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,937
It's not you I'm worried about.

637
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:53,565
16 more months.

638
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,284
I love you.

639
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:17,798
Be easy, son, all right?

640
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,014
Sucre tells me you're the local pharmacy.

641
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,103
What you need, man?

642
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,354
Fugnac.

643
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,022
I only speak English, white boy.

644
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:35,468
It's an insulin blocker.

645
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:38,905
Standard over-the-counter variety. You can get it at any pharmacy.

646
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,380
You can get that at medical then.

647
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:41,980
I can't get it at medical.

648
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:42,948
Why not?

649
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:45,509
Because they're already giving me insulin shots.

650
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:49,788
You're one mixed-up cracker, you know that?

651
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:52,176
Can you get it for me, or not?

652
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:55,711
Only if you tell me why it is that you want to keep going back up to medical

653
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,046
to get a insulin shot for which you don't need.

654
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,506
I like the ambiance.

655
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,091
Uh-huh.

656
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:02,217
We in business?

657
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,319
Scofield. I don't know what you did,

658
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:22,613
but Abruzzi wanted me to give you this P.I. card.

659
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,698
Congratulations.

660
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,840
You just joined the ranks of the employed.

661
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,510
Kudos, Fish.

662
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,762
You got spine.

663
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,228
All right, cons, break it down!

664
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:58,190
Move it, guys.

665
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,371
Saw Veronica came by yesterday.

666
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:13,664
Still engaged to that guy?

667
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:14,665
Yup.

668
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:16,458
Could have been me.

669
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:17,960
If you hadn't self-destructed.

670
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:21,171
You think I meant to knock up Lisa Rex?

671
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:23,882
I was just being stupid. Hurt.

672
00:40:24,925 --> 00:40:27,553
Shouldn't have pushed her away, though.

673
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,221
You pushed everyone away.

674
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,849
I'm an anchor.

675
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,327
All I'll do is drag him down with me.

676
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:40,607
Why did you hire him?

677
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:44,194
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

678
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:51,201
You mean what you said earlier?

679
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,412
I'm not here on vacation; trust me.

680
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,541
Getting outside these walls, that's just the beginning.

681
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,501
You're going to need money.

682
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,464
I'll have it.

683
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,466
And people on the outside--

684
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,260
people that can help you disappear.

685
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,470
I've already got them.

686
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,140
They just don't know it yet.

687
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,688
Look, whatever you got going on, fill me in,

688
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,240
'cause I'm in the dark here.

689
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:26,323
Chaparral Associates got the contract to retrofit this place in '99.

690
00:41:26,492 --> 00:41:29,907
$4 million contract. Head partner couldn't crack it.

691
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,491
So, he subcontracted out--

692
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,994
an under-the-table sort of deal with a former associate.

693
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,955
That guy was one of the partners in my firm.

694
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,043
We basically ghost-wrote the whole plan--

695
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:43,712
crossed the "t's," dotted the "i's," grouted the tiles.

696
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,681
You've seen the blueprints.

697
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,183
Better than that.

698
00:41:57,309 --> 00:41:58,727
I've got them on me.

699
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,107
Are you kidding me?

700
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,988
Am I supposed to be seeing something here?

701
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:11,114
Look closer.

702
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:47,150
