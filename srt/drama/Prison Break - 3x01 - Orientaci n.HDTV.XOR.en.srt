1
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:15,340
Do something, my brother is innocent!

2
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,587
- He's American...
- I can't do anything.

3
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:19,411
Yes! Back at the crime scene,

4
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:21,365
- that'll prove...
- I'm a night clerk.

5
00:01:21,546 --> 00:01:24,319
You want someone who can
do something, wait for the consul.

6
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:25,886
He gets in in the morning.

7
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,015
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,217
That ain't gonna cut it.

9
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:32,714
Your brother,

10
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,827
- where do they have him incarcerated?
- Sona.

11
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:38,926
What?

12
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:45,549
The worst of the worst are there,
men no other prison will take.

13
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,669
They rioted so badly a year ago,
the guards pulled out,

14
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:57,756
just left them
to themselves.

15
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,820
A thousand thieves,
rapists, murderers.

16
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:15,162
The government just stays back,
keeps the perimeter.

17
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,423
To them, Sona's
a one-way street.

18
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:30,365
What goes in...

19
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:32,591
never comes out...

20
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:34,865
unless it's dead.

21
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,440
Subtitles: swsub.com

22
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:26,489
Somebody wasn't diligent enough
with this guy,

23
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:29,920
and we need him moved to a facility
that's a little more... moderate.

24
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,306
All right? Thank you.

25
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,037
Alright, the good news
is as of yesterday you're a free man.

26
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:38,557
- You got nothing to worry about.
- Just my brother.

27
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,547
Right. Well, that's a heck
of a story, you two.

28
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:45,523
That made the news even down here.
And I understand you also have a son?

29
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,124
LJ... Lincoln Jr.?

30
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,415
He must be ecstatic about your
exoneration.

31
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:52,843
- Still trying to reach him.
- Tell us where he is. We'll send...

32
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,602
Let me handle that.
Let's just focus on Michael.

33
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,498
Okay, well, good news is
is that much

34
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:01,305
of what you're saying is
checking out at the crime scene.

35
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:05,361
The victim did have a service revolver
with U.S. government numbers on it.

36
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,909
And if a weapon was found,
then that lends

37
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,223
real credence to self-defense
as a motive.

38
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:13,574
Great.
Did they find anything else?

39
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,441
- Like what?
- A bag.

40
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,187
- What was in it?
- A little money.

41
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,846
No, sorry.

42
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:22,341
- Of course they didn't.
- Yeah, well, whatever the case,

43
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:25,286
regarding Michael,
I've managed to make a little headway.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,402
I arranged the transfer of your brother
to another facility tomorrow.

45
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,306
- It's a lot safer, it's a lot cleaner.
- Great.

46
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:35,636
And if this is stacking up
like I think it is,

47
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,525
I'd be pretty confident
the charges will be dropped.

48
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,481
He'd be free?

49
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:42,682
Well, he'd still face charges
in the U.S.

50
00:04:43,137 --> 00:04:45,268
- But out of there?
- Yes.

51
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:38,085
Is there...
is there a mess hall here?

52
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:39,553
Mess hall?

53
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,997
And some water.
I'm dying of thirst. Please.

54
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,653
Please.

55
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,900
There's some water.

56
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,476
Bite me.

57
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:57,931
- What'd you say?
- I didn't say nothing.

58
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:01,963
Drink it.

59
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,707
You hear me?
Drink!

60
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,172
Hey, get used to it, man.

61
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,155
I haven't eaten for days.

62
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:31,782
Come on.

63
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,904
- How are you doing?
- What do you want, Alex?

64
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,326
You're so clever... 
Planting the drugs on the boat.

65
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,783
That's a big irony.

66
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:42,549
Lawman in jail.

67
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,530
You are exactly where
you belong.

68
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,918
No, you're wrong.
And you're gonna help me.

69
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,312
I will have a court date one day,
and you will be there on the stand.

70
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,867
And you'll tell the truth,
that you planted this

71
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,487
and you set this up,
and I'm gonna go home.

72
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,904
That's funny.
I could have sworn you set this up.

73
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,392
I set this up?
I'm in here.

74
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,050
What does the Company want with me?
Why Panama?

75
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,347
What, you think I know
what they wanted?

76
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,037
They had me.

77
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,332
I did what they
asked me to do:

78
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,159
arrest you in Panama
and hand you over.

79
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:17,560
That's it. That's...

80
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:23,447
That's old news, huh?

81
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,360
This is the first day
of the rest of our lives.

82
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:28,911
How about we work together,
help each other out.

83
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:30,836
Except every time I look at you,

84
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,955
all I can see is the man
who killed my father.

85
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:37,795
You're on your own.

86
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:13,484
Sign here to say that once inside,
you're on your own by the law,

87
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:16,297
you're not protected by the military
in case of an assault.

88
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:18,876
Any attempt to assist
an inmate trying to escape

89
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,913
will be met
with a lethal response.

90
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,630
Wouldn't dream of it.

91
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,725
So...

92
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,079
So...

93
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:44,753
Feel like I'm on the wrong side.

94
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:47,588
- You're on the right side.
- You're not.

95
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,495
- Gonna break me out?
- Too tiring. All that running.

96
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,895
Yeah, well, maybe you should
have lost the cowboy boots.

97
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:57,253
You scared?

98
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:03,043
I'm getting you out of here, man.

99
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:06,830
The Consulate's arranged to transfer you
to a safer facility until the trial...

100
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,467
which is about a month.

101
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:11,665
- They say you got a good chance.
- When's the transfer?

102
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:12,924
Tomorrow.

103
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,709
Just... just hold on,
man, one more day.

104
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,884
You know, I keep waiting for you
to mention a certain someone.

105
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,760
- I don't know where she is, man.
- Well, you got to find her.

106
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:26,984
I will.

107
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,038
She's important
to me, Linc.

108
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:33,863
If anything happens to Sara...

109
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:40,292
It's going to be fine, man.
I promise.

110
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:45,718
I'll see you tomorrow.

111
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:47,990
All right?

112
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:11,945
American, right?

113
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,306
I love America.

114
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:17,017
NBA. Tracy McGrady shooting the
ball in the hoop from downtown.

115
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,239
Whatever you're selling,
I'm not buying.

116
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,452
Selling?

117
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,509
I just want to talk basketball.
Who's your team?

118
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,576
Let's go, blanco.
Orientation.

119
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,477
- I'm not interested.
- It's not for you to decide.

120
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:52,463
Bring them in.

121
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:12,715
I hope they haven't been
treating you too poorly.

122
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:14,606
I should hear of it if you have.

123
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:18,247
I think as you can tell, Sona
is unlike any other place in the world.

124
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:21,407
Since the riots of last year,
they left us here to rot.

125
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:25,258
They figured we would just destroy
ourselves, but instead, we've thrived.

126
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,256
With the canal, Panama is now a breeding
ground for international crime.

127
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,074
27 different nationalities we have here.

128
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,489
But not one gang.

129
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,998
Not one racially-motivated incident.

130
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,254
It's just...

131
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,659
me.

132
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,833
Egalitarianism I believe is the word.

133
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,952
- Did I get that right?
- Right as rain.

134
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,319
That's what practice does for you.

135
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:56,728
Now, is there anything

136
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,113
you want to tell me?

137
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:03,021
Any history that you bring to this place
that I should know about?

138
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,432
I don't think you're quite
telling me the truth.

139
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,339
We get the news, man.

140
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:22,160
You were quite the superstar on CNN.

141
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:25,619
Man breaks brother out...
and flees to Panama.

142
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,263
But you're not a superstar here!

143
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,595
- You realize that, don't you?
- I'm not going to make waves.

144
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,446
It wouldn't be within your power.

145
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,605
I heard about the two of you.

146
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:47,713
You two in the hall today.

147
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,575
Now, if you'd like to sort your problems
out, it's very simple here.

148
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,568
A man has a beef with another,
he makes his problem known.

149
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,238
And then we deal with it directly

150
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,744
as men... over there.

151
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,133
Won't be necessary.

152
00:14:18,564 --> 00:14:20,416
You always shake like that?

153
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,188
Or just when you're scared of someone?

154
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,053
I think he gets the message.

155
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:01,067
We could go...
You and me... right here.

156
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,267
You're a brave man, huh?

157
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,428
You're lucky I've been meditating.

158
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:18,407
Before, I couldn't take my finger
off the trigger, but now,

159
00:15:18,594 --> 00:15:20,512
now, I have mind control.

160
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:23,041
Complete control.

161
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:25,009
Mind...

162
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,564
body...

163
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:28,320
and soul.

164
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:32,557
Get out!

165
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,610
He's a waste of our time.

166
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:49,166
Who would have thought...
a famous person in Sona.

167
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,583
Weak people rally around fame.

168
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:53,790
They worship it. They're blinded by it.

169
00:15:54,024 --> 00:15:56,631
There are many people of weak character
behind these walls.

170
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:59,221
Yes, they will follow a man like this,

171
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,117
and they will put him on a pedestal.

172
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:07,326
He has that charisma, right, mami?

173
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,122
He's no you.

174
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,794
You don't have to pander me, mami.

175
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,368
He's good looking, right?

176
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:22,670
He's the best looking man
in the prison, right?

177
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,258
Not compared to you.

178
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,762
I told you, mami...

179
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:37,918
Sara Tancredi... she's an American.
She's missing.

180
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,310
We don't have a report
of anything like that.

181
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,347
But if you do, you call me.
The number's on the back.

182
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:48,008
- Anything, you call me, alright?
- Will do.

183
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:50,614
Thank you.

184
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,319
Where'd you get shoes?

185
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,333
It's time to start
earning your rent, here.

186
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,602
- There's no rent, it's prison.
- Keep talking.

187
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,237
It's going up.
Here.

188
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:19,595
Work time's started right now.

189
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:22,757
Where?

190
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,599
- Hell no.
- Absolutely not.

191
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:31,178
One more word from you,

192
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,890
and I will drown you in here,
you understand?

193
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,909
Now, work.

194
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,562
Burn it down in the sewers
when you're done.

195
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:03,146
- Elliot Pike.
- What do you want?

196
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,492
Well, to be frank, to represent you.

197
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,452
- You're a lawyer?
- Of sorts.

198
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:09,792
The court already appointed me a lawyer.

199
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:15,673
Then perhaps I can be
of assistance in a different way.

200
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,546
Somehow I doubt that.

201
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,170
I got a lot of big guns behind me,
Mr. Scofield,

202
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,594
people you might like
to have in your corner

203
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,939
should you ever decide,
say... to break out of here.

204
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:31,707
Who are you?

205
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:36,057
We can assist you in every possible way
once you get past that wall.

206
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,757
There's a reason a guy like you,
with your skill set,

207
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:45,406
was put in here, you know.

208
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:49,407
This conversation's over.

209
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,351
You should listen to what I have to say.
We're trying to do this the easy way!

210
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:28,298
What the hell are you doing
taking my stash?

211
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,809
Cough it up, you bitch!

212
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,610
- I didn't do it.
- Where is it?

213
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,402
- Where is it?
- It wasn't me.

214
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,954
You know the rules about
extra-curricular fights!

215
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:44,668
It doesn't happen here.

216
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:47,989
- He took something that belongs to me.
- He's out of his mind.

217
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:51,067
It seems pretty easy to get
to the bottom of this... check him.

218
00:21:58,743 --> 00:21:59,863
Check his area.

219
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:13,114
That's bull.

220
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:17,498
You're both scumbags.

221
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,914
You and me, man,
we're not done here.

222
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,539
You haven't seen her?
No one like this has checked in?

223
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,701
You're absolutely sure?

224
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:40,540
Thanks.

225
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,586
Yeah.

226
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,001
<i>Mr. Burrows. Captain Itzuris
at the constable's office.</i>

227
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,436
We found an American woman
matching the description

228
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,846
<i>of your friend, Ms. Tancredi.</i>

229
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:54,767
Where?

230
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:56,714
<i>At the morgue.</i>

231
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,446
What's he saying?

232
00:23:11,596 --> 00:23:12,794
That we can't eat.

233
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:14,461
What are we supposed to eat?

234
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:32,234
They expect us to forage, like dogs.

235
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,844
I'll die.
I will literally die.

236
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:42,475
Hang in there, man.

237
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,897
Playing by yourself.
Same old Pretty.

238
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:20,453
Just not good
at making friends, are you?

239
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:22,624
We got nothing to say to each other.

240
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,536
On another note,
them big government types

241
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,094
that shook me so hard,
why did they wanted you here?

242
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,784
Was it Sona they was interested in?
I'm wondering.

243
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,465
Want me to get you down here,
in this very county.

244
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:36,108
What do you think it is?
You think it's Sona?

245
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:38,577
Who'd be interested in a dump like this?

246
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,402
Runner! Runner!

247
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,920
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- No problem.

248
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,965
The body was fished out of the pond
this morning.

249
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,269
Where?

250
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:04,211
Calle Sesenta-Seis.

251
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,129
Just west of Avenida Colon.

252
00:26:10,556 --> 00:26:11,556
Sir?

253
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,991
That's the last
place I saw her.

254
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:31,494
It's not her.

255
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,923
It's not her.

256
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,676
Someone's thrown the glove
down on you.

257
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:53,159
The gauntlet, right?

258
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:55,825
Yeah, except we both know
I didn't take those drugs.

259
00:26:55,966 --> 00:26:57,146
I'm not the judge.

260
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,194
I don't deal in the claims
people make.

261
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:02,095
I just make sure the rules are followed.
And the rules say

262
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:05,398
all grievances are dealt with
two men in a ring, a fight.

263
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:08,568
I'll be leaving tomorrow,
so that won't be necessary.

264
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:11,215
It may not be necessary to you,
but it is to me.

265
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:13,949
I have a duty
to maintain order here...

266
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,776
an ironclad legal system
that assures that

267
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:19,138
no one goes independent
with their grievances,

268
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:21,559
as is so often the case
in other prisons.

269
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,301
Here,
there is a system,

270
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:25,389
and that system means order.

271
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:28,639
So whether you agree with it or not
does not matter to me.

272
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,385
There's a larger agenda than yours.

273
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,416
What happens if I refuse?

274
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:39,990
We'll come for you.

275
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:46,003
And I can guarantee you that is
an outcome that you will not like.

276
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,849
Tell me something...
do you always set up your fights?

277
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:52,875
I had nothing to do with it.

278
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:55,374
And yet the only one
in this prison

279
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,456
who has a problem with me is you.

280
00:27:58,545 --> 00:28:00,195
I'd be glad to see
you go down...

281
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:01,696
superstar.

282
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,490
Go on, keep going.

283
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,317
You burn it around the corner.

284
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,145
Think you can do me a favor?

285
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:00,224
Bite me.

286
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,554
I can feed you.

287
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,472
A few weeks ago, I was in your shoes.

288
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:08,340
Didn't get any food for days.

289
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,254
They'd have let me die,
just like they're gonna let you die.

290
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:13,219
Get back to the "feed me" part.

291
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:21,393
Chicken. Man, where'd you get chicken?

292
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,169
That's not chicken.

293
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:30,939
Want some more?

294
00:29:33,068 --> 00:29:35,457
Then you're gonna have
to run an errand for me.

295
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:36,995
What kind of errand?

296
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,939
- <i>Dad? It's me.</i>
- LJ.

297
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:51,395
- Where are you?
- I'm in Panama.

298
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,435
What?
How...

299
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,290
- How'd you get this number?
- I ran into Sara.

300
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:00,135
The consulate gave her your number.

301
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:01,913
- <i>Dad, I'm cutting out.</i>
- LJ?

302
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,432
- I can't hear you.
- <i>Dad, do this.</i>

303
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,797
Meet us at the restaurant
in the Garfield Price building,

304
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,644
- at the top.
- Garfield what?

305
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:10,836
<i>8:30...</i>

306
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:26,811
Time to fight, blanco.

307
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:35,428
Best to make your peace with God.

308
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:41,898
<i>Uno, dos, tres,</i> all right?

309
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,378
What? Even at 10-1?

310
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,306
There's a reason he chose World.

311
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,696
Six consecutive life terms, okay?

312
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:05,042
I'm just kidding, man.

313
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:06,503
<i>Tranquilo</i>!

314
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,218
Surely,
it's beneath a man of your status

315
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:19,023
to be walking around like that
all sticky-like.

316
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,307
Leave him.

317
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:22,575
What do you propose?

318
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:25,056
Ablution.

319
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:30,177
A humble sign of friendship
from a stranger

320
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,823
who's come into your house.

321
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:41,666
Sorry about that.

322
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:45,066
Just... half a man down here.

323
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,062
What's your name, norteño?

324
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:52,732
You can just call me...

325
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:54,443
"friend."

326
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:05,724
Go for the kneecap.

327
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:08,568
You...

328
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:11,659
You hit it straight on, it'll buckle,

329
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,192
and you'll take the guy
out of commission.

330
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:16,931
Fighting dirty? That's your secret?

331
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:21,475
I didn't think there was any such thing
as clean in a place like this.

332
00:32:22,386 --> 00:32:24,038
You know, I'm surprised, Alex.

333
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,442
It almost sounds like you care.

334
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,430
You're my get-out-of-jail-free card.

335
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:32,841
Just survive.

336
00:32:35,552 --> 00:32:36,989
Kneecap, really hard.

337
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:19,050
Good luck, man.

338
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,975
God bless, man.

339
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,579
We got a disagreement

340
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,357
between two dogs.

341
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:05,721
A drug addict and a thief.

342
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,928
And I condone neither.

343
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,460
And I wash my hands of both of them.

344
00:34:10,753 --> 00:34:13,453
But they have an issue,
and we have rules.

345
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,510
And without rules,
we're nothing but savages.

346
00:34:17,118 --> 00:34:19,678
Therefore,
with proper respect for the rules,

347
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:22,618
this fight is engaged
with only one rule:

348
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:24,562
no weapons.

349
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:26,747
Only man versus man,

350
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,982
without augmentation or handicap.

351
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,185
I'm done talking.

352
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:45,061
I'm not gonna fight!

353
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:21,340
I don't think
you understand the rules, friend.

354
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,155
Only one man comes out alive.

355
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:17,138
No weapons!

356
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,746
Rules are rules, remember?

357
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,286
If we don't have them...

358
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,563
we're savages.

359
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:53,897
Excuse me.
You have no jacket.

360
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,051
I'm just meeting someone.
Give me a break.

361
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,868
Well, this is a nice place.

362
00:36:58,095 --> 00:36:59,474
It requires jackets.

363
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:02,551
- I don't have a jacket.
- It requires jackets.

364
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:05,652
Fine.

365
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:15,189
Excuse me.

366
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:16,815
You speak English?

367
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,794
How about American?

368
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:36,193
Can I grab a water, please?

369
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:40,745
Please, tell me you didn't come
all the way to Panama for the water.

370
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Family.

371
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:49,692
That's a nice jacket... Sergio.

372
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:52,398
It's a long story.

373
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:54,127
Thank you.

374
00:37:56,168 --> 00:37:57,724
You're waiting for someone?

375
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,836
I should have known.
Good-looking ones are always taken.

376
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:07,733
What happened to your face?

377
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:10,080
- A cat.
- Cat?

378
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,730
It's a big cat.

379
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:15,510
You push anything too far into a corner,
and the claws will come out.

380
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:21,069
- Your timing's all wrong, lady.
- Come on. Hang out.

381
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:22,520
I'd like to...

382
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:24,848
but it ain't the right time.

383
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:29,598
Yes, it is, Lincoln.

384
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,042
We have a lot to discuss.

385
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:37,786
Specifically, your brother.

386
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:45,443
I highly suggest you talk to him.

387
00:41:14,957 --> 00:41:16,841
How are we coming with the transfer?

388
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,853
There are some people that want you
to break someone out of there.

389
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,048
Yeah, I know.

390
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:26,773
Some guy approached me.
I said, "No, thank you."

391
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,270
You gotta stay.

392
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:31,433
What are you talking about?

393
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:33,173
His name's James Whistler.

394
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:35,354
No, Linc, I can't do that again.

395
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
<i>Talk.</i>

396
00:41:43,388 --> 00:41:44,400
<i>Dad!</i>

397
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,303
<i>Dad,</i>

398
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:48,058
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

399
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:49,703
<i>They got me and Sara.</i>

400
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,731
<i>Please, do what they want.
Dad, please.</i>

401
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:57,919
You got a week
to find this Whistler guy.

402
00:41:58,742 --> 00:42:00,029
Get him out of there.

403
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:01,697
Otherwise, they...

404
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:03,284
Sara and LJ...

405
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:04,827
they both die.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
