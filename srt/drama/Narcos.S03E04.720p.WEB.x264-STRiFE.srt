2
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,610
Please, pay attention!

3
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,739
I need you to put your cell phones,
beepers, and radios in the container.

4
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,657
Is this necessary, Agent Peña?

5
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,244
- I'm afraid so, Captain.
- Please. I'll take that.

6
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,039
One of my guys
says one of your guys

7
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,332
is working for the cartel.

8
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,211
They have any proof?

9
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,712
Can't say yet.

10
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,591
But this warrant will be hard to execute
if they're one step ahead.

11
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,054
It's just a precaution.

12
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,058
- Gracias.
- Okay.

13
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,145
For the next three hours,
we'll be running silent.

14
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,525
- My colleagues and I will take the lead.
- And the target?

15
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,612
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

16
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,536
We're advisors.
We work together, same as always.

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,372
Credit's all yours.

18
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:12,132
Gentlemen, you heard!
I need you to be tight and right.

19
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,134
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

20
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,217
Let's go.

21
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,421
In case you're confused, Capitán,

22
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,532
I wouldn't have come all the way
from Bogotá if it wasn't a big deal.

23
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,537
My men's safety. That's what I care about.

24
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,999
I make the final call
if anything feels off.

25
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,126
You follow?

26
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,094
My kid gave it to me
right before I went out on this buy-bust.

27
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,181
Some Jamaican took a rip at me,
missed by that much, so...

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,893
I rub it for luck ever since.

29
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,634
So, what are we doing here?

30
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,680
We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

31
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,136
Applauded
by the multitude present on 10th street,

32
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:51,184
president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano
is welcomed by the people of Colombia...

33
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,562
I don't give
Gilberto Rodríguez credit for much,

34
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,314
but I have to hand it to him...

35
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,193
he was a man in control.

36
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,403
It's too early.

37
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:08,117
- I rise early. I'm up with the sun.
- Up all right!

38
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,121
He was married to three women.

39
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,956
At the same time.

40
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,710
And he managed them the same way
he ran his business.

41
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,713
Scheduled down to the minute.

42
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,847
Wife number three got him
Monday and Tuesday.

43
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,932
Hi!

44
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,726
How did it go, honey?

45
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,646
Very good! Look, what a beauty.

46
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,929
Number two...

47
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,113
got him Wednesday and Thursday.

48
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,619
And wife number one
got him on Friday and Saturday.

49
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,055
Look at that pass. Goal!

50
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,873
Damn it, what sort of defense is that?
Piece of shit!

51
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,375
I'm paying your fucking salaries!

52
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,418
Sundays were for football.

53
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,922
All the wives were invited
if they wanted to come.

54
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,590
They usually did.

55
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,008
Thank you.

56
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,385
And they all got along.

57
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,261
That was the deal.

58
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,432
And he made it work. He insisted on it.

59
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,601
He made far more friends than enemies.

60
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,020
I can help you expand your businesses...

61
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,356
And he would count on those friends
to protect him.

62
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,608
I could help you make millions.

63
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,902
His retirement was going
to go his way, too.

64
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,739
He wasn't going to die
on some shitty rooftop.

65
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,868
Nobody was stabbing him in the back,
nobody forcing him out.

66
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,289
Like I said, he was a man in control.

67
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,041
The guy who never made
a wrong move in his life.

68
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,462
A guy who built a billion-dollar empire,
brick by brick.

69
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,131
A guy who owned every cop in town.

70
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:49,552
A guy with a get-out-of-jail-free card
burning a hole in his pocket.

71
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,346
And you want to go after him? Shit.

72
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,560
You'd have to be crazy, stupid, brave,
and lucky all at the same time.

73
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,146
Two units: Calderón's and mine.

74
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,483
Breach one here. Breach two... here.

75
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,695
Feistl, Van Ness: pool.
You come in from the back.

76
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,408
- All right, let's do this already.
- Okay.

77
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,496
If anyone kills the godfather, I kill you.

78
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,541
We can't repeat what happened
with Escobar. I want him alive.

79
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,668
Understood?

80
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,907
Go.

81
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,065
- Nobody lives here, boss.
- That's bullshit.

82
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,067
Intel had Pacho here last night.

83
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,239
What do you think?
What do we do?

84
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,033
I think there could be hideouts here.

85
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,828
- We have to check the house again.
- All right.

86
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,871
We turn this place upside down.

87
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,626
Men, we're going to search
every corner of this house, understood?

88
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,677
It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.

89
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,221
I don't know whose it is,
but it's not one of ours.

90
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:01,726
Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

91
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,352
Yes, sir.

92
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,026
- Salcedo.
- Jorge.

93
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:11,985
Sir.

94
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,991
I need you to do something important.

95
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,994
When you leave your house,
you'll find Navegante.

96
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,829
He knows where you have to go.

97
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,084
Of course, sir, but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

98
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,547
Córdova. Give it to Córdova.

99
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,715
Jorge...

100
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,094
- be careful.
- Of course, sir.

101
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,191
He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

102
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,697
You're a man of your word.

103
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,608
Juárez.

104
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,446
So close to heaven and so far from God.

105
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,366
Impressive.

106
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,162
I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

107
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,751
Don't be an asshole, Pacho.

108
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,755
El Paso, Texas,
is what I wanted you to see.

109
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,466
Fucking NAFTA changed everything, Pacho.

110
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,429
It's been around for what?
Two years, more or less?

111
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,766
More than two million trucks
have crossed already, many of them ours.

112
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,309
Filled to the brim.

113
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,563
Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

114
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:15,317
Less than ten percent.
It's insane. They don't have the manpower.

115
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,486
Assholes opened the floodgates

116
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,490
and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it.

117
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,537
This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

118
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,372
No, man. What I'm saying is,

119
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,543
you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

120
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,462
And you're going to regret it.

121
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,756
You want some?

122
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,265
Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

123
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:51,145
No. No way. Why betray?
They want to get out.

124
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,108
I'm proposing that we start something new,
you and I.

125
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,571
Just imagine it:
You send it to me, I get it across.

126
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:05,034
In two years, we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

127
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,788
Think about it, all right? Think about it.

128
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,791
Just don't take too long,
because in six months,

129
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,418
I need to secure a new supply.

130
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,881
Hopefully, it will be with you.

131
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,643
Hey...

132
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,394
Give it another once-over?

133
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Okay.

134
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,072
It should be now.

135
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,799
Thirty seconds.

136
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Hey!

137
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,059
Hey! You can't park there!

138
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,687
Damn truck.

139
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,815
These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

140
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,898
You can't park here.

141
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,943
Let me just grab the cables
and I'll move it.

142
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,194
Move the fucking truck.

143
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,093
That's the one Lady Di uses.

144
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,291
Gilberto!

145
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,919
Someone's ringing the doorbell!

146
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,174
- Careful.
- Sorry, wait just a moment.

147
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,844
Let me get the door.

148
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,386
Look.

149
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,143
Gilberto?

150
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,152
Police! Back up. Quickly! Move it!

151
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,403
Quickly! Move it!

152
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,447
What's going on?

153
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,033
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, I won't say it again.

154
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,371
You can't come in here. Get out.

155
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,631
He's fucking running!

156
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,151
Get up! Look at my face!

157
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,904
Let's go.

158
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,991
- Sit down, miss.
- I already told you, Gilberto is not home.

159
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,618
Did he contact anyone?

160
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,329
- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

161
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,833
Mrs. Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

162
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,920
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

163
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,384
The question is, will you cooperate?

164
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,207
Are you all right?

165
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,792
Yes.

166
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,506
It's good here.

167
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,726
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

168
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,981
Yeah. Okay. We're done. I'm calling it.

169
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,028
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

170
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,196
Welcome to my world.

171
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,032
Well...

172
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,928
Do what you need to wrap up,
have your men report back.

173
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,454
- Okay.
- Feistl, anything else?

174
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,331
- Ride to the airport?
- Sure.

175
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,262
Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

176
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,723
These people are angry.

177
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,562
What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

178
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,150
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

179
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,529
Different? How?

180
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,909
You're crippled. You don't carry a gun.

181
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,289
Most people don't carry guns.

182
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,753
Yeah... but you're not most people.

183
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,132
And that's why it's so weird. Interesting.

184
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,802
That you never carry a gun.

185
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,599
I see. Why do you think that is?

186
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,351
I don't know.

187
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,812
Maybe you're scared.

188
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,987
Fear... of what you could do with it.

189
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,159
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

190
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,182
Pedrito, go in the house!

191
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,897
Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

192
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,027
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

193
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,614
Go right back to where you came from

194
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,577
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

195
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,079
she can come looking for him.

196
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,789
I just came to talk.

197
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,208
If you don't like what I have to say,

198
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,412
I'll go to Cali
and deliver whatever message you want.

199
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,546
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

200
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:38,760
Your boss murdered my son...
to take up with his whore wife.

201
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,891
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

202
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,519
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

203
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,314
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

204
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,566
Protecting?

205
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,819
Is that what they call it now?

206
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,780
And he will be protected as well.

207
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,869
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

208
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,664
You promise. How nice of you.

209
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,460
Who told you I would do that?

210
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:16,256
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

211
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,550
That bitch made her choice.

212
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,597
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

213
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,227
The next men who come... won't be asking.

214
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,603
There will be war.

215
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,819
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

216
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:45,035
If you don't mind, Capitán,
we need to stop by a friend's house.

217
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,956
Make a right here.

218
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,922
Nice neighborhood.
Your friend's very wealthy.

219
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,259
He's a very fortunate man.

220
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,224
What is this?

221
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,166
My friend likes chickens.

222
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,323
- Colonel Martínez.
- Captain.

223
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,118
You know what's happening here?

224
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,078
Yes, I think I know.

225
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,163
I'm giving you one chance

226
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,167
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

227
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,467
You think you're clever?

228
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,888
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotá.

229
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,683
You're way out of line here, Hugo.

230
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,935
Perhaps.

231
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,034
He's here. We'll find him.

232
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,955
Watch him.

233
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,016
You got your kid's drawing?

234
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,048
I'm unarmed.

235
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,759
We're going to send your head
back to Miguel in a fucking box.

236
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,095
- Walk, motherfucker.
- Let's go.

237
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,847
Duvan!

238
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,766
Duvan!

239
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,853
Bring out the car.

240
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,232
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

241
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,820
- Very good.
- Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

242
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,659
All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I shoot your ass.

243
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,745
I'm getting in first, you hear?

244
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,997
Real still.

245
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,501
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want?

246
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,585
Relax.

247
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,712
- Stop!
- Mama!

248
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,130
What else, motherfucker?

249
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,635
Fucking asshole!

250
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,790
Fuck!

251
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,399
Drop the weapon.

252
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,240
Drop the weapon.

253
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,205
Don't shoot.

254
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,957
I'm a man of peace.

255
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,518
Let's go.

256
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,205
Hey! Stop!

257
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,333
Colonel! Calderón took off.

258
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,627
- Fuck. We move fast.
- Okay.

259
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,204
- You have a phone in there?
- Yes, in there.

260
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,414
They got Gilberto, they're moving
towards the aerial base.

261
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,273
The whole workforce is on this.

262
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,737
They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?

263
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,923
Move it, asshole.

264
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,142
They'll try to take us on the road.

265
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,894
Guns out!

266
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,067
Cleaning, cooking, working.

267
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,861
Hello.

268
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,366
Don Miguel... something's happened.

269
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,450
What happened?

270
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:45,705
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

271
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,573
We've got a visual.

272
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,078
Surround him in the market!

273
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,841
Tail him!

274
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,561
Look! There he goes! Faster!

275
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,148
Let's get him on the next turn!

276
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,364
Hold your fire!

277
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,873
Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

278
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,500
Driver!

279
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,337
Out further!

280
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,672
Further!

281
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,808
Get out.

282
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,769
Open the back.

283
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,104
- Okay. Let me get the keys.
- Open it.

284
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,661
Open it.

285
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,288
Okay. All right. Settle.

286
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,969
The American sons of bitches
tricked us. We've got the wrong truck!

287
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:08,092
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

288
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,850
I took care of security.

289
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,438
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

290
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,858
Send Salcedo's beeper another message.

291
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,961
Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

292
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,590
Come in.

293
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,845
- Nicolas.
- Uncle.

294
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,394
- Is it true?
- Yes.

295
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,438
They got him.

296
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,150
Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

297
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,444
Once something happens, I'll call you.

298
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,196
No, sir, I have to help.

299
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,574
Come.

300
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,370
You know your dad
doesn't want you mixed up in this.

301
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,499
We have to have faith that your dad
won't be taken out of Cali.

302
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,417
And if he is?

303
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,838
Why did we waste all of that money
on my education? I'm a lawyer.

304
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,923
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.

305
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,425
I want to help him.

306
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,720
Let's hope that's not necessary.

307
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,111
Fuck.

308
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,030
Wait here.

309
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,248
What's up? Why'd we stop?

310
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,084
There's cops surrounding the plane.

311
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,337
Cops? Good ones?

312
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,965
I don't think so.

313
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,153
Colonel Martínez.

314
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,929
Sir, please don't come any closer.

315
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:57,600
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

316
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,395
You know it.

317
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,438
And that means prison.

318
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,153
What you do today...

319
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,323
what you do this moment...

320
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,659
defines you.

321
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,995
For the rest of your lives.

322
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,168
Are you police or not?

323
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,263
That's better.

324
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,180
Home stretch.

325
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,579
Shit!

326
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,043
What's up? It's me.

327
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,171
- About fucking time.
- I was out of range.

328
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,923
They arrested Gilberto.

329
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,551
- What?
- They got him, Jorge.

330
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,470
They got Gilberto.

331
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,643
- You were monitoring the raid.
- But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.

332
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,563
Even so, we checked
all the tapes. It's impossible.

333
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,109
It doesn't make sense!

334
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,903
I just don't understand!

335
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,699
Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

336
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,660
We got beat.

337
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,787
Get back here quick.

338
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,879
Hasta la vista, baby. Ciao.

339
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,602
Take that.

340
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,533
Five seconds to take photos, no more.

341
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,868
Congratulations.

342
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,912
But you know this won't hold up.

343
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,916
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

344
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,881
Smile, Gilberto. You're about to be on TV.

345
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,385
This way, Mr. Rodríguez.

346
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,471
Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

347
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,266
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

348
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,517
Enough. Let's go.

349
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,188
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodríguez.

350
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,323
For those of us
who thought the surrender was bullshit,

351
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,784
Gilberto's arrest proved
that these guys could be caught.

352
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,247
For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid violence,

353
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,166
it was the beginning of a nightmare.

354
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,920
The first shot in a war
to bring down another cartel.

355
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,382
But whatever side you fell on,
one thing was clear:

356
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,970
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

357
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,390
Especially him.

358
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:23,741
Don Gilberto.

359
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,214
Hey, congrats.

360
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,049
Congratulations. Good work.

361
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,261
No, where you going?
Come on, we want to toast you!

362
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,679
Start without me.

363
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,846
Great work!

364
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,271
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Big day.

365
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,775
- Quite a notch on your belt.
- It was strong intel, sir.

366
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,658
- I acted...
- Know how much work you torched?

367
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,570
People want to see
the godfathers in handcuffs

368
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,197
and that's what they're gonna get.

369
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,118
- Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
- Colombians may not feel that way.

370
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,579
Let's go find out.

371
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,415
Get changed.

372
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,303
- My love!
- Mommy!

373
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,765
Mommy.

374
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,101
- Are you hungry? No?
- No.

375
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,023
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

376
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,321
Come on.
Mom will read you a story in a bit.

377
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,822
Go. I'll be right there.

378
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,992
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

379
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,292
Sir, we don't know how much the DEA knows.

380
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,546
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

381
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,633
I'll stay here for now.

382
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,014
We all need to talk.

383
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,899
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorizes the police...

384
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,861
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

385
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,615
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

386
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,033
of the United States.

387
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,994
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

388
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:36,665
The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

389
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,210
So a war started by National Police?

390
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,545
Look, as Attorney General,

391
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:47,134
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

392
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,762
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

393
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:53,682
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

394
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,895
The President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper.

395
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,985
I hate to be late to a good debate.

396
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,989
You know us, might as well
try to smooth rough water with a hammer.

397
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,869
I've been apprised by Minister Botero

398
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,622
about our newly-incarcerated
Cali godfather.

399
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,210
- With all due respect, Mr. President?
- Go ahead, Miguel.

400
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,132
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

401
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,428
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.

402
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,266
Colombia is a nation of laws.

403
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,726
Not of concessions.

404
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,814
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organization in the world...

405
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,526
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

406
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,614
Mr. Rodríguez is entitled
to the same due process

407
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,783
as any Colombian citizen.

408
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,287
Let's see where due process gets him.

409
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,249
For now...

410
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,586
his arrest stands.

411
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,088
Thank you, gentlemen.

412
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,092
Fuckin' A.

413
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,026
Thank you very much.

414
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,604
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

415
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,730
Relax, Dad.

416
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

417
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:16,825
Besides, I thought you could use
a friendly face.

418
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:22,373
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

419
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,546
How's it look?

420
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,342
The warrants are old.

421
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,179
- Invalid?
- Vulnerable.

422
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,101
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

423
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,228
8:00 a.m., latest, I'm out.

424
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,148
Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

425
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:53,153
And he'll hold you here in Bogotá
due to the conspiracy charge.

426
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,115
I don't get it.

427
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,826
This is a mistake, a blunder.

428
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,538
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

429
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,873
That's what you want to believe.

430
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,334
But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

431
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,424
- Dad, this is real.
- No, money is real.

432
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,426
And what about all I've paid?

433
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,513
Sons of bitches
can't leave me confined here.

434
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:26,478
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

435
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,564
It was Calderón.

436
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,360
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

437
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,947
- And his fucking family and his children.
- David, please.

438
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,660
Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

439
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,998
- Córdova...
- Sir, just as we realized...

440
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,458
By the time you realized,

441
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:53,088
Colonel Martínez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

442
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,758
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

443
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,469
When it comes to the DEA,
Córdova counts on me.

444
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:05,267
Wait. Córdova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

445
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,728
Yes, sir.

446
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,648
Then you should've been there.

447
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,402
Your men should've been there.

448
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,659
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck.

449
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,162
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

450
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:31,293
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us are safe.

451
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,419
Not your families...

452
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,883
and not mine.

453
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,261
My family.

454
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,604
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defense Minister Botero.

455
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:54,775
Today marks an important beginning,

456
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,193
an important victory.

457
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,572
Because of the success
of our Colombian-American operation...

458
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,991
the Cali cartel is on the run.

459
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,954
And with the continued support
of the Colombian National Police...

460
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,668
I promise you...
the other three godfathers will fall.

461
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,255
Questions?

462
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,967
That's as much recognition
as we can hope for, right?

463
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,057
None at all? Smart move.

464
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,560
Keep his face all over this
while we're closing in.

465
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,396
Kiss-ass.

466
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,357
Want some?

467
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,986
No, I'm moving tables.

468
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,279
Oh, boy.

469
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,906
Oh, God.

470
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,159
Can't believe you're eating that shit.

471
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,233
Colonel, please.

472
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,110
Thanks.

473
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,030
Have a drink with me.

474
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,827
Tonight, we celebrate.

475
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
Tomorrow, we go back to work.

476
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,793
Well, not for me.

477
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,881
What are you talking about?

478
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,964
You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

479
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:46,970
Yeah, we never saw those.

480
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,390
Apparently, Vargas did.

481
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,853
And there was a list of cops
who've been accepting money from Cali.

482
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,358
One name he was eager to share: mine.

483
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,780
Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

484
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,117
Exactly. It sends a message to any cop
who wants to try what we did.

485
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,837
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

486
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,217
Good luck.

487
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,636
Colonel...

488
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm sorry.

489
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:43,026
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

490
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,447
You did everything right, Peña.

491
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:51,201
But now you're all alone.

492
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,413
Take care.

493
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,193
We need to talk about your security.

494
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,905
Let me be in charge.

495
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:32,200
I'll protect you, Dad.

496
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,165
Now's not the time for a change.

497
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:47,090
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

498
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,555
What if he doesn't come back?

499
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,488
Jorge.

500
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:11,822
Jorge.

501
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,385
- They got Gilberto.
- I don't understand.

502
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,221
I thought Gilberto
had this all under control.

503
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,764
So did I.

504
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:38,975
And what now?

505
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,977
This could get messy.

506
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,148
Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.

507
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,361
Pacho... be smart.

508
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,906
For now, we wait.

509
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,575
You stay there a while longer.

510
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,745
We have to keep everything running.

511
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:04,960
The health of the business
has never been more important. Understand?

512
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,129
Yes. Of course.

513
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,426
You listening to me, motherfucker?

514
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,388
Hey, listen, buddy, I don't speak Spanish.

515
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,516
No speak Spanish.

516
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,935
Okay.

517
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,020
Have a nice day.

518
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,554
Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

519
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,889
The Jurado tapes.

520
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,185
Well, we probably shouldn't call them that
because they're not legal, per se.

521
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,478
I want all of them.
