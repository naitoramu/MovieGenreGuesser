1
00:00:01,763 --> 00:00:03,099
<i>Previously on</i> Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,269
When I sent you those envelopes,

3
00:00:04,336 --> 00:00:06,007
I wasn't just playing games.

4
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:07,277
Move on subject four.

5
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:09,081
My wife is a defenseless woman.
- Execute the order.

6
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:11,454
Please don't do that!

7
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:15,599
Don't call anyone.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,640
You wanted to get in
on the action,

9
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:19,643
here's your chance.

10
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:26,394
Three-quarters
of a billion dollars

11
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,901
in a numerical account
in Luxembourg.

12
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:32,243
All the data will be delivered
within 24 hours.

13
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:33,881
Case.

14
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:36,020
I'll take that.

15
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,007
Hi,
Mom.

16
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:38,894
I know you have it.

17
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:40,198
Bring me Scylla

18
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:43,339
or this time Sara's death
will not be faked.

19
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:44,944
Linc!

20
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,749
Looks like you have
a little decision to make:

21
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:48,085
Scylla...

22
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:49,322
or someone you love.

23
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,779
Just think this
through, Michael.

24
00:00:57,846 --> 00:01:00,987
I have, and we're
saving them both.

25
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:01,990
How?

26
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,795
I will figure it out.

27
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:04,998
Your brother's
bleeding to death.

28
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,301
I wonder if we
can get them

29
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:08,206
to bring Linc and Sara
to the same place.

30
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:09,609
Right now,
your only advantage

31
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:12,150
is that neither party knows
that there's another player

32
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:13,520
that has leverage on you.

33
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:16,194
You bring them both together,
you lose your tactical edge.

34
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,330
I'm not abandoning Sara.

35
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:18,500
I didn't say to do that.

36
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:20,338
What I am saying
is that Sara has the advantage

37
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,043
of not having a bullet
in her chest.

38
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,922
One at a time.

39
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,105
Big surprise.

40
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:36,515
The dumb one got caught,
the smart one got away.

41
00:01:36,582 --> 00:01:38,988
I'm beginning
to see a pattern here.

42
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,526
He's never gonna give it to you.

43
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:43,132
Hmm, I disagree.

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,405
He truly cares for you.

45
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,177
No matter
how many times

46
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,248
you've shown you
don't deserve it.

47
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,791
You know, you two
are truly a classic study

48
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,697
of nature versus nurture.

49
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:58,072
Same environment, same parents--

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,412
you're completely
different.

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,618
Why do you think that is,
Lincoln?

52
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,091
Because Mom's a psychotic bitch.

53
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:12,344
Hello, Michael.

54
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,647
All right, you win.

55
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:14,750
I'll give you Scylla.

56
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:16,622
Just give Linc
whatever help he needs.

57
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,493
Not until I get what I need.

58
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:22,471
Edison Shipping Yard,
B Dock, 45 minutes.

59
00:02:22,538 --> 00:02:24,042
And bring my brother.

60
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,347
45 minutes?
Cutting it close.

61
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:28,019
He doesn't
look so good.

62
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,657
Just be there.

63
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:33,466
Is is worth it, Sara?

64
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:36,508
Do you ever go back
to that night

65
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,814
and wonder how things
would have gone

66
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:42,925
if you had just left
that infirmary door

67
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:44,930
locked?

68
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,435
All the people who's lives
would have been saved.

69
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,406
Hell, your father

70
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,844
would still be alive.

71
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,782
You ever think about that?

72
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,289
Mm-hmm.

73
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,695
And now that Michael's
returning Scylla to me,

74
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,333
it was all for nothing.

75
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:01,308
Assuming he does return it.

76
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,951
If the situation were reversed,
if Michael were here

77
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,089
and you were
holding Scylla,

78
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:10,265
what would you do?

79
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,137
You'd bring it back

80
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,676
for the same reason
you left that door unlocked;

81
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,846
because you

82
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:18,587
couldn't let
an innocent man die.

83
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:21,327
Your heart betrays
your better judgment.

84
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:23,132
So does Scofield's.

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,375
You know, you're probably right.

86
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:28,313
Because if Michael had used
his better judgment

87
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:31,321
the night he stole Scylla
out from under your nose,

88
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,193
he would have killed you.

89
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,705
Get her out of my sight.

90
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,410
Take it.

91
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:04,609
Either take my pocket
or I take yours.

92
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:08,754
Understand?

93
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,292
<i>The authorities</i>
<i>are blanketing the streets</i>

94
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,397
<i>looking for</i>
<i>the primary suspects,</i>

95
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,101
Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield.

96
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,439
The brothers, famous for one

97
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:18,647
of the most daring
prison breaks in recent history,

98
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:20,752
are considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

99
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:28,975
Homemade explosives?

100
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:30,378
You got a better idea?

101
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,919
Maybe the best way
to save Linc--

102
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:34,991
to save everyone--

103
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:37,063
is give Christina what
she wants.

104
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:40,706
I'm just trying to find a way
where the people that we love

105
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,513
don't end up on an autopsy table.
- And I'm not?

106
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,889
Better get your story straight,
Alex.

107
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,092
This whole time
you've been saying

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,597
we should give Scylla
back to the General.

109
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,502
What, you didn't hear
what he did to Self's wife?

110
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,838
Self made his own bed.

111
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:53,941

Yeah, and we're sleeping in it.

112
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:58,821
Let's say,
best-case scenario, okay,

113
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,394
that maybe somehow we're able
to get to Linc and Sara.

114
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:02,531
Okay, what then?

115
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:03,734
General's still got somebody

116
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:04,737
watching my wife.

117
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,375
What's the plan
to keep her safe?

118
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:07,778
What about LJ?

119
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,282
What's the plan
to keep him safe?

120
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,586
I can't think about
that right now.

121
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,323
Maybe we go to your mother
and try to make a deal.

122
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,831
I mean, there's no love lost
between her and the General.

123
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,772
With her contacts,
if we give her Scylla,

124
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,509
maybe she can find out
where the agents...

125
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:21,782
We're not giving up
and we're not giving it back!

126
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,553
We're gonna save everyone!

127
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:15,726
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing here?

128
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,600
What am I doing here?

129
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,907
You're in Recovery,
Mr. Self.

130
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,878
Apparently, you
had quite a fall.

131
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:25,018
Luckily, someone found
you and called 911.

132
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,388
They did what?

133
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,192
The doctor will be in shortly
to go over your history.

134
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,630
No, no, no, no.

135
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:32,337
Tell the doctor
to go see the next guy.

136
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:33,540
I'm going.

137
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:34,710
Actually, I can't.

138
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:36,515
There's some men here

139
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,651
waiting to
talk to you.

140
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,654
What kind of men?

141
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,759
The kind with badges.

142
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:44,235
Mr. Self, my name
is Agent Chris Franco.

143
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,575
This is Agent Wilson Wright.
We're with the Bureau.

144
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:48,513
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

145
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:49,850
About what?

146
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,056
Let's start with where we
can find Lincoln Burrows

147
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:53,561
and Michael Scofield.

148
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,046
Be ready to pick us up.

149
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,123
Better not get too close
to that thing when it goes off.

150
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:20,700
And you better not get too far.

151
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:32,464
All right, if Michael
tries anything,

152
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,968
take out both knees.

153
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,205
I don't want him dead,

154
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:38,012
I just want him immobilized
and eager to talk.

155
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,619
And what do you want
to do with Burrows?

156
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,833
Once I get Scylla,
dump him off the dock.

157
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,679
Yeah, one of them guys
from the news,

158
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:52,684
I think I just seen him.

159
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,197
Interesting choice.

160
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,202
I would have thought
you'd picked something

161
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,575
a little more public
for your own protection.

162
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:03,513
Something a little
more public

163
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,254
isn't safe for me right now,
thanks to you.

164
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,396
Did you come alone?

165
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,332
Did you?

166
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,142
Come on.

167
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,220
We can have at least one
honest conversation, can't we?

168
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:21,494
Actually, I'd like that.

169
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:23,233
In spite of what you think,

170
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,071
I never wanted
to see you get hurt.

171
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,542
What did you want?

172
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,650
Understanding...

173
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,255
forgiveness.

174
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,728
But when I made my choice,
I knew I'd never have

175
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,098
any of those things.

176
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:38,172
But you will have power,
won't you?

177
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,044
Yes, and you'll have Lincoln.

178
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:41,782
Quite honestly,

179
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,654
I think you're getting
the short end of the stick.

180
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,025
Speaking of which,
I need to get him

181
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,728
to a hospital, so where is he?

182
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:47,898
Where is Scylla?

183
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,703
I need to know he's alive.

184
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,702
Satisfied?

185
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:04,978
Follow me.

186
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,194
Now, you wouldn't have some
little trick up your sleeve,

187
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:12,732
would you, son?

188
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,606
I'm done playing games
with you.

189
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:21,655
Good. Then bring
Scylla out to me.

190
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:24,262
If I bring Scylla out in the
open, your man will shoot me.

191
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,134
Well, then I guess
we have a standoff.

192
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,140
The only thing is, what I want

193
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:29,410
isn't gasping
for air

194
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,816
and losing a pint of blood
every ten minutes.

195
00:09:31,884 --> 00:09:33,788
Give it to me, Michael.

196
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,927
You know I can't do that.

197
00:09:35,995 --> 00:09:37,765
Give it to me, Michael.

198
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,369
You're running out
of options, son.

199
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,792
I said no.

200
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,163
This is Give it to me, Michael!

201
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,299
Christina, we gotta go!

202
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,672
Come and get it.

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,109
Go get it.

204
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,514
Son of a...

205
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,687
Come on, come on,
Michael.

206
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:10,302
Michael, we gotta go now!

207
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,772
Now!

208
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,566
<i>So the government</i>
<i>helped you out?</i>

209
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:47,969
After all we've been through,

210
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,339
you know how crazy
that sounds, huh?

211
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,742
Well, the proof
is there.

212
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:53,015
Every morning I wake up
my little girl,

213
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,957
and she's healthy again, man.

214
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:58,463
Where are you living?

215
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:01,071
Actually, uh, that's why
I came down here to talk to you.

216
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:05,349
You know, uh...

217
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,822
We were in protective custody

218
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,295
while I was waiting to testify
against Mahone,

219
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,300
but his case fell through.

220
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:16,177
Anyway they wanted to not
only renege on my deal,

221
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,952
they wanted to put my ass
back in Fox River.

222
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,358
So, what are you doing here
in Chicago following me?

223
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,703
I was wondering if you, uh,

224
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:28,878
had any idea
of where Michael and Linc were.

225
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,162
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

226
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,300
Look, you in a bind
with the feds,

227
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,707
and now you want to know
about Mike and Linc?

228
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:41,713
Come on, come on...
- What, you gonna bust me, too?

229
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,519
No, I am trying
to help you, man.

230
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,492
And them.

231
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,998
Okay, man, don't you
watch the news, Sucre?

232
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,737
They are in a lot of trouble.

233
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:53,210
Big time.

234
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,881
And the only way
they can get out of it

235
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:57,721
is if you help me find them.

236
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:01,866
We're just trying
to find the two men

237
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,270
behind this assassination.

238
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:05,643
Well, obviously your clearance
level isn't high enough

239
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,313
for you to fully grasp

240
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:09,218
the operation
that I've been involved with.

241
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:12,261
All right, then how about we
tell you what we've grasped so far.

242
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,667
The dead body of your partner,
Agent Miriam Holtz--

243
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,705
autopsy shows the bullet
she was shot with

244
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,580
was fired from an agency-issued firearm.
- Right.

245
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:20,883
The disappearance
of your direct supervisor

246
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:21,920
at Homeland,
a Mr. Herb Stanton.

247
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:22,988
Okay.
We also got a number

248
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:24,626
of DHS transportation officers

249
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:26,131
with interesting information

250
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,836
concerning a warehouse
back in Los Angeles

251
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:30,174
that you were conducting some
kind of secret operation out of.

252
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:32,782
So when an international
political figure

253
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,386
is assassinated
on American soil

254
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,926
by two men taken into custody
by a Homeland Security agent,

255
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:39,834
who by all appearances
has gone rogue,

256
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,207
you tell us what we're supposed
to think is going on.

257
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:45,014
What's going on is you're
talking to a federal agent

258
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:47,087
like I'm an accomplice
to a crime

259
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:48,290
that I had
nothing to do with.

260
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,493
Do you have
any idea

261
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:50,830
how many years I've served
my country?

262
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,233
Do you have
any idea to the extent

263
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:55,208
that I've served my...?
What is this, Gitmo now?

264
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,846
As a Homeland agent,

265
00:12:56,914 --> 00:13:00,890
you are aware, I'm sure,
that anyone who impedes

266
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,795
an investigation
into an act of terrorism

267
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:04,466
has virtually no protection
under the law.

268
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,243
Okay! Okay!

269
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:09,781
Okay.

270
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,284
Now...

271
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:15,094
where are Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows?

272
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,632
I don't know where they are.

273
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,102
Okay?

274
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:20,442
But I could find out.

275
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,286
Well, Michael clearly
cares more about winning

276
00:13:24,354 --> 00:13:26,424
then he does about
saving your life.

277
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,430
Looks like you're not going
to live long enough

278
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:29,867
to be an uncle.

279
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,708
What? What?

280
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:35,181
Sara hasn't told anybody.

281
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,025
Christina, Banerjee's
on the phone.

282
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,197
He wants to know why he hasn't
received the technology.

283
00:13:43,304 --> 00:13:44,406
If Michael doesn't call

284
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:45,910
in the next ten minutes,

285
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:48,885
you're gonna wish he'd let
you fry back at Fox River.

286
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:58,978
Hello.

287
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,415
I thought we had an understanding.

288
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,590
I thought I made the stakes
crystal clear.

289
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,596
You did, and I'm trying.

290
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:07,768
And I'm trying not
to kill Sara,

291
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:09,573
but that would be a lot easier

292
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,645
if I had something in this hand
besides a gun.

293
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:14,152
Look, every cop and fed
in this city is looking for me.

294
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,957
The last thing I want to do
is jeopardize her life

295
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,595
by getting arrested and having

296
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:19,901
the very thing you want
locked up as evidence.

297
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:24,246
Well, I appreciate you taking
care of my interests, Michael.

298
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:25,917
I do.

299
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:27,320
And believe me, for that reason

300
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,992
I will take care
of your interests,

301
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,866
but if I don't see Scylla
in one hour

302
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm unleashing Bagwell to play
doctor with the doctor.

303
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:36,144
Am I clear?!

304
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:37,882
I need more time.

305
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,556
One hour!

306
00:14:40,623 --> 00:14:43,798
Doesn't Michael understand?

307
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:48,376
He's playing chicken
with other people's lives here.

308
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,482
My life's beenhreaned
I'm not talking about yours.

309
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,254
That boy has messed up

310
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:54,359
every chance I've ever had
at freedom.

311
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,997
This is my last shot.

312
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,500
You really think
when this is over

313
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:58,838
you're going
to be free?

314
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:01,211
Better than free--
I'm going to be employed.

315
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,383
The General's getting me
an honest-to-goodness job

316
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,754
with an office
and a desk.

317
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,692
What kind of a job
is he going to get you, huh?

318
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,797
What's he going
to trust you with?

319
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,940
The General hires professional
killers, not amateurs.

320
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:14,647
Not uneducated criminals
who rape and kill.

321
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,017
You mind your tongue,
little lady.

322
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,488
The only thing
you're getting

323
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,228
when this is over is a slit
throat and an unmarked grave.

324
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:22,668
Actually,

325
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:26,980
your only chance at a life
is to get out of here.

326
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,720
And if you take me with you,

327
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:32,193
whatever's happened
between you and Michael,

328
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,566
if you get me back to him,

329
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,074
the slate could be wiped clean.

330
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:38,912
With Michael and me...

331
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,452
that slate's never going
to be clean.

332
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,825
And if he doesn't give
the General what he wants...

333
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:49,172
...it's going to get
a hell of a lot dirtier.

334
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,625
What are you doing?

335
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,898
I need to make
sure Linc's okay.

336
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:04,079
I suppose that little explosion
was meant for me.

337
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,917
Let's pretend
that was for the cops.

338
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:07,955
Please, Michael, stop.

339
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:09,827
You're embarrassing yourself.

340
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:12,935
You should know by now that
you can't outthink me.

341
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,640
I'll always be one step
ahead of you

342
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,111
because I'm your mother.

343
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:17,816
Is Linc okay?

344
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:18,818
Hm.

345
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:21,191
I remember the
first time

346
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:22,728
I caught you in a lie.

347
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:26,338
I could see it in your eyes,
just like I could see it today.

348
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:27,875
Put him on the phone.

349
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,483
You're not in a position
to be making demands, son.

350
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,551
Actually, if Linc is dead,

351
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,156
I have no reason
to give you Scylla,

352
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,897
which puts me in exactly
the position you describe.

353
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,564
Yeah.

354
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,372
Hey, it's nice to know
you're still breathing.

355
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:52,775
How much time do I have?

356
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:53,845
Not much.

357
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,282
The General has Sara.

358
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,388
He's giving me an hour
to exchange her for Scylla.

359
00:16:57,455 --> 00:16:58,624
I need to know where you are,

360
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,329
so if you can give me
any kind of signal.

361
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,234
Don't know.

362
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:03,871
Look, if I'm going
to save you both,

363
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,576
I need something.
- Banerjee again.

364
00:17:05,643 --> 00:17:07,347
There's just not enough time,
Michael.

365
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:08,584
I can do this, Linc.

366
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:10,021
I can do this.

367
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,166
There's something
you need to know.

368
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:17,274
Sara's p... Sara's pregnant.

369
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:22,387
It's... it's okay.

370
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,158
You're going to be a dad.

371
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:25,630
No, I understand.

372
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:27,301
Now, if you just give us
a little more time...

373
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,504
Go to her, Michael.

374
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:31,479
I'll find a way, Linc.

375
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:32,882
There's not enough time.

376
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,355
There's just not enough time.

377
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:37,093
Let me go out knowing
that I did something for you.

378
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,407
Give me that!
- Let me...

379
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:40,840
Linc?

380
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:01,358
I'm sorry about what's ever
happening to Linc.

381
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:02,759
And I know you have to
protect your family,

382
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:04,161
I understand that,

383
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:06,329
but, Michael, what are we going
to do about the rest of us?

384
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:07,964
What are we going to do
about my wife?

385
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:11,368
Alex, I don't...

386
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:13,370
I don't know
what you want me to say.

387
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:16,339
You haven't gone a day
in your life without a plan.

388
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:17,874
Please don't start now.

389
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:22,446
All I know is

390
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,781
I have 43 minutes
to get this

391
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:27,050
to the General.

392
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:29,186
I am done making plans.

393
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:32,522
And to hell
with everybody else.

394
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:36,159
Well...

395
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:39,229
maybe it's time I take a
page from your book, Alex.

396
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,897
Hang out on
the sidelines,

397
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:42,466
survey the field.

398
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:47,337
When the time is right,
back the winning horse.

399
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:51,141
at's what you
think I'm about?

400
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:55,245
Tell me something, Alex,
which horse are you backing now?

401
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:57,581
Because I'm not quite clear
on that.

402
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:11,962
At least you got a decision.

403
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,931
They took my son.

404
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:17,601
I didn't
get to choose.

405
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:24,441
I'm just trying to do
whatever it takes to...

406
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,711
to not lose everything.

407
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:30,914
So am I.

408
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:35,519
So if there's something
you need to do to protect Pam,

409
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,254
you should do it.

410
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:53,003
Do you realize
after what you pulled,

411
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,639
you're completely worthless
to me now?

412
00:19:57,074 --> 00:20:00,977
You've been worthless
to me all your life.

413
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:07,484
I know you and Michael think
I was a terrible mother.

414
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:10,020
Couldn't agree with you more.

415
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:11,955
I warned Aldo.

416
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:14,658
I told him
I was not cut out for it.

417
00:20:14,725 --> 00:20:16,459
It is not in my nature!

418
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,667
He used to call me
his Lady Macbeth.

419
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:27,070
I knew there was a reason
I hated Shakespeare.

420
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,405
You hated it

421
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:31,174
because you couldn't
understand it.

422
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:36,479
You couldn't understand
it because...

423
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:40,417
your real mother was as dumb
as a day-old doughnut.

424
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:43,086
You asked me

425
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,956
how I could just sit
and watch my son

426
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,624
go into the chair.

427
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:51,661
The answer's simple really.

428
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,498
You're not my son.

429
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:00,804
Michael already knows.

430
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:04,674
That must be why it's so easy
for him to play with your life.

431
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:08,979
I guess we have that in common.

432
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:10,614
Now, go find my son.

433
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:13,950
<i>Your information</i>
<i>leads to an arrest,</i>

434
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,785
we'll make sure the courts
can't touch you.

435
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,287
Right.
Well, you put that in writing

436
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:18,722
and then we're in business.

437
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,657
No, no, the only thing you get
to demand in writing

438
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,092
is what we put
on your tombstone.

439
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,326
Last thing you're going
to want to find out about

440
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:24,828
is the brothers killing
somebody else

441
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,663
while you're in here harassing

442
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:27,864
your only source
of intel.

443
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,065
It needs to be
in writing,

444
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,401
and signed
by the attorney general.

445
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:34,337
I don't trust anyone who says
they work for the government.

446
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:38,708
All you have to do...

447
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,210
is call the brothers.

448
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:43,413
Get them on the phone,
let me talk to them.

449
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,649
And then they can make up
their own minds, all right?

450
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:48,418
I'm just trying
to stay out of all this.

451
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:50,387
I finally got my family back,

452
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:52,922
and I'm not about
to risk losing them again.

453
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,793
I know this feels good today.

454
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,063
But what about
a couple months from now, huh?

455
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,399
When the only job you can get
is under the table

456
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:04,934
or some labor gig,
where every minute

457
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:07,771
you'll be worrying about the guy
you're sweating next to,

458
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:09,673
if he's gonna drop the dime
in a heartbeat

459
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,107
because he recognizes you.

460
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,710
How is finding Linc and Mike
gonna change any of that?

461
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:16,079
This guy sought me out, okay?

462
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:18,381
He knows everything
about this whole thing.

463
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:19,716
Well, is he government?

464
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:21,017
'Cause if he's government,
I don't want...

465
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,819
I didn't trust him
at first either!

466
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,788
Okay? But it's something about
being in the pen

467
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:29,025
where you start to decipher who
is a player and who is a punk.

468
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,360
And this guy

469
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:32,862
is a player.

470
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,297
Just like Scofield.

471
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:38,702
So the only thing
that we have to do

472
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:40,570
is tell him
where the brothers are,

473
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:42,772
help him get
this device thing back,

474
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,941
and-and so he can put it
into the right hands.

475
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,643
And then what? Hmm?

476
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:49,079
This brother has juice.

477
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:52,148
He can erase
our entire record.

478
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:55,385
Now, I'm not talking about cash
and all that flashy stuff.

479
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm just talking about
straight up freedom,

480
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:59,589
living like a man.
You feel me?

481
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,962
No, of course, Nandu.

482
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,297
It... Yes, yes.

483
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:10,133
We just ran into a few
technical difficulties, so...

484
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,468
No, I understand.

485
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,903
Now, if you just give us
a little more time, then, um...

486
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:15,839
No, no, no. No, no, don't.

487
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,240
please don't
get on the plane.

488
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:18,875
No, I can...

489
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,790
You just cost me three-quarters
of a billion dollars!

490
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,125
Good.

491
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,794
At least the day
wasn't a total waste.

492
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,362
I was gonna wait
till I found Michael

493
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,531
and just kill you
in front of him, but instead,

494
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,099
I'm gonna take you out

495
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,868
the same way you came in--
alone.

496
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:50,940
You better be calling me

497
00:23:51,008 --> 00:23:52,175
to tell me you've got Scylla.

498
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:54,744
Whoever you've sent after it
is too late.

499
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:56,012
Michael's giving Scylla back

500
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,914
to the General
in exchange for Sara's life.

501
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:59,182
Who the hell is this?

502
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,350
Alex Mahone.
I don't believe

503
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:01,718
we've had the pleasure
of meeting.

504
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:04,020
Oh, yeah.

505
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,755
Alex Mahone.

506
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,624
You calling to rub
this in my face?

507
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,559
Calling to see
if you'll make me an offer.

508
00:24:09,627 --> 00:24:11,461
I can get Scylla for you,

509
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:13,730
if you promise to give me
what Michael can't.

510
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:15,799
What's that?

511
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,934
Protection for my family.

512
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:20,103
If your people can get my wife
away from whoever

513
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,939
the General's got watching her,
I'll get you Scylla.

514
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:24,674
You can get me Scylla?

515
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:26,075
Mahone...

516
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:27,143
you son of a bitch.

517
00:24:28,546 --> 00:24:30,313
I've got no particular love
for Burrows.

518
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,682
Sounds like
the feeling's mutual.

519
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,883
Yeah, but unlike his brother,

520
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,318
the guy's always been
straight with me.

521
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,487
And he helped me track down
the guy who murdered my son,

522
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:38,688
and for that, I owe him.

523
00:24:38,756 --> 00:24:40,423
And you don't owe Michael?

524
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:43,126
Not anymore.

525
00:24:43,194 --> 00:24:45,061
His choice, not mine.

526
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:47,931
Tell you what.

527
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:50,333
You give me Scylla,

528
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:52,535
if Lincoln's
still breathing,

529
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:54,437
you can have him.

530
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,073
I like that deal.

531
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:16,326
Hickory dickory dock.

532
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:20,263
Tell me, has Scofield
ever run up your clock?

533
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:22,599
Has he been man enough
to go there?

534
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:23,600
Or is he

535
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,602
saving it up
for the wedding day?

536
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,404
Michael is more man
than you can ever hope to be.

537
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:31,875
How would you know what
a man is like, huh?

538
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:35,078
Of the two of us, I bet
I've been with more of them.

539
00:25:35,145 --> 00:25:38,114
Look at you,
all buttoned up...

540
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:40,216
frigid.

541
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:44,053
Tell me, what does it take to
loosen up a gal like you, huh?

542
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:46,256
Music?

543
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:47,257
Flowers?

544
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:49,292
Touch?

545
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,660
Where the fingers

546
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,762
do the walking down
to where only...

547
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:56,132
Stop it!

548
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,001
Please.

549
00:25:58,068 --> 00:25:59,502
My, my.

550
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,571
I do like a woman
with manners.

551
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:08,011
Michael, you better be
calling me

552
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:09,145
to tell me you're close.

553
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:10,847
We're almost there.

554
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:12,415
Good. But I've changed my mind.

555
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:13,816
The exchange will be made

556
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:15,485
at a location of my choosing.

557
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:18,178
Forgive me, but I don't
really trust you,

558
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:20,014
except on unfamiliar territory.

559
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:23,117
You bring Sara unharmed, and...

560
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:25,319
I'll meet you anywhere.

561
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,789
Uh, there's an old parking lot

562
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:31,492
where Pelican Drive
meets the beach.

563
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,559
Be there in 20 minutes.

564
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:33,927
And I'm supposed to trust

565
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:35,929
that you're just gonna let us
live our lives, huh?

566
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:39,500
Believe it or not, Michael,
the last thing on Earth I want

567
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:43,170
is to ever see you or any member
of your family again.

568
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:46,240
You stay out of my way,
I'll stay out of yours.

569
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:47,441
Bring me Scylla.

570
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,709
20 minutes, Michael.

571
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:49,710
All right.

572
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:51,211
20 minutes!

573
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,717
About earlier...

574
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:00,821
I do think you're in it
for yourself.

575
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:05,192
Fortunately for me, that's meant
you've also had my back.

576
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,760
More than once.

577
00:27:08,763 --> 00:27:09,863
And for that,

578
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,699
I'm grateful.

579
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:15,335
Take the case.

580
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:17,304
Get out of here.
What about Pam?

581
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,040
I got it handled.

582
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:27,281
Good luck.

583
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:32,319
Looks like your boyfriend
straightened his priorities out.

584
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:33,320
That's too bad.

585
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:35,255
We were just starting
to get familiar.

586
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,891
Teddy, what are you doing?

587
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:42,696
You said we was gonna bring her
on the exchange.

588
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:45,466
All I'm giving Scofield today
is a slow death.

589
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,335
So what are we gonna do
with her?

590
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:50,170
Whatever you like.

591
00:27:50,238 --> 00:27:52,005
Perhaps we've finally
found a job

592
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:54,074
for which
you're perfectly suited.

593
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:18,609
Mr. Mahone?

594
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:19,944
I'm on my way.

595
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:22,613
And Michael?

596
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,615
I don't want
to talk about Michael.

597
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:27,852
Well, it seems Michael did
a poor job choosing his friends.

598
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,220
None of us choose this.

599
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:30,288
This happened to us.

600
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,923
The only thing we choose
is how it ends.

601
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,125
So just get your people
in place to help my wife.

602
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,060
How does that sound?

603
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:39,897
One of our assets
with the Bureau

604
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:42,199
says that two agents
are questioning Don Self

605
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,868
at Miami Mission Hospital.

606
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,870
And the attorney general
just issued a proclamation

607
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:47,271
for his immunity.

608
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:48,773
You think he's a threat?

609
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,642
Perhaps.

610
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,945
Question is, to whom?

611
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,254
Hello?

612
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:04,789
Michael, it's Don Self.

613
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:06,123
How's it going?

614
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:07,158
Well, well, well.

615
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,326
Thought you were dead.

616
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:10,127
If I had a dollar every time

617
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:11,963
I've said that about you.

618
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,397
You sound funny, Don.
What do you want?

619
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:14,999
What do I want?

620
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:18,402
You saw what that bastard
did to my wife, right?

621
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,737
I want revenge.

622
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:21,439
Where are you,
so we can hook back up?

623
00:29:21,506 --> 00:29:22,640
That's not necessary.

624
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,275
This whole thing's
about to be over anyway.

625
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:25,443
What do you mean
the whole thing?

626
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,345
What's going on?

627
00:29:27,412 --> 00:29:30,581
I'm hanging up now, Don.

628
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:32,249
Hello?

629
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:33,484
Scofield's
on a burner.

630
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:34,485
They're harder
to trace.

631
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,519
We're gonna
need more time.

632
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:36,520
Well, he's gonna call back.

633
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:37,922
He just gets a little riled up.

634
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,956
But he'll call back.
- When?

635
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:39,991
After he kills somebody?

636
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:41,192
You heard; this thing's

637
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,127
about to be over; Lord
knows what that means.

638
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,997
Get him back on the phone,
Agent Self, now.

639
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,635
<i>So this cat said that</i>

640
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:54,572
Scofield and Linc
should recognize him

641
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,073
when they see him.

642
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:57,074
Recognize him from where?

643
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:58,609
Look, I don't
know, man.

644
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,578
Look, we've been in
a lot of messed up places.

645
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:03,114
I'm just saying,
it makes a difference.

646
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,515
Besides, I mean, did he say

647
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,884
what he was gonna do
with Scylla if he gets it?

648
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,687
All this guy said is that he
couldn't go to the government,

649
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:12,490
'cause no one government
should have that much power.

650
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:15,693
Now, look, man, you want to ask
him yourself, he's right there.

651
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,028
He even give you a name?

652
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,030
Said call him Paul.

653
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,468
Sir.

654
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:30,241
If anyone tries to
escape, aerate them.

655
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,056
<i>Keep an eye out</i>
<i>for anything suspicious.</i>

656
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:47,158
Scofield's a tunnel rat.

657
00:30:57,135 --> 00:30:59,603
You know...

658
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:02,540
I wasn't the only fox in the
river to fall asleep at night

659
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,042
dreaming about treasures
was tucked beneath

660
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,445
that white coat of yours.

661
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:10,081
Every guy let their minds

662
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:14,118
wander-- eenie, meenie,
mynie, mo-- in between you

663
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,220
and Nurse Katie,

664
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:19,090
sometimes settling on
the both of you.

665
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,758
You digging that?

666
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:23,127
All you old junkies
like a little

667
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,729
dirty talk.

668
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:30,634
Let me see where
those tracks are.

669
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,870
I think I can, I think I can.

670
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:36,273
If you let me go, I can tell the
courts that you saved my life.

671
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:37,475
I think I can.

672
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,844
Teddy, if you let me go,
I can petition for leniency.

673
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:42,646
I could tell them
you saved my life.

674
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:44,381
I still have connections
from my father.

675
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:48,519
You know, I was always thinking

676
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:52,389
the way I was gonna get revenge
on Scofield was to kill him.

677
00:31:52,457 --> 00:31:55,759
Just driving that knife
right into his bleeding heart.

678
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:58,462
And now...

679
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,797
standing here

680
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:03,167
looking at you,
I'm thinking there's

681
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:06,403
something worse
than death for him.

682
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:09,640
Please, no.

683
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,645
I'll return you in one piece.

684
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:19,416
But that piece
gonna be a little used.

685
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,686
That's all.

686
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:27,124
And every time
he looks at you...

687
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:29,460
every time he wants
to be with you...

688
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:36,033
...he's gonna see me.

689
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:12,585
Nothing!

690
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:15,354
We got to get back

691
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:17,290
to the loft now.

692
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:39,712
Hey, Michael, this is
Don calling back again.

693
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,647
Listen, I know
you have a beef with me.

694
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:42,815
All right?
And I understand,

695
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:43,983
but I think I have
a way to get us

696
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,451
all out of this.

697
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,486
Okay, just please call me back.

698
00:33:47,554 --> 00:33:48,788
How many messages
we going to

699
00:33:48,856 --> 00:33:51,557
leave this guy before
we move on to plan B?

700
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,459
Look, he's going
to call back, okay?

701
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:56,095
Excuse me, gentlemen, I need
to check on the patient.

702
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:58,731
Just take a
few minutes.

703
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,133
He's going to call back, okay?

704
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:02,635
There's coffee
down the hall.

705
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:04,070
He's going to call back.
Just be patient, okay?

706
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:07,006
We're going to get him.

707
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:11,043
How's it going, Doc?

708
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:12,678
It's going well.

709
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,981
Is this
your first time with me?

710
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:17,049
Huh?

711
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:23,589
What is that?

712
00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:24,824
I know you, right?

713
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,127
What...

714
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:01,727
Oh, yeah.

715
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:10,937
Ooh, I bet you was a tomcat
back when you was using, huh?

716
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:15,975
See, nowadays, you like to
look a fella in the eyes,

717
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:17,677
but back then...

718
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:25,751
Back then, oh...

719
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:29,689
Back then, I bet the last
thing you wanted to do

720
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:32,224
was see who you was
keeping company with.

721
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:37,496
That's self worth for you.

722
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:40,933
See, I've always
felt that the partner

723
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:42,802
you choose to be with
is just a reflection

724
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,172
of how you're really feeling
about yourself in that moment.

725
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,340
And I got to tell
you, sister,

726
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:49,375
right now, old
Teddy is feeling

727
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:50,409
like a million bucks.

728
00:35:54,014 --> 00:35:56,215
Oh...

729
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,758
I'm going to be a
gentleman about this.

730
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:09,895
I'm going to let you choose.

731
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:17,837
and I'm going to give you
just what the doctor ordered.

732
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,742
What, you got something to say?

733
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:24,577
Just that while you
and the other cons

734
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,579
were taking care of
yourselves, I...

735
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:28,914
Katie and I were going
over your medical records

736
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:30,816
trying to figure out

737
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,518
how best to
manage your care,

738
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:34,420
figure out what
makes you tick.

739
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:36,722
The thing I remember
about you, Theodore?

740
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,492
Nothing makes you tick.

741
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:43,496
You can't... tick.

742
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:45,598
What exactly are you implying?

743
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:47,900
That the reason you rape
and kill and make pain

744
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:49,735
is because you
can't make love.

745
00:36:49,803 --> 00:36:51,804
You've got neurogenic ED,

746
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:54,573
probably caused by
injuries you sustained

747
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:58,310
during your own
childhood sexual abuse.

748
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:01,614
That is a lie.

749
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:03,416
That is a lie.

750
00:37:03,483 --> 00:37:04,683
Talk all you want about
what you're going

751
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:06,185
to do to me, Theodore.
You and I both know

752
00:37:06,253 --> 00:37:09,188
there is very little
you can actually do.

753
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:13,125
All right.

754
00:37:13,193 --> 00:37:15,828
You are just going to take
back every word you just said.

755
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:17,763
You hear me? You hear me?!

756
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:19,799
There's no reason
to be ashamed of it, Teddy.

757
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:22,635
So many men suffer from it.

758
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:23,903
Shut up!

759
00:37:31,344 --> 00:37:33,145
I don't know
what is more insulting:

760
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:35,714
You thinking
I'm erectorally challenged

761
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:38,617
or you thinking I'm going
to let you break out of here.

762
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:40,553
Hmm, let me think about that.

763
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,488
I'm going to go
with the first one.

764
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:44,323
Now,

765
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:47,059
I'm going to show you
just how functional I am.

766
00:37:51,932 --> 00:37:53,065
Michael!

767
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,467
Please.

768
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:06,679
It's all right.

769
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:10,983
Come here.

770
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:12,184
You all right?

771
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:14,620
Get me out of here.

772
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:24,897
Show me.

773
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,243
Why don't you come inside, Alex?

774
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,711
We have a lot to talk about.

775
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:49,485
Before we do any business...

776
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:56,225
I'd like some proof
that Pam is safe.

777
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:01,663
We have an asset embedded
in the Company operations room

778
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:04,366
who was able to access
the details of her location

779
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:07,803
and the position
of her bird-dog.

780
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:09,104
That's great.

781
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:11,306
That's not good enough.

782
00:39:11,374 --> 00:39:14,143
I need to know
that she's in the clear.

783
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,812
I'm ready to
execute that order,

784
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,548
but first, I need you
to hand over Scylla.

785
00:39:24,621 --> 00:39:27,456
It's only a matter of time
before the General realizes

786
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:31,026
that I turned my back on him.

787
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:32,828
And Michael.

788
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:36,632
And when he does,

789
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:40,569
he's going to want revenge.

790
00:39:40,637 --> 00:39:41,737
Go make the call.

791
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:44,506
Alex.

792
00:39:50,613 --> 00:39:52,581
This isn't about threats.

793
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:54,783
This isn't about games.

794
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,686
This is about how
people do business.

795
00:39:57,754 --> 00:40:01,223
I would be a fool if I gave
you everything you want

796
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,592
before I had some
kind of guarantee

797
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,228
that I'm going to get
everything I want.

798
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,647
You've been busy.

799
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:31,186
Here it is.

800
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:32,321
Where's the rest of it?

801
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,295
All right.

802
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:42,331
I've kept my end
of the deal.

803
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,399
Time for you
to make good on yours.

804
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:47,436
Make the call, please, and
Linc and I will be on our way.

805
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:50,105
Well, if it's okay with you, I'd
like to check this out first,

806
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:51,640
make sure everything works

807
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,475
before anybody
goes anywhere.

808
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:55,344
Lock him up.

809
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:07,623
What are you doing here?

810
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,625
Saving your ass.

811
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:11,960
I couldn't make
that choice, Sara.

812
00:41:12,028 --> 00:41:14,663
I had to save you both.

813
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:17,833
If there's something you need
to do to protect Pam,

814
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,334
you should do it.

815
00:41:25,842 --> 00:41:28,544
Alex.

816
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:35,217
There may be some way
we can save everyone.

817
00:41:37,754 --> 00:41:39,454
The bad news is

818
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:40,489
my mother can read
my every move.

819
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:44,192
She says it's
because she knows me.

820
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,694
The good news is

821
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:47,829
she doesn't know you.

822
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:50,766
I knew the General
would never honor

823
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,967
his end of the arrangement.

824
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:53,769
I knew...

825
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:56,271
I knew he'd never
bring you to the exchange, so

826
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,173
I did what I had to do.

827
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,613
How big an explosion
are we talking about?

828
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:09,384
Big enough to end all this,

829
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:12,154
so we can...

830
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,089
maybe start something new.

831
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,461
I mean, if that's...

832
00:42:19,529 --> 00:42:20,896
what you're feeling.

833
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,314
Come on, you got to get
off the table. Come on.

834
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,516
We got to get to the
other side of the room.

835
00:42:42,585 --> 00:42:43,552
Over here.

836
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,954
Slide down the wall.

837
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,024
You ready to get
the hell out of here?

838
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,359
Yeah.

839
00:42:54,297 --> 00:42:55,731
There's something wrong.

840
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:57,799
I'm not getting
any kind of connection.

841
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,424
Michael.

842
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:17,425
