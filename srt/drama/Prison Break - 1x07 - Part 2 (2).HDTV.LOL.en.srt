1
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:03,808
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:05,293
I didn't kill that man,
Michael.

3
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:06,568
The evidence says you did.

4
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:07,830
I was set up.

5
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,115
Put down your weapon.

6
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:14,126
I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison cell.

7
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:16,310
I'm looking for someone.
A guy named Lincoln Burrows.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,969
The man killed the Vice
President's brother.

9
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,676
Why you want to see
Burrows so bad anyhow?

10
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:21,715
- 'Cause he's my brother.
- I'm getting you out of here.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,881
That's impossible.

12
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:24,928
Not if you designed
the place it isn't.

13
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:27,625
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

14
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,370
I've got them on me.

15
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,977
I took some time to
speak to your mother...

16
00:00:32,026 --> 00:00:33,843
If you're talking about
that guy at Fox River...

17
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:35,405
He refuses to call
him his father.

18
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,476
Take the only thing
Burrows has left.

19
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:41,075
The chair isn't the only way to
take a man's life in prison.

20
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,871
And now,
scenes from last week's episode.

21
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,441
Constantly coming
up here for count

22
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,767
won't let me do what I need to
do to get through that wall.

23
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,029
Only way to stop
count is a lockdown.

24
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:52,073
You've got to get
the inmates riled up.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,376
All right, that's it!
Lockdown!

26
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,790
Somebody made an
anonymous phone call.

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,544
Whoever made that call
couldn't have seen Lincoln.

28
00:00:58,574 --> 00:00:59,423
How do you know?

29
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,917
Because the phone call
came from Washington, DC.

30
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:06,304
This is Bellick.
Our wing has been breached.

31
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,990
Hooke's Law of Elasticity.

32
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,904
If we drill holes in
strategic locations,

33
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:13,787
we compromise the load-carrying
capacity of the wall.

34
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:14,918
Take the cuffs off.

35
00:01:15,197 --> 00:01:16,519
A rookie CO.

36
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,127
Get out of here, T-Bag.

37
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,970
I think we can work
something out.

38
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:21,110
No deal.

39
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:25,884
Where's my daughter?

40
00:01:25,976 --> 00:01:27,128
Not to worry, sir. She's fine.

41
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:29,358
The guard there assures us
that everything is fine.

42
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:30,825
We have everything under control,
Governor.

43
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,181
You better hope you do.

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,759
They're breaking out.

45
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:40,023
They're breaking...

46
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,568
Shh.

47
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:44,749
We need a favor.

48
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:46,636
Some heavy hitters
want this done so...

49
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,183
Burrows is as good as dead.

50
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:50,298
- You looking for Scofield?
- Yeah.

51
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,762
Come on.

52
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,115
Hey, yo,
Big Stroke's about to get the doc!

53
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,030
Sucre,
I need you to finish what we started.

54
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,818
No one touches the CO. No one.

55
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,823
- Any word from the governor?
- Not yet, boss.

56
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,986
Bellick!
Get those guys in line!

57
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:27,969
Get them into formation.

58
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,385
- We going back in?
- Not yet.

59
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,383
We cut the water off
about an hour ago.

60
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,570
The stink alone should
drive them out of there.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,645
- You think that's gonna work?
- No, but it's protocol,

62
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,211
and we're all gonna
do this by the book.

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,969
It's the best chance we have of
everybody getting out of there without
getting hurt.

64
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:44,562
Hey!

65
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:50,006
This is the warden!

66
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:51,992
What's happening in there?

67
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:53,881
Hey, we got some demands!

68
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,611
Tell them we need
the air back on.

69
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,555
We need the AC!

70
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,388
We've got a hostage:
the guard.

71
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:05,380
We got a hostage!
The new jack!

72
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:08,810
Find out who's in there.

73
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,022
They got Bob.

74
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:23,621
That girl doctor--
tell him we got her.

75
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,465
Why don't you do it?

76
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,596
I don't want to get shot.

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,146
And we got the girl doctor!

78
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,750
- The doctor?
- There's only one.

79
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,926
How the hell did that happen?

80
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:40,006
How did they get
their hands on her?

81
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,153
I thought she was safe.
She was in Sick Bay.

82
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:44,622
We've got to get her out of there.
Somebody has got to go in there, now.

83
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,125
- We can't do it, sir.
- Why not?

84
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:49,491
It's not by the book.

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,557
Sir,
I've got some updates for you.

86
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,523
Help!

87
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,734
Help!

88
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:27,417
Scofield's in here?

89
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,544
He's in here?

90
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:40,148
Turk?

91
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:42,212
Turk!

92
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,799
You ain't gonna use that.

93
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,614
You makin' up the rules now,
ese?

94
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:24,113
It's my house.
You got a problem?

95
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,821
Yeah, I got a problem.
We all do.

96
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,334
No problem.

97
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:30,465
I swear to God.

98
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:32,872
I'm not gonna say anything.

99
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,716
- I didn't see anything.
- That's right, badge.

100
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,128
You didn't see nothing.

101
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:41,897
W ait.

102
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,072
Don't leave.

103
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,145
Sorry. I'll be back.

104
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,862
Don't worry.
I'll cover for you.

105
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:06,207
Don't worry, CO, all right?
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

106
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,856
I'm part of the team now.

107
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:18,268
Help a brother out.
Drag that over.

108
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:25,847
Cat's away...
Mm-hmm, hmm, hmm.

109
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,119
Ladies  and gentlemen, please return to
your seats and fasten your seat belts.

110
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,357
We are making our final
approach into Washington, DC.

111
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,969
We need to focus on
the real question.

112
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:19,475
Who wanted Terrence
Steadman dead?

113
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:22,703
The call came from DC.
What does that tell you?

114
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,957
You got to think past the government,
though.

115
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:28,072
Anybody could be here.
A business partner, a rival...

116
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,570
Before Steadman was killed,

117
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:34,768
EcoField introduced a prototype electric
engine at the techno conference.

118
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:39,653
$60 barrels of oil would be obsolete
if that thing ever hit the mainstream.

119
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,972
Could be oil, oil companies...

120
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:46,205
Suppliers, consumers,
everything in between.

121
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,426
Or the government of an
oil-based economy...

122
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,971
like the United States.

123
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,334
- Can I take your soda?
- Oh, sure.

124
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,413
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

125
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,524
At any rate, we land,

126
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:01,990
we meet my guy,

127
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:06,131
and even if we don't find the person who
tipped off the cops, we find his phone.

128
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,166
The paper trail begins.

129
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,785
That's the governor.

130
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:56,222
Whatever happens,
don't say anything.

131
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:23,355
Governor,
I appreciate your coming.

132
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:26,376
Now, you should know, since our
conversation, the situation has
escalated.

133
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,787
But not to worry, we're making
good progress with our contacts.

134
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,573
Just cut the crap, Warden,

135
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,707
and tell me where
my daughter is.

136
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:38,987
Help!

137
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:44,369
Help!

138
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:51,296
We got a... "Tyler Robert
Hudson." That is fancy, CO.

139
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:54,482
Look at that address:
144 Oak Park...

140
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:56,681
What's this?

141
00:12:57,429 --> 00:12:58,427
Terrace.

142
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,218
Terrace.

143
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,722
How do you swing that, CO?

144
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,571
Sounds like you're about
something living on a... terrace.

145
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:10,298
I can't wait to kick it on a terrace.
What...

146
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:13,535
Aww... aww...

147
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,844
This here must be
your daughter.

148
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,167
Put it back.

149
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,254
Prom?

150
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:25,973
You know what they say about
a prom dress, don't you?

151
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:32,317
She ain't come home that night,
did she?

152
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,859
No, she wore that all....
night long.

153
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,947
Next morning

154
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,787
she had to throw that dress in
the trash can behind the motel,

155
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,731
so her mama didn't see the...

156
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,514
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

157
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:51,903
What the hell are you doing?

158
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,675
I'm just kicking it with Deputy Dawg,
you know... talking women.

159
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:03,594
I'll be very clear here because you
and I face an evolutionary cap...

160
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:08,555
You ain't gonna hurt this man.

161
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:12,489
We're locked into this thing now,
understand?

162
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,688
And  he's the only
leverage we have.

163
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:24,417
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

164
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,176
Now,
do we have an understanding?

165
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:33,697
I'm on your side now.
Do you understand me?

166
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,754
I'm just going with the flow.

167
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:39,687
You let me know when you're
done with your, uh, "leverage."

168
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,709
Let me out!

169
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,050
Let's smoke the bitch out!

170
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:52,211
It ain't gonna hurt real bad,
if you make it easy...

171
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:53,870
If you make it hard, though...

172
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,191
Open the door! Come here.

173
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,209
Come open this door!
Open this door!

174
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:04,465
Come on.

175
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:05,970
Grab my hand.

176
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:08,365
Come on!

177
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:21,276
I've got you.

178
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:31,786
You're all right?

179
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:34,116
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

180
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:38,325
See these pipes?

181
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,930
We're going to stay on them.

182
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,868
They go through the wall
and over the hallway,

183
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,961
and they're going to
get us out of here.

184
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:46,940
All you have to
do is follow me.

185
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,271
- Okay?
- Okay.

186
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:51,108
Okay.

187
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:53,004
Let's go.

188
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:04,976
Where did she go?

189
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,727
Where are we meeting him?

190
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,453
Georgetown,
in a parking garage.

191
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:25,979
He's a private investigator.

192
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,459
He used to be my roommate,
freshman year at Duke.

193
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:34,543
The disturbance has escalated
at this Chicago-area prison.

194
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,384
Oh, my God, Nick, look.

195
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:37,091
At least two hostages
have been confirmed

196
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:40,004
in what is now being
called a full-scale riot,

197
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,376
here at the Fox River
State Penitentiary.

198
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,516
Should we go back
or keep going?

199
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,420
Just keep going.

200
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:51,532
You want to go back and stand there with
the rest of the people who aren't
helping?

201
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:54,506
Come on.

202
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,655
The National Guard responded after
Illinois Governor Frank Tancredi

203
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:01,021
declared a state of emergency
shortly after 3:00 p.m.

204
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:02,552
Come on, honey.
It's time to go.

205
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,793
Hold on. Hold on.

206
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:06,453
No word on what caused the initial
disturbance, but sources with the...

207
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,191
That's not Fox River, is it?

208
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,563
- What are you doing?
- We have to go. Come on.

209
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:17,993
No, Dad might be in trouble.

210
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,806
Look, your father's already in trouble.
There's nothing we can do about it.

211
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,581
Just don't make a scene, okay?

212
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,551
He gets very uncomfortable
with this thing. Just...

213
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:30,615
Let's just go, okay?

214
00:18:30,732 --> 00:18:33,314
- Oh, God forbid, man!
- Please!

215
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,924
We're just talking about my
old man here and his life.

216
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,222
If-if that's all
right with you.

217
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:41,914
- Leave me out of this.
- I am leaving you out of it.

218
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:43,875
I left you out of it
the day I met you.

219
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:44,691
Okay, L.J.

220
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:47,251
Because nothing in her life or
mine has anything to do with you.

221
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,670
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

222
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,883
Oh, yeah? Or what?

223
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:51,366
You see,
this is what I'm talking about.

224
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,881
This is the kind of crap
I have to deal with.

225
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:53,823
Just let me handle it!

226
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,159
The kind of crap you
have to deal with?

227
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:58,366
- L.J., do you want to talk...
- Oh! You got no clue, do you?

228
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,714
- Honey, look.
- Leave me alone!

229
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,478
- Get off me!
- What the hell are you doing?

230
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,894
You don't talk to
her like that.

231
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:05,491
Stop it!

232
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:06,805
Stop!

233
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:12,029
Go upstairs, L.J., now!

234
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:13,077
Go!

235
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,517
- You love that man?
- Just go.

236
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,732
- You love that man.
- Do what I say.

237
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:46,770
Turk, why are you doing this?
Who sent you?

238
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:49,381
Why?  Why?

239
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,032
Why'd you do this?

240
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,784
What's it all about?
Who sent you?

241
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:31,581
Man, you've got to help me.

242
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:34,098
You've got to help me. Please.

243
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:37,539
Talk!

244
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,152
Who's your friend?

245
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,296
You scared the hell out of me.

246
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,216
Who you talking to?

247
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,152
It's the Fish's idea.

248
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:22,676
The devil marks the walls so you
know where to drill the holes.

249
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,748
You're making holes
with an egg beater?

250
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,239
I know. Crazy, huh?

251
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,773
It's called the Hooker Law.

252
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:32,777
It says that if you poke the exact
right holes in something big and strong,

253
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,440
it gets very weak.

254
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:37,112
That's true.

255
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:40,589
When the wall is weak,
we can take it down.

256
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:43,668
At least that's the plan.

257
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,288
Yeah. It's always the plan.

258
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,667
You should never
underestimate a wall.

259
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:53,308
You see...

260
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:59,641
sometimes, no matter how hard you try,
it just won't give in.

261
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,396
Are you all right?

262
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:14,671
I'm okay. I'm fine.

263
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,567
You know what?
I need a minute. I'm sorry.

264
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,037
- It's not much further.
- Just a sec.

265
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:39,116
We can stop if you want,
catch your breath.

266
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:42,632
Yeah, I could use a minute.

267
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,817
Things should be
winding down around now.

268
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,526
Pretty soon the powers-that-be
will break in and...

269
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:54,860
it'll all be over.
It's just a matter of time.

270
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:57,940
What's happening anyway?

271
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:02,224
All hell is breaking loose.

272
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:06,294
But I think if we stay up
here we should be okay.

273
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,729
I can't believe
this is happening.

274
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:25,668
You ever been to Baja?

275
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:30,100
-  Mexico?
- No.

276
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:32,191
There's this great
place down there.

277
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,156
20 bucks a night,

278
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:36,656
hammock on the back deck.

279
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,276
Beers are 50 cents.

280
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,214
25 cents at happy hour.

281
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,640
You ever been to Thailand?

282
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,045
Thailand's great.

283
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,710
Michael, if you're trying to calm me
down, you're doing a terrible job.

284
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:55,140
But I am trying.

285
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:59,183
Shh! You hear that?

286
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,582
- Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

287
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:07,404
Crawling around in the ceiling,
risking your life.

288
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,300
You needed help, and, uh...

289
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:12,423
I came to find you.

290
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:20,581
How did you know where to go?

291
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:25,901
When everything
went off in A Wing,

292
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,615
the COs left the station.
I saw you on the monitor.

293
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,518
One of my first assignments on PI,
we were up here,

294
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:34,655
cleaning out toxic mold.
It took days. So,

295
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,981
I'm kind of familiar
with the layout.

296
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,093
I hope you wore a mask.

297
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:41,988
Excuse me?

298
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:45,244
To prevent inhalation.
Mold can be really dangerous.

299
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,123
Yeah. I wore a mask.

300
00:24:55,181 --> 00:24:56,548
Get up. Get up there.

301
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:03,472
The door to the visitation room,
did you ever use it?

302
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,171
Um... not usually,
but my access card should work.

303
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:08,442
Get up. Get up.

304
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:10,621
Psst!

305
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:14,758
Let's go.

306
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,451
Let's go!

307
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:42,587
Yes, sir, I understand. But believe me,
Sara is our top priority.

308
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:45,548
The hell she is. I ordered a
state of emergency an hour ago.

309
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,578
Soldier,
get me your commanding officer.

310
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,853
Now what the hell is
going on out here?

311
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:51,158
Negotiating, sir.

312
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:52,499
They can't hold
out much longer.

313
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,728
Negotiating?!

314
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:56,150
It is 100 degrees in there.
They're almost out of water.

315
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,092
We are trying to avoid
doing anything extreme.

316
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:01,279
Look, I don't care if it takes a
massacre to get her out of there.

317
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,319
Do you understand me?

318
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:04,149
Now if you're not gonna do it,
I am!

319
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:06,509
Captain, spread the news.
You're going in.

320
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:09,221
It's time to do this my way.

321
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:25,636
All right.

322
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:55,662
Hey!

323
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:56,505
Fish!

324
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,728
You gonna keep that
nurse all to yourself?

325
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:20,329
S troke!

326
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:31,375
Somebody help me.

327
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:34,382
Come on, this way!

328
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:56,897
Good call, Governor,
bringing in the big guns.

329
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:58,953
I appreciate your support.

330
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:00,710
Captain Brad Bellick.

331
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:06,373
I sent you a letter earlier this year.
My views on penal reform.

332
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,861
Oh. And what are they?

333
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:13,087
These inmates don't mess around.
Us COs need to get tough.

334
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:16,169
Warden Pope's a good guy.
Don't get me wrong.

335
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,558
But he doesn't understand
that sometimes

336
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:21,028
you got to grab the situation
by the gonads and take control.

337
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,842
And is that what you would do,
Captain?

338
00:28:22,872 --> 00:28:25,059
Yes, sir,
that's exactly what I'd do.

339
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,343
Give me that. Give me that.

340
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:39,186
- I don't know...
- Give me that thing.

341
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,018
Demolition runs in the family.

342
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,513
The whole trick is pressure.

343
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:46,698
Where should I... Here?

344
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,444
- Yeah...
- Good, good.

345
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,920
You see, you should push hard,
but not too hard.

346
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:54,099
Just like when you, you know.

347
00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:55,515
Yeah, well,
you got to be careful, though.

348
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,684
- Yeah, I know it.
- No, I mean it. You...

349
00:28:57,776 --> 00:28:59,500
One slip,
and you-you'll hit the gas pipe.

350
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,236
Gas... pipe?

351
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:05,002
Yeah, you know,
as in pipe that carries the gas.

352
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:18,035
We can't go this way.

353
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:20,452
We have to.
There's no other way to Visitation.

354
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:21,684
This is it.

355
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,143
No, it's not.

356
00:29:24,658 --> 00:29:26,757
- It's back this way.
- This won't help.

357
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,612
- Trust me.
- Michael, if you're wrong...

358
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,988
We don't have time.

359
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:38,865
Not too hard.

360
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,382
Not... too soft.

361
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:45,134
When I was her age,
I had such bad skin.

362
00:29:45,223 --> 00:29:50,020
Oh! Ooh! Eee!
Acne they called it.

363
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:56,644
Yeah. She looks just like all
them girls who made fun of me.

364
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,582
After I kill you,

365
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,845
I'm gonna crawl out that hole
and call me up a limousine,

366
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:07,210
and me and your baby
is going to the prom.

367
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:31,277
Captain,
what's the news with Sara?

368
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:32,526
We're still trying to find her,
sir.

369
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:34,035
You don't even
know where she is?

370
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,474
We're on it.
Soon as we do, we'll let you know.

371
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:41,387
You should've listened to Captain
Bellick and gassed the whole block.

372
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,130
Captain Bellick?

373
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:45,958
He's right on the front line.
He knows what these guys can do.

374
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:48,838
You better pray that Sara gets
out of there in one piece.

375
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,453
I do, Governor,
but this is still my prison.

376
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:57,116
Whatever happens,
I take full responsibility. Excuse me.

377
00:31:09,456 --> 00:31:10,690
It's this way.

378
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:12,664
Uh! Yeah.

379
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:17,885
Ooh... yes. We're through.

380
00:31:20,585 --> 00:31:22,389
Time to put this
theory to the test.

381
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,083
I guess we start
chipping away now.

382
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:29,550
Right on.
She's all yours, pal.

383
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:00,127
The smell. The sm...

384
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:02,788
We did it.

385
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,245
That's it.

386
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:10,313
But I can't leave you here.

387
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:13,293
You don't have a choice.
I'm one of the bad guys, remember?

388
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:25,980
Do you see the assailant?

389
00:32:26,062 --> 00:32:29,731
Number eight, affirmative.
I've got him in sight.

390
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,914
What are you going to do?

391
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,186
Go back to my cell.
Stay out of the way.

392
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,617
- Michael...
- What?

393
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:42,139
They see us.

394
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:47,129
You have to go.

395
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,963
I can't. They'll kill you.

396
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:04,963
You go out the door,
I'll drop to the floor.

397
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:07,343
They're sharpshooters, Michael.
They won't miss.

398
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:08,997
That's why you
can't stay here.

399
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,234
- What's going on?!
- I'm coming, Doc!

400
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,337
Go!

401
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,479
Who's this?

402
00:33:52,337 --> 00:33:53,679
That's my guy.

403
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:05,886
Hey.

404
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:07,561
Nice ride.

405
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:09,085
Yeah, you like that?

406
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,526
Cop auction. 300 bucks.

407
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,783
You must be Veronica.

408
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,718
Whoever tipped off the cops about
Lincoln Burrows called from this number.

409
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,928
That wasn't an easy trace.
I hope you're not too bummed.

410
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:27,161
- Why, what's the problem?
- It's a pay phone.

411
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,087
This is it,
11th and Constitution.

412
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:33,531
Anyone could have
made that call.

413
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:36,661
Any one of the million people
who pass through here every day.

414
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:38,917
That's empty.

415
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:41,776
What about that?

416
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:45,040
Federal Energy Commission,
that's interesting.

417
00:34:47,468 --> 00:34:48,699
Where you going?

418
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:51,443
I'm gonna go see if this
guy knows what was in there.

419
00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:57,148
Excuse me.

420
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:00,543
Do you know what was
in that space before?

421
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:04,284
Okay, thanks.

422
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:09,564
Hey.

423
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:12,636
It was the regional headquarters
for a company called EcoField.

424
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:15,458
- Terrence Steadman's company.
- That's right.

425
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:30,918
- Hello?
- Veronica?

426
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:35,851
- Who is this?
- That's the problem, Veronica.

427
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:37,755
You ask too many questions.

428
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,818
Now I have one for you.

429
00:35:41,147 --> 00:35:43,492
Is Lincoln Burrows
really worth it?

430
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,285
Gove me the phone.
Who is this?

431
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:49,422
Nick Savrinn,
I just wanted to let you know.

432
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:52,651
As of now,
both of you are dead.

433
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:56,283
Come on, let's go.

434
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:04,305
Michael! Michael!

435
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,017
Michael!

436
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:09,984
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

437
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:13,611
I didn't touch him, man.
I didn't touch him!

438
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:16,287
Ask him!
Things have changed since we last met.

439
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:22,804
Relax, partner.
I'm in on it now.

440
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,079
The rabbit plan.
Know all about it. So does the CO.

441
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:33,143
Sucre!

442
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:37,510
Why'd you take Abruzzi down there?
I didn't take him down there.

443
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:39,061
And the pedophile--
he thinks he's in!

444
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:41,835
- Shut up!
- Where's Michael?

445
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,336
Where's Michael?!

446
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:47,702
Michael!

447
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:14,969
Where have you been?

448
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,156
All over. Are you all right?

449
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,799
- Yeah, are you?
- Yes. Yes.

450
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,181
Move!

451
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm okay. I'm okay.

452
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:38,182
Bellick.

453
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,251
She's walking.
That's a good sign.

454
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:44,056
Yeah. Astute observation.

455
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:46,815
Maybe you'd like to share
that with the governor?

456
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,737
I was tense. I was just...

457
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:52,414
Next time you bad-mouth me
to one of my superiors,

458
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:54,646
there are going to be
serious consequences.

459
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,025
Do I make myself clear,
Captain?

460
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,800
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

461
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:06,527
Sara!

462
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,994
Sara! Sara!

463
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:11,493
- Dad?
- Sara!

464
00:38:12,544 --> 00:38:14,928
Thank God. Are you all right?
Are you okay?

465
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:18,698
I told you when you took this job, I
knew something like this was going to
happen.

466
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:21,236
Didn't I? I knew something
like this was gonna happen.

467
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,925
God, Dad, how about,
"I'm happy to see you alive"?

468
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,738
Oh, sweetheart, I just want you to
see what you're doing to yourself.

469
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,723
I mean, there is nobody that
is forcing you to be here.

470
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,742
I know. Thanks, Dad.

471
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,397
All right. Clean this mess up.

472
00:38:51,302 --> 00:38:52,070
What's going on?

473
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,625
You won't believe it, Fish. We did it.
We never seen nothing like it.

474
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:56,516
Those little "Hooker"
holes were right on!

475
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:58,967
All right, let's get everyone
out of here, especially him!

476
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm getting him out of here.
I'm going to take care of him myself.

477
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,800
- You're not gonna kill him.
- I'm not coming back here.

478
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,680
It's over!
We don't need him no more.

479
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:06,845
You're not gonna kill him.

480
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,418
You so stupid you're gonna let
him walk out that front door?

481
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,342
- That ain't for you to decide.
- After all he's seen?

482
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:13,029
- After all he's seen?
- Get up.

483
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:14,930
- After all he's seen?
- Get out!

484
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:18,274
Keep your mouth shut.
Turn left.

485
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,539
Get out!

486
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,939
If we have a problem,
we know where to find you.

487
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,270
Bye-bye.

488
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:31,524
Forget about it.
Just forget about it, all right?!

489
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:52,050
No!

490
00:40:15,117 --> 00:40:16,618
One for the team.

491
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:37,537
Okay, so this is the complete
list of the injured and the dead?

492
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,624
- And it's the whole list?
- Yeah.

493
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,790
Thank you very much.

494
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:45,866
Oh, thanks.

495
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:48,889
Hey, Ron.

496
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:51,943
Dr. Tancredi.

497
00:40:52,337 --> 00:40:53,968
Glad to see you
made it out alive.

498
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:55,414
Yeah, me, too.

499
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,476
- Um, question.
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:01,249
Why'd your department
assign inmates on PI

501
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,516
to do a toxic mold
removal project?

502
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:07,192
What toxic mold project?

503
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,324
In the crawlspace in A Wing.

504
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,407
PI didn't go there.

505
00:41:13,522 --> 00:41:15,759
We'd never assign
inmates to do that.

506
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:20,081
- Okay, sorry.
- No problem.

507
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:38,281
