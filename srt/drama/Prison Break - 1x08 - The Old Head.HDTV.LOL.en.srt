1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:01,922
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:04,190
I'm looking for someone.
A guy named Lincoln Burrows.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,777
The man killed the Vice
President's brother.

4
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:07,532
Why you want to see
Burrows so bad anyhow?

5
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:09,622
'Cause he's my brother.
I'm getting you out of here.

6
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:10,780
It's impossible.

7
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:12,908
Not if you designed the place,
it isn't.

8
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:15,626
- You've seen the blueprints?
- Better than that.

9
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:17,005
I've got them on me.

10
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:21,476
Nick Savrinn, as of now,
both of you are dead.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,191
This is Bellick.
Our wing has been breached.

12
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:26,618
Marilyn, no!

13
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:30,795
The chair isn't the only way to
take a man's life in prison.

14
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:31,766
What are you doing?

15
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:33,939
Your father's already in trouble.
There's nothing we can do about it.

16
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:34,596
Come on.

17
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,732
My first assignments on PI,
we were up here cleaning out toxic mold.

18
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:42,326
PI didn't go there.
We'd never assign inmates to do that.

19
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,955
Tyler, Robert.

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,793
This here must be
your daughter.

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,596
It's over!
We don't need him no more.

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,142
You're not gonna kill him.

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,158
One for the team.

24
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:06,768
17 days from now they strap my
brother to an electric chair...

25
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:13,203
Send 50,000 bolts coursing through
his body for a crime he didn't commit.

26
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:17,549
I'm here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

27
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,523
I've been in Fox River
nearly three weeks now.

28
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,003
In that time, I've managed to
get out the back of my cell

29
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,939
and into the old steam pipes
that run through the prison.

30
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:34,679
Those pipes are our way out.

31
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:39,025
Think of this place
like a map of the U.S.

32
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,203
Our cell over there,
that's New York City.

33
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,880
The infirmary, our exit,
that's California.

34
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:49,467
The pipes beneath our feet
that connect the two...

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,556
Route 66.

36
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,396
Route 66.

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,732
Our ticket out of here.

38
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:55,654
I assume we're
doing this at night.

39
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:56,908
That's right.

40
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:01,086
We're locked up, Fish,
and your boy is in solitary.

41
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:03,426
How are we just gonna
fly out of our cages

42
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:06,308
and right into your cell,
right into New York City?

43
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:07,521
You're not.

44
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:12,367
You're gonna meet me half way,
in Saint Louis.

45
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:14,707
Route 66 runs directly
beneath that building.

46
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,435
It's the only building sitting
on top of those tunnels.

47
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:20,432
All we gotta do is
get in there on PI...

48
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,980
and dig ourselves an on-ramp.

49
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,361
Shortly after,
we hit the infirmary.

50
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,242
Then we'll be
outside those walls.

51
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:28,329
What's in there?

52
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:30,459
It's an old storage room.

53
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,811
Figure John here can pull
all the strings he needs.

54
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:36,058
It's not that easy, Fish.
That's a restricted area.

55
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,108
I got to be able to
justify it to the bulls

56
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,585
and how it's got to be some
actual work to be done in there

57
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,131
for me to get in there.
You follow?

58
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,664
Then you better figure it out.

59
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,880
'Cause if we don't
get in that room,

60
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,137
we're not getting out of here.

61
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,309
Feeling kind of left out.

62
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,574
New York? California? Saint Louis?
What are we discussing?

63
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:58,453
Talking baseball, actually.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,936
Now that's a subject I just
happen to know quite a bit about.

65
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,599
What a shame.
The conversation's over.

66
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:07,103
Really now?

67
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,066
That any way to
treat a teammate?

68
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:17,173
I'm coming along on this endeavor
whether you like it or not.

69
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:21,100
'Cause I've got a hell of
a singing voice otherwise.

70
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:26,198
I won't take that
piece of crap along.

71
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:28,245
- I won't do it.
- Me neither.

72
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:32,549
We won't have to.
He'll be out of the picture soon enough.

73
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,314
The state provides
$25,000 insurance,

74
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:41,699
plus donations from the Illinois
Corrections Officers Foundation.

75
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:45,376
That's the last thing on
my mind right now, Warden.

76
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:48,342
Do you know who killed him?

77
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:49,888
We have some leads.

78
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:52,395
But I can promise you this:

79
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:55,487
we are not gonna rest until
we find out what happened.

80
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:58,705
His pictures are missing.

81
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,796
He had a photo of
our daughter in here.

82
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:05,933
Not to worry. We'll find them.

83
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:13,454
I begged him not
to take this job.

84
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:16,755
Shauna, I am so sorry.

85
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,644
I'll walk you to your car.

86
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:23,774
Captain.

87
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:25,959
I need to speak with
you for a second.

88
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,702
I'll meet you in the hallway.

89
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,552
I want the son of a
bitch who did this.

90
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:37,103
Now you do whatever you
need to do to find him.

91
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,109
You understand?

92
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,240
I've got five boxes.
You want to give me a hand?

93
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:50,850
Veronica?

94
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:55,374
That phone call was textbook scare
tactics. That's what they want.

95
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,546
They want to scare us from
doing what they know we can do.

96
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,958
- And what's that?
- Expose them.

97
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,017
This guy bothering you again,
Miss Donovan?

98
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:05,766
No, Lucasz. The other night was my
fault. It was a misunderstanding.

99
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,399
Okay, but if you
need anything...

100
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:11,240
Trust me.
You'll be the first person I call.

101
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:14,164
Here.  Let me.

102
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,685
Those boxes contain seven years
of criminal appellate work.

103
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:24,109
If there's a precedent
in there somewhere

104
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,498
that can help us suspend Lincoln's
execution, we're gonna find it.

105
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,722
You can just leave those by the door,
Lucasz. I'll bring them in.

106
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,635
Oh, that's okay.
I've got your key right here.

107
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:37,108
If I didn't know better,
I would say Lucasz was sweet on you.

108
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:38,649
Very funny.

109
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:25,487
F ire.

110
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:26,867
What?

111
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,997
Fire. We burn the place down.

112
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,542
How's that gonna help us?

113
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:32,622
A few years ago,
the chapel burned down

114
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:36,142
and the D.O.C.
realized they had some toxic issues--

115
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:38,942
you know, asbestos,
lead paint, you name it.

116
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:42,786
They couldn't find a contractor,
so they put the inmates on the job.

117
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:46,337
We spent like five,
six hours in there at a time.

118
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:50,641
But the good news is no guards
came around almost at all.

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,939
Can you get us in there?

120
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,365
Been doing a little,
uh, thinking.

121
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,015
I'm gonna need a PI card,
aren't I?

122
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:11,449
I mean that's where this whole
thing is happening, isn't it?

123
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,455
It's on its way.

124
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,552
You're slow-walking me,
aren't you?

125
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,140
Why would I do such a thing?

126
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:24,526
You think Bellick's gonna pop
me for shanking that C.O. Bob.

127
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,382
Maybe you'll take a little walk
and tell him for yourself, right?

128
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:30,416
Then, I'll be out of
your hair for good.

129
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,633
Well, I got news for you.

130
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:36,560
If I go down for killing Bob,
believe me,

131
00:07:36,644 --> 00:07:38,733
I'm gonna take a
little walk of my own.

132
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:43,621
Tell them about that hole
you got behind your toilet.

133
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:47,173
So...

134
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,143
how about that PI card?

135
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,851
I don't know if you remember,

136
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,950
but that summer
before fifth grade,

137
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:59,081
when I stayed with
you a couple weeks,

138
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:01,922
and you thought I broke
your glass coffee table...

139
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:07,228
And when you came home,
I denied it.

140
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:13,580
But you told me you could care
less about the coffee table.

141
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:16,003
You just didn't want
me lying to you.

142
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:19,847
And you said I'd feel a lot better
if I just told you the truth.

143
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:23,440
And you promised
not to be angry.

144
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,481
I remember.

145
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:27,748
Well, I broke it.

146
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:30,795
I know.

147
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:37,897
You know, if there's anything that
you want to get off your chest,

148
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:39,109
you can tell me.

149
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,783
And I promise I
won't get angry.

150
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:44,039
You want to know if
I killed that guy.

151
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:53,566
I, uh, went there planning
to do something wrong.

152
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,870
But I didn't kill that guy.

153
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,254
Someone's working hard to
make it look like I did.

154
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:05,349
Anyway, there's a chance the
execution may not happen.

155
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:06,644
What?

156
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:08,232
Veronica's working my case.

157
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,616
I got a reporter coming today who
actually believes I'm innocent.

158
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:14,582
So I ain't dead yet.

159
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,886
LJ, look at me.

160
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,351
You got to have faith, kid.

161
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:24,402
Just have a little faith.

162
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,563
-  Kellerman.
- Well?

163
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,611
- Taken care of.
- Good.

164
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,825
Now move on to
the second thing.

165
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,135
If you could see what
we're looking at,

166
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,973
believe me,
Burrows is gonna get the message.

167
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,552
Which is what you've
assured me of before,

168
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:51,644
yet that message keeps
getting returned to sender.

169
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:54,819
Now move on the second
thing and report back.

170
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,491
We're headed there now.

171
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,165
You're thinking too much.

172
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,296
Yeah, God forbid.

173
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:10,416
He's gonna toss every cell in this
block until he finds the killer.

174
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:13,926
He tosses this one, he's gonna find
the hole back there in a heartbeat.

175
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:14,875
I know.

176
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:18,468
We got to turn him in.

177
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,733
That's the only way it'll stop.

178
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,351
We turn him in, he'll talk.

179
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,831
So we're screwed either way,
aren't we?

180
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,229
Which one?

181
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,527
Right there. Saint Louis.

182
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,101
What the hell are
you doing here?

183
00:11:06,226 --> 00:11:08,035
Clean up detail.
We thought this was storage.

184
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:11,127
This look like storage to you,
you idiot? It's a restricted area!

185
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:13,789
It's the guard's break room.
Now back it up!

186
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,505
- Back it up, now!
- Sorry.

187
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,677
Won't happen again.

188
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:32,046
Frickin' break room.
Are you kidding me?

189
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:35,570
They must have changed
it since the retrofit.

190
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,077
The bulls are camped out in there.
They'll never leave.

191
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:40,279
- You got a backup plan?
- There isn't one.

192
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,171
It's the only room sitting
on top of that pipe.

193
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,511
It's the only way out,
and we've gotta get back in there.

194
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,670
Impossible, Fish.

195
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,968
Maybe not. Check it out.

196
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,984
I don't get it.
How does he get in there?

197
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:56,993
He's a trustee,
ones with a high security clearance.

198
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,789
- Why him?
- He can be trusted.

199
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:00,376
How does one become a trustee?

200
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,881
Just have a spotless record
for the last 30 years.

201
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,680
Pretty much count's
all of us out.

202
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,859
Which means we've
gotta get him on board.

203
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:09,109
Forget it.
The guy's a Boy Scout.

204
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,132
Mr. Westmoreland?

205
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,347
Hey, Michael.

206
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:22,838
Have you found your cat yet?

207
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,196
Still M.I.A.

208
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:30,210
- You can always get another.
- I don't want another.

209
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:33,845
Besides, it's a moot point.
She was grandfathered.

210
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,851
Once she's gone, no more pets.

211
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,881
Wouldn't be an issue if
you were on the outside.

212
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,452
Still tugging on
that leash, eh?

213
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:43,539
Yup.

214
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:48,051
And this is the part where I
extend a formal invitation.

215
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:50,098
'Cause you still
think I'm D.B. Cooper?

216
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:52,647
I don't think, I know.

217
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,655
The way I see it,

218
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,789
you're in here doing 60-to-life
for vehicular manslaughter.

219
00:12:58,873 --> 00:13:00,586
It would have been 20,

220
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,424
but the car you
were in was stolen.

221
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,932
Felony murder rule
cubes up your sentence,

222
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,143
and here you are.

223
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:10,739
Hitting that woman was an accident.
But the car?

224
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,413
No one accidentally
steals a car.

225
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:15,085
So the question is,

226
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,636
why would Charles Westmoreland
be in Arizona boosting a car

227
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,565
ten states away from
where he lived,

228
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:23,088
and only ten miles away
from the Mexican border?

229
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,695
And why, two days before that,

230
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:29,165
would someone make a phone call to
his wife from a motel in Portland,

231
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:31,714
a stone's throw away
from the airport,

232
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,260
out of which, shortly after,

233
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:36,854
Flight 305 was hijacked
by one D.B. Cooper.

234
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,152
Seven hours after
the hijacking,

235
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,453
records show Charles Westmoreland
was treated for a busted knee

236
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:44,189
at a free clinic
in Brigham City.

237
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:47,269
Only way to get from Portland,
Oregon, to Brigham City, Utah,

238
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:49,680
in  seven hours was in a car,

239
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:54,026
breaking every land speed
record known to man, or flying.

240
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:58,998
It's public record D.B. Cooper jumped
out of that 727 about an hour after
take off.

241
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:03,386
Taking a dive at 10,000 feet
with $1.5 million in cash

242
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,391
in a hastily packed parachute,

243
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,065
might make for a
pretty rough landing.

244
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,196
Rough enough to
shatter some bones,

245
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:12,327
maybe even a left knee.

246
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:16,463
D.B. Cooper would've had a car
waiting for him when he landed.

247
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,971
According to DMV
records in 1971,

248
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:23,107
Charles Westmoreland was the
proud owner of a '65 Chevy Nova.

249
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,653
As it happens,

250
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,954
a '65 Chevy Nova with the
registration number scraped off

251
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:31,464
was found abandoned with a blown
gasket along the Arizona border,

252
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:35,224
a mile or two away from where
you accidentally hit that woman

253
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,439
with your stolen car.

254
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:41,700
Interesting story.

255
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:43,497
Interesting man.

256
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,466
But you didn't
answer one thing.

257
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,012
What's that?

258
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,146
Maybe I did hurt my knee.

259
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:54,778
I did steal that car.

260
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,745
And I did accidentally
hit that poor lady.

261
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:03,051
But how could I have hijacked a
plane in Portland on November 24

262
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:07,815
when I was in Folsom finishing up
a 30-day drunk and disorderly?

263
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:16,213
I hope you aren't hanging this
whole escape on that money,

264
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:18,451
'cause I'm not the one
in possession of it.

265
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,807
Thanks for the invite though.

266
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,157
Veronica.

267
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:46,881
Veronica. Come on.

268
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:52,648
We're okay.

269
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,116
How is this okay, Nick?

270
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,799
Somebody just tried to kill us.

271
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,040
I know. I was there.

272
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,234
Then act like it, okay?

273
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,135
We just watched a man burn to
death right in front of us.

274
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,269
My God.

275
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:10,781
Lucasz...  my God.

276
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,201
It's okay. It's okay.

277
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,041
We just left him there.

278
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,434
There was nothing we
could do for him.

279
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:18,568
He was dead as soon as
he opened the door.

280
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:21,770
I am trying so hard to
understand all this, Nick.

281
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:23,453
Who these people are,
what they want,

282
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,252
how we just walked away from there
without even calling the police.

283
00:16:26,282 --> 00:16:30,189
We did it because these people we're
dealing with won't stop until
we're dead.

284
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,436
Now, if they think we're dead,
like they do right now,

285
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:33,982
maybe we get a little
breathing room here,

286
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,235
we figure out what
our next move is.

287
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,573
No, we should go to the police.

288
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,996
I've been telling myself the same thing,
but you know what?

289
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,074
They're bigger than the police.

290
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,141
Now, we go to the authorities
and all we're gonna be doing

291
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,356
is broadcasting to them
that we're still alive.

292
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:51,091
And then we got that target
right in our back's again.

293
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,358
We can't hide forever.

294
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:56,533
No, no, maybe not forever, but

295
00:16:57,202 --> 00:17:00,157
I think I know a place we can,
at least for a little while.

296
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,712
We just have to go in
there ourselves then.

297
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,614
Like I said, unless the old man's in,
it's not possible.

298
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,423
And even if it were,
with the guards in there,

299
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:15,389
there's no way in hell they're just
gonna sit back and watch us start
a fire.

300
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,386
See, I already figured that part out.
I've been thinking.

301
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,433
And?

302
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,408
That thing you're doing
at the Pope's office?

303
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,277
- Using rubber cement?
- Yeah?

304
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,501
Can you get some out of there?

305
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:26,659
Maybe. Why?

306
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:29,720
Look, there's a coffeemaker
in the guard's room, right?

307
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,405
I've got a hookup with one
of my boys in the kitchen.

308
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,529
If we can get rubber cement in
the bottom of that coffeepot,

309
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,861
when the burner goes on...

310
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,116
It's a good idea.

311
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,781
But without Westmoreland,
we're never getting in that room.

312
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,186
He doesn't want to be
a part of the escape?

313
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:47,633
No.

314
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,389
Then what does he want?

315
00:17:49,556 --> 00:17:51,269
He's gotta want something.

316
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:53,985
Everybody wants something.

317
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:07,439
Come on, kitty. Come on.

318
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,537
Yes, that's a good girl.

319
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,603
I don't believe it.

320
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:26,492
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

321
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:27,548
Where'd you find her?

322
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,082
In the yard, by the chapel.

323
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,183
Why do I get the feeling there's
a string attached to this?

324
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,355
Not a string, just a favor.

325
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:44,417
-  I'm not D.B. Cooper.
- That's all right.

326
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:49,096
'Cause it's not gonna take D.B.
Cooper to do what I need done.

327
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:50,684
What's that?

328
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,982
All I want you to do

329
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:56,826
is take a certain coffeepot into
the guard room at a certain time

330
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:58,456
and turn the burner on.

331
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,043
Why?

332
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:02,604
Let's just say it would be
in everyone's best interest

333
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,890
if a fire were to
start in there.

334
00:19:05,225 --> 00:19:08,651
Marilyn, did you think he
was the arsonist type?

335
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:10,531
I'm not.

336
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,163
I'm the clean-up crew type.

337
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,130
The type that gets access
to all kinds of tools.

338
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:21,812
Michael, I'm grateful for this.
I really am.

339
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:26,909
But I've made it a point to keep my nose
clean ever since I walked into
this place.

340
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:29,207
32 years without a blemish.

341
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,595
If that parole board date ever comes,
I wanna be ready.

342
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,893
I can't jeopardize that.

343
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:37,314
Sorry.

344
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:43,581
Michael.

345
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:46,422
Thanks, though. Really.

346
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,913
After what you went
through in the riot,

347
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,542
I thought you might
take a day off.

348
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:56,701
I'm fine.

349
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:01,005
I, uh, couldn't find anybody
to cover for me anyway.

350
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,810
I hope you don't feel
like you owe me anything.

351
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:07,606
I do.

352
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,738
I'm, uh...

353
00:20:12,161 --> 00:20:14,459
I really appreciate
what you did for me.

354
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:21,019
But?

355
00:20:24,653 --> 00:20:29,709
But you told me that you had been
up in the crawl space for PI,

356
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:33,930
and PI was never
assigned to go there.

357
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:39,904
We're done here, right?

358
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,298
Michael, don't be like that.

359
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,918
I just...
I just want some answers.

360
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:47,258
Thanks for the shot, Doc.

361
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,111
Sue Parsons. Headline Press.

362
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,907
Thanks for coming by.

363
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,685
I appreciate you
taking the time.

364
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,733
I appreciate you
looking into my case.

365
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:03,136
So what can you tell me?
From what I understand,

366
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:06,352
you have numerous people working
on your behalf as we speak.

367
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,656
Yeah, um, well, Veronica Donovan,
she's my attorney, and

368
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,082
Nick Savrinn, he, uh,
works at Project Justice.

369
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:18,428
Savrinn, okay.
Have they gotten very far?

370
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:21,604
Nothing to go to court with.
Not yet, anyway.

371
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:26,325
You ever think it's
just time to let go?

372
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:27,788
Accept what happened?

373
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:29,333
Let go? Yeah.

374
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,799
Accept what happened? Never.

375
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:34,305
I mean,
would you if someone had set you up?

376
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:35,810
Destroyed your life?

377
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,069
I guess I'm thinking in
terms of the pain and anguish

378
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:41,197
it's caused your
friends and loved ones.

379
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:43,623
People who care about me,
they believe me.

380
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:46,966
That's all that matters to me right now.
It's all I got.

381
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,554
You have a son.

382
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,894
Lincoln, Jr.? LJ?

383
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,440
Yeah. Why?

384
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:54,486
I have a source that tells me

385
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:58,206
if you accept what happened and
stop fighting your execution,

386
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:00,211
your son will be
left out of this.

387
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:01,465
If not,

388
00:22:01,632 --> 00:22:04,788
I hope you said good-bye to him
when he left here this morning.

389
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:08,275
- Who are you?
- One Burrows is gonna die.

390
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,988
Up to you which one.

391
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:11,325
Who are you?!

392
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:12,704
Who are you?!

393
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:13,874
Hey!

394
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,002
Don't let her go.
She threatened my son!

395
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:19,390
Please, no!
She threatened my son! No!

396
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:32,676
- LJ Burrows?
- Yeah.

397
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:35,057
I'm Officer Hale
with Juvenile Court.

398
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,242
We just need to do a quick
survey of the residence,

399
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,836
make sure the environment here is
reflective of the terms of
your probation.

400
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,036
Your parents home?

401
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,877
No, but they'll be
home any minute.

402
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,679
Well then...
better get started.

403
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:52,523
LJ and his dad--

404
00:22:52,607 --> 00:22:53,997
you never said how it
went this morning.

405
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:55,113
Sounded fine.

406
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,008
Of course, everything a 15-year-old
boy tells his mother is fine.

407
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,975
Look, no offense, but can I see
some kind of identification?

408
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:01,674
Sure.

409
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,052
LJ, we're home!

410
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:07,983
LJ, you here?

411
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,253
Oh, my God.

412
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:18,721
Drop the phone, lady.
This is the only warning I'm giving you.

413
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:20,267
Drop it.

414
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:22,983
Run!

415
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:44,417
Pick up, pick up.
Please answer. Come on.

416
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,055
LJ...

417
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,186
we're not here to hurt you.

418
00:23:56,743 --> 00:24:00,671
911... send.

419
00:24:01,715 --> 00:24:05,371
You really think you're going to get
to four buttons before I get to one?

420
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,409
Come on.

421
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,754
LJ, get out of here!

422
00:24:27,328 --> 00:24:30,587
Mom? Mom?

423
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:54,947
Where are you going, LJ?

424
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,450
What do you want from me?

425
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,331
Cooperation. That's all.

426
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,835
You want cooperation?

427
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,467
I know what you look like,
you son of a bitch!

428
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,889
I'm going to the police.

429
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:07,200
Going to the police? I don't think
that's such a good idea, LJ--

430
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:10,239
I mean, with your prints on
the murder weapon and all.

431
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:11,922
I didn't touch
the murder weapon.

432
00:25:11,952 --> 00:25:13,247
Of course you didn't.

433
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:16,548
I know that and you know that.

434
00:25:17,468 --> 00:25:19,611
I just don't think you're
going to have much luck

435
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,186
convincing Ballistics of that.

436
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,732
Who the hell are you people?

437
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:24,362
Just concerned neighbors.

438
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:27,078
Heard a bit of a ruckus
at the Rixs' house.

439
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:30,139
Gosh, you know, I guess we
really should've seen it coming.

440
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:31,810
I mean,
all the signs were there--

441
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,138
drug use,
decline in academic performance--

442
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:36,281
but we didn't think he'd
ever do something like this.

443
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:37,619
No one's going to believe that.

444
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:38,819
Yes, they will.

445
00:25:38,986 --> 00:25:41,337
And when they catch you--
and they will catch you, LJ--

446
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,800
they're going to
try you as an adult.

447
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,166
You know what that means?

448
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,134
We can help you, LJ.
We're the only hope you've got.

449
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:48,429
No, you're not.

450
00:25:58,247 --> 00:25:59,960
She made that choice, not you.

451
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,303
Let's find the kid.

452
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:12,244
You got Marilyn back.

453
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:14,167
Sure did.

454
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:16,548
That's good.

455
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,144
How long ago you quit smoking?

456
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:24,069
A little over nine years now.

457
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:25,657
You don't mind, do you?

458
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,192
I feel a kinship
with you, Charles.

459
00:26:43,457 --> 00:26:44,910
More than any other con here.

460
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,930
And we've seen a lot,
haven't we?

461
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:50,727
Sure have.

462
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:53,818
And correct me if I'm wrong...

463
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,287
I've always treated you fair.

464
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:00,838
I've always
appreciated that fact.

465
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:05,101
I've known Bob since
he was 18 years old.

466
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,320
I got him this job.

467
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,791
You can imagine how
responsible I feel.

468
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,297
I can't help you
with that, boss.

469
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,429
I think you can.

470
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,061
Word is he died in
front of your cell,

471
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:24,237
and you were right
here when it happened.

472
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:32,593
We've both been around
long enough to know

473
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,270
that when a con starts
that snitching business,

474
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:38,401
he's not long for this world.

475
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,952
Don't put me in that
position, boss.

476
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:50,644
If you don't tell me

477
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:54,738
who killed Bob before
I leave this cell,

478
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:59,209
our friendship goes with it.

479
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:08,735
That's a nice cat.

480
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,640
Westmoreland knows,
and his jaw ain't that strong.

481
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:08,401
What's this?

482
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:10,615
Nothing.

483
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:15,379
- You stalker.
- I am not a stalker.

484
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,181
I just... I don't get it.

485
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,062
What is there to get?

486
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,986
He doesn't fit the
profile. Right?

487
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:27,329
The man's got a graduate degree.
He lives in my neighborhood.

488
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,973
Guys like that hang
out in Streeterville.

489
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,352
They drink single malt scotch.

490
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:34,068
They-they pay $200 for Cubs tickets.
They don't rob banks.

491
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:36,187
Maybe he couldn't
afford season tickets.

492
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:39,112
Maybe that's why he
robbed the bank.

493
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,243
Thank you.
I'm actually being serious.

494
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:44,209
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

495
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:46,967
Why do you care so much?

496
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:50,978
- 'Cause he lied to me.
- They all lie to you.

497
00:29:56,911 --> 00:30:00,066
Maybe because he's the one guy
in here I can actually get to...

498
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,844
one guy I can...

499
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:05,936
make a difference with.

500
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:08,986
Go home, girl.

501
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,660
You keep burning it at
both ends like this,

502
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,418
you're going to
drive yourself crazy.

503
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,423
Good night.

504
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:21,939
I'm sorry, Burrows.

505
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,403
Both of them were dead by the
time the paramedics got there.

506
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:30,087
- What about my son?
- He's missing.

507
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:33,011
The police are treating
him as a fugitive.

508
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:35,016
A fugitive?

509
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:37,672
They found his prints
on the murder weapon.

510
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:40,658
That's impossible. I...

511
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,254
- I, uh... I need to call him.
- No, I can't do that.

512
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:47,354
What do you mean, you can't do that?!
His life's in danger!

513
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:52,398
Burrows, the police have instructed me
that this is an ongoing investigation,

514
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,950
and as such,
any contact you make with your son

515
00:30:56,075 --> 00:31:00,003
could potentially aid and
abet him as a fugitive.

516
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,889
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:06,647
Warden, please!

518
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:26,118
Let's go.

519
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,586
That's messed up.

520
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:32,134
Aw, jeez. Does he even know?

521
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:33,069
I don't think so.

522
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:09,948
What's up, T?

523
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,419
We family, right?

524
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,719
Hell, yeah, we are.

525
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:21,396
Well, I'm in a quandary,
and I need your help.

526
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,404
Name it.

527
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:27,496
Bellick's squeezing tighter
and tighter around here.

528
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,385
And you were right--

529
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:31,382
eventually, somebody's mouth
is going to start moving.

530
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:33,567
Thing is, Trokey,
if I get popped for this,

531
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:40,240
what with my priors and...
predisposition to violent behavior...

532
00:32:41,953 --> 00:32:44,377
I'll spend the rest of
my life in the SHU.

533
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:49,934
But if you come forward with
only your drug convictions

534
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,692
and a whole lot of remorse...

535
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:54,583
- I can't do that, T.
- I ain't finished yet.

536
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:57,049
No need. I ain't going down
for murdering no hack.

537
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,032
I mean, you understand that,
don't you?

538
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,385
You ain't mad, are you?

539
00:33:05,143 --> 00:33:08,444
No, Trokey, I'm not mad.

540
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,466
I need out. I got to find him.

541
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:34,432
You will. Both of us. Soon.

542
00:34:34,516 --> 00:34:36,564
They're coming after
my family, Michael.

543
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:39,238
You got to trust me.
We're gonna get this done.

544
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:42,747
How? Tell me. Michael, tell me.

545
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:43,917
You can't, can you?

546
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:46,758
I've got to get out of here now.
LJ's in trouble.

547
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:47,761
Scofield.

548
00:34:48,346 --> 00:34:49,808
How about it?

549
00:34:50,603 --> 00:34:52,064
Just stick with me.

550
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:05,060
Yo, Bruce, hey!

551
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,113
If you go out there,
they will gun you down.

552
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:36,480
I don't care anymore.

553
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:38,706
Well, you better start thinking
about what you're doing,

554
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,461
'cause you can't help
LJ if you're dead.

555
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,748
What the hell's going
on over here, huh?

556
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:44,836
- We got a problem?
- No.

557
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,762
Well, then get on your feet.
Let's go!

558
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:54,489
Son of a... What the hell's going
on in building two? Come in.

559
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,494
Fire in the guard's break room.

560
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,505
Thanks.

561
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,260
I didn't do it for you.

562
00:36:26,326 --> 00:36:31,424
Found the source. Someone in
here smoke these? Lucky Strikes?

563
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:33,638
Bellick.

564
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:38,151
Captain Bellick,
got someone to see you.

565
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,706
What the hell do you want?

566
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,341
I know who killed Bob, sir.

567
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:13,541
I don't know how
that got there.

568
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:17,803
It's not mine. It's not mine!

569
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,056
You set me up.

570
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:20,907
It's bad enough
you killed a guard.

571
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:23,241
Don't try and lay it off
on somebody else now.

572
00:37:23,277 --> 00:37:25,575
You set me up! He set me up...!

573
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,312
Your father lived here?

574
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:45,463
Yeah. He wanted some place that
was completely off the grid.

575
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,495
A place the government
didn't even know existed.

576
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:50,185
Tapped into the power lines.

577
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,316
A well supplies the
place with water.

578
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:55,663
Last few years of his life,
he barely even left the property.

579
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,789
- It's...
- Yeah.

580
00:37:58,332 --> 00:38:01,562
When you spend so many years fighting
cops and prosecutors and judges

581
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:04,236
trying to take your freedom
for something you didn't do,

582
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,937
you use every cent you had

583
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:08,569
on attorney's fees,
you wind up losing anyway...

584
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,291
15 years of his life.

585
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:17,678
Almost all of his
son's childhood.

586
00:38:20,143 --> 00:38:22,943
I guess I can forgive him
for wanting to hide away,

587
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:24,489
be left alone.

588
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:28,165
We'll be safe here until we
figure out our next move.

589
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:37,776
Yeah, hold up here a minute,
hold up here.

590
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,626
Uh, seems to be a
bit of confusion.

591
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,037
I'm supposed to be on this,
uh, detail.

592
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:43,709
I don't think so.

593
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:49,224
Oh, John. You can't be serious.

594
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:53,778
Not after our long,
illustrious history we shared together.

595
00:38:53,862 --> 00:38:57,873
All those nights
in New York City.

596
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:00,255
In California.

597
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:04,308
In Saint Louis.

598
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,274
They were good times,
weren't they, John?

599
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:11,285
Tell the badge here about 'em.

600
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:16,007
'Cause if you don't want to,
uh, I certainly could.

601
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:29,377
I want this place gutted.

602
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:32,523
The drywall's got to be torn out,
the studs got to be removed.

603
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:34,976
Boss, we've got some
toxic issues here.

604
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,773
Asbestos to start with.

605
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:38,486
Take it up with the union.

606
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:41,411
All I'm saying is,
this room is your only priority now.

607
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:44,085
Better be brand-spanking-new
when you're done.

608
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:46,144
If anybody's thinking
about getting cute,

609
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:48,529
trying to trunk one of
these tools out of here,

610
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:52,817
Brady's got the outline of every
single piece of hardware in here.

611
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,250
And at the end of every day,

612
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,327
every single piece
better match up,

613
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,541
or you're all
going to the hole.

614
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:13,625
Let's go.

615
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:24,991
This goes down four feet,
connects to the mainline below.

616
00:40:25,116 --> 00:40:26,589
All we've got to
do is widen it,

617
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,210
and we've got ourselves
an on-ramp to Route 66.

618
00:40:37,316 --> 00:40:38,778
They're gonna hear this, man.

619
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:39,990
They won't.

620
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:52,943
Come on, Pretty, we a team now.

621
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,853
- Best get cracking, hey?
- You, shut up.

622
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,046
Really think you're gonna get to
four buttons before I get to one?

623
00:41:48,848 --> 00:41:50,687
I don't have my glasses.

624
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:53,068
How about you read this for me?

625
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:56,327
Tell me the news,
the latest developments.

626
00:41:57,122 --> 00:41:58,291
Evidently there was

627
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:01,801
an explosion in a Gold Coast
apartment in Chicago yesterday.

628
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:04,684
Gas line.
Everyone inside was killed.

629
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:06,940
Shame. Anything else?

630
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,503
How about that kid up in Oak Park,
the one they say killed his parents?

631
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,497
- Oh, they got him.
- They did?

632
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:14,044
He's in custody.

633
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,058
Good. I imagine heads would have
rolled if he hadn't been caught.

634
00:42:19,224 --> 00:42:21,982
Lives would have been lost.

635
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:24,363
How about you hand
that back to me?

636
00:42:24,447 --> 00:42:26,620
Now that it's yesterday's news,

637
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:29,086
we can put it behind us,
can't we?

638
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:33,640
Move on to the next
chapter of our lives.

639
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:38,612
You're not just doing this for me,
you know.

640
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:40,659
Or my brother.

641
00:42:40,742 --> 00:42:41,787
Yes?

642
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,284
They're ready for you,
Madam Vice President.

643
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:49,434
You're doing it
for your country.

644
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,667
Madam Vice President!

645
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:04,064
