Mr. Magnussen, how would you describe

Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,371
I've never had the slightest influence
over any of them.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,321
Why would I?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,891
I notice you've had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,807

10

Can you recall
the subjects under discussion?

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,884
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,761
Do you think it right
that a newspaper proprietor,

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,686
a private individual and,
in fact, a foreign national

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,048
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,087
I don't think it's wrong

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,845
that a private individual
should accept an invitation.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,088
However, you have my sincere apologies
for being foreign.

That is not in any way...

Mr. Magnussen, can you recall an occasion

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,124
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,931

in any way?

- Mr. Magnussen, outside the enquiry

no communication at all.

In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Katherine Driscoll.

34
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,766
That was before I knew him.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,888
The letters were lively, loving,

36
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,607
some would say explicit,

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,284

to know the touch of your body."

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,884
I know what was in the letters.

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,807
She was 15.

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,644
She looked older.

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,045
Oh, she looked delicious.

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,491
We have photographs, too.

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,009
The ones she sent him.

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,210
Yum yum.

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,645
He was unaware of her age.

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,688
He met her only once
before the letters began.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,607
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

50

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,841
Let me help.

158
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,086
Now, concentrate. Isaac Whitney.

159
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,566
Okay, you asked for it.

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,805
Right, are you concentrating yet?

163
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,926
- You broke my arm.
- No, I sprained it.

164
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,766
It feels squishy.

165
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,611
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

166
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,842
- Feel that.
- Yeah, it's a sprain.

167
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,928
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

168

Now, where is Isaac Whitney?

169

I don't know.

170
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,281
Maybe upstairs.

171
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,442
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

172
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,202
No, it was really sore.
Mental, you are.

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,886
No, just used to a better class

- Mrs. Watson, can I...

191
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,851
Can I get in, please?

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,007
Yes, of course, get in.

193
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,809
- Where's John?
- They're having a fight.

Who is?

195
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,006
- For God's sakes, John. I'm on a case.
- A month, that's all it took.

196
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,645
- One!
- I'm working.

197
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,447
Sherlock Holmes in a drug den,
how is that going to look?

198
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,608
- I'm undercover.
- No, you're not.

199
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,682
Well, I'm not now!

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,762
In, both of you, quickly.

201
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,604
Please, can I come?
I think I got a broken arm.

202
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,966
- No, go away.
- No, let him.

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,202
- Why?
- Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

204
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,120
Anyone else? I mean, we're taking
everybody home, are we?

205
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,442
- All right, Shezza?
- Shezza?

206
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,806
I was undercover.

207
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,086
Seriously, Shezza, though?

208
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,730
We're not going home,
we're going to Barts.

209

- I'm calling Molly.
- Why?

210
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,404
Because Sherlock Holmes
needs to pee in a jar.

211
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,969
Well, is he clean?

212
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,441
Clean?

213
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,365
How dare you throw away
the beautiful gifts you were born with?

214
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,403
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

215
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,481
Say you're sorry.

216
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,325
Sorry your engagement's over.

217
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,004
Though I'm fairly grateful
for the lack of a ring.

218
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,161
Stop it.

219
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,524
Just stop it.

220
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,967
If you were anywhere
near this kind of thing again

221
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,610
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

222
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,001
Oh, please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

223
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,128
A ca... What kind of case
would need you doing this?

224
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,931
I might as well ask you
why you've started cycling to work?

225
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,844
No, we're not playing this game.

226
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,169
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

227
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,527
- Not interested.
- I am. Ow!

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,480
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

229
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,922
- Yeah, somebody hit me.
- Huh?

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Yeah, just some guy.

231
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,441
Yeah, it was probably just an addict
in need of a fix.

232
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,491
Yes, I think in a way it was.

233
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,404
- Is it his shirt?
- I'm sorry?

234
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,165
Well, it's the creases, innit?

235
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,050
The two creases down the front?

236
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,202
It's been recently folded
but it's not new.

237
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,044
You must have dressed in a hurry
this morning.

238
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,088
So all your shirts
might be kept like that.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,331
But why?

240
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,767
Maybe 'cause you cycle
to work every morning,

241
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,046
shower when you get there

242
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,645
and then dress in the clothes
you brought with you.

243
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,601
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

244
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,407
- Not bad.
- And I further deduce...

245
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,004
you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

246
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,206
No, he's always walked like that.
Remind me, what's your name again?

247
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,324
- They call me The Wig.
- No, they don't.

248
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,171

- Nope.

No, you saw the kitchen.

Clearly nothing.

knowingly closed the door

301
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,443
without the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

Okay, stop! Just stop!

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,766
That name you think
you may have just heard,

312
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,001
you were mistaken.

313
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,607
If you ever mention hearing that name
in this room, in this context,

314
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,331
I guarantee you on behalf
of the British Security Services

315
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,290
that materials will be found
on your computer hard drives

316
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,727
resulting in your
immediate incarceration.

317
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,770
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

318
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,165
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

319
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,286
Well, I think we both find
that embarrassing.

320
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,806
- Magnussen is not your business.
- Oh, you mean he's yours?

321
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,689
You may consider him
under my protection.

322
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,205
I consider you under his thumb.

323
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,164
If you go against Magnussen,

324
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,607
then you will find yourself
going against me.

325
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,409
Okay, I'll let you know if I notice.

326
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,762
Erm... What was I going to say?

327
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,410
Oh, yeah. Bye-bye.

I'm slightly worried that he might.

- Yep.

340
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,651

- You're trying to put me off?
- God, no.

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,085
I'm trying to recruit you.

344
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,768
And stay out of my bedroom.

345
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,651

- How are you?
- Janine?

Sorry, not dressed.

Has everybody gone? I heard shouting.

349
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,046
Yes, they're gone.

350
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,168
God, look at the time, I'll be late.

351
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,571
Sounded like an argument.

352
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,290
- Was it Mike?
- Mike?

353

Mike, yeah, his brother, Mike?
They're always fighting.

- Yeah.

Oh, could you be a love

probably got some questions.

372
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,568
Yeah, one or two, pretty much.

373
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,881
Naturally.

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,365
You have a girlfriend?

375
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,441
Yes, I have.

376
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,331
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

377
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,731
That's the only way I can describe him.

378
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,081
Have you ever been to the shark tank
at the London Aquarium, John?

379
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,605
Stood up close to the glass, those...

380
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,762
floating, flat faces, those dead eyes?

381
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,725
That's what he is.

382
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,283
I've dealt with murderers, psychopaths,
terrorists, serial killers.

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,042
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

384
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,121
Yes, you have.

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,686

- You have a girlfriend?

386
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,889

Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

413
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,003
You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner
but he is so much more than that.

414
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,601
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

415
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,002
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

416
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,445
And I'm not exaggerating when I say

417
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,851
that he knows
the critical pressure point

418
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,922
on every person of note or influence

419
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,810
in the whole of the Western world
and probably beyond.

420
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,406
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

421
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,084
And he has created

422
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,050
an unassailable architecture
of forbidden knowledge.

423
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,491
Its name is Appledore.

424
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,569
- Dinner.
- Sorry, what, dinner?

427
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,808
Seriously? I've just told you
that the Western world

428
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,565
is run from this house
and you want to talk about dinner?

429
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,721
Fine, talk about the house.

It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous information

The Alexandrian library
of secrets and scandals.

And none of it is on a computer.

He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

435

It's all on hard copy in vaults
underneath that house.

Some time ago you put pressure on her

Did you notice
the one extraordinary thing he did?

There was a moment
that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

509
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,442
Exactly. When he showed us the letters.

510
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,887
Okay.

511
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,291
So, he's brought the letters to London.

512
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,488
So no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

513
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,891
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal

- How do you know his schedule?

You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

690

What was directly behind you

Not been murdered yet.

what would you have heard?

But any pressure or impact on
the entrance wound could dislodge it.

you failed to make a kill shot.

Yours.

Why didn't you come to me

What the hell
am I supposed to say to that?

1229
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,408
- Merry Christmas?
- You hate Christmas.

1230
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,561
Yes.

1231
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,090
Perhaps there was something
in the punch.

1232
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,810
Clearly. Go and have some more.

that Sherlock got us

1234
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,330
out here to see
his mum and dad for a reason?

1235
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,607
His lovely mum and dad.
Fine example of married life,

1236
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,091
I get that.

1237
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,088
That is the thing with Sherlock.
It's always the unexpected.

1238
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,527
Oi... Oi...

1239
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,331
Mary? Jesus Christ, Mary?

1240
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,482
Sit down. Mary, can you hear me?

1241
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,803
Don't drink Mary's tea.

Don't worry.
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

1246
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,522
I calculated your wife's dose meself.

1247
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,728
Won't affect the little one.
I'll keep an eye on her.

He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.

- In my opinion, yes.

I've been thinking about you.

1258

Really?

1259
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,482

I want you to invite me.

1263
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,807
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

1264
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:05,843
Oh, I think you're a lot more careless
than you let on.

1265

Am I?

1266
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,971
It's the dead-eye stare
that gives it away.

1267
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,922
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

- A Christmas present.

- Yeah, of course I do.

Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.

Unlike your wife.

1318

Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr. Watson.

1319

For those who understand these things,

1320

Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful man
in the country.

1321

Well, apart from me.

1322
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,011
Mycroft's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother Sherlock.

1323
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,730
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend John Watson.

1324
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,962
John Watson's pressure point
is his wife.

1325

I own John Watson's wife,

I own Mycroft.

He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

1328

It's an exchange, not a gift.

Forgive me but...

- I already seem to have it.
- It's password protected.

- I don't need to see it.

Well, you might enjoy it, though.

By now your brother

will be converging on this house.

And they'll have every justification

1356
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,890
Mycroft has been looking
for this opportunity for a long time.

1357
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,927
He'll be a very, very proud big brother.

1358
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,526
The fact that you know it's going
to happen isn't going to stop it.

Ask me.

Why are you smiling?

1362

Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake

1363
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,130
which will destroy the lives
of everyone he loves

1364
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,002
and everything he holds dear.

1365

You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

1374
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,724
How to store information
so you never forget it,

1375
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,645
by picturing it.

1376
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,528
I just sit here, I close my eyes

1377

01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,681
We're not naming our daughter after you.

1532
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,569
I think it could work.

1533
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,529
To the very best of times, John.

- How is this possible?

1542
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,564
We don't know.
But it's on every screen in the country,

1543
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,564
- every screen simultaneously.
- Has the Prime Minister been told?

And Mycroft?

That is simply not possible.

he was dead, Moriarty.

01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,284
Absolutely. He blew his own brains out.
