1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:02,413
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,683 --> 00:00:05,407
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:06,495
I was set up.

4
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:09,927
Put down your weapon!

5
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,976
I find it incumbent that you
see the inside of a prison cell.

6
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:15,113
I'm looking for someone,
guy named Lincoln Burrows.

7
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:16,630
Man killed the Vice
President's brother.

8
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,480
Why you want to see Burrows so bad,
anyhow?

9
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,521
'Cause he's my brother.

10
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:21,707
- I'm getting you out of here.
- It's impossible.

11
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,651
Not if you designed the place,
it isn't.

12
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,308
You've seen the blueprints.

13
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,635
Better than that...

14
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,197
I've got 'em on me.

15
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:29,994
There's a lawyer poking around.

16
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,175
Miss Donovan.

17
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,880
I didn't mean to scare you.

18
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:33,633
It's gone!

19
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:35,084
Does anyone else have
a key to this place?

20
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:36,505
You were here, remember?

21
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:39,264
I walked over to the cabinet,
and I...

22
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:48,948
Got an issue with our
little friend over there?

23
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:52,854
Maybe it's time I lit up that
leather once and for all.

24
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:55,348
What happened?

25
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,104
Don't make me lie to you.

26
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:58,190
You heard the news, didn't you?

27
00:00:58,284 --> 00:00:59,133
No, what?

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,174
- They're brothers.
- Who?

29
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:04,698
- Burrows and Scofield.
- Michael Scofield?

30
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:07,459
I'm going to the wall tonight.
See if I can access the roof.

31
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,740
Take the only thing
Burrows has left.

32
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:13,600
The chair isn't the only way to
take a man's life in prison.

33
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,353
Just a few more rides.
Then you have to wrap it up.

34
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,231
Oh, Adam's getting bigger, huh?

35
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:41,609
- Ten. Hmm?
- Not here.

36
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,602
We need a favor.

37
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,955
Been out of the life for years.
You know that.

38
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:47,716
I know.

39
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,280
Problem is, Diamond,
no one's gonna believe that

40
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,324
after I take the heroin
I have in my pocket

41
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:55,995
and put it in the glove box of the
reasonably priced minivan you have
parked over there.

42
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,031
I will cuff you.

43
00:01:57,124 --> 00:02:00,364
I will drag you out of
here in front of everyone.

44
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:06,554
What do you need?

45
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,101
What America needs

46
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:14,808
is an environmentally friendly,

47
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,036
logistically feasible,

48
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:21,792
and economically responsible
alternative fuel source.

49
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:28,004
Leave a message, I'll call you back.
Thanks.

50
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:29,515
Hi, it's Wendy.

51
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,470
I know you wanted to work with no
distractions, so don't pick up.

52
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:36,423
I just wanted to let you know that Nick
Savrinn left six messages for you.

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,367
What'd you tell him?

54
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,321
Oh, uh, what you said to say,
that you were in a meeting.

55
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,077
Look, if he comes by the office
tomorrow, tell him I'm not there, okay?

56
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,738
Okay. Good night, Veronica.

57
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:47,157
Thanks, Wendy.

58
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,721
Bed check.

59
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:25,066
Do you want to tell me why you haven't
returned any of my phone calls?

60
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:29,116
Look, I really appreciate
everything you've done, okay?

61
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,015
But I don't want your help anymore.

62
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,818
Don't want my help anymore...

63
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,412
Do you really think I had something
to do with that missing tape?

64
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:38,888
No, look, I'm just gonna go grab a cup
of coffee, and get back to work, okay?

65
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:41,128
I don't have time
for this right now.

66
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,817
Veronica.

67
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,570
Just wait a second.

68
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,371
Will you hold on a second?

69
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,988
- Listen, why do you avoid...?
- Don't touch me, all right?

70
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,123
Everything okay, Miss Donovan?

71
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:57,399
Lucas,
do you mind walking me back inside?

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,569
Take a walk, pal.

73
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:04,647
You're being paranoid.

74
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:09,508
- You're being paranoid.
- Go away.

75
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,231
Show some skin, Scofield.

76
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,272
Hey, Scofield.

77
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:47,664
I'm trying to sleep, boss.

78
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,672
I can't get through the wall.

79
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,181
What do you mean,
you can't get through the wall?

80
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:03,741
I know how to do it.

81
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:06,488
I just don't have
the time to do it.

82
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:09,434
We're locked up.
All we got is time.

83
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:10,915
You don't understand.

84
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:14,038
I planned this break on a schedule.

85
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,650
Them constantly coming
up here for count

86
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,458
won't let me do what I need to
do to get through that wall.

87
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,288
If I'm not back on schedule,

88
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:24,147
which means we're through that
wall by the end of the day manana,

89
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,143
we're not getting out of here.

90
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,201
Look, there are three things
for certain in life--

91
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:31,291
death, taxes and count.

92
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:35,025
Only way to stop count is...

93
00:07:37,174 --> 00:07:37,927
What?

94
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,367
Never mind. It's a bad idea.

95
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:43,311
Worse than the idea
of losing Maricruz?

96
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,771
A lockdown.

97
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,244
We get Gen Pop locked down for a day,
you'll have all the time you need.

98
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:57,195
- And no count?
- Bulls don't even come by.

99
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,569
Only one problem.

100
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,552
How do we get a lockdown?

101
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:11,148
Can  you get to the prison AC unit?

102
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,230
Maybe.

103
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:17,152
You want a lockdown,
you got to get the inmates riled up.

104
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,727
And if you want to piss
off the meat in concrete,

105
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:23,669
turn up the heat.

106
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:23,033
I thought you were retired.

107
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,168
Never mind me.

108
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,586
Some heavy hitters want this done,
so that means I want it done.

109
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:29,077
No  screw ups.

110
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,902
For you, Diamond,
it's not a problem,

111
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,987
Burrows is as good as dead.

112
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,149
Hottest April on record.

113
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:50,000
- Global warming.
- Probably. You got a minute?

114
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,747
Uh-huh. About five years worth.

115
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:55,300
Sure, right, um...

116
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:59,157
You never told me Lincoln
Burrows is your brother.

117
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,247
- It never came up.
- Right.

118
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:04,426
I'm curious if that isn't because
of my father, the governor.

119
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:09,425
He may not be the one pulling the
switch, but you and I both know

120
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:14,289
he has the power to grant clemency,
and he won't, and he never does.

121
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:18,094
My old man was an abusive
drunk who abandoned his family.

122
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,752
I don't judge anyone by
their father's actions.

123
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:26,365
Or inactions.
If that was your concern.

124
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:31,631
Just so you know,
I don't agree with his politics.

125
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,492
I'm sorry about your brother.

126
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,737
I appreciate that.

127
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,501
Hey, this isn't much.

128
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:52,425
Um...

129
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,245
I have to give Lincoln
a weekly checkup now.

130
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,146
If you want,
I could schedule those visits

131
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:01,807
to end right before you
come in for your shots.

132
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,890
That way, uh,

133
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:08,961
you could at least see each other,
even if it's just in passing.

134
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,969
Thank you.

135
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,078
Yeah.

136
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:34,273
Greetings from the kitchen, Fish.
100 bucks.

137
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:45,933
Theodore Bagwell,
transferred back from the infirmary.

138
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:55,955
Yeah!

139
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:03,622
We got you a little
"get well" gift.

140
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,835
Aw...

141
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:10,565
It's just the right size.

142
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:13,163
Thank you, boys.

143
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:15,804
I'll catch up with you later.

144
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,201
What's you name?

145
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:25,798
Seth.

146
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,485
You new, Seth?

147
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:32,220
Scared? Look at me, boy.

148
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,297
You probably heard
stories about me.

149
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,316
They're not all true.

150
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,232
What do you say we go for a walk?

151
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,150
Your co-counsel's already here.

152
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:18,940
Excuse me?

153
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,620
What the hell are you doing here?

154
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,313
I'm talking to my client.

155
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,116
- Don't talk to him.
- Veronica...

156
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,777
We don't know anything
about this guy.

157
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,768
He found something
that can help us out.

158
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,258
You have one minute.

159
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:38,635
I've been going over the incident
report from the night of the murder,

160
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,348
and somebody made an anonymous
phone call to the local cops

161
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,993
claiming to see Lincoln
running away from the garage

162
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:45,269
with  bloody pants.

163
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:46,261
We've been through this.

164
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,686
Look, you can't cross-examine a
witness if you don't know who it is.

165
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,059
We don't need to know who he is;

166
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,862
we know where he is.

167
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:52,757
What do you mean?

168
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,866
Well, it took some doing, but a P.I.
friend of mine

169
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,684
tracked that phone call back
to the police department.

170
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:00,953
Whoever made that call couldn't have
seen Lincoln running from the garage
that night.

171
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:02,234
How do you know?

172
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,165
Because the phone call
came from Washington, D.C.

173
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:30,452
You were supposed to turn off the A/C,
not turn on the furnace.

174
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:59,051
It's getting so hot in here.

175
00:15:59,154 --> 00:16:02,432
Did I say you could talk, Cherry?

176
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,885
You'll know when I want
you to open your mouth.

177
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:11,702
Geary!

178
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,808
You got to do something
about the heat.

179
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:17,921
- Doing the best we can.
- Your best is garbage.

180
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,476
It's a hundred degrees in here.

181
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:22,543
Look like I got frostbite to you?

182
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,371
Line up!

183
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:45,009
Why don't you transfer us
all someplace cooler...

184
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:46,788
like Africa?

185
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:51,840
Get your ass on the line, convict.

186
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,620
All of you, hit that line!

187
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:01,042
We'll move when the
temperature situation

188
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:03,419
is rectified, all right?

189
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,272
Hey, Bellick,
this is Mack in Cell Block.

190
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:09,742
We got some cons popping off.

191
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,262
Give 'em a smack,
throw 'em on the line and write 'em up.

192
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,973
If you can't handle it,
don't cash your paycheck this week.

193
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,207
This is not a good time, Doc.

194
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:21,650
Oh, I just got a call a prisoner
was suffering from heat exhaustion.

195
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,499
- He's faking it.
- Is that your medical opinion?

196
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:28,081
We got a bunch of overheated
cons getting loud in the A-Wing.

197
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:29,989
I don't blame them.
It's an oven in there.

198
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,226
Everything's under control,

199
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:33,599
but you should go back to
the infirmary building.

200
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:34,873
When things calm down,

201
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:37,628
I'll have your patients
transferred from sick bay.

202
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,617
I'm just looking out
for your best interests.

203
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,803
And I appreciate that, um...

204
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:44,012
but, Officer Bellick,
you and I both know

205
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,271
that it's illegal to deny
a prisoner medical care,

206
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,836
and you could lose
your job over it.

207
00:17:47,873 --> 00:17:49,775
And I'm just looking out
for your best interests.

208
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:56,321
Go right on in.

209
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:59,010
Thank you, sir.

210
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:03,994
Don't be a baby, T-Bag.

211
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,743
It's ain't that hot.

212
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,487
Not that hot?!

213
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,956
When this guy woke up this morning,
he was white!

214
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,217
You want to cool off?

215
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,060
Step back!

216
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:36,407
We'll step back when we get
some wind blowing in here.

217
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,280
All right, that's it! Lockdown!

218
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:45,364
Everyone back to your cells!

219
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:49,318
I said, everyone back to your cells now,
convicts!

220
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:51,642
Lockdown!

221
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,761
You got your lockdown, bro.

222
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,279
- You're coming with me.
- What? No, no, no.

223
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:00,016
I'm the lookout, man, that's it.

224
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:02,630
I need you down there.
It's a two-man job.

225
00:19:03,424 --> 00:19:04,480
Let's hang a sheet.

226
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:06,338
N-N-No way, man.
You only hang a sheet

227
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:08,456
when you and your cellie want
to get friendly, you know?

228
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:10,050
You want to protect
your prison rep,

229
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:11,964
or you want to get out of here?

230
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:13,137


231
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:13,312


232
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,457
What the hell's going on in here?

233
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,078
Well, these inmates became belligerent
and they refused to rack in.

234
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,885
You locked it down with inmates
still out of their cells?

235
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:24,122
We can handle 20 out-of-control
inmates easier than 300.

236
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:30,776
Listen up, bros, listen up.
Bellick, I got one for you.

237
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:34,387
What do you call a piece of white
trash who couldn't pass the cops' exam

238
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,841
and  now makes less than a mailman?

239
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:38,642
A C.O.

240
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,210
Get your hands of the fence.

241
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,482
Suck it, pig!

242
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:53,479
You know, Teddy, you really let me down,
and that's hard to do,

243
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,515
because I don't expect much...

244
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:59,247
from the inbred child of a retard.

245
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,167
That's right, Teddy.

246
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:07,030
I read your psych records...

247
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,985
about how your daddy raped
his mongoloid sister,

248
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:15,463
and then nine months later,
little Teddy pops out.

249
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,667
I'm going to kill you!

250
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,217
It's hotter than hell.

251
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,258
They'll wear themselves
out eventually.

252
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,169
The call was a fake.

253
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:43,160
What about a stay
of execution or...?

254
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,738
No, no, it's legally insufficient.

255
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,193
What the hell does that...

256
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:46,831
mean?

257
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,146
What the hell does that mean?

258
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:52,333
It means the prosecution could point out
the evidence from your criminal trial.

259
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,541
Okay?
The blood, the video, the gun.

260
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:59,049
A questionable phone call is
not going to stack up to that.

261
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:02,611
- But it's something, right?
- Absolutely.

262
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:04,018
We got an area code,

263
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:06,731
and my contact is going to track that
number to someplace more specific--

264
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,584
a building,
a neighborhood, a block--

265
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,629
to the person who
made this phone call.

266
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:11,926
What happens next?

267
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:14,183
We need to catch the
next flight to D.C.

268
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:17,840
That is, of course,
if you trust me now.

269
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,923
It's coming!

270
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:25,385
It's coming! It's coming!

271
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:26,758
Get on the train!

272
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:39,603
Get on the train!

273
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:41,914
Get on the train!

274
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:43,979
Let's get to my office.

275
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,615
Oh,  just what I thought.

276
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:48,667
The piglets are scared
of the big bad wolf.

277
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,357
Big bad wolf!

278
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,649
Just what I thought.

279
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:58,020
Get on the train!

280
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:11,950
Come on.

281
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:51,050
Marilyn, no!

282
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:15,920
Whose keys are those?

283
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,256
I guess in the commotion...

284
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,970
How many rounds do you think you're
going to get off before they get their
hands on you?

285
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,110
This is Bellick.

286
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,599
Our wing has been breached.

287
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,488
I want A-Wing evacuated
and shut down.

288
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:37,505
All access to B-Wing cut off now.

289
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,322
We'll get some fluids into you,
you'll be good as new, okay?

290
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:50,980
Nod your head if you believe me.

291
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:53,701
Good man.

292
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:56,848
Theo.

293
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:58,706
What can we do for you today?

294
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:02,770
Hmm.

295
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,328
This where it hurts?

296
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,318
A little higher and to the left.

297
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:07,791
You're three weeks post-op.

298
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:10,715
Your knee is being held together
by a rod and three screws.

299
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,327
I'm saying tenderness is normal,
no more meds.

300
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:17,834
Okay... Kuame, why are you back?

301
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:19,407
Inmates in cell block
have compromised

302
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:22,110
lockdown and breached A-Wing
through the guard station.

303
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:23,680
A-Wing is shutting down.

304
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:25,813
Whoo-hoo!
It's popping off up in Gen Pop!

305
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:30,467
That's what I'm talking about,
baby.

306
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,514
Somewhere on the other
side of this wall

307
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:48,322
is the main drainage pipe to
the prison's old sewer system.

308
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,479
We can get through this wall,
we can get into the pipe.

309
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,978
We can get into the pipe,
we can get into the infirmary.

310
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:06,209
If we can get to the infirmary,
then we can get out of here.

311
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,329
Sorry,
all visitors have to leave the facility.

312
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,323
- This is privileged attorney...
- You have to leave.

313
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:15,032
There's a minor
disturbance in cell block.

314
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:17,840
A-Wing is being shut down
for safety purposes.

315
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,884
A-Wing?
Veronica, Michael is in there.

316
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,921
- Will you be okay?
- You have to leave now.

317
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:24,829
Go to D.C.-- it's all we got.

318
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:26,233
I'll take care of Michael.
All right?

319
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,943
- Okay.
- Please.

320
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,076
Sorry about cutting you short.

321
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:35,225
Bob, how many times have I told you not
to apologize. It makes you look weak.

322
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,118
Now what's going on?

323
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:37,975
Like I said,
it's a minor disturbance.

324
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:41,303
Minor disturbance? My brother's in
Gen Pop, give it to me straight.

325
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,542
Some  clowns breached cell block.

326
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:45,866
But they won't get anywhere.

327
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,479
We always have locked
doors on either end.

328
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,015
There's nothing to worry about.

329
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:52,246
Son of a bitch.

330
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,337
Additional sections of A-Wing
have been compromised.

331
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:17,512
I'll be damned.

332
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:21,980
A rookie C.O.,
and it ain't even Christmas.

333
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,742
Get the cuffs off.

334
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:30,950
Get out of here, T-Bag.

335
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,826
Oh, I see--
you found him first, finder's keepers?

336
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,257
You know, I respect that.
I do. But, uh...

337
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:40,387
I think we can work something out.

338
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,610
What you got?

339
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,270
Oh, I can make your last few weeks
on Earth, quite, quite enjoyable.

340
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,734
Get you some Demerol, some X...

341
00:27:49,108 --> 00:27:52,206
You know, make you forget
about that big, bad chair.

342
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:53,620
No deal.

343
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:57,706
You've got to learn
the art of negotiating.

344
00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:01,970
Lesson one: Bargaining position.

345
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:04,901
Yours just changed.

346
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:11,875
- What are you doing?
- I gotta get out of here.

347
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:13,200
Look around,
you're not gonn make it.

348
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,988
No blood needs to spill, Sink.

349
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:17,711
Then walk away.

350
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:21,023
We both know that
ain't gonna happen.

351
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:21,958
Yeah.

352
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,641
That's one big pile of concrete.

353
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:43,582
How do you know where the pipe is?

354
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,494
I got someone to
show us where it is.

355
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:50,600
Oh, really? Who?

356
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:03,162
Infection's not so bad,

357
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:05,540
but I'm going to give you a shot of
penicillin just to make sure, okay?

358
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:06,697
Thanks, Doc.

359
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,452
This is Rizzo.
Does anyone need back up, over?

360
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:22,135
Negative,
A-Wing is evacuating and locked down.

361
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,254
Remain in B-Wing.

362
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,697
What's up, Doc?

363
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,886
Come on, Doc.

364
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:59,361
You don't want to do this.

365
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:19,991
We're sorry. This line is
experiencing technical difficulties.

366
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,958
You ever see one of
them safari shows,

367
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,391
where a bunch of cheetahs just
jump all up on an antelope?

368
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,569
Guess which one you are?

369
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,260
Tough little gorilla, ain't he?

370
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:14,481
I was raised to believe the
devil's got some crazy power,

371
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:17,893
but I don't think shining him on
this wall is gonna bring it down.

372
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,933
Not unless he's got a
sledgehammer with him.

373
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:21,689
We don't need a sledgehammer.

374
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,834
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

375
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:35,253
Sick Bay, report?

376
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,223
Sick Bay, please report.

377
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:41,606
Rizzo, is everything okay?

378
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,694
All clear in Sick Bay. Over.

379
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:53,843
Roger that.

380
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,866
Let the bulls worry
about the noise.

381
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:03,956
You worry about how you're gonna
drill through a six-inch concrete wall

382
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:05,930
with what used to be an eggbeater.

383
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,663
We just need a few small holes.

384
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:09,450
How are we going to fit
through a few small holes?

385
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,398
Ever hear of tensile strength?

386
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:13,530
Hooke's Law of Elasticity?

387
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:15,101
What do you think?

388
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:16,869
If we drill holes in
strategic locations,

389
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:19,841
we compromise the load-carrying
capacity of the wall.

390
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:21,945
How about speaking English?

391
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:24,824
We'll be able to break through the part
of the wall that covers the pipe
opening.

392
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,340
Give me that.

393
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:30,399
We go in through the tip of each horn,
the eyes,

394
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:31,553
the end of the nose,

395
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:34,697
the bottom of the fangs
and end of the braids.

396
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:39,219
It makes a kind of
"X." Let's get to it.

397
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:52,459
If I can get DIRT in there with some of
the newer firepower the state's
issued...

398
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,893
Oh, yeah, so we can end the riots
today and start the funeral tomorrow?

399
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:57,101
I can contain this, sir.

400
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,104
- I've got a call for you.
- Not now.

401
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:01,543
I think you should take this, boss.
It's the governor.

402
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,916
- Governor.
- Where's my daughter?

403
00:33:04,994 --> 00:33:06,083
Not to worry, sir, she's fine.

404
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:07,793
She's in sick bay in B-Wing.

405
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,885
It's a completely different
part of the facility.

406
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:12,382
It's, uh,
totally locked off from the disturbance.

407
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:15,005
Disturbance? That's what you're
calling a riot nowadays?

408
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,921
Can any of these
animals get to her?

409
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:20,892
Sir, it's impossible for anyone
from A-Wing to get into sick bay.

410
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,034
The guard there assures us
that everything is fine.

411
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:24,833
We have everything under control,
Governor.

412
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:27,826
For your sake,
you better hope you do.

413
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,139
I'm going to dance with you, Doc!

414
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,607
We're going to dance
till the sun come up!

415
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:56,583
It's your turn.

416
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,639
I ain't messing with no Diablo,
man.

417
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:00,288
We can't afford downtime.

418
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,629
We have to switch off drilling.

419
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,200
It's bad mojo, bro.
Are you kidding me?

420
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:04,693
I mess with him,
you drill into him,

421
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,583
he gets pissed, and then what, huh?

422
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:09,767
I got enough enemies already.

423
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,464
You believe in God, right?

424
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:13,979
You know I do.

425
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:15,443
So you're protected.

426
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:19,284
He'll protect you from him.

427
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:58,950
I assure you, once Bob and I
are done getting acquainted...

428
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:03,193
...everyone else
will get their turn.

429
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:07,504
Yeah!

430
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:16,920
We're going to have a little fun now.
Don't worry.

431
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:19,142
I don't got the blickey.

432
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:20,603
My pipes are clean.

433
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,661
Now, where you going, rookie?

434
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:33,477
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

435
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:37,727
They always think
they can run away.

436
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,271
I've got a question for you, Fish.

437
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,814
What if we do all this work,
and the pipe is ten feet that way?

438
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:03,880
- It won't be.
- You got X-ray vision?

439
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,518
I calculated the drill
point coordinates,

440
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:09,563
hid them in my tattoo, and then
projected them back onto the wall.

441
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:12,602
Everything's been worked out so
the image hits the right spot.

442
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,136
It's just math.

443
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,961
What if your math is wrong?

444
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:20,019
You'll drill into one of a
dozen gas lines behind the wall.

445
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,402
There'll be an explosion,
and we'll be burned alive.

446
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:28,989
But you're good at math, right?

447
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:03,864
They're breaking out.

448
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,579
- They're breaking...
- Shh.

449
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,362
Yo, Stroke,
you got longer arms than me, man.

450
00:37:48,152 --> 00:37:50,080
Ow! Son of a...

451
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,051
That bitch stuck me.

452
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:17,023
They think it's hot now?
I want all the water shut off.

453
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:19,888
- I'll call it in.
- Mack, you take care of it.

454
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:22,305
Yes, sir.

455
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:36,842
- Yeah, we have a problem.
- Oh, that's right. Yeah.

456
00:38:36,936 --> 00:38:39,220
Bob here seen the hole.
He's got to go away.

457
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:47,848
- No one's going anywhere.
- He's seen the hole.

458
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:49,373
So have you.

459
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:53,647
Looks like your lockup idea
didn't work out too good, huh?

460
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:56,689
I have a daughter. Please.

461
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,723
We gotta kill him.

462
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,252
The cops are right outside.

463
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:05,578
They'll stay outside,

464
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,859
as long as they know
we're keeping him alive.

465
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:10,600
But he's a guard.
He's gonna squeal.

466
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:14,233
What the hell does this
have to do with you anyway?

467
00:39:14,492 --> 00:39:17,291
This is not any of your concern.

468
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:18,897
Hmm.

469
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:26,714
See,
Bob here knows about our secret.

470
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:29,719
He knows about our escape.

471
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:34,570
So it's all of our concern,
now isn't it?

472
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:54,481
Easy, big fella. It's just me.

473
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,897
Looks like you took
a pretty good hit.

474
00:40:01,105 --> 00:40:03,533
Cons got that rook
guard in Gen Pop.

475
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,124
Kid's probably dead already,
or wishing he was.

476
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,395
Where's Scofield?

477
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,201
I haven't seen him
since things jumped off.

478
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:10,548
I gotta find him.

479
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,393
You're looking for Scofield?

480
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,466
Yeah, Turk.

481
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:14,342
Come on.

482
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:26,749
You got things backwards, pervert.

483
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:29,445
You're in as much trouble as he is,
you understand?

484
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:32,124
Go ahead, go ahead.
Stick me. Stick me.

485
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,161
Let's see how many
times I can shout out

486
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,887
about your little hole in
there before I bleed out, huh?

487
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:39,583
'Cause every con in here is gonna
know about your little escape,

488
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:41,693
before one drop of my
blood hits the floor.

489
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,978
So, you see, friends,

490
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,791
either I'm through
that hole with you,

491
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,117
or I'm gonna sing like Johnny Cash.

492
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:19,177
Hey, yo,
Stroke's about to get the doc!

493
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:36,936
Sucre,
I need you to finish what we started.

494
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:38,089
What's going on, man?
Where you going?

495
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,041
Sick Bay.

496
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,766
Hey, there's no way into B-Wing.
We're all locked out.

497
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,663
I'm not. No one touches the C.O.

498
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:46,219
No one.

499
00:41:54,504 --> 00:41:56,958
You gonna clue me in, paisan?

500
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:03,804
It's faster if we cut through here.

501
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:08,310
Burrows is as good as dead.

502
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:04,310
