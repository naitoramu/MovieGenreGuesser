<i>Mama's gonna buy you...</i>

12
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:04,270
{\pos(192,225)}Surprised he doesn't make
us do that.

13
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:09,851
{\pos(192,210)}The pack totally
has a pecking order.

14
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,109
{\pos(192,210)}And the head Hyena, he's the man.

15
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,323
{\pos(192,210)}All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

16
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:19,128
{\pos(192,210)}I mean, literally.
It's so gross.

17
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:22,328
{\pos(192,210)}They have to lick his jerk.

18
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:25,403
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

19
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,218
{\pos(192,190)}If this is supposed to be all, like,

20
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:33,934
{\pos(192,190)}Major League and all,

21
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:37,837
{\pos(192,190)}we should have equipment
maintainer guys.

22
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,598
And water boys.
You know?

23
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,251
Gatorade me, bitch.

24
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,089
{\pos(192,210)}Get us a couple flunkies in here.

25
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,074
Treat us right.

26
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:08,351
15 hours starts now.

27
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,626
I'm going to hit it,
if that's cool with you.

28
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:13,068
I don't understand.

29
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:14,377
{\pos(192,210)}What?

30
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:16,477
{\pos(192,210)}These numbers,
they just don't add up.

31
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,673
{\pos(192,210)}Told you.
Dude's totally boning us.

32
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,887
{\pos(192,210)}No, it's not that.

33
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,616
It's our output.
We're off.

34
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,623
We're .14% off.

35
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,733
Point one-four, that's

36
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,137
what, like...

37
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,605
What does that mean?

38
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,125
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

39
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,530
{\pos(192,210)}So how far off are we?

40
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:43,367
{\pos(192,210)}It's not negligible.

41
00:03:45,564 --> 00:03:47,564
{\pos(192,210)}Ball-parking it, I'd say we're

42
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,775
{\pos(192,210)}quarter to a half a pound shy.

43
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:53,826
{\pos(192,210)}That's weird.

44
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,611
What about spillage?

45
00:03:58,145 --> 00:03:58,947
Spillage?

46
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,241
Yeah, you know, like,
just stuff gets spilled.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,195
Nothing gets spilled.

48
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:04,786
A little maybe.

49
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,580
Nothing gets spilled.

50
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:09,040
What about evaporation?

51
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,439
{\pos(192,210)}It wouldn't account for this much.

52
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:13,505
{\pos(192,210)}The materials aren't out that long.

53
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,373
{\pos(192,210)}What about the other one?

54
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,876
The drops, like on...

55
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,612
on that, like, cold beer.

56
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:22,095
Condensation?

57
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:29,082
{\pos(192,210)}What about the crap
that gets left behind,

58
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,146
{\pos(192,210)}you know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats?

59
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,734
{\pos(192,210)}I add up, like, a gallon each.

60
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:37,814
{\pos(192,210)}Did you work that in?

61
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:39,948
{\pos(192,210)}Vestiges?

62
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:42,696
{\pos(192,210)}Vestiges.

63
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:48,058
Bet that's it.

64
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,193
Bet that's totally it.

65
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,420
Are you okay?

66
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,204
Why?

67
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:09,634
{\pos(192,180)}Nothing.

68
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:22,322
Are you coming?

69
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,656
Yeah, in a minute.

70
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,858
{\pos(192,210)}All right, see you tomorrow.

71
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:31,727
All right.

72
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:39,163
Shit.

73
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:43,331
You bastard.

74
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,459
Son of a...

75
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,780
Come on, you...

76
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:14,017
Come on, come on.

77
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,175
Son of a...

78
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,060
Son of a bitch.

79
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:07,486
That's great.

80
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,082
All right.

81
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:01,045
You little bastard.

82
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:44,966
Shut the door!

83
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,521
My ears are popping.

84
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,542
Shut the door.
Move.

85
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,060
It's like I'm on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

86
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,349
Positive pressure.

87
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:55,784
Positive what?

88
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,834
God, friggin' kills.

89
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,772
Just move your jaw around.
Move it around.

90
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,829
I am moving it around.
It's not working.

91
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,239
Then just yawn or something.
Stop acting like such a baby.

92
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:06,617
Damn.

93
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,534
What positive?
Positive what?

94
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:12,092
Pressure. I've turned
the ventilation up

95
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,187
to keep the outside out.

96
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,917
There's been a contamination.

97
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:19,700
Wait.

98
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:20,722
What?

99
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:25,042
- Hold up.
- Something got into the lab.

100
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,418
So what do we do?

101
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,315
I mean, do we...

102
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,044
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't
we be wearing masks?

103
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,603
It's not that...
that kind of contaminant.

104
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,131
So it's, like, not dangerous?

105
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,917
Mr. White, talk to me here.

106
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,220
Not to us particularly. No.

107
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:48,709
What {\the hell }is that?

108
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:50,546
This is...

109
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:53,006
I made it.

110
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:59,052
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

111
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,491
A fly.

112
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:09,529
What do you mean?

113
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:11,023
A fly, like...

114
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,796
- like what do you mean?
- I mean

115
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:14,674
a fly,

116
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,785
a house fly.

117
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:20,824
Like, uh, one fly?

118
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,617
Singular?

119
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,970
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab,

120
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,362
and I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

121
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,065
No, man, not really.

122
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,648
I can't say that I'm
really following you here.

123
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:38,133
Dude, you scared the shit out of me.

124
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,343
I mean, when you say
it's contamination,

125
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,491
I mean, I'm thinking, like
an Ebola leak or something.

126
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:44,441
Ebola?

127
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,193
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel,

128
00:12:47,318 --> 00:12:50,295
where all your intestines sort of
just slip right out of your butt.

129
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,454
Thank you. I know wt Ebola is.

130
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,537
Now, tell me.
What would a West-African virus

131
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:56,964
be doing in our lab?

132
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,154
So,

133
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,436
you're chasing around a fly,

134
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:04,625
and in your world I'm the idiot.

135
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,779
Jesse, listen.

136
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,461
This fly... any fly...

137
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,481
cannot be in our lab.

138
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,850
It's a problem.
It's a contamination,

139
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,559
and that is in no way
a misuse of the word.

140
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:19,640
Okay?

141
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,403
So in terms of

142
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:23,518
keeping our cook clean

143
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,616
and our product unadulterated,

144
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:27,496
we need to take this
very seriously.

145
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,684
Now do you understand?

146
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,981
So is that your fly saber?

147
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:39,333
This is a swatter.

148
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:42,065
It happens to work quite well,
thank you.

149
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,281
What happened to your head?

150
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,206
Nothing. I'm fine.

151
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,964
You didn't hit it,

152
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,511
like really... really hard?

153
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,355
My head is not the problem, Jesse.

154
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,130
The fly is the problem.

155
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:57,707
You didn't happen to

156
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,213
maybe...

157
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,877
try our product, did you?

158
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,213
Jesse, I know this

159
00:14:04,338 --> 00:14:06,221
seems unusual to you, a layman.

160
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:09,975
A fly... I get it...
seems insignificant, right?

161
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:11,200
But trust me.

162
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:13,633
In a highly controlled
environment such as this...

163
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:19,317
any pollutant...

164
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:22,969
no matter how small...

165
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:28,763
could completely...

166
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,096
What?

167
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:53,654
Were you here all night?

168
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,533
Have you even slept?

169
00:14:57,851 --> 00:14:59,391
No. Jesse, look.
I'm fine. Okay

170
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,401
Will you just please focus...

171
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,451
Okay, look. We're running late,
so let's just get started.

172
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,884
Shall we? The sooner we do
it, the sooner we're done.

173
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:13,975
Frickin' finally.

174
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:21,422
What are you doing?

175
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,340
It's time to alkaline.

176
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:26,718
Have you not heard a word I said?

177
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:30,138
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

178
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:32,482
Have I been speaking to myself?

179
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,534
The timer went off.

180
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,155
How long is this batch going
to be good for? An hour? Two?

181
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:40,634
The batch will be good for nothing

182
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,706
if we don't clear the contaminant.

183
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:44,611
Clear the contaminant?

184
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,418
We're making meth here,

185
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:47,837
not space shuttles.

186
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,998
We're making nothing
until we catch this fly.

187
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:52,434
What fly?

188
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:54,322
Where the hell is

189
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,918
this fly?
Not like I've even seen the thing.

190
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,918
Maybe your positive pressure blew
it out the door or something.

191
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,837
No, no. It is here.
It is around. Okay?

192
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,036
He's around,
and am not going to expose

193
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,153
this batch to the open air
and contamination.

194
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,889
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself, or you can help me,

195
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,515
but you are right.
We are running out of time,

196
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,588
so I need your answer right now.

197
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:26,128
Okay.

198
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,914
Hey, tick-tock.

199
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,810
Look, I like making cherry
products, but let's keep it real.

200
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:53,053
All right, we make poison

201
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:54,938
for people who don't care.

202
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:58,430
We probably have the most
unpicky customers in the world.

203
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:01,065
No rationalizing.

204
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,658
We'll find it any minute now.
Don't give up.

205
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:17,539
Did you...

206
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,765
Did you know that there's

207
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,153
an acceptable level of rat turds

208
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,350
that can go into candy bars?

209
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:28,387
That's the government, Jack.

210
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,150
Even the government

211
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:34,558
doesn't care that much
about quality.

212
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,850
You know what is

213
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,069
okay to put in hotdogs?

214
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,356
Pig lips and assholes,

215
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:48,866
but I say, hey, have at it, bitches,

216
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,660
because I love hotdogs,

217
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:55,366
and, you know, see what I'm...

218
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:56,941
What are you doing?

219
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,947
Look, let me just top it off,

220
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:04,792
all right, really quick.

221
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,128
A little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

222
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,923
No harm done.
Then we're golden.

223
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:17,106
It stays closed.
That's an order.

224
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,337
You can't order shit, Adolf.

225
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:21,752
We're 50-50 partners.

226
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,019
Remember?

227
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:32,629
God, what is your problem, bro?

228
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,332
Freakin' psycho.

229
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,231
God,

230
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,886
it, like, hit bone.

231
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:49,649
You see it, right?

232
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,334
You see it?

233
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,130
Get it.

234
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,100
You want me to get it?

235
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:10,121
Slow.

236
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:11,744
Move slowly.

237
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,265
I know.

238
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,882
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

239
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:18,533
Absolutely. I'm just going
to need your swatter thing.

240
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:23,539
Come on.

241
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:27,458
It's okay, come on.

242
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,196
- Come on.
- Make it count.

243
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:33,172
I'm gonna...

244
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,353
I'm going to make it count,
all right.

245
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,435
Now.

246
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:39,971
On three.

247
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,130
One...

248
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:48,905
You like that?
Hurts?

249
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:56,149
- Did you get it?
- I think so.

250
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:58,614
- Where is it?
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

251
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,529
Who cares?
I got it.

252
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:03,294
- Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

253
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,183
It's,

254
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:07,840
right there.
Look.

255
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:09,743
Look.

256
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:11,708
See?
I told you I got it.

257
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:22,959
This is a raisin.

258
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,922
Look, I definitely got it, man.

259
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,049
Man.

260
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:34,269
He's got some skills.

261
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:36,736
I'll give him that.

262
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,575
Look...

263
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:42,754
I feel like I'm

264
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,342
running out of ways
to explain this to you,

265
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,711
but once more I shall try.

266
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:51,916
This fly is a major problem for us.

267
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,990
It will ruin our batch.

268
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:57,690
Now, we need to destroy it

269
00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:59,299
and every trace of it

270
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,384
so we can cook.

271
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:03,203
Failing that...

272
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,441
we're dead.

273
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,946
There is no more room for error.

274
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:17,935
Not with these people.

275
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,623
All right,
how about we go get some air?

276
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:26,619
Get some air?

277
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,688
Your answer to "We're sliding
head-first into a massive crap..."

278
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,493
I understand that
the fly is a serious thing.

279
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,024
Now, all right?
I'm on board.

280
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,537
I'm just saying maybe
if we went and got some air,

281
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:43,928
it would help us come up with
a plan on how to catch it.

282
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,572
Then come back down here

283
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:47,247
and subtract his ass.

284
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,886
Wait, do you have your keys?

285
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,469
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

286
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,613
Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

287
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:15,738
Yeah.

288
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,256
If you're not going to help me,
stay out of my way!

289
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,754
Does somebody have an ax I can use?

290
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:31,879
<i>El ax-o!</i>

291
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:33,978
<i>Peligroso! El ax-o!</i>

292
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,949
There we go.

293
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,667
Say good night.

294
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:18,224
Son of a bitch!

295
00:23:22,814 --> 00:23:23,864
Son of a...

296
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,407
Damn it!

297
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,984
Where in the hell is that...

298
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,247
Need some juice maybe?

299
00:24:03,216 --> 00:24:04,666
{\pub}Knock yourself out.

300
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,279
It's a real one.

301
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:08,406
Yeah, like yours was working.

302
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:14,049
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

303
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,852
You don't decontaminate
by contaminating further.

304
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,777
What the hell is all this?

305
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,653
Here, how about this?

306
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:25,714
"Nontoxic glue strips."

307
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,564
It's got pheromones.
I got a buttload.

308
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:32,805
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

309
00:24:39,008 --> 00:24:40,673
I sure hope we have enough.{\CP caché à droite}

310
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:44,494
I'm going to go out
on a limb and say yeah.

311
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:47,482
Do you see him?

312
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,357
How long do you think
you've been awake?

313
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,440
Why do you keep asking me that?

314
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:57,276
Just figure
you could use some coffee, is all.

315
00:24:57,401 --> 00:24:58,651
I know I could.

316
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,442
How about it?

317
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:04,117
Yeah.

318
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,634
You take cream and sugar?

319
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,759
Black is fine.

320
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:25,097
Why don't you just leave him be?

321
00:25:25,544 --> 00:25:27,344
Let the traps do the work.

322
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:31,262
These pheromones
are supposed to kick ass.

323
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:36,957
I bet we catch this
mo-fo any second.

324
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:51,351
Thank you.

325
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:56,224
You ever have, like, a wild animal

326
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,388
trapped in your house?

327
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:04,703
Not that I can recall, no.

328
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,307
We did, this one time,

329
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:11,070
back when it was my aunt's house,

330
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,356
back before she died of cancer.

331
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,018
Possum.

332
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,294
Big, freaky-looking bitch.

333
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:22,482
Since when
did they change it to "opossum"?

334
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:24,849
What's up with that?
{\I mean, }When I was coming up,

335
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,597
it was just "possum".

336
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:30,779
"Opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

337
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:34,175
Why they gotta go changing
everything?

338
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:36,950
Whatever.
They're just big rats anyways,

339
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:40,987
giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces,

340
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,533
totally freaky,

341
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:45,248
like alien rats.

342
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:51,278
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

343
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,822
but he was living there
under the house.

344
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:58,955
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room,

345
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,037
always scurrying around.

346
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,243
Sometimes I'd see him
outside at night,

347
00:27:04,368 --> 00:27:06,668
and he would just, you know, freeze.

348
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:11,050
And it's like you're not
looking right at it. Right?

349
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,425
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

350
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:17,756
That's what they do.
They play dead or whatever.

351
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:20,281
It's just so lame.

352
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:24,221
Is there a discernible point
to this story,

353
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:28,433
a point that you'll be arriving at

354
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:30,458
sometime in the near future?

355
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:35,699
It was just a total bitch
to get out. It took forever.

356
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:36,874
A guy came,

357
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:39,591
set all these traps and all,

358
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:42,535
and he finally got it,

359
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,766
but my aunt,

360
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:46,789
she didn't believe it.

361
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,231
She kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

362
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:55,662
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

363
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:57,706
She started keeping an old umbrella

364
00:27:57,831 --> 00:27:58,981
by her chair.

365
00:28:00,276 --> 00:28:03,090
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it,

366
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,434
even gave it a name.

367
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,068
It was...

368
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,163
Scrabble.

369
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,174
Yeah, that was it.

370
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:14,194
"Scrabble, just knock it off."
Bang, bang, bang.

371
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,740
She got like that toward the end.

372
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,122
Got obsessive about stuff,

373
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:28,243
just got mad about stuff.

374
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:31,402
We didn't know what was up.

375
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:35,786
It wasn't like her to be that way.

376
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:41,673
But it turned out that the...

377
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,413
the cancer had spread to her brain,

378
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:46,888
and that was why.

379
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:51,537
It metastasized.

380
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:57,171
But it was good
that that was when we decided

381
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:59,556
to take her to the doctor
because then

382
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,020
we knew what was up

383
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:05,503
and got her some treatment

384
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,914
and meds so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

385
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:16,577
It was a lot better after that.

386
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:20,379
She was a lot happier.

387
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,402
Where the hell is he?

388
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,144
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse,

389
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,615
just last week.

390
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,080
I'm still in remission.

391
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,122
I'm healthy.

392
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:55,516
Good.

393
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:57,072
Great.

394
00:30:01,877 --> 00:30:03,177
No end in sight.

395
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,473
That's great.

396
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,273
I missed it.

397
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,064
There was some perfect moment,

398
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,754
and it passed me right by.

399
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:32,370
Yeah, I had to have enough
to leave them.

400
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:35,025
That was the whole point.

401
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,975
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have enough.

402
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:48,009
But it had to be
before she found out...

403
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:49,134
Skyler.

404
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:51,792
It had to be before that.

405
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:53,819
Perfect moment...

406
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:56,618
for what?

407
00:30:58,505 --> 00:30:59,655
To drop dead?

408
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,993
What, are you saying
you want to die?

409
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:10,272
I'm saying I've lived too long.

410
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:16,879
You want them to actually miss you.

411
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,267
You know?

412
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:23,492
You want their memories of you
to be...

413
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:28,846
But she just won't...

414
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:31,396
She just won't understand.

415
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:33,685
No matter how...

416
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,929
well I explain it,

417
00:31:37,402 --> 00:31:39,673
these days she just has this...

418
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:41,598
this...

419
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:45,442
I mean, I truly believe

420
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:48,650
there exists
some combination of words.

421
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:52,133
There must exist certain words

422
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:55,137
in a certain, specific order

423
00:31:55,262 --> 00:31:56,939
that would explain all of this,

424
00:31:57,064 --> 00:31:59,703
but with her I just...

425
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:03,969
I just can't ever seem to find them.

426
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:06,350
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

427
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:09,371
I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

428
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:12,875
but before the fugue state
they didn't have enough money,

429
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,451
so no, not then.

430
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,662
And plus my daughter
wasn't born yet.

431
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:31,716
It had to be after Holly was born.

432
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:36,155
Definitely before the surgery.

433
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:39,870
Oh, Christ.

434
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,025
That damn second cellphone.

435
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:45,182
How could I possibly...

436
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:58,229
I know the moment.

437
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:05,692
It was the night Jane died.

438
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:16,404
I was at home and...

439
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:18,769
And we needed diapers,

440
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:21,385
and so I said I'd go,

441
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:23,985
but it was just an excuse.

442
00:33:24,748 --> 00:33:26,676
Actually, that was the night I...

443
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:29,051
I brought you your money, remember?

444
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,566
Yeah, I remember.

445
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,873
But afterward I stopped at a bar.

446
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,117
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

447
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,963
I just walked in, sat down.

448
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,678
I never told you.

449
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:54,901
That you went to a bar?

450
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:04,875
I sit down, and this man,
this stranger,

451
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:07,645
he engages me in conversation.

452
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,423
Now, he's a complete stranger.

453
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:15,273
But he turns out
to be Jane's father,

454
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:17,468
Donald Margolis.

455
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:20,499
What are you talking about?

456
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:22,144
{\Of course }I didn't know it at the time.

457
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,957
I mean,
it was just some guy in a bar.

458
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,296
I didn't put it together
until after the crash

459
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,827
when he was all over the news.

460
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:33,017
Jane's dad.

461
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,050
Think of the odds.

462
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,368
Once I tried to calculate them,

463
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,106
but they're astronomical.

464
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:42,806
{\I mean, }Think of the odds

465
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,439
of me going in, sitting down

466
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:49,034
that night in that bar
next to that man.

467
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,416
What did you talk about?

468
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,963
Water on Mars.

469
00:35:05,258 --> 00:35:06,258
Family.

470
00:35:09,046 --> 00:35:11,088
What about family?

471
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:16,587
I told him that I had a daughter,

472
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:19,073
and he told me he had one, too.

473
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:21,845
Then he said,

474
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:24,790
"Never give up on family."

475
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,150
And I didn't.

476
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,071
I took his advice.

477
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:50,684
The universe is random.

478
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,273
It's not inevitable.

479
00:35:52,398 --> 00:35:54,852
It's simple chaos.

480
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,429
It's subatomic particles
in endless, aimless collision.

481
00:36:00,554 --> 00:36:03,161
That's what science teaches us,

482
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:05,793
but what is this saying?

483
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:10,933
What is it telling us,
when on the very night

484
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:14,694
that this man's daughter dies,

485
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:19,103
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

486
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:24,646
How can that be random?

487
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:28,853
Sit down.

488
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:45,884
That was the moment.

489
00:36:47,996 --> 00:36:49,046
That night.

490
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:54,983
I should never have left home.

491
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,060
Never gone to your house.

492
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,030
Maybe things would have...

493
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,430
Thought I was...

494
00:37:18,894 --> 00:37:21,947
I was at home watching TV.

495
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:24,817
Some...

496
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,288
Some nature program about elephants.

497
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:35,688
Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

498
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:41,608
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

499
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:47,429
She was singing a lullaby.

500
00:37:56,826 --> 00:38:00,578
If had just lived
right up to that moment

501
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:04,006
and not one second more...

502
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,631
... that would've been perfect.

503
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,864
{\pub}He's not coming down.

504
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,427
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

505
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:42,104
That's why he likes it.

506
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,342
Thailand's hot, right?

507
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:48,921
Yeah.

508
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,982
See? That's why.

509
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,952
Wait.

510
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:56,629
Here.

511
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:13,166
He's not coming down.

512
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,936
He's staying up there forever.

513
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:45,921
What are you doing?

514
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:48,946
What do you think?
I'm going to get that bitch.

515
00:39:53,939 --> 00:39:56,239
No, you're going to break your neck.

516
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:58,615
Yeah, yeah. Just...

517
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:03,877
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

518
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:06,728
Damn it.

519
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:10,493
Just hold onto it.

520
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,401
Hold it still?

521
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:34,316
I'm sorry.

522
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,362
Sorry for what?

523
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:37,843
Being a lunatic?

524
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:43,772
I'm sorry about Jane.

525
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,651
Me, too.

526
00:40:57,673 --> 00:40:58,855
I mean...

527
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,411
I'm very sorry.

528
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:12,759
It's not your fault.

529
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:16,888
But it's not mine either.

530
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,357
It's no one's fault,

531
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,000
not even hers.

532
00:41:27,924 --> 00:41:29,687
Sucker's just sitting there.

533
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,356
We are who we are.

534
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,603
You know, just two junkies

535
00:41:39,728 --> 00:41:41,778
with a duffel bag full of cash.

536
00:41:42,684 --> 00:41:43,884
Like you said,

537
00:41:44,862 --> 00:41:47,382
we both would've been dead
within a week.

538
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:49,952
But I miss her, though.

539
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:55,669
God, I do.

540
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:07,369
Come down.

541
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:09,289
Wait,

542
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:11,448
I am so close.

543
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:15,395
Let it go.

544
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,496
We need to cook.

545
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,374
What about the contamination?

546
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,948
It's all contaminated.

547
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,741
I definitely scared him.

548
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:40,227
Probably stay out of our way...

549
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:15,703
Somebody got caught, yo!

550
00:43:15,828 --> 00:43:17,478
You see that, Mister...

551
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,651
Bins are packed?

552
00:44:07,902 --> 00:44:09,202
Bins are packed.

553
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:11,999
How's the yield?

554
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:13,929
Two-oh-two and change.

555
00:44:15,678 --> 00:44:17,278
You okay getting home?

556
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:18,996
Yeah. Better.

557
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:20,792
Thanks.

558
00:44:21,183 --> 00:44:22,323
<i>Mañana</i>, then.

559
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:40,137
Come here.

560
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:45,975
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

561
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,121
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

562
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:54,860
That half a pound
that I said we're off by...

563
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:59,256
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

564
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:01,843
You understand?

565
00:45:01,968 --> 00:45:03,918
And if they ever found out...

566
00:45:07,475 --> 00:45:09,253
I didn't take shit.

567
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:18,384
I'm just saying that I won't
be able to protect you.

568
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:21,246
Who's asking you to?
