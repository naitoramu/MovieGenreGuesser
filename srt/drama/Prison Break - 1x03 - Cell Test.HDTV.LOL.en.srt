1
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:16,635
Oh, my God. Williamson, get in here.

2
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,927
What the hell happened here?

3
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:21,254
An accident.

4
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,706
Here... gotta get him to the infirmary. Come on.

5
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:32,632
Get out.

6
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,290
I thought you said you were gonna have a conversation with him.

7
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,278
Yeah, I did.

8
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:44,873
Things, uh, escalated.

9
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:54,009
Bring him on into Three. Cathy, I'm gonna need 10cc's of Xylocaine.

10
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:01,951
Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here.

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,871
I said thank you, I'll take it from here.

12
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,088
Let's go.

13
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,835
Okay... let's take a look at you.

14
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,035
You're okay... You're okay...

15
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,161
What happened?

16
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:28,098
Uh, nothing.

17
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,916
This isn't nothing, Michael. I need you to tell me what happened.

18
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:32,938
Don't make me lie to you.

19
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:35,903
Please.

20
00:01:42,497 --> 00:01:45,524
I think you better have I.A. start an investigation.

21
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,859
Oh, there's no need. We know what happened.

22
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,522
Uh, perhaps you'd be good enough to enlighten me?

23
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,475
There was a pair of gardening shears left on the floor of the shed.

24
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:55,328
Evidently, he stepped on them.

25
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:57,467
Blade went right through his boot, huh?

26
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,409
Yep.

27
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,457
So, uh, why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

28
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,921
Like I said, Doc...

29
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,299
we got it taken care of.

30
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:08,183
Let's go.

31
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:44,093
I'm going to kill that scum.

32
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,769
You won't. You kill him, you kill our express ticket out of here.

33
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:47,980
Look what he did to you--

34
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:51,366
you're not going to last a second in this place unless I do something about it.

35
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,783
You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,955
Yeah.

37
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:57,670
They operate flights from small airfields across the Midwest,

38
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,000
like the one ten miles from here.

39
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,954
They're run by a shell corporation Abruzzi owns.

40
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:03,802
We get him on board,

41
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,996
there's gonna be a midnight flight waiting for us the night we get outside those walls.

42
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:10,525
You're willing to risk the entire escape on a guy you don't even know?

43
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:12,996
Preparation can only take you so far.

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,942
After that, you gotta take a few leaps of faith.

45
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:20,088
Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith, Michael.

46
00:03:20,182 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm not talking about Abruzzi.

47
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,844
There's someone else who holds the key to this entire thing.

48
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,109
With him, it either works or it doesn't.

49
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,534
Problem is, I couldn't know who that was until I got in here.

50
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,311
Sucre? You can't be serious.

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,107
The guy's a thief, Michael; he can't be trusted.

52
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,845
Gonna have to trust him,

53
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,410
because he's my cell mate.

54
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:45,098
How well do you know him?

55
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,334
About as well as a man can in a week.

56
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:51,189
You tell him, he tells everyone, we're done.

57
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,512
You know that, right?

58
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,797
We don't get him on board, there's not going to be any digging in that cell,

59
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,165
and if there's no digging in that cell...

60
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,552
then there's no escape.

61
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:41,286
Thank you for calling, please leave a message after the tone.

62
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:45,606
Maricruz? It's me, baby. You there?

63
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:47,974
Pick up if you're there, mami.

64
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:49,330
I been in the SHU.

65
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,551
I been thinking about you.

66
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:54,434
About your body...

67
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,995
God, I've been thinking about your body...

68
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:58,083
Hello?

69
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,017
Uh, Mrs. Delgado....

70
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:03,353
Hi. How you doing? It's me, Fernando.

71
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,066
Um, sorry to bother you at home, but, uh,

72
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:09,063
you know what's up with Maricruz's cell phone?

73
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:10,731
It just keeps going straight to voice mail.

74
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:12,769
Maybe she has it turned off.

75
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,608
Any chance you know where she is?

76
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:18,129
I know exactly where she is.

77
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:19,691
And that would be?

78
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,591
- With Hector.
- Hector?

79
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,249
That's right.

80
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:24,817
They're at the mall, I think.

81
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,235
I don't suppose, next time you see her,

82
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,380
you could have her turn her phone back on?

83
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,400
Mrs. Delgado, I know you don't like me,

84
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,683
but I love your daughter and she loves me.

85
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:35,865
We're going to get married, you know?

86
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:39,767
If you were a decent man and you really loved her,

87
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,094
you'd let her live her life.

88
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:44,825
What's that supposed to mean?

89
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,573
I'll tell her you called.

90
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,383
I'm looking to do some damage.

91
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:59,093
Well, you come to the right place.

92
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,195
I want to do it slow.

93
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,556
Inflict the maximum amount of pain,

94
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,652
so a guy wishes he'd just die, you know, and get it over with,

95
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,774
but just can't quite get there.

96
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:10,148
Oh, I got that.

97
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:13,019
I got that.

98
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:18,669
Look at this right here, boss.

99
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:24,869
I call it "the gutter."

100
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,051
Jam it up there in the stomach,

101
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,670
and  these bits right here hook the intestines.

102
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,710
You give it a pull back,

103
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,710
poor sucker's guts are hanging right out of his stomach,

104
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:37,805
and he'll get a real good look at 'em, 'cause the wound's not fatal.

105
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,268
Well, least not until the infection sets in.

106
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:49,801
You're one sick puppy, you know that?

107
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:52,292
Thank you.

108
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:13,013
What happened?

109
00:08:13,715 --> 00:08:14,470
I'm  okay.

110
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,571
They've gotten to you, haven't they?

111
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,555
The other prisoners.

112
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,735
My God, Michael, this place is going to kill you.

113
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:30,879
You said you talked to a woman. What was her name?

114
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,015
- Leticia.
- Leticia Barris.

115
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,007
How'd you know?

116
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,674
A year ago, I was doing exactly what you're doing.

117
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,958
Trying to find out the truth.

118
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:42,347
It's a bottomless pit, Veronica.

119
00:08:42,476 --> 00:08:43,711
They designed it that way,

120
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:46,806
so that, by the time you got to the bottom of it, Lincoln would be dead.

121
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,611
Why didn't you tell me you were doing this?

122
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:50,229
Once the day was set,

123
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,605
once that final appeal had been rejected,

124
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,743
he had 60 days to live.

125
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,398
Figured I could play their game and watch him die in the process,

126
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:01,490
or I could take matters into my own hands.

127
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:03,391
You don't have to do that.

128
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,857
Leticia knows something.

129
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,243
If I can get it out of her, maybe we can re-open Lincoln's case.

130
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:09,905
What'd she tell you?

131
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,623
She said that somebody else was behind the killing of the Vice President's brother.

132
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:14,329
Who?

133
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,713
She got spooked, she took off before I could get anything out of her.

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,353
She's holed up in the Elysian Fields Projects.

135
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,919
I'm going to go see her this afternoon.

136
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:25,968
Place is dangerous. You should take someone with you.

137
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:26,817
Who?

138
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,196
Fiancé would be a good place to start.

139
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:33,774
I think that's probably the last thing in the world Sebastian'd ever want to do.

140
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,535
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

141
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,499
No priors, a good student.

142
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:49,928
Then you get yourself arrested for intent to sell.

143
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:52,720
Good life get a little boring?

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,001
It was stupid.

145
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,318
It won't happen again.

146
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:58,305
Well, we're all here to make sure of that.

147
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,982
I took some time to speak to your mother before you came in.

148
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,884
She told me that there were some...

149
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:05,580
some extenuating circumstances in your life right now.

150
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:07,497
Yeah, if you're talking about that guy at Fox River,

151
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,110
he's got nothing to do with this.

152
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,059
He refuses to call him his father.

153
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,215
The world would be a better place without him.

154
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,410
It's clear to me you've got a lot of anger, young man.

155
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:19,267
Misdirected, it could land you in the wrong place.

156
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,648
So, to make sure that doesn't happen,

157
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,631
you're gonna have to check in with me once a week.

158
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,435
Fridays, one hour.

159
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:28,571
Your attendance at school and your grades need to be pristine.

160
00:10:28,664 --> 00:10:29,371
Absolutely.

161
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:30,791
And to give you a real good idea

162
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,554
where  that anger of yours will get you if you don't rein it in,

163
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm signing you up for the Scared Straight program at Fox River.

164
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:39,032
You'll have a mentor, who you'll work with weekly,

165
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,657
to give you a little perspective.

166
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,751
A mentor?

167
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,672
Your father.

168
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,289
Tell me that ain't what I think it is.

169
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,090
It ain't what you think it is.

170
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:14,739
Fish. A cell phone in here?

171
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,760
That's cardinal sin number one.

172
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:19,137
They can tack two years onto your bid, automatic.

173
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,559
If they catch you.

174
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:23,411
Man, you know what kind of trouble I can get, for just knowing what I know?

175
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:25,319
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

176
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,524
Now, that means you can make calls whenever you want, right?

177
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,964
I don't like the look in your eye.

178
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:40,109
What's in there-- you never saw it. Got it?

179
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,181
Why didn't you include any names?

180
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:51,605
Why would I want anyone to watch me die?

181
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,507
I've seen it happen a number of ways.

182
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,428
Some people want to go it alone,

183
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:01,196
others have grandiose statements they want to make.

184
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,525
But most want some member of their family there,

185
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:09,038
before they leave this world.

186
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,193
I'll do it alone.

187
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,361
Son, in my opinion,

188
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,831
all inmates who have made that choice

189
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:22,969
have deeply regretted it in their final minutes.

190
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,054
I'll, uh...

191
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:32,044
...leave it blank for now.

192
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,513
You have less than four weeks now.

193
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,819
You should give it some thought.

194
00:12:57,713 --> 00:12:59,952
Hi. I'm-I'm looking for Leticia Barris.

195
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:01,517
Five.

196
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,110
Thank you.

197
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,533
Hello!

198
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:34,143
Don't you move a muscle.

199
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,243
Take it easy, Leticia.

200
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:42,757
You're working with them, aren't you?

201
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:44,975
- With who?
- Think I'm stupid, lady?

202
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,786
I hear the clicks on my phone, I see the cars out there on the street.

203
00:13:47,882 --> 00:13:50,161
I know you're scared. I am, too.

204
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:53,682
But, please, put the gun down.

205
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,151
Where you going?

206
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,799
Ireland. What difference does it make?

207
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:05,231
It makes all the difference. Nobody's ever gotten your testimony.

208
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:07,258
That's exactly the reason I'm still breathing.

209
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,217
I'm not with them, Leticia. You have to believe me.

210
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,295
Oh, yeah? Then what you sneaking in here for?

211
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,858
I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.

212
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:14,713
Oh, yeah?

213
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,137
And why do you care so much about my well-being, all of a sudden?

214
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:19,004
I don't.

215
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,262
Finally, an honest answer.

216
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:23,308
But maybe you can save Lincoln.

217
00:14:23,974 --> 00:14:28,354
And maybe you can bring down the guys who killed your boyfriend in the process.

218
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:29,422
If somebody killed you,

219
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,372
and Crab could have done something to the guys who did it--

220
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:32,882
you think he would have?

221
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,740
I'm not as strong as he was.

222
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,422
I can't take those people on.

223
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,917
I'll take 'em on.

224
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:43,573
All you have to do is come to my office and tell me what you know.

225
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:47,101
I'll type it up, you can sign the affidavit, and split.

226
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,141
I'll take you to the airport myself.

227
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,344
Bellick.

228
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:37,166
Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

229
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,054
I want some extra time outside for the next couple weeks.

230
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,377
Paint fumes in P.I. must be getting to you.

231
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:45,747
Cell phones allowed in here?

232
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:49,834
Who?

233
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,689
Extra time outside.

234
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:53,978
A couple cigarettes.

235
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,829
Half hour. One week. One cigarette.

236
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,131
Know a con named Sucre?

237
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,955
This is what I don't understand, John:

238
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,800
Otto  Fibonacci fingers you.

239
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,136
He put you in prison for life.

240
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:27,827
Yet, you act like you don't even want to find out where he is.

241
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,340
That's not true, Philly.

242
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,098
Maybe it's 'cause you don't think you have anything to lose anymore, you know?

243
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:34,528
You're already locked up.

244
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:37,333
You... you know, maybe you, um... maybe you like it here.

245
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:38,562
I mean, I don't know.

246
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:42,696
But, what I do know is that, if Fibonacci testifies next month,

247
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,440
you and I are gonna be neighbors.

248
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,589
And I am not going to let that happen.

249
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:51,168
I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

250
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:57,127
Fancy suits, ties, shirts.

251
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:00,570
I think you're right, so, uh...

252
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:02,779
so, let's cut to the chase.

253
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:04,932
Did you break this kid?

254
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:06,907
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

255
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:17,175
What is this?

256
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:18,980
It's a little gift from me to you.

257
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,992
Are these his?

258
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:26,537
Yeah, he won't crack.

259
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:34,432
Well, perhaps, you should consider using a different methodology then, John.

260
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:38,846
From what I gather, there are far worse threats in prison

261
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,948
other than bodily harm.

262
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,368
What happened to the days when you used to trust me, Philly,

263
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,172
that I would get things done?

264
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:49,704
Those were the days when you actually did get things done, John.

265
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,199
Daddy! Daddy! Did you hear the news?

266
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,713
What? What-What news?

267
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,813
We're going to stay with Uncle Philly at the lake for a few weeks.

268
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,616
Yeah. We're gonna have a good time!

269
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,064
You're right, John. Maybe you're right.

270
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:14,961
I do trust you.

271
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:18,100
Now, you're gonna take care of that thing, aren't you?

272
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:30,016
How are those boneyard visits going with that girlfriend of yours?

273
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,017
I imagine pretty good, huh?

274
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:44,318
You know, visitation rules stipulate that conjugals are only for married couples.

275
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,542
But  we're engaged.

276
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:47,397
Besides, I got that coming to me

277
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:50,010
'cause I ain't caused no static in this place.

278
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:54,441
Please don't dead my conjugals.

279
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,853
I won't.

280
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:58,392
Thank you.

281
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,230
But, in exchange,

282
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,825
you have to tell me where that cell phone is.

283
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:06,556
Cell phone?

284
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:08,689
Don't play stupid with me.

285
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:11,213
I'm giving you a chance to save your precious conjugals.

286
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,539
You lie to me,

287
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:15,475
they're gone, and they're never coming back.

288
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:19,975
Now, where's that cell phone?

289
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:50,272
Turner?

290
00:19:50,595 --> 00:19:53,409
Your transfer came in. They want you in administration.

291
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:09,025
He didn't talk.

292
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,398
All I got to say is I better get to make all the calls I want.

293
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,282
Gonna be kind of hard.

294
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,228
Soap?

295
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,633
I lost my congugals over soap?!

296
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:39,786
You may have lost your conjugals, but I can do you one better.

297
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:41,947
I can get you to her.

298
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,038
To Maricruz.

299
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,793
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

300
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,823
Yeah? And how you gonna do that?

301
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,892
We're breaking out of here.

302
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,054
How?

303
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:55,661
- It starts in our cell.
- In our cell?

304
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,813
To tell you the truth, it's already started.

305
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:02,575
Ah.

306
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:04,058
Are you crazy?!

307
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,870
You think I want to break out of here?

308
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:07,880
16 months from now, I'm out the gate.

309
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:08,967
I'm getting married, papi,

310
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:11,182
and I'm sure as hell not doing it with no posse on my ass.

311
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,681
Man, I ought to beat you six ways till Sunday!

312
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,349
I lost my conjugals, pendejo.

313
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:16,820
and all because of your little bar of soap.

314
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,297
I had to test you; see if you could keep a secret.

315
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,432
You want a secret?

316
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,240
I got a secret for you, Fish.

317
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,098
You dig in my cell while I'm there,

318
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:26,483
and I'm gonna split your wig.

319
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:36,455
That went well.

320
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:44,405
Why don't we start with Lincoln's relationship with your boyfriend.

321
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:45,135
Real simple.

322
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:47,777
He owed my man $90,000, and he wasn't getting it done.

323
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,705
Then, all of a sudden, it gets done.

324
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,322
Crab walks in with 90K and a big-ass smile on his face.

325
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:53,218
Who  paid him?

326
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,284
Not Lincoln-- they paid his marker.

327
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,464
Who's "they"?

328
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,505
It's all right, Leticia.

329
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,020
I told you, you're safe here.

330
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,305
Crab brought this guy home. Never seen him before.

331
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:09,822
Crab did what he always did when he was doing big business:

332
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:12,719
he told me to take a walk, so that's exactly what I did.

333
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,140
There was something about this guy, though--

334
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:16,872
he wasn't the kind of guy Crab usually dealt with.

335
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,943
What do you mean?

336
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,659
Couldn't put my finger on it till he went outside.

337
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:23,039
Then I knew. He had that look.

338
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:24,035
What look?

339
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:26,271
You know, that they own the place.

340
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,111
That they're untouchable.

341
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,293
Like they're government.

342
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:33,055
So the government paid Lincoln's debt?

343
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,182
Did Crab say what they wanted in return?

344
00:22:37,235 --> 00:22:38,597
Uh-uh.

345
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:39,783
All right.

346
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:42,133
Uh, just give me a moment to type this up.

347
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:44,467
Where are you going?

348
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:45,904
I'm gonna have a smoke.

349
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:47,161
Look, this is only gonna take me a minute.

350
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,040
So will the smoke.

351
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:55,820
No redness or swelling, so it's no sign of infection.

352
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,547
I'm gonna keep you on antibiotics for the next ten days.

353
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:00,427
You should be good.

354
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,424
Michael, you understand, by law,

355
00:23:04,504 --> 00:23:07,973
I'm obligated to file a report if I feel there's been prisoner misconduct.

356
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:13,012
There's no way this injury happened by stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

357
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:15,871
If you file a report, things could get a lot worse for me.

358
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:17,496
They're not already?

359
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,446
Not compared to what they could be.

360
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:22,840
I've made some enemies.

361
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:23,908
Yeah.

362
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,621
Scared?

363
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:30,881
Men... Okay.

364
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,015
Um... here's what I think. I think you are scared.

365
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:37,861
And you wouldn't be human if you weren't scared in a place like this.

366
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:42,405
When I was young, I couldn't sleep at night,

367
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,446
'cause I thought there was a monster in the closet.

368
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:50,442
But my brother told me there wasn't anything in the closet but fear.

369
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:52,060
That fear wasn't real.

370
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:57,584
He said it wasn't made of anything. It was just air.

371
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:58,887
Not even that.

372
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,071
He said you just have to face it.

373
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:03,448
You just have to open that door,

374
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,636
and the monster would disappear.

375
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,299
Your brother sounds like a smart man.

376
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:09,714
He is.

377
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,301
In here, though,

378
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:13,832
you face your fear,

379
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:15,973
you open that door...

380
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:18,081
and there's a hundred more doors behind it.

381
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:22,065
And the monsters that are hiding behind them...

382
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,665
are all real.

383
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:27,814
If you want, I could recommend you be sent to Ad-Seg.

384
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,716
With the rape victims and the snitches.

385
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,666
It would keep you safe.

386
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,375
Thanks...

387
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:38,558
but I think I'd like to face the monsters on my own.

388
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:44,901
Have a good smoke?

389
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:46,526
I don't smoke.

390
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,972
Didn't mean to startle you.

391
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:56,337
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

392
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:59,309
We've been informed that you

393
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,742
obtained a copy of the surveillance tape

394
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:04,523
entered as evidence in the Lincoln Burrows trial.

395
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:06,422
Is there a problem with that?

396
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:07,778
We're just following up.

397
00:25:07,901 --> 00:25:10,254
Has there been some amendment to the Freedom of Information Act

398
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,559
that I'm not aware of?

399
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,520
You know, when a prisoner gets

400
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:17,852
close to the end of his time on Death Row,

401
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:19,322
there's a lot of last-minute sec...

402
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:20,712
I'm sorry, I still don't understand

403
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,886
why this would be a problem for the Secret Service.

404
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:23,946
It's not.

405
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:27,229
The prosecution made its case far beyond any reasonable doubt,

406
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:30,850
and we know that we have the right man.

407
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,120
That being said,

408
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:36,476
if you come across anything that could shed some light on his innocence,

409
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:38,824
I'm offering my help.

410
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,533
Sounds great.

411
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,993
I really appreciate you coming by.

412
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,727
Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?

413
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:49,576
Of course.

414
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,493
Don't hesitate to call.

415
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:54,328
Thanks.

416
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:05,676
Leticia.

417
00:26:34,398 --> 00:26:36,863
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry, I...
- Where are you?

418
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:39,109
I'm sor.. this isn't the time, I'm sorry.

419
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,490
This is the time-- I'm at the reception hall.

420
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:44,377
The coordinator's here. The vendors.

421
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:47,976
Look, I'm just, I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.

422
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:09,100
I say we take his whole foot.

423
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,620
We could cut off all his limbs;

424
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,546
he still wouldn't talk.

425
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:17,264
Pain is not the answer here.

426
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:21,505
Maybe the Beatles were right, after all.

427
00:27:22,366 --> 00:27:24,812
Maybe all you need is love.

428
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:29,009
What're you doing?

429
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:30,921
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm rolling it up.

430
00:27:32,372 --> 00:27:33,476
You can't do this.

431
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,568
I'm done playing your reindeer games, Fish.

432
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:38,901
I'm gonna transfer to a nice, quiet cell with a normal cellie,

433
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:41,079
one that doesn't screw my entire life up.

434
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:42,350
Look...

435
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:46,804
I'm sorry about your congugals, but if you go now...

436
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,942
Don't do this. Please.

437
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:53,221
Listen to me, Fish.

438
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:54,886
I got 16 months.

439
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:56,865
I got a fiancée to think about.

440
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:58,857
I get caught with a hole in my wall,

441
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,869
I don't get to see the real world for another five years.

442
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,677
Let's go, Sucre.

443
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,005
I can't do that.

444
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,520
There's always a solution. We can work it out.

445
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:10,082
Sorry, Fish.

446
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:19,283
Can I ask you something?

447
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:24,966
Why have you denied any family or loved ones to be there for you in the end?

448
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,616
Why would I let them watch me die?

449
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:29,527
I've caused them enough pain.

450
00:28:30,364 --> 00:28:32,528
Maybe it's not about them watching you die.

451
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:37,424
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

452
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,109
That the final torture?

453
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:42,975
No. It's about how you want to leave this world.

454
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:46,580
What's the last image you want to take with you?

455
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:47,904
A stranger?

456
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,421
Got an issue with our little friend over there?

457
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:09,176
I don't got to come to you. You don't give the green light.

458
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,987
Everything in here runs through me. You know that.

459
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:16,045
May Tag's in the ground because of that piece of detritus.

460
00:29:16,277 --> 00:29:17,691
So now you want him.

461
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:21,375
Every day for the rest of his bid.

462
00:29:21,687 --> 00:29:24,758
Seems you and I have something in common, then.

463
00:29:35,093 --> 00:29:36,591
Easy now, Fish.

464
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,351
Don't make this any harder than it needs to be.

465
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,189
It's time we came to an arrangement, don't you think?

466
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:58,098
You know, I was thinking I was gonna gut you bow to stern,

467
00:29:58,192 --> 00:29:59,685
soon as I laid eyes on you.

468
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:04,502
But, alackaday, you look so pretty when you're scared, don't you?

469
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:10,114
Maybe we ought to get the love out of the way 'fore we move on to hate.

470
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:12,777
What do you say to that, Pretty? Hmm?

471
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:14,427
Yeah...

472
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:19,764
Maybe it's time I lit up that face once and for all.

473
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:27,406
God, he talks too much.

474
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:31,644
You and I need to have a conversation.

475
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:44,305
What happened in there was my way of saying

476
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:48,376
I know I been going about this whole thing the wrong way.

477
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,246
I'm trying to make amends here.

478
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:55,840
Bygones be bygones?

479
00:30:57,613 --> 00:30:59,524
You're a mercurial man, John.

480
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:01,323
I prefer bold.

481
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:09,175
Tell me what you need from me.

482
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:10,146
A trade.

483
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:13,921
You get me a plane, I'll get you Fibonacci.

484
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:16,587
What do you need a plane for?

485
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,980
I think you know.

486
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,503
I help you, I'm in. You know that, don't you?

487
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,184
I do.

488
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,696
Just got to know the exact date and time.

489
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,059
I'll tell you soon enough.

490
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,263
Soon enough ain't gonna cut it.

491
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,368
I need to be outside these walls before Fibonacci testifies.

492
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,831
You will be.

493
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:36,998
He testifies in one month.

494
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,498
Then you'll be out in plenty of time.

495
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:43,813
If not... you're a corpse.

496
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:49,701
You'd better cut the crap. Tell me the exact date and time,

497
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:51,650
so I can start making the arrangements.

498
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,812
I don't know if I can trust you with that information yet.

499
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:54,529
Why not?

500
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:56,986
Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man.

501
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:08,243
Lewis, take these off.

502
00:32:09,384 --> 00:32:10,985
Sink, I can't do that.

503
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:13,607
Come on, man, I'm in a cage. Ten minutes.

504
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:15,472
Please.

505
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:18,055
It's my kid.

506
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:35,169
So... here we are.

507
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:39,417
Yeah. How you been?

508
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:42,625
You know... in trouble.

509
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,029
How's your mom?

510
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,367
She's good.

511
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:53,380
Hey, um... I've been talking to the chaplain,

512
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:57,225
and they'd like me to decide on who I should, uh, have at the, uh...

513
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,912
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

514
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,970
when you get to the end,

515
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:09,032
you start to realize what's important to you, you know?

516
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,509
Who really matters to you.

517
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:15,212
And, uh, you know...

518
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,070
that leaves you and Mike.

519
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:19,744
The only blood I got left in this...

520
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:21,783
in this world.

521
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:26,131
Yeah, I got to say, I'm not really following what you're saying.

522
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:27,783
Well, uh...

523
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,468
In the end,

524
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,749
the only thing that matters is love.

525
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:40,630
Blood, family... you.

526
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:47,700
Um...

527
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:56,790
Give me your hand.

528
00:33:58,435 --> 00:33:59,974
What are you doing?

529
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:01,937
Give me your hand.

530
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,462
Give me your hand.

531
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:16,811
I want you to be there when...

532
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,959
I want you to be there the day before I die.

533
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,974
So I can see you.

534
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,664
So I can hold you.

535
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:36,282
I, uh...

536
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,992
I love you.

537
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,617
I've always loved you.

538
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,730
Yeah...

539
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:53,817
This whole thing, um...

540
00:34:57,838 --> 00:34:59,205
I don't know if I can take it.

541
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,516
Me, either.

542
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:06,139
I don't have a choice.

543
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:08,612
You do.

544
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,582
I am so sorry.

545
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:38,526
I met with this woman today, and she knew things about Lincoln's case.

546
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,436
And then she just disappeared. I think something happened to her.

547
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,522
Look, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

548
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:48,191
Do you want to get married...

549
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:50,341
or not?

550
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:54,644
I don't know.

551
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,120
Wonderful.

552
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,078
Maybe we could postpone it.

553
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,703
Okay, I can't do this right now. My head's not in it.

554
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,945
It's supposed to be a celebration...

555
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,694
If you're really telling me you want to postpone this thing...

556
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:11,427
...then I want to cancel it.

557
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:18,028
Sebastian...

558
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,496
I'm sorry.

559
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:25,300
I'll come get my stuff tomorrow.

560
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,783
Open on 40!

561
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:04,845
Scofield.

562
00:37:05,226 --> 00:37:06,555
Found you a new cellie.

563
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:09,394
As luck would have it, I found him in the Psych Ward.

564
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:11,352
You were the only guy with an empty tray, so...

565
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:12,775
Psych Ward?

566
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,443
You got a problem with that?

567
00:37:15,263 --> 00:37:17,296
'Cause if you do, please,

568
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,188
feel free to drop it in my suggestion box here.

569
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:30,378
Haywire, get in here!

570
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,033
Close it up on 40!

571
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:45,339
Oh, and Scofield, just a heads up--

572
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:48,313
don't make eye contact with him.

573
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,308
Lincoln, we have a problem.

574
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:19,021
- I got a new cell mate.
- Who?

575
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:22,604
That's a problem.

576
00:38:22,878 --> 00:38:24,745
We're just gonna have to bring him on board.

577
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,707
You're don't bring a guy like that on board.

578
00:38:26,987 --> 00:38:29,230
Then I'll work at night, when he's sleeping.

579
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,794
Ten feet, Scofield.

580
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,919
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

581
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:44,152
Thought you said the margin for error was zero days.

582
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:45,407
I did.

583
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:17,002
Nice out here.

584
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,073
I got a buddy--

585
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,234
he's got a place way back up in these woods.

586
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,473
Come up here hunting around this time of year.

587
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:24,402
Man...

588
00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:27,293
Whoa.

589
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,814
Get her back in. Back in.

590
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:36,118
Come on.

591
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:36,999
Over here. Come here.

592
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,154
Take her out there.

593
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:40,409
She's nothing.

594
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:43,003
Nobody would believe her if she talked, anyway.

595
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:47,137
Hundred yards or so should do it.

596
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:50,404
Do it.

597
00:39:51,403 --> 00:39:52,213
Go!

598
00:40:08,316 --> 00:40:09,418
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,302
You got to believe that.

600
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:14,535
Damn it.

601
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:40,134
Please!

602
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:44,343
Please!

603
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:49,276
Please.

604
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,936
Pick up the casings.

605
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,495
What's your problem?

606
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:57,357
I got a neuroanatomic lesion

607
00:41:57,636 --> 00:42:00,618
affecting my reticular activating system.

608
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:02,345
What does that mean?

609
00:42:02,622 --> 00:42:04,982
It means I don't sleep.

610
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:07,748
At all.

611
00:42:15,045 --> 00:42:18,548
