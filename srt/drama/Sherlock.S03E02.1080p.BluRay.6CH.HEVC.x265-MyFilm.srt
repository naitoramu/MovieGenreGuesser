158
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,646
that I've still got some kind of
interest in Mary?

159
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,051
You've volunteered to be
a shoulder to cry on

160
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,485
on no less than
three separate occasions.

I think from now on we'll downgrade you

I will be monitoring.

They're right about you.
You're a bloody psychopath.

167
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,483
High-functioning sociopath.

168

Yes, um, well done

177
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,330
cute smile to the groom's side

- No.
- And you have to wear the outfit.

- No.
- You really do have to wear the outfit.

- Grownups like that sort of thing.

Yep.

- Sure, loads.

186

- Cool.
- Hmm.

192

He said you had some pictures for him

Traces of two leading

both advertised for their strength.

205
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,011
Suggestive of a chronic

manifesting under stress.

207

Okay, done there.
What about his friend?

208
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,169
Long-term relationship.
Compulsive cheat.

- Seriously?
- Waterproof cover on the smartphone.

Yet his complexion doesn't indicate
outdoor work.

211
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,846
Suggests he's in the habit of taking
his phone into the shower with him,

212
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,446
which means he often receives texts
and emails he'd rather went unseen.

213
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,204
- Can I keep you?
- Do you like solving crimes?

214

Do you have a vacancy?

Darling, I'm so sorry.

Yeah, it was a bit of a punt asking,
I suppose.

218

Still, free bar,
wouldn't have been a good mix.

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,644
Oh. God, wow.

220
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,925
- Is that...
- He came.

221
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,120
So that's him.

222
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,362
- Major Sholto.
- Uh-huh.

223
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,807
If they're such good friends,
why does he barely even mention him?

224
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,008
He mentions him all the time to me.
Never shuts up about him.

225
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,321
- About him?
- Mmm-hmm.

226
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,931
Ugh, I chose this wine.
It's bloody awful.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,525
Yes, but it's definitely him
that he talks about?

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,886
Mmm-hmm.

I'm very, very glad to see you, sir.

230
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,885
I know you don't really
do this sort of thing.

231
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,531
Well, I do for old friends, Watson.

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,204
John.

233
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,930

- You, too.

Er, yes, well, I think so, sir.

236

No more need for the trick cyclist?

237
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,929
No, I go now and then.
Sort of a top-up.

- Exactly.

- So?
- So, he'll have to make a speech

- Sorry, what?
- Billy Kincaid, the Camden Garrotter.

Best man I ever knew.

Vast contributions to charity

Personally managed to save
three hospitals from closure,

and ran the best and safest
children's homes in North England.

Yes, every now and again
there would be some garrottings,

against the garrottings,

- For my wedding.

- Gavin Lestrade.

I confess at first I didn't realise
he was asking me.

409

When finally I understood,

410

I expressed to him that I was
both flattered and surprised.

411
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,968
I explained to him that
I had never expected this request

412
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,849
and I was a little daunted
in the face of it.

414

I nonetheless promised that I would do
my very best to accomplish a task

415

which was, for me,
as demanding and difficult

as any I had ever contemplated.

417
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,128
Additionally, I thanked him
for the trust he placed in me

418
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,965
and indicated that I was, in some ways,

419
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,611
very close to being moved by it.

nothing short of a celebration of

If I burden myself with
a little helpmate during my adventures,

448
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,249
it is not out of sentiment or caprice,

449
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,561
it is that he has many
fine qualities of his own

that he has overlooked
in his obsession with me.

Indeed, any reputation I have
for mental acuity and sharpness

452
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,047
comes in truth from
the extraordinary contrast

John so selflessly provides.

There is a certain
analogy there, I feel.

And contrast is, after all,

So if I didn't understand
I was being asked to be best man,

470
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,050
it is because I never expected to be
anybody's best friend.

471
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,967
And certainly not the best friend

it is the highest compliment
of which I am capable.

Uniform fetishist.
All the nice girls like a soldier.

It's sailor.

And Bainbridge thinks
his stalker is a bloke.

630
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
Let's go and investigate.

- Elite guard.

Forty enlisted men and officers.

633
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,327
Why this particular grenadier? Curious.

- Yeah.

- Your previous commander, Sholto.

- Previous commander?
- I meant ex.

I currently have a commander.

- Which you don't.
- Which I don't.

Of course you don't.

It's standard procedure,

They all died.
He was the only survivor.

675

The press and the families

He got into the shower
and then someone stabbed him.

But the cubicle was locked

A weapon that can vanish.

777
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,802
But in all of this,
there is only one element

Course, there's hours of material here,

- Don't want to get ill.

And then I found out about

One, someone who isn't competitive

Two, someone who isn't constantly trying

Obvious, really.

1193
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,043
Our mayfly man was trying to escape
the suffocating chains of domesticity

1194
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,770
and instead of endless nights
in watching the telly

1195
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,444
or going to barbeques
with the awful, dreadful,

1197
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,121
he used his wits, cleverness
and powers of disguise

1198
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,201
to play the field.

1199
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,281
He was...

1200
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,570
On second thoughts,

1201
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,608
I probably should have told you
about The Elephant in the Room.

1202
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,208
However, it does help
to further illustrate

1203

how invaluable John is to me.

1204
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,806
I can read a crime scene
the way he can understand a human being.

1205

I used to think
that's what made me special.

Quite frankly, I still do.

Out of my head, I am busy!

1251
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,681
There's only one time
that name's been made public.

1252
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,922
<font color="#404040">JOHN:</font> Does it have to be
on the invitation?

1253
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,490
It's your name.

1254
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,609
- It's traditional.
- It's funny.

1255
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,323
<font color="#404040">TESSA:</font><i> Enjoy the wedding.</i>

1256
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,880
Enjoy the wedding.

1257
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,371
The wedding!

1258
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,441
You knew about the wedding.

1259
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,841
More importantly,
you'd seen the wedding invitation.

1260
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,844
Now, barely a hundred people
had seen that invitation.

1261
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,888
The Mayfly Man only saw five women.

1262
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,485
For one person to be in both groups...

1263
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,126
could be a coincidence.

What do we say about coincidence?

01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,610
The universe is rarely so lazy.

1267
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,682
So, the balance of probability is...

1268
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,761
Someone went to great lengths

1269
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,887
to find out something
about this wedding.

1270
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,804
- What great lengths?
- They lied. Assumed false identities.

1271
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,882
- Which suggests?
- Criminal intent.

1272
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,486
- Also suggests...
- Intelligence. Planning.

1273
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,881
Clearly. But more importantly...

1274
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,927
The Mayfly Man.

1275
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,365
The Mayfly Man is...

1276

Ah, yes, raising glasses

Get off early, leave them laughing.

Wise advice I'll certainly
try to bear in mind but for now...

1293
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,322
Part two! Part two is more action-based.

1294
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,722
I'm going to walk around,
shake things up a bit.

01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,160
Who'd go to a wedding?
That's the question.

1296
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,484
Who would bother to go to any lengths
to get themselves to a wedding?

Well, everyone.

1298
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,884
Weddings are great! Love a wedding.

1299

- Something's wrong.

And John's great, too.

1301

I haven't said that enough,
barely scratched the surface.

thing with peas... once.

Might not be peas, might not be him.

1307

But he's got a great singing voice
or somebody does...

1308
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,643
Too many, too many, too many, too many!

1309
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,483
Sorry, too many jokes about John.

1310
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,891

All of which is suggestive of...

- Murder.

Sorry, did I say "murder"?
I meant to say "marriage".

1319
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,884
But, you know, they're...

1320
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,322
quite similar procedures,
when you think about it,

1321
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,610
the participants tend to know each other
and it's over when one of them's dead.

1322
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,489
In fairness,
murder is a lot quicker, though.

Janine, what about this one?
Acceptably hot?

1324
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,967
More importantly, his girlfriend's
wearing brand-new, uncomfortable underwear

1325
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,407
and hasn't bothered to pick
this thread off of the top of his jacket

1326
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,164
or point out the grease smudge
on the back of his neck.

1327
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,925
Currently, he's going home alone.
Also, he's a comics and sci-fi geek,

<font color="#404040">MRS. HUDSON:</font> Sherlock!

1355
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,402
Imagine someone's going to get
murdered at a wedding.

1356
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,720
Who exactly would you pick?

1357
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,928
I think you're a popular choice
at the moment, dear.

1358
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,247
If someone could move Mrs. Hudson's glass
just slightly out of reach,

1359
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,924
that would be lovely.

1360
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,766
More importantly,
who could you only kill at a wedding?

1361
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,290
Most people you can kill any old place.

1362
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,164
As a mental exercise,
I have often planned

1363
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,765
the murder of friends and colleagues.

1364
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,526
Now, John I'd poison.
Sloppy eater, dead easy.

1365
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,126
I've given him chemicals and compounds
that way, he's never even noticed.

1366
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,770
He missed a whole Wednesday once,
didn't have a clue.

1367
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,887
Lestrade's so easy to kill,

1368
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,450
it's a miracle no one's
succumbed to the temptation.

1369
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,726
I've got a pair of keys
to my brother's house,

1370
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,484
I could easily break in there
and asphyxiate him...

1371
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,050
If the whim arose.

1372
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,009
He's pissed, isn't he? Ow!

1373
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,926
So, once again,
who could you only kill here?

1374
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,641
Clearly, it's a rare opportunity,

1375
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,290
so it's someone
who doesn't get out much.

1376
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,045
Someone for whom
a planned social encounter

1377
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,646
known about months in advance
is an exception.

1378
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,802
Has to be a unique opportunity.

1379
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,487
And since killing someone
in public is difficult,

1380
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,449
killing them in private isn't an option.

1381
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,649
Someone who lives in an inaccessible
or unknown location, then.

1382
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,643
Someone private, perhaps,

1383
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,048
obsessed with personal security...

1384
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,923
- <font color="#DF01D7">(BEEPING)</font>
- Possibly someone under threat.

Major James Sholto, who he?

1386
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,769
- I don't think he's coming.
- He'll be there.

1387
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,763
- Where are you living these days?
- Oh,

1388
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,126
way out in the middle of nowhere.

1389
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,290
The press and the family's
giving him hell,

1390
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,600
he gets more death threats than you.

1391
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,685
Oh, a recluse?

1392
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,731
Small household staff.

1393
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,848
- Job?
- Gardener, cook, private nurse, maid.

1394
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,729
High turnover for additional security.

1395
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,801
I do security work.

1396
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,723
Probably all signed
confidentiality agreements.

1397
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,211
Do you have a secret
you've never told anyone?

- There's another question that remains,

1399
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,964
however, rather a big one, a huge one.

1400
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,963
How would you do it?
How do you kill someone in public?

1401

There has to be a way.

1402
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,527
- This has been planned.
- Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes!

1403
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,931
Oh, hello again, Archie.
What's your theory?

1404
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,729
Get this right and there's
a headless nun in it for you.

1405
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,086
The invisible man could do it.

1406

the when, the why, the where?

The invisible man
with the invisible knife,

1408
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,130
the one who tried to kill the guardsman.

1409

Bainbridge? Bainbridge!

1410
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:08,130
Oh, not just planned,
planned and rehearsed.

1411
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,126
Ladies and gentlemen,
there will now be a short interlude.

How can you not remember which room?
You remember everything!

Major Sholto!

If someone's about
to make an attempt on my life,

1429
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,561
it won't be the first time. I'm ready.

You're not safe in there.
Whoever's after you,

we know that a locked room
doesn't stop him.

with the invisible knife?

I don't know how he does it
so I can't stop him

no one's coming to kill you.

I'm afraid you've already been killed
several hours ago.

- What did you say?
- Don't take off your belt.

1466
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,127
My belt?

1467
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,441
His belt, yes.

1468
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,648
Bainbridge was stabbed
hours before we even saw him,

- but it was through his belt.
- <font color="#DF01D7">(CLICKING)</font>

1470
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,964
Tight belt, worn high on the waist.

1471
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,008
Very easy to push a small blade
through the fabric,

1472
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,241
and you wouldn't even feel it.

1473
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,243
The belt would bind the flesh together

1474
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,321
- when it was tight.
- Exactly.

1475
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,368
- And when you took it off...
- Delayed action stabbing.

1476
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,602
All the time in the world
to create an alibi.

So...

1479
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,407
I was to be killed by my uniform.

1480
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,810
How appropriate.

1481
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,849
He solved the case, Major,
you're supposed to open the door now.

1482
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:29,921
A deal is a deal.

1483
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,009
I'm not even supposed
to have this any more.

1484
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,208
They gave me
special dispensation to keep it.

1485
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,002
I couldn't imagine life
out of this uniform,

1486
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,367
I suppose, given the circumstances,
I don't have to.

1487
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,206
When so many want you dead,
it hardly seems good manners to argue.

Whatever you're doing in there, James,
stop it right now.

1489

1551
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,449
<i>An invitation to a wedding.</i>

1552
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,205
<i>The one time Sholto would
have to be out in public.</i>

1553
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,089
<i>So, he made his plan</i>

1554
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,408
<i>and rehearsed the murder,</i>

1555
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,010
<i>making sure of every last detail.</i>

1556
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,444
Brilliant, ruthless
and almost certainly a monomaniac.

1557
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,727
Though, in fairness,
his photographs are actually quite good.

1558
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,326
Everything you need's on that.

1559
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,166
You probably ought to
arrest him or something.

1560
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,568
- Do you always carry handcuffs?
- Down, girl.

1561
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,641
Come on, quick.

1562
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,850
It's not me you should
be arresting, Mr. Holmes.

1563
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,526
Oh, I don't do the arresting,
I just farm that out.

1564
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,602
Sholto, he's the killer, not me.

1565
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,130
I should have killed him quicker.

1566
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,048
I shouldn't have tried to be clever.

1567
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,722
You should have driven faster.

1568
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,481
Right.

just one last thing

before the evening begins properly.

01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,721
Apologies for earlier,
a crisis arose and was dealt with.

1577
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,882
More importantly, however,
today we saw two people make vows.

1578
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,770
I have never made a vow in my life
and after tonight I never will again.

1579
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,289
So, here in front of you all,
my first and last vow.

Mary and John...

Whatever it takes, whatever happens,

1582

from now on, I swear
I will always be there, always,

1583
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,724
for all three of you.

Uh, I'm sorry, I mean two of you.
All two of you.

1585
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,164
Both of you, in fact, I just miscounted.

1586
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,722
Anyway, it's time for dancing.
Play the music again, please. Thank you.

Okay everybody, just dance.
Don't be shy.

Sorry, that was one more deduction
than I was really expecting.

1590
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,529
- Deduction?
- Increased appetite.

1591
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,568
- I'm starving!
- Change of taste perception.

Ugh, I chose this wine.
It's bloody awful!

You were sick this morning.
You assumed it was just wedding nerves.

1594
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,723
You got angry with me
when I mentioned it to you.

All the signs are there.

The signs?

- The signs of three.
- What?

Mary, I think you should
do a pregnancy test.

Don't panic. None of you panic.

Absolutely no reason to panic.

Well, you're hardly going to need
me around
