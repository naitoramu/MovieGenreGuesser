1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000


2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,400
- When? 
- Tomorrow.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,460
I messed up.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,560
- What do you mean? 
- I mentioned Whistler.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,230
So you're Feng.

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,200
- Susan? 
- That's right.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,370
The wall itself is 
fortified with steel fiber.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,370
The bad news is that 
there are both weight

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,030
and microphonic sensors

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,100
that will alert 
Company security

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,200
to the presence of any 
breathing human being

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,930
that weighs more 
than two pounds.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,830
You have a 
hypothalamus hamartoma,

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,570
and the doctor feels 
that you need surgery.

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,730
- Two days. 
- No, tomorrow.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,900
Otherwise, you could die, 
and there's no alternative.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,830
Just a little 
bit more.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,870
Go slow.

19
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,500
No, there's no way he 
deserves any of this.

20
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,970
Sing it, sister.

21
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,070
After what he 
put me through?

22
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,870
I can hardly 
believe it myself.

23
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,370
Look, what we 
must do is

24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,970
make sure that cosmic 
justice rains down upon him,

25
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,800
for once we obtain the 
good General's card,

26
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,900
there ain't hardly 
nothing standing

27
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,400
in between us 
and Mr. Feng's

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,830
$125 million.

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,170
I was born on 
a mountainside.

30
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,230
Just keep both 
hands on the camera.

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,370
Let's go.

32
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,930
That's great.

33
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,300
Thank you so 
much, Dr. Malden.

34
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah, he can see 
you today at 3:00.

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,070
- No. 
- We're going.

36
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,500
We need to finish 
what we started.

37
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,500
We can 
do this.

38
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,430
I need one 
more day.

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,700
Michael, Dr. Malden 
can see you today.

40
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,530
He's given 
us his word

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
he won't alert 
the authorities.

42
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,400
If you put this off 
and you, you collapse,

43
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,130
you're going to be 
treated by another doctor.

44
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,530
Do you want to 
roll the dice

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,230
that they're not going 
to call the cops?

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,870
There's still 
so much to do.

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,030
All right.

48
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,800
Three o'clock?

49
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,370
Last time I drilled 
a hole in the wall,

50
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,300
it was with an eggbeater back 
in Fox River with Michael.

51
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,070
I just can't believe it's 
all coming to an end,

52
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,800
and he's 
not here.

53
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,570
He'll be 
all right.

54
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,400
How do 
you know?

55
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,470
I don't.

56
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,470
I'm just trying to 
keep us focused.

57
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,800
He's sick,

58
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,600
but I guarantee 
you one thing

59
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,600
that'll make 
him worse,

60
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,830
going back 
to jail.

61
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,900
If we don't get in there... 
that's where we're all going.

62
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,170
He's going 
to be okay.

63
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,430
I'm scared, too,

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,800
but a hospital's the best 
place for him right now.

65
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,170
He won't go without a 
plan to complete the job.

66
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,600
Well, Alex and Fernando 
should be back soon

67
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,300
with the video, right?

68
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,670
Should be, yeah.

69
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,170
So, then, all we need 
is the sixth card.

70
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,470
Gretchen's working on that.

71
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,870
You really think 
we can trust her?

72
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,070
With the card?

73
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,530
Absolutely.

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,570
Anything else?

75
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,830
Nope.

76
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,600
Eight guards will accompany 
Scylla from the basement bunker

77
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,100
up to the garage, where an 
armored truck will be waiting.

78
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,700
One truck is not going 
to be enough security.

79
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,570
That is why I have a full 
Secret Service escort

80
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,570
to March Air 
Force Base.

81
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,570
There, it will be 
brought aboard a C-130.

82
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,870
We need air support all 
the way to River Rock.

83
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,500
Colonel Rififi is lending 
us three of his F-18s.

84
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,770
It may be hard 
for you to believe,

85
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,670
but I do have 
this under control.

86
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,200
There's nothing for 
you to worry about.

87
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,700
When the plane lands, the same 
precautions will be taken.

88
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,700
Armored truck

89
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,630
to guards to 
final location.

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,970
That's fine.

91
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,030
Are you going 
somewhere?

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,900
- I have an appointment. 
- Today?

93
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,130
You told me there was 
nothing to worry about.

94
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,430
Just tell me it's 
not Gretchen.

95
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,900
This is 
ridiculous.

96
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a personal 
matter.

97
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm not going 
to discuss it.

98
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,770
I don't 
trust her.

99
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,330
That's 
nothing new.

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,470
I'll be back 
in an hour.

101
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,170
What'd you 
find out?

102
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,400
You'll be awake 
the whole time.

103
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,730
The only anesthetic 
you're going to need is

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,430
4 minor injections 
of local

105
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,400
2 in your forehead and 2
in the back of your head.

106
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,670
And that's for 
the brace?

107
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,270
The frame, 
yeah, and...

108
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,970
attaching that is going to be 
the most uncomfortable part.

109
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,900
They're going to have to 
secure 4 pins into your skull

110
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,930
and they're going to need 
a small drill to do it.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,830
Do we have to 
listen to this?

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,100
I want to hear 
this, Linc.

113
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,030
And then 
what?

114
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,030
Uh, another 
CT scan.

115
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,200
The doctor 
will use

116
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,500
the 3-dimensional 
imagery to pinpoint

117
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,300
the exact location 
of the growth.

118
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,600
And once you 
have that?

119
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,270
Then it's the 
Gamma Knife unit.

120
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,100
They'll fit you 
with a helmet,

121
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,930
they'll calibrate it so 
that each of the 201 holes

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,830
are aimed directly for the 
tumor, and at that point...

123
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,800
I've got two more 
boxes in the car

124
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,000
that you guys got to 
bring in yourself.

125
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,670
All right.

126
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,930
You okay?

127
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,030
- Because the last time I saw you... 
- Yeah, I'm fine.

128
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,870
I was just a 
little dehydrated.

129
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,430
All right, good.

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
This is the stuff 
you requested.

131
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,530
You sure this is 
gonna get you in?

132
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,130
Let us worry 
about getting in.

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,570
You worry about how 
we're getting out.

134
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,230
I got someone keeping an 
eye on Gretchen and Bagwell.

135
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,400
If they try anything, 
they're getting taken out.

136
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,730
Nothing is going to get 
between us and Scylla.

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,970
You sure you're 
all right?

138
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,700
Yeah, it's just, uh,

139
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,900
you know, we're breaking 
into Company headquarters,

140
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,370
and, uh, you'll understand why 
we're all a little on edge.

141
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,800
Understood.

142
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,000
You know, I 
was thinking,

143
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,730
when your father approached 
me about doing this,

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,130
I felt like 
I was, uh,

145
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,030
chasing a ghost 
or something, but...

146
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,830
'cause of the work 
you guys have done,

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,470
today is the day, we are 
taking these bastards down

148
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,900
You get it?

149
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,040
Got it.

150
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,900
We got 
four hours.

151
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,200
How come?

152
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,670
I'm going in 
for treatment.

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,500
Here 
we go.

154
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,770
Scylla.

155
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,070
Obviously, we've got 
a lot to figure out.

156
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,800
We have to break 
through two walls..

157
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,200
one concrete, 
one glass..

158
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,800
and do it without 
making a sound.

159
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,240
Hypersensitive 
parabolic microphones,

160
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,800
pointed in 
all directions.

161
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,840
The floor sensors 
can detect

162
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,270
an added surface load 
of just two pounds.

163
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,570
So...

164
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,840
we have to traverse the 
distance between the two walls

165
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,240
without touching 
the floor

166
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,870
and do all that without 
generating any kind

167
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,240
of body heat 
whatsoever.

168
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,570
These are the latest in 
heat-sensing technology.

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,600
We make one 
wrong move,

170
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,400
the camera goes on, and General 
Krantz will know we're inside.

171
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,840
It's amazing.

172
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,000
All this security 
and only one man

173
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,440
has access to 
video surveillance?

174
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,600
The Company doesn't 
want any record

175
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,840
of what's going 
on down there.

176
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,370
Can we access 
that elevator?

177
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,600
No, it's right 
in the middle

178
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,040
of the Company building.. 
there are ten layers

179
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,600
of security. We have 
to go where they're

180
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,200
not expecting us,

181
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,270
starting with 
the concrete wall.

182
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,670
Sucre, you were 
drilling there, right?

183
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,540
It's fortified with steel 
fibers, just like you said.

184
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,770
All right, in 
order to get

185
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,100
through that, we 
have to generate

186
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,670
an electromagnetic field...

187
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,900
We have to generate an 
electromagnetic field...

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,640
To have, uh,

189
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,370
an electromagnetic field

190
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
with the force that we 
want, we're going to need

191
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,570
at least a couple 
of car batteries.

192
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,700
Can you 
get that?

193
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,470
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,140
We can 
do this.

195
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,540
Uh, what time are we 
expecting Gretchen

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,140
to get that 
sixth card?

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What took 
you so long?

198
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,970
You know how I get 
when I'm hungry.

199
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,840
It wasn't easy getting 
away from the office.

200
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,500
I could have 
come to you...

201
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,570
like old times.

202
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,970
I almost wish there was 
a mahogany desk in here.

203
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,070
Oh... 
you're tense.

204
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,640
Take off 
this jacket.

205
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,770
Let me get 
in there.

206
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,640
I didn't bring 
it with me.

207
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,040
My card.

208
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,700
That is what you're 
looking for, right?

209
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,570
What are you talking 
about? Your card.

210
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,870
You forget.

211
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm the one that 
taught you how to lie.

212
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,100
I never thought that 
at the age of 63,

213
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,700
I could still have 
my heart broken.

214
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,170
Why did you feel you 
needed to steal my card?

215
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,100
Don't you know that if you'd 
waited just a little bit longer,

216
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,840
you'd have had 
one of your own?

217
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm sorry. 
I'm...

218
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,570
Who are you 
selling it to?

219
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,740
That's-that's 
not why...

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,470
Who?

221
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,970
I'm the mother 
of your child.

222
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,140
Please, for 
Emily's sake.

223
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,700
Please, 
Jonathan.

224
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,500
Please.

225
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,400
I love you.

226
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,400
If I ever see 
you again...

227
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,870
I'll shoot 
you on sight.

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,440
Is everything 
all right, Cole?

229
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,170
I got something 
important you need to know.

230
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,500
We're gonna 
be rich.

231
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,500
So, here's 
the question.

232
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,770
How much is it 
gonna cost me

233
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,640
to get that 
jacket off you?

234
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,070
Excuse me?

235
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,900
Last day I'm ever 
gonna see you.

236
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,770
You're all 
covered up.

237
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,570
I cannot 
abide. $100.

238
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,900
You want to pay me to 
take my clothes off?

239
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,770
Not all of them. 
Just the jacket.

240
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,440
- $200. 
- I'm not gonna strip for you.

241
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,640
Pity on 
an old man.

242
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,070
You're 
disgusting.

243
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,600
And lecherous 
and vile.

244
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,840
And soon to be 
wealthy beyond belief.

245
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,300
$1000

246
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,600
Why so modest 
all of a sudden?

247
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,200
Cole, I need to see 
you in my office, now.

248
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,940
Thank you for calling 
GATE. How can I help you?

249
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,370
It was Mr. White in his 
office with the lead stapler.

250
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,700
Cole, yesterday with 
that Idaho Group,

251
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,840
you made this 
company $35,000.

252
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,900
And I would like to 
return the favor.

253
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,000
It's our 
annual cruise.

254
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,140
7 days and 6 nights 
of non-stop pitching.

255
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,100
I personally clear 
$50,000 on most trips,

256
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,870
but for everything 
you've done,

257
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,470
it's all 
yours.

258
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,940
The least 
I could do.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,600
It leaves 
today?

260
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,970
Go home 
and pack.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll see you 
in a week.

262
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,770
Unfortunately, I 
have some business

263
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,870
I need to take 
care of right here.

264
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,670
Okay, so here's 
how it works.

265
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,100
As soon as the sensors pick 
up any kind of a heat source

266
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,370
90 degrees or more, 
system goes into standby,

267
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,670
a yellow light 
comes on.

268
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,040
After 5 seconds 
in standby,

269
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,570
if the heat source isn't 
gone, we have an alarm.

270
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,270
So we got 6 seconds to 
make it across the hallway

271
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,500
and through 
the glass wall?

272
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,070
Basically.

273
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,440
If we get our hands on 
some liquid nitrogen,

274
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,970
we could regulate 
the temperature.

275
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,340
Yeah.

276
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Kill two birds 
with one stone.

277
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,440
See if you can 
get some of that.

278
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,240
Hey.

279
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,670
Hey.

280
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm not going to ask 
how you're feeling.

281
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,770
Good.

282
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,900
About 4 years after 
I joined the Bureau,

283
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,640
my first Special 
Agent in charge..

284
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,170
he was diagnosed 
with liver cancer.

285
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
But for him,

286
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,570
the hardest part 
wasn't the treatment.

287
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,400
The hardest part was 
leaving the office,

288
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,000
because we had this... 
we had this big RICO case

289
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,000
that was about 
to go to trial,

290
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,600
and we're talking 
thousands

291
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,970
of man hours, 5 
years of research.

292
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,340
And the guy was 
going to be in chemo.

293
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,200
And he was scared.

294
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,440
He was scared that we 
were gonna lose the case,

295
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,040
and that a lot of bad 
men were gonna walk.

296
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,600
Let me guess: He had a 
ragtag band of criminals

297
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,440
ready to pick 
up the slack.

298
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,940
It was something 
like that.

299
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,500
We're not going to 
let you down, Michael.

300
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
What happened 
to your boss?

301
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,170
Oh, he was there 
to see us win.

302
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,000
You're sure 
she's a Fed?

303
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,470
Wouldn't take off her 
jacket for a $1000.

304
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,040
She's got a 
gun under there.

305
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,270
It's a 
complication.

306
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,370
Well, that's a 
nice way to put it.

307
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,270
Sort of like you not 
getting the sixth card.

308
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,970
What are we calling 
that now, a setback?

309
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,540
Relax.

310
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,870
You have any idea what 
I'm giving up here?

311
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,500
I was guaranteed 
50 grand.

312
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,500
You're crying over 
$50,000? Are you serious?

313
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,000
I have 
a job.

314
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,670
I make money. 
I get mail.

315
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,100
People call 
me 'Sir'

316
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,400
Working 12-hour days and 
eating leftover Lo-Mein.

317
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,100
Something tells me 
Theodore Bagwell

318
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,740
wouldn't last long 
in this situation.

319
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,740
Yeah, maybe,

320
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,870
but Cole 
Pfeiffer would.

321
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,540
You want to pout, 
you do it tomorrow.

322
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,570
We have 
work to do.

323
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,440
Is it really worth 
$125 million?

324
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,940
It's worth 
twice as much.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,040
What if they refuse 
to hand it over?

326
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,440
Either we pay for Scylla, 
or we kill for it.

327
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,900
Feng, we 
need to talk.

328
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,370
Hey, give me a second h
ere, guys, just a second.

329
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,370
We can't make any 
noise above 10 decibels.

330
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,500
You got two 
of those?

331
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,040
Absolutely.

332
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,740
This is gonna 
work, right?

333
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,400
It should.

334
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,440
No, not 
just that.

335
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,070
The whole thing.

336
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,240
I mean, do we 
even have a chance?

337
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,900
Just make sure the hole 
is in the right place.

338
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,870
So, where 
are we?

339
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,540
Gretchen didn't get 
us the sixth card.

340
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,340
We need that 
sixth card, Don.

341
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,000
I know.

342
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,500
If we don't get the sixth card, 
we're never gonna crack Scylla.

343
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,640
I know it.

344
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,340
Well, we know they're 
moving Scylla today.

345
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,570
We know we can't just waltz 
into the General's office

346
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,740
and steal that 
last card,

347
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,970
so where does 
that leave us?

348
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,400
There's got to be a way.
There has to be a way

349
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,500
Not without losing 
another man.

350
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,700
Believe me, I spent the last 
week trying to figure out

351
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,700
how to get that sixth card, 
and every scenario ends

352
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,940
with a gun to someone's head, 
and that is not acceptable.

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,700
You know, Gretchen did 
pass on this one piece

354
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,340
of information 
for you.

355
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,370
This could 
be helpful.

356
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,540
The buyer just 
showed up.

357
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,970
All right, well, find 
out what they're up to.

358
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,570
Mr. Feng, so glad you 
could come and see us.

359
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,140
I was expecting 
the next time

360
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,000
the three of us would be 
in the same room together,

361
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,900
that you'd have 
something for me.

362
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,540
That was our 
expectation as well,

363
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,200
but we've hit a few 
bumps in the road.

364
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,500
Now, to ensure 
the item's

365
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,540
safe recovery, 
we need your help.

366
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,640
It's time 
to go.

367
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,840
"All that 
avails is flight."

368
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,300
Maybe my father 
was onto something.

369
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,300
If they 
all die

370
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,470
because we tried to 
take down The Company,

371
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,570
and I survive 
because...

372
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,700
because I called 
in sick...

373
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,970
how am I gonna 
live with myself?

374
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,440
You're gonna get 
through this.

375
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm not going 
to the hospital.

376
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,870
What?

377
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,500
Linc, just 
get in the car.

378
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm going 
with you.

379
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,500
If I still had a 
medical license,

380
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,540
I'd lose it 
over this.

381
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,000
This is usually 
given to epileptics.

382
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,340
It will suppress the 
rapid firing of neurons

383
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,140
for the next 
three hours,

384
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,640
making it 
unlikely

385
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,800
that you'll have a 
seizure in that time,

386
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,700
but Michael, any added 
mental or physical stress...

387
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,770
I get it.

388
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,100
I mean it.

389
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,870
I don't want you to move 
unless you absolutely have to.

390
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,270
And as soon as this is over, 
I'm taking you to the hospital.

391
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,300
Hey.

392
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,340
You all right?

393
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,040
This is gonna go 
exactly as planned.

394
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,140
I promise.

395
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,940
I'm not 
praying for me.

396
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,400
Let's go.

397
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,470
You wanted 
to see me?

398
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,600
It's the second 
Tuesday of the month.

399
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,940
Don't you have your 
Eagles and Angels luncheon?

400
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,940
I figured I'd 
skip it today.

401
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,640
You called me in here to 
confirm my lunch plans?

402
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,070
You were right.

403
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,640
If it weren't for you, 
this would be in the wind.

404
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,640
- Is she dead? 
- Let's just say

405
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,300
she won't bother 
either of us anymore.

406
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,340
But I do want Scylla 
moved right now.

407
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,800
Our mechanics are on the 
tarmac inspecting the C-130.

408
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,140
When they sign off, 
we'll be ready to move.

409
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,100
Call the other card 
holders, get them in here.

410
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,170
Did, uh, Self call 
you, uh, regarding

411
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,400
a little snafu 
with the General?

412
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,840
Get out 
of my way.

413
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,500
Just for uh, 
clarification's sake,

414
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,600
the sixth card is part of the 
to-do list, right gentlemen?

415
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,340
The game's 
afoot.

416
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,540
Does Michael have a 
way to get the card?

417
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,340
I've worked with 
Michael Scofield before,

418
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,540
both with him 
and against him.

419
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,840
There's no way he's 
going down there

420
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,140
without a plan 
to finish the job.

421
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,500
I got a call from 
an old friend.

422
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,670
Heard Scylla 
was in play.

423
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,070
He wants to know if 
he can get in on it.

424
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,070
A bidding war?

425
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,670
He's prepared 
to offer 200.

426
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,840
Is he 
for real?

427
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,200
I don't know. I've 
set up a safe house

428
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,240
where we can hear him 
out. Do you have a pen?

429
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,200
Just a 
minute.

430
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,870
1917 Piermont.

431
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,040
1..9..1..7

432
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,470
Piermont,
got it.

433
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,770
I'm on 
my way.

434
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,100
Uh, good 
afternoon.

435
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,600
Thank you for 
calling GATE.

436
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,370
I got some last 
minute negotiations

437
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
with the buyer 
to speak about.

438
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,540
I'll be back 
lickety-split.

439
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,800
See you 
later.

440
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,100
Can you hold, 
please?

441
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,800
All right.

442
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,600
This is it.

443
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,840
Now, does anyone 
have any questions

444
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,640
about what they're 
supposed to do?

445
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,240
That hole you drilled 
in the wall this morning,

446
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,440
once we get over there, 
if we make too much noise,

447
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,400
the sound waves will 
travel through the wall

448
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,140
and get picked up by the 
sensors on the other side.

449
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,800
So, from this point on, 
we need absolute silence.

450
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,170
Alex, 
good luck.

451
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,840
You, too.

452
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,500
Ready?

453
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,340
We have to break 
through two walls..

454
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,670
one concrete, 
one glass..

455
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,000
and do it without 
making a sound.

456
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,370
In order to get 
through that,

457
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,500
we have to generate an 
electromagnetic field.

458
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,640
To have

459
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,600
an electromagnetic 
field with the force

460
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,900
that we want, 
we're gonna need

461
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,440
at least a couple 
of car batteries.

462
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,870
starting  with 
the concrete wall.

463
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,540
Sucre, you were 
drilling there, right?

464
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,300
It's fortified with steel 
fibers, just like you said.

465
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,930
You sure 
this is it?

466
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,930
1917 Piermont 
Avenue.

467
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,300
Okay.

468
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,400
When was the last 
time you swept a room?

469
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,100
The Academy.

470
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,100
All right, just 
follow my lead, okay?

471
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,730
Because Gretchen and Bagwell 
have no respect for human life.

472
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,130
- Okay? They go for a weapon, you shoot.  
- Okay.

473
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,700
They try to 
run, you shoot.

474
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,830
If they do anything than 
kneel down and put their hands

475
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,930
- behind their heads... 
- I shoot.

476
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,260
Don't miss.

477
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,900
Agent Self.

478
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,330
We've been 
waiting.

479
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,900
That's Feng. 
He's got them.

480
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,500
When Scofield and Burrows 
walk through the door,

481
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,060
give them an 
opportunity to surrender.

482
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,630
If we can avoid confrontation, 
that's the best case scenario.

483
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,860
There's no way they're gonna 
hand it over without a fight.

484
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,500
If they take that position, 
we'll respond in kind.

485
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,630
$125 million.

486
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,530
Only cherry that could 
top this sunny day.

487
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,030
You can keep your Burrows 
and your Mahone and your Sucre.

488
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,030
Just leave 
Scofield for me.

489
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,100
We got a green 
light on the C130.

490
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,030
It's time.

491
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,600
Thank you.

492
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,960
Oren, Tuxhorn and 
Edison are standing by.

493
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,800
Scuderi was 
in Las Vegas.

494
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,760
You think we could get 
the state of Nevada

495
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,100
to outlaw 
gambling?

496
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,600
I somehow 
doubt that.

497
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,600
His plane will touch 
down within about an hour.

498
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,760
Then you can make 
your luncheon.

499
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,800
I would 
rather stay.

500
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,360
Now more 
than ever,

501
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,100
we need the support 
of law enforcement.

502
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,830
I will 
call you

503
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,760
- when we're ready to move. 
- General, I...

504
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,560
There's nothing more 
for you to worry about.

505
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,260
Lisa?

506
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,330
Very good work.

507
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,890
I need to go 
downstairs, now!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
