1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
You know you got a couple of foxes in your henhouse, right?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,900
They both want out of here.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,100
They'll behave until then.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Look, this is it, man.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,700
Ain't no do-overs this time.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,700
We break out tonight,

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,400
or we ain't never getting out.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
Brains of the outfit,huh, scofield?

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,800
He's leading you off a cliff, boys.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,500
And you acting like you still in charge.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,700
Pretend I ain't here.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,900
Yeah, you and the radio.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,700
The thing I can't quite figure is,

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,600
with a crap storm this thing's become,

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700
why they haven't killed you.

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,300
We have an employee who's not working out.

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,700
We fire her.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
It needs to be that simple.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,900
She's the vice president of the united states.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
That's all she'll ever be, jim.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,600
What's going on?

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Get to blackfoot,you find steadman.

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,500
Just-just give me a chance.

24
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,500
no!

25
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,600
Where's the lawyer?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,700
We're through.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,800
hey, hey, hey, hey.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,600
You okay, old head?

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,400
No.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,300
Oh, god...

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,900
sound the alarm.

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,900
Come on, michael!

33
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,100
Sound the alarm!

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,000
Come on!

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,200
Come on!

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,800
Michael, come on, move it!

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,500
grab my hand!

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,100
Grab my hand...

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Don't shoot!

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,100
Don't shoot!

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,700
We got a 10-98!

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,700
Inmates over the wall!

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Who was with you?!

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,900
Nobody!

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
- Nobody, huh?
- No.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,300
Talk or I swear to god,

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,300
I will snap your neck right here!

48
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,400
I don't know!

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,300
names,i want to names

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
scofield...

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,300
burrows, sucre.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,700
And that vanilla ice kid.

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,800
Who else?!

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
bagwell, man.

55
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
C-note.

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,600
Abruzzi.

57
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,300
And that bug-eyed j-cat.

58
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,900
Was there anybody else?

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,100
Was there anybody else?!

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
Westmoreland.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,900
We got inmates over the wall!

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,400
How many?

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,000
Eight.

64
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,200
Warden?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,900
They just found bellick.

66
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,900
Get my shotgun.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,800
Pope's already given orders for all the co'S...

68
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,000
did I stutter?

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,300
Get me my shotgun!

70
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,600
Those piles of crap,

71
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,900
doing what they just did,

72
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,500
they just signed their death warrant.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Every last one of them.

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,700
When those men went over the wall,

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,900
they made a choice.

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,200
That choice makes them a threat to society once again.

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Now as many of you know,

78
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,300
some of those men are convicted killers.

79
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,400
Now, our job is to protect

80
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,300
and ensure the safety of the general population.

81
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,900
That means if we have to bring them down to ensure that safety,

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,700
by God we will do it!

83
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,700
This time we're playing for keeps, gentlemen.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Now it's been at least 12 minutes

85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
since they went over that wall.

86
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,400
That's one mile on foot at best.

87
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,000
If they got their hands on a vehicle,

88
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,800
they could be ten miles from here.

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,500
So let's get moving!

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,500
Yo, come on, man,

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
we got to roll.

92
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,500
We don't got to do anything but wait right here.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Let them get ahead of us.

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,100
I don't know if we're gonna get a chance, papi.

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,700
Dogs. Son of a bitch.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,100
They're coming right for us.

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Nobody move.

98
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
They can't smell us.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
but they can see us.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Prison Break
Season 01 Episode 22

101
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,500
hey..... Can't get to the phone.

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,300
Leave a message after the beep.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,300
Hey, nick, it's me.

104
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,700
Look, I just landed in montana.

105
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
I'm about an hour outside of blackfoot.

106
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,800
And this house,

107
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
it's got something to do with terrence steadman's murder,

108
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,600
I know it.

109
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,900
If whatever's here can help free lincoln,

110
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
then I wanted to say thank you.

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,500
soft money makes the world go around.

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
You know it, and I know it.

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
You cut my funding

114
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,000
and I can't run a proper campaign without it.

115
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,400
There was a lot of internal debate, trust me.

116
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,200
And there's every chance you can still win with your message,

117
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,500
- and it would certainly be our loss...
- oh, cut the crap.

118
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Is there anything else you want to tell me,

119
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,200
or did you just come here to twist the knife you stuck in my back?

120
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,100
Well, actually,

121
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,700
I came here to express our gratitude

122
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
for all that you've done for us over the years.

123
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,100
And to let you know that this isn't personal.

124
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,000
- Surely you've been in politics long enough to know that.
- Look,

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,000
is this about the energy bill?

126
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,300
The energy bill has nothing to do with it.

127
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,500
Why am I finding that so tough to believe?

128
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm a grown woman.

129
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
How about you give it to me straight?

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,700
All right.

131
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,300
All right.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,100
The bottom line,

133
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
madam vice president,

134
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,700
is that you can't affect change in the oval office.

135
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,300
And that is what we need the most:

136
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,300
Certitude.

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Simply put...

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,700
you can't get things done.

139
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Well, maybe you don't know me so well.

140
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,600
I highly suggest that in the coming weeks,

141
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,700
as the race narrows and the candidates start falling out...

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,900
that you walk away,

143
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,000
quietly,

144
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,400
of your own volition.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Otherwise,maybe it'll be...

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,600
of the company's volition.

147
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,600
Ah!

148
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
Hey, hey, take the suit off.

149
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,000
You're practically glowing in the dark.

150
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
- I only got my skivvies on underneath.
- Take the suit off!

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,900
I'll freeze to death!

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,500
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Hurry up.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
- We got to do something about that freak.
- You got it.

154
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,300
- Now, come on.
- Come on, hurry up.

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,900
Where the hell is the van?

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
Eye-tie, where in the hell is the van?

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Ye of little faith.

158
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,500
Come on, come on.

159
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Watch out.There, I told you.

160
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,300
Behind the wheel,cro-magnon.

161
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,300
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

162
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,600
what the hell you doing?

163
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,500
I'm getting us invisible.

164
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
john, where are the keys?

165
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
- What?
- The keys,where are they?

166
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,800
I told you, in the garbage can by the trees in a plastic bag.

167
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,600
What are you waiting for?

168
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Come on, come on.

169
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,500
no, no, no, no!

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
No!

171
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
We got the on-ramps to 55 and 80 being monitored.

172
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,800
We've got traffic checks on 171, 6 and 53.

173
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Special services has secured a watch on passenger lists at o'hare and midway.

174
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,600
How are we doing with the wiretaps?

175
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,400
They're being set up on all the family members of the escapees as we speak.

176
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,200
Surveillance teams are being established outside the residences as well.

177
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,800
Thank you.

178
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,800
What do you got?

179
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,600
Door wasn't forced.

180
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,100
Lock wasn't picked.

181
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,100
As far as I can tell,

182
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,600
they basically just walked right in.

183
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,700
I don't see how that's possible.

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,000
These doors are locked down every night when we leave.

185
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,300
It's priority number one.

186
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,100
Only thing I can think is...

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,500
what?

188
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,600
Someone left it open for them.

189
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,100
Hey, john,I've got to ask you

190
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,600
why you were so intent on lincoln driving

191
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,100
and you taking that particular seat?

192
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,000
What is it exactly you got up underneath there, huh?

193
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,500
What the hell are you doing?

194
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
You think that's gonna stop me, huh?

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,900
Think twice,johnny boy, hmm.

196
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,100
You shoot me,

197
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,600
pretty here will be dragging around 170 pounds of dead alabama flesh with him.

198
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,300
And considering

199
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,700
how much you need him to complete this little fibonacci vendetta of yours...

200
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,700
so I just don't think you're gonna be pulling that trigger.

201
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,900
No.

202
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,700
Are you gonna give me the key 
of those cops T-Bag?

203
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
you son of a bitch.

204
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
Get it, get it.Get it.

205
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,200
You looking for this?

206
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,000
Come on.

207
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,200
- Spit it out!
- Spit it out!

208
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Come on.

209
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,700
They drink this,

210
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
it's only a matter of minutes.

211
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,400
This glycoside saxitoxin hybrid goes to work in the blood stream instantly.

212
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Five minutes is the outside limit even the strongest cardiac muscles can continue to function.

213
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,900
After that--

214
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,900
massive cardiac arrest with no chance of survival.

215
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,400
What about toxicology tests?

216
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,900
Well, they'll reveal nothing.

217
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Death will appear to be from natural causes.

218
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,600
This is high treason,

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you know that don't you?

220
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,800
It's fresh, boss.

221
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,700
From tonight?

222
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,300
Can't be more than an hour old.

223
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,300
Dogs get the scent?

224
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,500
Already have.

225
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Hey, boss, check this out.

226
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,800
Captain...

227
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,000
this guy lives up the road.

228
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,100
Works on the property during the day.

229
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,600
You see a vehicle parked here?

230
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,300
I think so, yeah.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,800
What did it look like?

232
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,400
Uh, like a van.

233
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,600
A blue van.

234
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,200
You didn't think to report it to the authorities?

235
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,900
A parked car?

236
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,500
If you think I won't gut you
myself to get that key,

237
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,200
you're in for a big surprise.

238
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,500
I encourage you to remember the last
time you came at me with a knife.

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,400
Shut up!

240
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Shut up!

241
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,200
Both of you!

242
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
You can settle this in mexico.

243
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,700
How far to the airstrip?

244
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,500
Five miles, maybe.

245
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,000
your jet better be there, mr. Mafia.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,300
You feel me?

247
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,900
It better be there.

248
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Canine unit being deployed.Over.

249
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,900
Roger that.

250
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,400
Push past the search perimeter
before we can pick up track. Over.

251
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,100
They're everywhere out there.

252
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,900
Tell me something I don't know.

253
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,000
You're saying you don't know
anything about this?

254
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,700
Honestly, I don'T.

255
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,400
The door was left open, katie.

256
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
It wasn't me.

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Then who was it?

258
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,700
Only you and dr. Tancredi were left
at the end of the night.

259
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,000
The orderly confirmed that.

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
It wasn't me.

261
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Then you're telling me it was dr. Tancredi?

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,900
No.

263
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,900
I know you know something, katie.

264
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,800
And anything you know,

265
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,900
you have got to tell me.

266
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,400
If you don't,

267
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,500
you are going to lose a lot
more than your job.

268
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,600
Withholding information makes
you an accessory.

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,500
And I will press that button
if you don't start talking!

270
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,300
Sara.

271
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
What about sara?

272
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,500
Sara had a thing for scofield.

273
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,900
Thank you, katie.

274
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,500
All I want to do is touch her belly,

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,700
feel that he's in there.

276
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,800
After that,

277
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,000
whatever I got to do,

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,700
I'll figure it out.

279
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,300
I just want to touch her belly.

280
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,500
We're close, papi.

281
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,900
We got trouble.

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,100
Yo, dawg, man, this is bananas.

283
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,500
We got to get off this road.

284
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Any other way to the airstrip?

285
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,400
This is the only road.

286
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,800
Let's just run this bitch.

287
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,100
Somebody shut him up,

288
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,300
or I will.

289
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,000
Can we go back?

290
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,300
That won't do us any good.

291
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
It'll only get us farther from
where we need to be.

292
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Which means we got to bust that roadblock.

293
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Maybe not.

294
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,900
We've got to try and go around.

295
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Come on.

296
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,300
We're gonna get that key from you.

297
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't care if you got to crap it out.

298
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,700
You got a foul mouth sometimes, pretty.

299
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,500
What?

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,700
Son of a bitch, we're stuck!

301
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,500
Everybody out.

302
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,800
Listen to the speech tonight?

303
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,800
Need some id.

304
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
Secret service.

305
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,900
Have at it.

306
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,500
Come on!

307
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,300
this thing ain't going nowhere!

308
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,400
How far is the air strip?

309
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,300
On foot?

310
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,200
Maybe two miles.

311
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
What the hell are we waiting for?

312
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,100
Let's move.

313
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,400
Three-legged race over here ain't
going to make it ten feet.

314
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,700
We'll manage, won't we?

315
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,100
Sure, pretty.

316
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,200
We're teammates.

317
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Teammates till the end.

318
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,100
Let's get out of here!

319
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Let's go!

320
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,900
go

321
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Let's go.

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,700
This is as far as you go, my friend.

323
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,900
What?

324
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
No, man, you can't leave me out here,
not like this.

325
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,300
We had a deal, remember?

326
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
but come on, bro.

327
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,100
You and I,

328
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,700
we're not bros.

329
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,900
I don't think you want me
telling the guys what I know.

330
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,900
Now walk.

331
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
we got trouble, pretty.

332
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,500
We got more than that.

333
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,200
Go! Go!

334
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,300
Come on!

335
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
Oh my God!

336
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,700
Oh, come on!

337
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,000
And now what?

338
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,800
What do we do now Michael?

339
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,300
I don앖 believe this

340
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,700
What now?

341
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,900
<I>It압 clear. I앐 gonna pop back</I>

342
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
It압 coming back y아ll!
It압 coming back!

343
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,300
Make yourself small.

344
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,500
There's no way we are gonna
make two miles like this.

345
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,300
Especially with that bird up there.

346
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,300
We are if I got something to do with it.

347
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,500
excuse me.

348
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,900
What can I do for you?

349
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,800
Sort of was going to ask you
the same question.

350
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,300
I run the tower during the day.

351
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
There's no traffic allowed here
after sundown.

352
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
Had some mechanical problems.

353
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
Need me to take a look at anything?

354
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,900
No, no, we got it.

355
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,600
Don't trouble yourself.

356
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
We'll be on our way in no time.

357
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,200
You sure?

358
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,500
Positive.

359
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,100
Okay.

360
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,500
Have a good night,hey, buddy?

361
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
you, too.

362
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,900
Those guys better hurry up.

363
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,900
it's me.

364
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,200
I've got an unidentified aircraft
here at goose park.

365
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Think you better have a look at it.

366
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,300
Tail number's 986-delta.

367
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Hurry it up.

368
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
linkie,

369
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,900
just let papi work a
little bit of his magic, okay?

370
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,200
You know what you're doing?

371
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,300
Are you kidding me?

372
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,800
Hot-wiring this thing is like
hot-wiring a toaster.

373
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
Now, if it were to be an acura,

374
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
or one of those chinese cars,

375
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
that's a whole different story.

376
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Electronic ignition,

377
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,800
computer chips,forget about it.

378
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,900
But no, we're good.

379
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,900
that chopper's gonna be
coming back again,so hurry up.

380
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,800
What they got in mexico, anyhow?

381
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,300
You never been there?

382
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,900
Ain't never been nowhere except for iraq,

383
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,900
chi-town and fox river.

384
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
What you looking at?

385
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,900
Look, man...

386
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,500
is it a place where you can
have a family?

387
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,600
Lots of families down there,

388
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,700
so I hear.

389
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,900
Man, you know what I'm talking about.

390
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
For a black man,

391
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,200
an american man with a family.

392
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,700
So that's the plan,?

393
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,500
They're going to meet you down in mexico?

394
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,100
it's worse to not see them.

395
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
And I can't do that no more.

396
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,800
Not much of a life for them.

397
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,500
But it'll be a life.

398
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,500
More than what me and them have been
having for the last two years, man.

399
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,900
They're family, snowflake.

400
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,900
Ain't no way in hell I'm leaving
them behind.

401
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,900
We're good.

402
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,600
I must have done this a thousand times.

403
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Man, I thought you got busted
for armed robbery.

404
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,700
that's what they caught me for.

405
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,600
Red's the juice,

406
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,000
white is the ground.

407
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Strike them together

408
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,800
and we blow this town.

409
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
What?

410
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,400
What?

411
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,700
I don't get it.

412
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,100
Great!

413
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
That's just great ...

414
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,300
Okay.

415
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,500
Sorry.

416
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
engine's still warm,

417
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,400
and I don't see any other tire
tracks out here.

418
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,700
They're on foot,

419
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,900
and judging by how hot this engine is,

420
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,200
they haven't gone far.

421
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,300
Five, ten minutes ahead of us,
at the most.

422
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,200
Where are you?

423
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,400
Renwick road?

424
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,100
A quarter mile west of weber on renwick.

425
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,500
Okay, we've got renwick on the south,

426
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,200
weber on the east,

427
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,800
143rd street on the north

428
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,000
and 55 on the west.

429
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Units are in place along all those roads.

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,700
And I've got a dozen more coming.

431
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,800
Brad, this could be over quicker
than we thought.

432
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,700
We've got 'em boxed in.

433
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,800
Sir, we've got an update on dr. Tancredi.

434
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
Tell me.

435
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,100
None of the staff had any
interaction with her.

436
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,600
She left work suddenly in the
early afternoon.

437
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Returned for maybe an hour,

438
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
then left again.

439
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
All of it's very erratic.

440
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Has anyone been able to reach her?

441
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,700
Doesn't have a home line,

442
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,400
cell phone seems to be shut off.

443
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Chicago pd identified her car
outside her residence.

444
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,900
They're getting an emergency
warrant to go in.

445
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,500
Sir, it's none of my business,

446
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
but are you going to call the governor?

447
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,500
This is his daughter we're talking about.

448
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,100
Captain, the dogs picked up a trail.

449
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,800
Which way?

450
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,600
That way and that way.

451
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,400
They split up?

452
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Looks like it.

453
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
What the hell we waiting for?

454
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,100
I think it's pretty clear that our
policies have been effective.

455
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:28,000
We've had 14 consecutive quarters of
gtp growth above three percent.

456
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
Tax cuts are working.

457
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,800
Madame vice president!

458
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Peter.

459
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,900
,Madame vice president

460
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,000
a lot of people question the wisdom of
granting tax cuts to the oil industry,

461
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
in light of the fact that they're seeing
record profits.

462
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,900
Do you have thoughts on that?

463
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,900
We're a market-driven economy,peter.

464
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,700
Punishing companies for being a good
business model

465
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,900
doesn't make a whole lot of sense
to this administration.

466
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
Madame vice president!

467
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,300
rebecca.

468
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,800
Thank you.

469
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,700
Madame vice president,

470
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,300
are you saying...

471
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,000
...if you're elected president?

472
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,500
If those tax breaks result in growth, yes.

473
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,500
Excuse me?

474
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,700
Excuse me? Sir? Yes?

475
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,900
Sir, can I...

476
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,350
where are they?

477
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,980
They were way the hell back there.

478
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,080
This ain't going to work like this.

479
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,830
We've got to do something.

480
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,760
This way.

481
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,920
come on.

482
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,980
What's going on?What's going on?

483
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,970
what the hell you doing?!What the hell you doing?!

484
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,450
I swear to god!

485
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,490
You swear what?

486
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:24,840
I guess it was just meant to be,hey, now, fellas?

487
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,800
he's lucky I didn't take this to his head.

488
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,460
You cut his...

489
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,700
you cut his...

490
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,640
You... you cut his...

491
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,730
Sucre, shut up.

492
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,560
Hello?

493
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,560
Hello?

494
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,210
Hello?!

495
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,280
come on, let's go.

496
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,130
We can't leave him just like...

497
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,680
you want to stay here?Be my guest.

498
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,220
yes, this is warden henry pope at fox river penitentiary.

499
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,430
I need to speak with the governor.

500
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,480
Yes?

501
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,760
Governor, I'm sorry to bother you,but, uh,

502
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,620
there's been an...--are you watching this?

503
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,410
Watching what?

504
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,790

508
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,210
and doctors were unable to revive him.

509
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,880
The news out of washington medical center is official now.

510
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,570

518
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,030
Thank you all.

519
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,350
And you said I couldn't get things done.

520
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,420
Madam vice president,perhaps we could get together and discuss how to move forward...

521
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,690
it is "president" now, madam.

522
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,190
And you're going to have to talk to my organizers.My schedule is suddenly quite full.

523
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,820
I'm sure you'll understand.

524
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,230
Sara tancredi!

525
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,610
It's the police.We have a warrant to come in.

526
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,340
It's easier if you just open the door.
Otherwise we're going to come on in.

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*****

528
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,440
The airstrip's on the other side of that field.

529
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,120
Just 500 yards and this whole thing's over.

530
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,780
He's not moving.

531
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,960
Every second we stay here is another chance for them to find the plane.We got to go now.

532
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,370
Wait, wait.

533
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,550
all right, let's go.Let's go.

534
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,870
Michael.

535
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,100
If this doesn't work out,I just want you to know, I...

536
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,020
I know.

537
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,940
I know.

538
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,180
Freeze! Don't move!

539
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,180
I'll tell you when we got to go.

540
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,020
no Man, we got to go.

541
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,600
fire her up.

542
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,690
We find the defendant charged of murdering terrence steadman, guilty.

543
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,490
This stunt... by lincoln burrows'  defense counsel

544
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,910
is an affront  to the memory of my brother.

545
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,470
We made an imprint of the deceased's teeth

546
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,080
and compared them to the dental records of terrence steadman.

547
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,330
They were a perfect match.

548
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,820
Who killed terrence steadman?

549
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,040
Nobody.

550
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,350
Hello, terrence.

551
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,670
I can see it.

552
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:23,280
keep it moving, come on.Come on, they're close behind us.

553
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,060
Let's go. Hurry.

554
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,530
Hey! Hey!

555
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:56,890
No!No!No!

556
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,460
What do we do now?

557
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,330
We run.

558
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,660
This way.
