1
00:00:00,282 --> 00:00:02,602
I intend to do business
with Billy Kimber.

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:06,263
Is there any man here named Shelby?

3
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:09,143
I am planning an expansion.
Onto the racetracks.

4
00:00:09,144 --> 00:00:12,103
It would be an honour
to work with you, Mr Kimber.

5
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:14,423
Nobody works with me.

6
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:16,463
People work FOR me.

7
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:19,823
'Danny, you are a good man
and a good soldier.'

8
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,584
Yes, Sergeant Major.

9
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:27,383
Freddie Thorne is at the very top
of my list.

10
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:31,463
Well, cross him off.
He won't be returning to this city.

11
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,023
We're not going anywhere, Ada.

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,903
We are going to stay here
and we'll marry here, with our baby.

13
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:38,143
I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,103
Thomas, you sell those guns
to anyone who has use for them,

15
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:42,263
you will hang.

16
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:44,743
Dump them somewhere
the police can find them.

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,543
No.

18
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:51,103
Thomas Shelby is now the beginning,
middle and end of your mission.

19
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:52,743
So what shall I do?

20
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:56,823
You must do everything you can
to get close to him.

21
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,703
Dig out a nice dress.

22
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:00,423
I want to take you to the races.

23
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,984
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

24
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,783
Already broken.

25
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:12,824
This programme contains some violent
scenes and some strong language.

26
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:05,383
Give me a bottle of whiskey
and three glasses please.

27
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:07,064
Scotch or Irish? Irish.

28
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,263
I've decided not to go.

29
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:14,063
To the races.

30
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,784
Not unless you give me two pounds,
ten shillings towards the dress.

31
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,463
I've already given you three.

32
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:21,743
How much did you pay for the suit
you'll be wearing?

33
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:23,703
Oh, I don't pay for suits.

34
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:26,544
My suits are on the house
or the house burns down.

35
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:30,983
So you want me to go
looking like a flower girl?

36
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,904
What I want makes no difference.

37
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:38,344
It's not me you're dressing up for.

38
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:57,434
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

39
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,703
You'll forgive me, Mr Shelby,
if I indulge a little.

40
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:13,784
Please.

41
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,103
It takes a lot for a man
from Sparkbrook

42
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:19,343
to step inside this pub.

43
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,543
Anyone with money
and good intentions

44
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:23,064
is welcome in the Garrison.

45
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,264
Now... you said you had business.

46
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,184
It's delicate, Mr Shelby.

47
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:38,664
It's a question of who knows what
about what.

48
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:43,464
It concerns the factory
down the road, at the BSA.

49
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:46,983
As you might know,

50
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:49,024
most of the paint shop there
is Irish.

51
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,303
Big old place like that,
rumours get started.

52
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,184
Rumours that there was a robbery.

53
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,623
Robbery of what?

54
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:04,344
Guns, Mr Shelby.
A serious amount of guns.

55
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,423
What business is that of mine?

56
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:12,703
When it comes to speculation,
you can't beat a factory night shift.

57
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:16,343
Some say there was word
from the proofing bay

58
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,304
it was the Peaky Blinders
who took them.

59
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,343
Your night shift must be dreaming.

60
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,463
Maybe they are.
Maybe they're not.

61
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,543
What we are trying to say is,
Mr Shelby,

62
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:31,144
that if you were to hear about
the whereabouts of said items...

63
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:34,023
..we'd pay good money.

64
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,344
You have good money?
We have collections from the pubs.

65
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,263
For who do you speak?

66
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:44,183
The people of Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army.

67
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,504
For a fact?
For a fucking fact.

68
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,623
You think we're jokers?

69
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:55,704
Am I laughing?

70
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:06,623
# Oh, father, why are you so sad

71
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:10,423
# On this bright Easter morn'... #

72
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:12,263
Maguire, will you shut up?

73
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:17,983
# When Irishmen are proud and glad

74
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,703
# Of the land
Where they were born? #

75
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:24,343
Maguire, away and shite man,
we're trying to talk business...

76
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:28,463
# Oh, son, I see sad mem'ries view

77
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:33,223
# Of far-off distant days

78
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:38,824
# When being just a boy like you

79
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:46,984
# I joined the IRA. #

80
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:49,744
Bravo!

81
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,023
# Where are the lads... #
All right, boys.

82
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:57,463
If I hear anything about who knows
what about what, I'll let you know.

83
00:05:57,464 --> 00:06:00,543
# Gra mo chree, I long to see

84
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,904
# The boys of the old IRA... #

85
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:09,703
I thought you only allowed singing
on a Saturday.

86
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,743
Whiskey is good proofing water.

87
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:13,863
It tells you who's real
and who isn't.

88
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:15,623
And what did my countrymen want?

89
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:16,744
They're nobodies.

90
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:20,063
They drink in The Black Swan
in Sparkbrook.

91
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,903
They're only rebels
because they like the songs.

92
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:25,023
You have sympathies with them?

93
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:27,183
I have no sympathies
of any description.

94
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,503
Their accents were so thick,

95
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:30,543
it's a wonder you could
understand them.

96
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:33,984
Next time, I could translate.
You'd work for me?

97
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,584
I thought I already was.
So you are coming to the races?

98
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:42,664
Two pounds, ten shillings.

99
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,064
Ten shillings.

100
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:51,343
Buy something red.

101
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,863
To match his handkerchief.

102
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,304
Whose handkerchief?

103
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,463
Ada, what the hell?

104
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:23,423
I dared myself to run through
their territory in my dress.

105
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:26,383
Are you mad? Yeah.
Mad as hell with all of them.

106
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:27,504
I love you.

107
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:31,623
I love you too.

108
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,783
The more they try to stop us,
the madder I'll be.

109
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:36,064
Come on, princess,
the vicar's waiting. Wait...

110
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:38,704
How do I look?

111
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,224
Like an angel.

112
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:01,944
Moss?

113
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:06,343
What do we know about
The Black Swan?

114
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:09,823
An operative has provided
intelligence

115
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,663
that it is a place
where IRA men gather.

116
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:16,064
It's just a lot of drunken navigators
singing songs, sir.

117
00:08:17,144 --> 00:08:19,463
The IRA wouldn't go near them.

118
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,144
Then why are two of them
looking to buy guns?

119
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:25,544
Do you have names?

120
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,903
Must she do everything for you?

121
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:31,223
"She", sir?

122
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:35,423
One female operative
has proved more useful

123
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:38,024
than any of you great lumps of men.

124
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:43,424
We are regular police officers, sir.
Not spies.

125
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:47,263
We can only act
when a crime has been committed.

126
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:51,383
Perhaps I should send some men down
to The Black Swan to ask questions.

127
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,623
And scare them all into hiding?

128
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:55,863
Not the best of tactics, Sergeant.

129
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:58,784
My tactics come from my experiences
in France.

130
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:03,984
Most of my great lumps of men
served in France too, sir.

131
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:09,824
I serve my country every day.

132
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,104
That will be all, Sergeant.

133
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,704
Away and shite!

134
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:44,064
Fancy me, do ya?

135
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:48,104
What are you? A copper?

136
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:50,903
Oh!

137
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:52,304
Proddy bitch!

138
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:57,343
I've seen you. I've seen your face,
serving in the Garrison.

139
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:59,743
Come here...

140
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:04,104
I am taking you in for interrogation
on behalf of the Irish Free State.

141
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:31,264
All right?

142
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:34,464
Are you armed?

143
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:38,064
No.

144
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:40,824
Then I'll tell you.

145
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:46,103
Ada and Freddie Thorne
were married today.

146
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,904
They defied your orders,
they haven't left the city.

147
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:02,744
I'll deal with it.

148
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:09,024
Thomas... I'll deal with it.

149
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:11,424
Where are they?

150
00:12:12,664 --> 00:12:15,383
Freddie's comrades have safe houses.
Why do you want to know?

151
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:17,743
I want to send them flowers.
Why do you think?

152
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:19,544
Would it be so bad if they stayed?

153
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:23,664
I promised I'd run Freddie
out of town.

154
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,064
Promised who?

155
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,223
I told the coppers
Freddie wouldn't come back.

156
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:42,703
It's part of the deal.

157
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,303
What bloody deal?

158
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:48,344
What happened to family votes?
What happened to meetings?

159
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:53,063
If you let me deal
with Ada and Freddie,

160
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,224
it'll end in peace.

161
00:12:58,264 --> 00:13:00,024
Christ knows
you've had your fill of war.

162
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:08,343
You get Freddie out of town, Poll.

163
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,264
Or else I'll deal with it myself.

164
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:11,383
The victim had been drinking
in The Black Swan pub, sir -

165
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,583
the pub you told me about.

166
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:15,863
And a neighbour said
she saw a young woman

167
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:17,864
leaving the street
where the body was found.

168
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:23,943
A woman, sir. I was wondering
if there was a connection.

169
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,903
A connection with what, Sergeant?

170
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:30,383
You said your spy was a woman, sir.

171
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:32,824
I wondered if now there was now
a policy.

172
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:40,264
Shoot to kill.
Like there was in Belfast.

173
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:46,303
The Republicans
are famously factional.

174
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,464
He was killed by one of his own.

175
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,184
That will be all, Sergeant.

176
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:57,303
And they're not called spies.

177
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,103
They're called operatives.

178
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,384
Operatives, sir. Right, sir.

179
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,424
It's how you say things. Yeah...

180
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,583
What the bloody hell
is she doing here?

181
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,184
£200, Freddie.

182
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:19,143
For what?

183
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:23,304
For us. For a honeymoon
that goes on for ever.

184
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,903
Where did it come from?
Family fund.

185
00:15:30,904 --> 00:15:34,103
The pockets of widows
and desperate men.

186
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:35,783
See sense, Freddie.

187
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,743
Tommy is not going to let this rest.

188
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:41,343
Times like these, a communist
in the family is bad for business.

189
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:43,183
You have to leave the city.

190
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:47,143
You think I can't handle
Tommy Shelby? You can't.

191
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,864
I'm having trouble these days
and I'm twice the man you are.

192
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:55,064
I went into town.

193
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:57,624
The Cunard office.

194
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:01,423
I booked you both tickets
on the next boat

195
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:03,423
from Liverpool to New York.

196
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:05,303
America, Freddie.

197
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:06,823
They've already had
their revolution.

198
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:08,184
You won't have to bother.

199
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:18,544
Will you ladies at least
let a man sleep on it?

200
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,264
You had no business...

201
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,663
Observe and report.
That is your remit.

202
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,263
I decided we needed
to know where he lived.

203
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:05,743
I warned you not to let
your personal history

204
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:07,183
cloud your judgment.

205
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:08,983
You went after him
because he was IRA.

206
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:11,464
I followed him because I thought
he might have information.

207
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,223
According to the rules,

208
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:16,463
I should pull you out of
Garrison Lane immediately.

209
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,864
No. Cheltenham is tomorrow.

210
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,704
You take too much upon yourself.

211
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,863
This is an active military mission -
your words.

212
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:30,743
I'm doing my job.

213
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:35,743
Grace, the death of a base Fenian
doesn't concern me.

214
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,464
Your welfare does.

215
00:17:39,104 --> 00:17:40,944
Killing a man affects the heart.

216
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:44,704
And as for my heart...

217
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,383
I know that because of
our family connections,

218
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,264
you take my progress personally.

219
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:53,624
But I don't need you
to be my father.

220
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:58,384
I will be thinking of you.

221
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:26,664
Mr Shelby, sir. Mr Zhang.

222
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:32,823
That suit is sold, sir.
It's being collected this morning.

223
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:33,904
I know.

224
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:41,783
Please, gentlemen.
No fighting in here.

225
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:43,344
It's all right. I come as a friend.

226
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,663
You're collecting your suit
for Cheltenham - it's very nice.

227
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:52,344
How the bloody hell do you know?
I know a lot of things, Mr Kimber.

228
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:56,823
And as I told you before,
I know the Lee brothers.

229
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:59,503
And I know they're going to be
at the Cheltenham races as well.

230
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,703
They're going to lose a lot of money
on fast women and slow nags.

231
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:06,783
No. They're planning on showing up
in numbers and robbing your bookies.

232
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,783
Running chalk and rafflers.

233
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,943
You think I can't handle the Lees?

234
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,744
Just a word of warning
from a friend. That's all.

235
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,743
I'll see you at Cheltenham.

236
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:20,984
I'll wave at you from my box.

237
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:25,183
If you're coming to the races,
bring that pretty barmaid of yours.

238
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:26,864
Already invited.

239
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:34,383
Comrades -

240
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:38,743
as you know, to even gather
like this today is illegal.

241
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:43,543
Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered
that we are not allowed to assemble

242
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:45,663
in groups of more than three people.

243
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,183
So, to comply with the law,

244
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:50,784
please now clump together
in groups of three.

245
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:55,623
You hear that, boys?

246
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:59,183
The same whistles they used to blow
to send us over the top,

247
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:01,623
they now blow
to try and break us up.

248
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:03,943
So before the Specials get here,

249
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:06,784
raise a hand,
all those who want to strike...

250
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:14,263
Now disperse!
Disperse and take the message home!

251
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:17,384
United, we will never be defeated!

252
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:30,023
Tommy! Oi, Tommy.

253
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:32,543
What the hell's been happening?

254
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:34,943
The police had just raided
a rally at the factory.

255
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:36,903
You thinking Freddie Thorne's back?

256
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,063
I know he is. And he's with Ada.

257
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,743
How hard can it be to find
the only girl in Birmingham

258
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,103
with four-inch heels, eh?

259
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,023
She's with the commies.

260
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:48,223
They have little rat holes
all over the city.

261
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:50,423
I just want to know where she is.

262
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:52,863
Tommy, you'd best have a word
with Arthur as well.

263
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:55,583
What's wrong with bloody Arthur?

264
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:57,544
He's got the Flanders blues again.

265
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:41,104
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answer to.

266
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,744
"Is it true your Ada got married?"

267
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:51,464
I say, "I don't know."

268
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,384
"Where is she living now?"

269
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,104
"I don't know."

270
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:02,464
"Arthur...

271
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:08,104
"..who killed the Paddy
from The Black Swan?"

272
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,184
I go, "What Paddy?"

273
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:18,384
They say...

274
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:27,264
.."Is it you, Peaky Blinders,
who stole the guns from the BSA?"

275
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,104
What guns, Tommy?

276
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:42,583
Arthur, after your beating,
I thought you needed a break...

277
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:45,224
What bloody guns, Tommy?!

278
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:51,143
Arthur, I was going to tell you.
You were going to tell me.

279
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,104
Arthur, listen to me.

280
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:57,383
You've had a hard time
these past few years.

281
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:58,464
God knows you have.

282
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,024
You deserve some rest.

283
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:07,264
We had some luck. Some bloody luck.

284
00:23:08,384 --> 00:23:11,543
It fell off a wagon into our laps.

285
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:16,583
And all you need to know is, it's us
that has the machine guns now.

286
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:18,544
And it's them that's in the mud.

287
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,024
All right?

288
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:33,464
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

289
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:35,784
Come on.

290
00:23:59,824 --> 00:24:02,104
A surprise? Where is she?

291
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:10,103
What is it you've always wanted,
Arthur? Eh?

292
00:24:10,104 --> 00:24:12,783
When we were in France,
you used to say,

293
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,224
"When I get back to England,
I want to own my own pub."

294
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:19,944
Well...

295
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:27,744
You've gone soft.
You've gone soft, Tommy.

296
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:33,223
How do we know it's for sale?

297
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:37,063
Everything's for sale to us, Arthur.

298
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:39,583
We're making a lot of money
these days.

299
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:42,984
We need a legitimate business
to pass the money from the shop.

300
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:45,904
I wouldn't know what to do.

301
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:49,423
You've spent two-thirds of your life
in pubs.

302
00:24:49,424 --> 00:24:52,464
Just pour it instead of drinking it.

303
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:56,023
But I can still drink it, right?

304
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,984
Your pub - you do what you want.

305
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:06,663
Ah - sorry, gentlemen,
I didn't hear you come in.

306
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:07,744
What can I get you?

307
00:25:27,584 --> 00:25:29,503
Bloody kids.

308
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:31,224
The other one's punctured as well.

309
00:25:33,744 --> 00:25:36,343
Mr Campbell wants an explanation.

310
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:41,424
Today, some rabble-rouser Union man
brought the BSA out on strike.

311
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:44,824
It was Freddie Thorne.

312
00:25:46,384 --> 00:25:48,943
I thought you promised
he wouldn't come back.

313
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,503
I know he's in town.
I'm dealing with it.

314
00:25:51,504 --> 00:25:55,223
Inspector Campbell thought
you controlled your territories.

315
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:56,384
Yeah.

316
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,624
I said I'm dealing with it.

317
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:02,784
I heard that, er...

318
00:26:04,704 --> 00:26:07,183
..Freddie married your sister.

319
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:09,143
Some family you've got, eh?

320
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:10,864
Bet you can't wait for Christmas.

321
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,183
Deliver Freddie Thorne to us

322
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:19,063
or we'll take your sister
in as an accomplice.

323
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:21,024
She'll get four years for sedition.

324
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:26,824
Or you can turn him in
and your sister goes free.

325
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:36,744
I'll say good night then, Tom.

326
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,783
Have you seen Freddie Thorne?

327
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:08,144
No. Or Tommy? Ahh!

328
00:27:23,704 --> 00:27:25,943
I have to find Freddie.
Drink this first.

329
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,943
No, I have to find them, I think
they are going to kill each other.

330
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:30,104
Who is going to kill who?

331
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:33,304
We need to talk.

332
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,264
What exactly is it
that you want, Freddie?

333
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,104
I came to tell you...

334
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:50,904
..that's not going to work, Tommy.

335
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,464
Polly came round. She gave me that.

336
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:02,743
Well, Polly must have had
a rush of blood.

337
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:03,944
Or port wine.

338
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:06,743
Your honesty is appreciated.

339
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:08,703
Now, if you're not going
to use that thing...

340
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:11,104
I'm not finished. Sit down.

341
00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:13,824
Sit down. Sit.

342
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:21,184
Talk to me about the guns.

343
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,943
Do you remember we used
to jump in here,

344
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:29,224
see who could swim the fastest...?
I'm here to talk business, Tommy.

345
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,824
Do you reckon we could still do it?

346
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,024
Ah!

347
00:28:48,464 --> 00:28:52,264
You loaded Ada with your bastard
because she's a Shelby.

348
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:56,304
You thought it'd mean
you'd be somebody.

349
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:01,104
I won't let you fuck up
my sister's life for your cause.

350
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,104
My God.

351
00:29:12,224 --> 00:29:13,744
You actually believe that.

352
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:21,944
I love her, Tommy.

353
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:26,464
I've loved her since she was nine
and I was 12.

354
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:30,304
And she loves me the same.

355
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:39,904
You even know the word?

356
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:45,904
This marriage will not stand.

357
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:57,904
Shh...

358
00:30:17,824 --> 00:30:20,824
Freddie didn't want your money.

359
00:30:22,224 --> 00:30:25,423
And now the coppers are saying
if we don't turn Freddie in,

360
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,903
they'll put Ada
on the arrest warrant as well.

361
00:30:27,904 --> 00:30:31,023
That's where your compassion
gets you, Poll.

362
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:35,503
From now on, we do it my way.

363
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:36,824
Or what?

364
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:16,624
Ready?

365
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,184
They're getting closer.

366
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:26,384
I'll lead. Watch yourself, Danny.
Tommy.

367
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,344
Be careful, Danny.

368
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:06,544
Tommy!

369
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:09,504
Tommy!

370
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:12,664
Aargh!

371
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:17,904
Arrrggghhh!

372
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:22,783
Arrrggghhh!

373
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,864
Tommy!

374
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:26,264
Tommy?

375
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:28,544
Tommy!

376
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:30,824
Tommy?

377
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,024
It's open.

378
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:48,143
Private Whizz Bang reporting, sir.

379
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:49,144
At ease.

380
00:33:03,504 --> 00:33:06,663
So, what news from London?

381
00:33:06,664 --> 00:33:09,863
I was in a pub -
it was called Mother Redcap.

382
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:10,824
An Irish pub.

383
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:14,544
I got talking to some old bloke
about Birmingham.

384
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:18,904
He said there's been trouble.
An IRA man shot.

385
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:23,983
He said a lot, but the only bit
I heard... was that their high command

386
00:33:23,984 --> 00:33:25,784
think it's the Peaky Blinders
who shot him.

387
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:29,384
Came up on the next boat to warn you.

388
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,783
Is it true?

389
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:34,824
No.

390
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,424
But lies travel faster
than the truth.

391
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:42,784
Get a message to them.

392
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:46,303
Tell them to send someone to parley.

393
00:33:46,304 --> 00:33:48,463
Tell them there's been
a misunderstanding

394
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:49,984
and we don't want any trouble.

395
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:55,464
You've got enough trouble -
right, Tommy?

396
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,984
A whisky and a smoke.

397
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:07,024
I can smell it in the air.

398
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:12,104
I use it sometimes myself.

399
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,824
I call it "my sweetheart".

400
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:20,264
They gave us the worst job, Tommy.

401
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:22,584
Yeah...

402
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:26,104
..and we fucking volunteered.

403
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,304
Sometimes, it lasts all night.

404
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:52,303
I lie here and I listen
to the shovels and the picks

405
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:53,904
against that wall there.

406
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:01,263
And I pray the sun will come up
at the curtains

407
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,304
before they break through.

408
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,984
'No, I don't pray - I hope.

409
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,983
'And sometimes, it happens.

410
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:14,544
'The sun beats them.

411
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:17,704
'But mostly...

412
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,904
'..the shovels beat the sun.'

413
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:45,264
Your sister was here.

414
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:52,224
She was worried. You and Freddie.

415
00:36:53,264 --> 00:36:54,664
It had made her sick...

416
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:58,463
She's all right,
but in her condition,

417
00:36:58,464 --> 00:36:59,464
she needs peace.

418
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:02,823
Women talk.

419
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:04,264
That is something they do.

420
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:07,984
She talked about you.

421
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:12,304
She said you keep everything
locked up.

422
00:37:13,904 --> 00:37:16,184
Well, that's what men do.

423
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,183
Your sister's nice. I like her.

424
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:21,783
It can't be easy for her.

425
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:24,344
Her brother and her husband,
fighting over the same thing.

426
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:31,184
Men should talk, too.

427
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:33,904
To you?

428
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:41,103
Why not? I'm a barmaid. It's my job.

429
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:43,184
Men always tell their troubles
to a barmaid.

430
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:47,424
What is it you and Freddie
are fighting over?

431
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:03,384
I'll meet you here at nine o'clock
tomorrow morning.

432
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:08,104
Did you buy a dress?

433
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:10,744
Yes. I bought a dress.

434
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,384
How does it look?

435
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,464
He's changed the oil
and greased her up.

436
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,463
So will it get me
all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?

437
00:39:37,464 --> 00:39:39,583
He's good with motors,
but it pains him.

438
00:39:39,584 --> 00:39:42,503
No heart in motorcars.
I can't talk with them.

439
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:45,823
Yeah - Tommy might need
to make a fast getaway.

440
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:48,143
The Lees will be all over the track.

441
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:50,983
And Kimber's men. And his coppers.

442
00:39:50,984 --> 00:39:52,743
They control the law down there,
Tommy.

443
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,264
Give her a turn for me, Charlie.

444
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,583
This car only seats four.

445
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,143
You'll need more men than that
if you're to come back alive.

446
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,784
It'll be just me and a girl.

447
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,943
Is it just the two of us
going to the races?

448
00:40:19,944 --> 00:40:21,224
Something like that.

449
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,623
Attention!

450
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:58,824
Right.

451
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:04,303
This is what was known as the final
briefing before going over the top.

452
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:07,143
60 miles down that road
is Cheltenham racetrack.

453
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:09,983
Johnny, what's our mission, boy?

454
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:13,183
To stick it to the Lee family,
Arthur.

455
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:17,423
That's right. The Lees are skimming
money off legal bookies.

456
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:22,423
Running chalk, selling rafflers,
beating up them as won't buy.

457
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:25,863
But today, we're going to stop them.

458
00:41:25,864 --> 00:41:28,823
What about Kimber's men?
I thought he had his own protection.

459
00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:30,824
Kimber's let his troops go rotten.

460
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:35,264
They're on the take from the Lees
to look the other way.

461
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:38,703
We are going to show Kimber
how it should be done.

462
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,583
Now take what you're good at.

463
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,663
Those of you with guns,
keep them out of it,

464
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:44,943
unless a gun is pulled on you.

465
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:46,584
We want this done quietly.

466
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,663
So when do we share out the cash?

467
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:54,863
We don't.
We're not keeping the cash.

468
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:57,623
You're in Tommy's army now, boys.

469
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,784
Trust only kin.

470
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:02,504
Let's go.

471
00:42:22,904 --> 00:42:24,903
Are you sure we're allowed in here?

472
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:27,903
Well, I prefer to come to the races
the back way.

473
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:32,503
It keeps me out of trouble.
Tracks are lawless places.

474
00:42:32,504 --> 00:42:35,143
I can't stand petty criminals.
This way.

475
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:38,383
Will we get to lay a bet?
No - gambling is for mugs.

476
00:42:38,384 --> 00:42:39,863
This way...

477
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:41,743
You're lucky you're with me

478
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:44,343
or you'd be wasting your money
on fixed races.

479
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:46,623
I always wondered,
how do you fix a race?

480
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:47,904
How should I know?

481
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:53,863
OK, you do the talking. What?

482
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:57,183
Tell security
you are Lady Sarah Duggan...

483
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:59,463
Excuse us, excuse us...

484
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:01,663
..Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.

485
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:04,143
You got lost when you went
to look for the boy

486
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:06,303
riding your horse - Dandy Flower.

487
00:43:06,304 --> 00:43:08,343
If they ask about me,
say I'm Prussian

488
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:09,744
and don't speak a word of English.

489
00:43:10,744 --> 00:43:12,664
Come on, posh girl.
Earn your three quid.

490
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,984
I still prefer the Garrison.

491
00:43:48,904 --> 00:43:49,944
Do you dance?

492
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:52,904
If I'm asked properly.

493
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:59,064
Lady Sarah of Connemara,
will you dance with me?

494
00:44:58,144 --> 00:45:00,264
Roberts.
The Peaky Blinders are here.

495
00:45:01,624 --> 00:45:04,823
I told you, Mr Kimber.
He's got some balls, that one.

496
00:45:04,824 --> 00:45:06,904
And she's got some body, that one.

497
00:45:20,024 --> 00:45:22,143
Chalk for your blackboards.

498
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:23,664
Five pounds a stick.

499
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:30,504
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.

500
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:37,023
Hello, Raz. How's business?

501
00:45:37,024 --> 00:45:39,144
Argh! Ugh!

502
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:44,263
Fucking... get up!

503
00:45:44,264 --> 00:45:45,544
Fucking...

504
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:52,864
ARRGGHH!

505
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:57,583
Stay still, Raz,
or I'll take the whole ear off.

506
00:45:57,584 --> 00:46:00,263
And you're going to need
your ears to listen.

507
00:46:00,264 --> 00:46:03,623
No more chalking
on Billy Kimber's boys.

508
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:05,024
Right?

509
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:08,024
We're the protection now.

510
00:46:10,504 --> 00:46:16,983
I commandeer this stolen money
by order of the Peaky Blinders.

511
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,704
Agghh!

512
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,943
Either your left leg
is stronger than your right

513
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:48,103
or we're making a getaway.

514
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:51,383
Neither. I hope this doesn't involve
razor blades.

515
00:46:51,384 --> 00:46:53,463
I've decided to move up
in the world.

516
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:55,623
Become a legitimate businessman.

517
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:58,904
My gosh. You're serious.
I'm always serious.

518
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:05,263
We chased the Lees across the track,
right the way down the Devon road.

519
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:06,704
We got every penny back.

520
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:11,143
Nice dress.
You can wear that to my pub.

521
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:13,503
Buy the boys a drink. Anybody hurt?

522
00:47:13,504 --> 00:47:14,864
A few cuts and bruises.

523
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:18,064
Off we go, Lady Sarah.

524
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:26,904
Steady on...
Excuse me.

525
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:36,904
Your money, Mr Kimber.

526
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:40,663
Rescued from the Lee brothers

527
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:44,224
and returned to you
with a request for a fair hearing.

528
00:47:45,264 --> 00:47:48,023
Your own protection is failing,
Mr Kimber.

529
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:49,984
Your boys are taking cuts.

530
00:47:51,424 --> 00:47:54,023
I want to suggest that from now on,

531
00:47:54,024 --> 00:47:57,504
you contract out your racetrack
security to the Peaky Blinders.

532
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:01,503
We would be saving you
a lot of money, Mr Kimber.

533
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,503
A lot of money.

534
00:48:03,504 --> 00:48:04,864
In return, you give us...

535
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:09,223
..5% of the take

536
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:11,423
and three legal betting pitches

537
00:48:11,424 --> 00:48:13,943
at every race meeting
north of the River Severn,

538
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:15,983
rising to six after one year

539
00:48:15,984 --> 00:48:18,224
if we are all satisfied
with the service.

540
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:21,784
What do you say, Mr Kimber?

541
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:29,703
I say you talk business
to my accountant.

542
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:30,904
I want to dance.

543
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:45,824
Your man said it was all right
for me to have this dance.

544
00:49:08,264 --> 00:49:11,463
How many men can you put
in the field at one time?

545
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:14,263
There's a lot of men out of work
at the moment.

546
00:49:14,264 --> 00:49:16,904
Two guards for every bookie.
At every meeting?

547
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:22,703
We have contacts with good people
among the gypsies.

548
00:49:22,704 --> 00:49:25,823
We'll always know where the Lees
plan to attack.

549
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:29,543
With all the strikes and troubles,
you can't depend on the police.

550
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:32,504
Anyway... we're more honest.

551
00:49:34,184 --> 00:49:35,943
Looks like you two
are making a deal.

552
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:37,624
We are making progress.

553
00:49:39,504 --> 00:49:42,224
Then let me throw a small condition
into the mix.

554
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:02,983
So, listen... we're going to go
for dinner at Kimber's house.

555
00:50:02,984 --> 00:50:05,623
He has a place
a couple of miles away.

556
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:08,743
I have some business to settle first
with his accountant, so...

557
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:10,544
You go on ahead, with Kimber.

558
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:13,543
Just me and him?

559
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:17,264
Yeah... until I'm done here.
Is that all right?

560
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:23,344
I'll throw in an extra three quid
for your extra time.

561
00:50:25,744 --> 00:50:27,224
You think I'm a whore?

562
00:50:29,584 --> 00:50:32,343
Everybody's a whore, Grace.

563
00:50:32,344 --> 00:50:34,783
We just sell different parts
of ourselves.

564
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:36,903
You said you wanted to work for me.

565
00:50:36,904 --> 00:50:38,823
To do that, you have to sharpen up.

566
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:41,903
The deal is I give him
two hours with you.

567
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:45,223
He thinks he's a ladies' man.
He thinks he can seduce you.

568
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:47,543
Whenever you want,
just kick him in the balls.

569
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,783
I'm a clause in a contract.

570
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:51,903
If you want to be part
of my organisation,

571
00:50:51,904 --> 00:50:53,344
you have to make sacrifices.

572
00:50:57,144 --> 00:50:58,423
Do we have a deal?

573
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:00,504
As a sweetener,
you can try your luck with mine.

574
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:05,583
Yes, we have a deal.
Two hours? Yeah.

575
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:08,624
Side bet. Ten pounds says
I'll have her fucked in one.

576
00:51:10,784 --> 00:51:11,864
Mademoiselle.

577
00:51:22,824 --> 00:51:24,744
I bet he said you could have me,
didn't he?

578
00:51:27,104 --> 00:51:28,903
While he has her.

579
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:30,424
That's the arrangement, isn't it?

580
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,583
Yours might be a prostitute,

581
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:36,584
but I'm not.

582
00:51:37,904 --> 00:51:39,584
I was a milliner when I met him.

583
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,224
I was independent.

584
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:46,624
I made this hat.

585
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:49,504
I was a good milliner.

586
00:51:51,104 --> 00:51:52,424
It's a very pretty hat.

587
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:56,224
It really is.

588
00:52:06,264 --> 00:52:07,544
So is she a prostitute?

589
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:12,263
God's honest truth?

590
00:52:12,264 --> 00:52:13,624
I don't know what she is.

591
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:25,904
You showed me up
back there at the races.

592
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:31,544
Why don't you teach me
how to dance properly?

593
00:52:32,824 --> 00:52:35,743
The music is too slow.
Put on a Charleston.

594
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:38,424
Then we'd be far away.
I want to dance like this.

595
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:43,144
Come on. You weren't so stiff
back there, were you?

596
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:46,984
You ever been in a house this big?

597
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:49,264
Hm?

598
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:51,984
Look at you.

599
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:57,504
You look like a bloody film star.

600
00:53:01,944 --> 00:53:03,144
I want a cigarette.

601
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:17,623
Oh, look, I dropped something.
Pick it up.

602
00:53:17,624 --> 00:53:18,983
Pick it up yourself.

603
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:20,183
You're a fucking barmaid.

604
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:22,383
If I drop a glass on the floor,
you pick it up.

605
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:24,224
I want to watch you pick it up.

606
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:32,344
Right, you little slag.
I have tried to be nice.

607
00:53:33,504 --> 00:53:37,423
If I drop a glass on the floor,

608
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:42,223
you bend over and fucking pick up
the fucking glass, OK?

609
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:43,703
What?! No, sir... no.

610
00:53:43,704 --> 00:53:46,423
What are you doing here?
I've got another hour.

611
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:50,783
Just wait - listen to me.
Just listen to me.

612
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:53,463
I was going to let you go through
with it, but in the end,

613
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,623
my conscience got the better of me.

614
00:53:55,624 --> 00:53:57,144
She looks good on the outside...

615
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:01,024
..but she has the clap.

616
00:54:04,184 --> 00:54:05,584
Yeah. Syphilis.

617
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:09,263
When you took a shine to her,
I thought I'd use her.

618
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:11,784
Somebody told me she had syph
and I thought, "What the hell?"

619
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,784
Call it my better nature.

620
00:54:17,544 --> 00:54:19,064
She's... she's a whore.

621
00:54:24,704 --> 00:54:27,864
Just go and wait in the car.
I can walk on my own!

622
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:34,784
Can we shake hands
and forget this ever happened?

623
00:54:59,544 --> 00:55:02,184
Start of the day,
I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.

624
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:06,424
By the end,
I was a whore with the clap.

625
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:11,224
You're a fucking bastard,
offering me like that.

626
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:18,944
But then you changed your mind.

627
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:25,304
Why did you change your mind, Thomas?

628
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,944
