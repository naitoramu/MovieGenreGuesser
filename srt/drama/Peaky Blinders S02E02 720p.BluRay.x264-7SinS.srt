1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,239
What happened to the pub
is Irish business?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,439
You shut your gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,119
Eamonn Duggan?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,959
My son and my daughter

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,839
were taken from me
when they were very small.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,679
We're planning an expansion.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,359
I'm taking premises in London.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,359
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,879
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,759
We take the opportunity
to show our hand.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,399
That arrived an hour ago.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,799
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,559
Well done, Tommy.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,199
Now you're at war with Sabini.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,759
- Ada Shelby?
- No.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,439
Your brother broke the rules.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,079
Sabini.

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,399
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,519
See if
the bastard's still alive.

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,759
No! No!

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,079
It's all right, Miss Shelby.
We work with Tommy.

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,879
We're Peaky Blinders.

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,159
My name is not Shelby!

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,919
Ready for a visitor, Mr Shelby?

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,599
No.

26
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,879
I'm here on the King's orders.

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,879
I'm afraid I must insist.

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,799
You paid extra for daylight.

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,519
The racketeering business
must be booming.

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,479
Are you not going to thank me
for saving your life?

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,279
Pass me cigarettes?

32
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,919
Three nights ago,

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,439
at the co-operative stables
in Montague Street,

34
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,599
there was a murder.

35
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,039
A man named Duggan.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,119
The Oxfordshire constabulary
found his body in a shallow grave.

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,319
I need to piss.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,639
Nurse?

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,399
I know it was you who carried out
the murder of Mr Duggan.

40
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:51,223
<b>WwW.ZooCine.NeT
Watch Movies and Series!</b>

41
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,519
By the way.

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,439
Grace, she went to New York.

43
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,359
A place called, er...

44
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,439
Poughkeepsie.

45
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,879
She's married now.

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,959
To a banker. He's rich.

47
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,999
I'm sure she's very happy.

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,799
You have been under my microscope
for some weeks now.

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,279
I have been observing
every move you make.

50
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,159
And that is why I was on hand
to save your life.

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,839
I imagine being shot by a woman
hurts the same as being shot by a man.

52
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,319
Just a bit more shameful.

53
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,159
You know, Mr Campbell,
when I got shot they gave me a medal.

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,039
Yeah.

55
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
No medal for you I bet.

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,079
Mr Shelby,

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,679
our reunion...

58
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,199
is part of a very carefully
worked out plan,

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,239
which has been in place
for some time now.

60
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,159
Every time you lean on that stick
I bet you see her face.

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,679
And as a result of the information
in my possession,

62
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,999
I can charge you with murder at any time

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,159
and provide
two impeccable Crown witnesses

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,799
whose testimony will lead you
directly to the gallows.

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,959
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

66
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,039
And from this moment forward...

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,119
you belong to me.

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,239
So, get well quickly.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,999
I'll be in touch the moment I hear
you can piss standing up.

70
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,519
Then I will send you your instructions.

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,079
Curly, you left the gate open?

72
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,839
No, I locked it.
I pinched myself when I did it.

73
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,039
- Get that stuff under cover.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,399
Hey!

75
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,919
Who goes there?

76
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,279
Tommy?

77
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,919
Curly, get that oil you put on the legs
when they go lame.

78
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,639
Are you fucking mad, Doyle?

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,479
The yellow stuff. Go on.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,439
They said you'd be in for
another three weeks.

81
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,639
I need to get on a boat to London.

82
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,199
Tonight.

83
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,119
You discharged yourself?

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,559
I'm a fucking
sitting duck in there, Charlie.

85
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,919
Sabini could send a man at any time.

86
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,279
I need to get some things done.

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,479
You're burning up.

88
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,359
Here.

89
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,239
Tommy! That stuff's
for rubbing into fucking horses.

90
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,799
Ha! I am a horse.

91
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,879
If you were a horse, they'd shoot you
with this many broken bones.

92
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,599
Get the black powder, Curly.

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,919
- Go.
- Yeah.

94
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,439
The black powder.

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,039
You pay for a bloody hospital
and you're using witchcraft?

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,319
I need to sleep in the open air
and feel the boat under me, Charlie.

97
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,319
Tommy.

98
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,519
You're just like your mother.

99
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,079
Do you have a boat here?

100
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,679
Only theJanuary. She's heavy.

101
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,439
London will take four days.

102
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,679
That'll do. Can you spare Curly?

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,279
He'll be my doctor.

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,959
Then God help you.

105
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,439
You have tobacco, Curly?

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,559
And tea and whisky.

107
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,639
We'll have you running around
like a colt.

108
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,919
Get him aboard. I'll fill her up.

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,159
If I sleep all the way,
it's Camden Town we're heading for.

110
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,479
What business do you have
in Camden Town, Tommy?

111
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,759
Tell Polly she's in charge
while I'm away.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,799
If I don't come back,
tell her she's in charge for good.

113
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
You hungry yet, Tommy?

114
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,999
You know what, Curly?

115
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,039
I think I am.

116
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,159
Where are we?

117
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,039
Heathrow.
One more day and we'll be there.

118
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,839
I'll put something in the pan.

119
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,199
Can you steer?

120
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,959
Give it a go.

121
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,399
You're almost there, too, Tommy.

122
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,679
Fucking hell, lads. Calm down.

123
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,719
Put him down, Ollie.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,279
Put him down, mate. He's only little.

125
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,559
You on your own?

126
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,999
Seems so.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,519
Well, you're a brave lad, ain't you?

128
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,559
You want to take a look at my bakery?

129
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,559
We bake all sorts here mate, yeah.

130
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,599
Did you know we bake over
10,000 loaves a week?

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,119
Can you believe it?

132
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,319
We bake the white bread,
we bake the brown bread.

133
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,159
We bake all sorts.

134
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,159
Would you like to try some?

135
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,039
Bread?

136
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,159
Yeah?

137
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,959
All right.

138
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,959
What would you like, brown or white?

139
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,479
Try the brown.

140
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,039
Brown, right.

141
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,239
Not bad.

142
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,879
Not bad?

143
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,719
Not bad?

144
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,839
It's fucking awful, that stuff.

145
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,759
The fucking brown stuff
is horrible, it's for the workers.

146
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,999
Yeah.

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,519
The white stuff,
now that is for the bosses.

148
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,199
Come look.

149
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,359
Well, I've heard
very bad, bad, bad things

150
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,799
about you Birmingham people.

151
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,239
You're gypsies, right?

152
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,399
So what, do you live in
a fucking tent or a caravan?

153
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,199
I came here to discuss business...

154
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,799
with you, Mr Solomons.

155
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,599
Well, rum's for fun and fucking, innit?

156
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,079
So, whisky, now that...

157
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,719
That is for business.

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,239
Let's talk first?

159
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,559
Suit yourself.

160
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,919
They say you had your life
saved by a policeman.

161
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,639
I have policemen on my payroll.

162
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,079
Well, I don't like policemen

163
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,039
because policemen,
they can't be trusted.

164
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,559
Mr Sabini uses policemen all the time.

165
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,639
That's why he's winning
the war in London

166
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,559
and you are losing it.

167
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,759
A war ain't over until it's over, mate.

168
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,999
You were in the war?

169
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,319
I once carried out my own
personal form of stigmata on an Italian.

170
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,639
I pushed his face up against the trench

171
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,279
and shoved a six-inch nail
up his fucking nose

172
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,359
and I hammered it home
with a duck board.

173
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,719
It was fucking biblical, mate.

174
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,039
So don't come in here and sit there
in my chair and tell me

175
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,239
that I'm losing my war to a fucking wop.

176
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,999
That war was a long time ago.

177
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,759
You need to be more realistic.

178
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,359
Realistic, yeah?

179
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,319
Realistic?

180
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,039
Well, if you weren't losing the war,

181
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,119
then you wouldn't have
sent me the telegram.

182
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,439
Really?

183
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,639
You forget your fucking telegram.
The telegram just said, "Hello."

184
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,439
Very simple,
you want to sell me something.

185
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,399
What?

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,119
- We join forces.
- Fuck off.

187
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,159
No! Categorical.

188
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,679
Fucking ridiculous.

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,559
Mr Solomons.

190
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,719
Your distillery provides
one-tenth of your income.

191
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,399
Protection is another 10%.

192
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,879
And the rest you make
from the race tracks.

193
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,639
I know you keep a gun in the drawer.

194
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,199
I know you keep it beside the whisky.

195
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,999
I know you offer a deal or death.

196
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,119
I know what I'm saying makes you angry.

197
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,479
But I am offering you a solution.

198
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,519
You see, Mr Sabini is running
all your bookies off your courses.

199
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,399
And he is closing down the premises
that take your rum.

200
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,799
And people don't trust
your protection any more.

201
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,119
You're the bloke
who shot Billy Kimber, right?

202
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,639
You did, you fucking shot him.
That's you.

203
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,919
You fucking betrayed him, mate.

204
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,319
So it'd be entirely appropriate

205
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,439
to do what I am thinking
in my head to you right now.

206
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
I can offer you 100 good men.

207
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,039
All with weapons.

208
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,639
And a new relationship with the police.

209
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,879
Intelligence.

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,879
Intelligence is a very valuable thing,
innit, my friend?

211
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,839
And usually it comes
far too fucking late.

212
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,719
Let's say that
I shot you already, right,

213
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,639
in the fucking face.

214
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,519
And the bullet goes bone, mush,
bone, cabinet over there.

215
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,959
Which is a shame, innit,

216
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,879
'cause that cabinet's fucked now
and I got to get shot of it.

217
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,719
So, what I'd do is this...

218
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,799
It's fucking simple, mate.

219
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,799
I cut that cabinet in half, don't I?

220
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,959
I do. I just literally...
I cut the cabinet... I cut...

221
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,519
I cut the cabinet
literally in half, mate.

222
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,039
And I take one half
of the cabinet, all right,

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,919
and I put it into a barrel

224
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,519
and I take the other half of the cabinet
and all its pieces

225
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,359
and I put that
into another barrel, right?

226
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,039
And I send this barrel off to Mandalay.

227
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,719
And the other barrel
off to somewhere like...

228
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,359
I don't know...

229
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,999
Timbuktu.

230
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,679
- You ever been?
- No.

231
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,919
No?

232
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,799
Would you like to go?

233
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,599
No.

234
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,919
You know, I always thought that

235
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,639
you'd have a great big
fucking gold ring in your nose.

236
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,839
I'm sorry, go on.

237
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,239
Tell us your plan.

238
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,599
Ada.

239
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,559
How the fuck did you find me?

240
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,399
What, are you reading Polly's letters?

241
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,559
Polly showed me the letter.

242
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,679
Look, you think you're safe
because you moved flat, but you're not.

243
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,799
Polly thinks the same.

244
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,879
When will you understand?
I just want you all out of my life.

245
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,999
Ada.

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,079
Look at us?

247
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,399
And it'll happen again.

248
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,119
Yeah, well, next time I'll be ready.

249
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,759
In fact, I want them to try again
'cause I'll shoot their balls off!

250
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,159
- Ada, put the fucking gun away.
- Get away from me, I'm late for work.

251
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,759
All right, fine. Fine.

252
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,279
Just take this.

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,359
Take it.

254
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,839
Where you're living now is right
on the edge of Sabini's territory

255
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,039
and all the coppers round there
work for him.

256
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,959
I've got a lot of money coming in
that I can't put through the banks.

257
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,559
My accountant says the best thing
is to buy property for cash

258
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,599
and put it in the name
of a family member.

259
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,399
A house? A whole house?

260
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,159
It's all yours.

261
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,119
Four storeys, eight bedrooms,

262
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,839
kitchen, scullery.

263
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,319
Rooms for a maid,
if your political conscience will allow.

264
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,399
At least go and have a look?

265
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,799
Shoot the fucking lot of them.

266
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,719
Mr Sabini?
The police are here.

267
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,759
Tell them to wipe their feet.

268
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,199
So why do I have to tell you everything?

269
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,159
We can't search every train
that comes into London.

270
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,319
They don't use trains, they use boats.

271
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,679
The boatmen are all gypsies.
He's a fucking gypsy.

272
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,840
Why do we have to tell them everything?

273
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,919
Okay, we can't search every boat.

274
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,479
Lucky for me,
I have a boy in the Jews' rum house.

275
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,999
The gypsy went to meet Solomons.

276
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,999
And after, they drank
whisky and shook hands.

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,839
And then Alfie gave him some salt

278
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,759
or some such kike thing
that means peace.

279
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,759
What exactly d'you want us to do,
Mr Sabini?

280
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,879
Did you bring dog shit
in here on your shoes?

281
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,559
Check, have a look.

282
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,159
I can smell something.

283
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,719
You've got photographs
of this Tommy Shelby, though, right?

284
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,519
We have military ID photographs

285
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,959
from his time
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry.

286
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,439
Shelby won medals.

287
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,319
Okay, so you've got his fucking photo.

288
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,119
If he shows his face in Camden Town,
your coppers lift him. All right?

289
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,839
You know...

290
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,159
Sometimes when I smell something,
it's something that's not real,

291
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,759
it's something more like a...
Like a premonition.

292
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,199
It's like sometimes I smell something,
but it's not a smell, it's just...

293
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,759
something isn't right.

294
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,199
Mr Sabini, we'll do everything
we can to deal with this man.

295
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,799
Deal?

296
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,399
Did you say, "Do a deal"?

297
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,999
I didn't mean that.

298
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,639
Fuck.

299
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,959
Fuck.

300
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,279
- You've been fucking got at.
- No, you're being ridiculous.

301
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,199
Somebody's fucking sat you down.

302
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,079
Somebody's fucking sat you down
and talked to you!

303
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,719
- Mr Sabini...
- We should go.

304
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,279
This fucking gypsy has sat down
with the fucking coppers!

305
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,479
Mr Sabini.

306
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,039
And you're taking with
both fucking hands

307
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,959
off of me and off of him!

308
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,639
Okay, so now you fucking follow Shelby.

309
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,959
You fucking follow him
and you finish him!

310
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,119
Shit.

311
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,799
I told youse, boys, 'ere she is.

312
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,999
What the bloody hell is going on?

313
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,159
When did you get back?

314
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,839
I didn't want to miss
your birthday, Pol.

315
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,799
Back to work.

316
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,159
How d'you know it's my birthday?
Nobody ever knows.

317
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,799
It's different this year.

318
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,079
John, Finn, bring the car round.

319
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,159
Where are we going?

320
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,999
To unwrap your birthday present.

321
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,479
After you.

322
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,519
Good morning!

323
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,599
You said you were gonna buy Ada a house.

324
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,199
Yep, that's right, I did.

325
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,519
Just had a bit of cash left over.

326
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,799
This is ours?

327
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,839
No, Polly...

328
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,799
This is yours.

329
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,799
'Cause you deserve it.

330
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,359
What would I do with all these rooms?

331
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,719
Well, you could, relax for one.

332
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,679
Come here at weekends.

333
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,919
It has a garden?

334
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,239
You love gardens.

335
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,879
You can grow roses, Pol.

336
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
I don't know, have a piano.

337
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,359
Have people round,
they can have a singsong?

338
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,199
God help the bloody neighbours.

339
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,439
Fuck the neighbours.

340
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,399
Welcome home, Pol.

341
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,119
Arthur, why don't you
take the boys outside,

342
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,519
wait by the car?

343
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,919
Pol...

344
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,039
I know you haven't
been happy for a while.

345
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,119
And I know why.

346
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,719
Esme is all right, you know?

347
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,479
She's got a good heart, she has.

348
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,879
I've spoken to her and she told me.

349
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,399
Told you what?

350
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,919
She told me what it is
that would make you happy.

351
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,679
I've spoken to our contacts
in the police.

352
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,239
They have contacts in the council,

353
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,479
and they have contacts with the people
who keep the parish records.

354
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,519
Records of adoptions,
and of confidential forced removals.

355
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,399
Now, with your permission,

356
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,119
I'd like to grease a few palms

357
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,279
and take a look at the records
they never showed you.

358
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,599
Pol...

359
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,439
I am going to find your son and daughter
and I'm gonna bring them home.

360
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,959
That's what this house is for.

361
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,759
So that you can bring your family home
where they belong.

362
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,879
We're moving up, Pol.

363
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,839
Go have a look what you think.

364
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,799
Can you hear that?

365
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,679
Silence at last.

366
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,599
And it belongs to us.

367
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,479
Mummy, there's loads of chairs!

368
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,479
What's in there?

369
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,399
Still here?

370
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,999
Well, there's a lot coming in
and a lot going out.

371
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,559
Well, as long as there's more coming in,
we're all right.

372
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,319
This came for you today.

373
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,239
It's all the way from America, New York.

374
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,079
Somewhere called Poughkeepsie?

375
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,279
And the decorators doing The Garrison
want paying.

376
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,199
Arthur forgot and pulled a gun
when they asked, so...

377
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,319
- They've stopped and everything's green.
- All right, well, just pay it.

378
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,719
And we need to put
an advert in the Mail,

379
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,719
"Grand Reopening."

380
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,999
And you said there's a letter
that had to go today.

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,639
Special delivery.

382
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,359
I wrote it in the diary.

383
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,279
Yes, I haven't written it out yet.

384
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,519
Well, you can just tell me
and I'll write it down.

385
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,919
I've learnt shorthand.

386
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,639
Fair enough.

387
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,999
Dear Mr Churchill...

388
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,159
Has your pencil broken?

389
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,679
No. No, do go on.

390
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,279
Dear Mr Churchill...

391
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,839
I've been approached
by an agent of the Crown

392
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,799
to carry out a task, as yet unspecified.

393
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,039
"His name is Major Campbell
and I believe he reports to you."

394
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,359
"Therefore, I decided to make
direct contact with you"

395
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,599
"to make sure that certain things
are clearly understood."

396
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,479
"Mr Churchill, you should know that
I am a former British soldier"

397
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,359
"and if you look at my war record,"

398
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,159
"you will see that I fought bravely
at Verdun and at the Somme."

399
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,919
"Also, you will see
that my actions at Mons"

400
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,519
"saved thousands of Allied lives."

401
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,959
"I know that you resigned
your ministerial position"

402
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,439
"and the safety of an office"

403
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,439
"to go and fight on the front line
with the men."

404
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,639
"I read that you fought bravely,
Mr Churchill."

405
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,679
"Therefore, I hope I will be treated"

406
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,479
"in any dealings we have
with a degree of respect,"

407
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,679
"soldier to soldier."

408
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,239
"My demands are slight and my sacrifice
in service of my country"

409
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,039
"will no doubt once again be great."

410
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,119
"Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby."

411
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,079
Military Medal and the DCM.

412
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,999
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

413
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,879
Hands up in this room,
those who were at the Somme.

414
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,399
Those who were at the Battle of Verdun?

415
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,959
Thomas Shelby was a tunneller.

416
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,639
His demand is rather amusing.

417
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,839
He has asked that the Colonial Office
grant him an Empire export licence.

418
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,039
And specifically a licence
covering India,

419
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,119
Malay Peninsula, Canada and Russia.

420
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,799
He plans to transport
certain manufactured goods

421
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,079
from Birmingham to the Poplar Docks.

422
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,479
And you plan to agree to this demand?

423
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,359
Dear God, Major Campbell...

424
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,919
We will be asking this man to carry out
an assassination on behalf of the Crown,

425
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,799
once more risking his life.

426
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,079
These demands
by comparison are slight

427
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,599
and easily met
with a few quiet words over lunch

428
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,279
with the appropriate ministers.

429
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,879
Sir, with the greatest respect,

430
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,719
Thomas Shelby is a murdering,

431
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,679
cut-throat, mongrel, gangster.

432
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,359
And yet, the tunnels were dug
beneath our feet

433
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,679
to silence the guns
pointed at our heads.

434
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,999
Get Thomas Shelby's
details from Campbell

435
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,879
and get some kind of royal
appointment stamp.

436
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,359
Temporary.

437
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,719
Temporary?

438
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,599
Just until the deed is done.

439
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,679
Agreed, Major Campbell?

440
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,839
And then I can proceed as discussed?

441
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,399
Agreed, sir.

442
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,439
Come on, let's go inside.

443
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,519
Here, pass the ball!

444
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,159
Come on.

445
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,839
Come on in, boys.

446
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,319
Did you have a good game?

447
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,919
I'm starving,
have you done anything for lunch?

448
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,519
It'll be
on in a minute, in you go.

449
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,839
Go in and wash your hands, boys,
all right?

450
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,359
Come on, mister.

451
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,279
Mrs Johnson?

452
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,519
Yes. Who are you?

453
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,319
I'm from Birmingham Council,
Bordesley parish.

454
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,719
No-one wrote to me. What d'you want?

455
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,359
I would like to talk about your son,
about Henry.

456
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,799
Can I come in?

457
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,639
I'd rather you didn't,
he doesn't like to talk about this.

458
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,959
I see.

459
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,679
So what does Henry know
about his real identity, Mrs Johnson?

460
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,919
I only deal with Mr Ross from the agency
and he only ever writes, so...

461
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,559
Why are you here in person?

462
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,159
Well, the boy is approaching
his 18th birthday.

463
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,599
This isn't right!

464
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,999
You're not from the council,
something isn't right.

465
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,479
What does he know, Mrs Johnson?

466
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,039
He knows his mother couldn't cope.

467
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
She drank too much, she used opium.

468
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,639
She used to beat him.

469
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,679
But that isn't the truth, is it?

470
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,639
Look, I think you should come back
when my husband's here.

471
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,479
Does he know what his real name is?

472
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,759
His real name is Johnson, HenryJohnson,

473
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,359
now I would like you to go away
and come back when my husband's here.

474
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,679
The truth is, he was taken
from his mother without her permission.

475
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,719
Henry, go back inside, please.

476
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,839
Who are you?

477
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,519
Please, Henry, go on!

478
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,599
- Your real name is Michael Gray.
- No!

479
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,439
Your real mother wants to see you.

480
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,040
Her address is on the back of this card.

481
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,439
She just wants to talk.

482
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,359
- Go away.
- She just wants to talk.

483
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,079
Go away and leave us alone.

484
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,559
Go away!

485
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,159
Come on, let's go back inside.

486
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,279
Come on, I'll get you something to eat.

487
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,839
Come on, Henry.

488
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,439
Come on. Come on.

489
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,679
Call yourself a Shelby?

490
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,239
Fucking hit him, Finn.

491
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,039
Hit him, that's right.

492
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,199
All right, Isiah, your turn.

493
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,559
Finn! Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, for fuck's sake!

494
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,999
Hit him.

495
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,719
Get him out of there, get him back!

496
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,559
- Get him back!
- Arthur, for fuck's sake!

497
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,039
Get him out of there!

498
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,919
Rockfair is down to sixes.

499
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,279
Right, what happened?

500
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,919
It was a fair fight.

501
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,759
Yeah.

502
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,799
Arthur just caught him with a good 'un.

503
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,439
I saw the body, don't fucking lie to me.

504
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,599
I saw the body, what fucking happened?

505
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,999
I'm not family, I'm saying nothing.

506
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,239
Arthur...

507
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,479
He's blown a few times lately.

508
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,159
Six, seven.

509
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,279
It's like he's not there in the head.

510
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,199
He can't even hear "stop".

511
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,159
Even his own name.

512
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,119
And then he cries.

513
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,239
Right, listen to me.

514
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,439
That's two fucking stories.

515
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,079
Your brother killed a boy.

516
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,479
There were witnesses,
there will be questions,

517
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,559
get your story straight,
it was an accident.

518
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,239
Fuck off.

519
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,679
I spoke to the doctor,

520
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,919
he said the kid
probably had a weak heart.

521
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,359
We'll look after his mother.

522
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,119
It'll be fine.

523
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,679
Polly said I should have stuck
with the medicine.

524
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,279
I said that you know best.

525
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,439
It's like a fucking boat, Tommy.

526
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,239
Full of heavy cargo, like coal or iron.

527
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,119
Sometimes it slips to one end.

528
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,279
And the boat tips.

529
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,399
I can feel it slipping.

530
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,399
And I can feel the boat tipping.

531
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,159
But there ain't nothing
I can do about it.

532
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,839
It's like me fuckin' head's just like
this fuckin' black fucking barge!

533
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,319
And it just fucking drifts

534
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,719
in and out, in and out.

535
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,199
Well, we're home
a long time now, Arthur.

536
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,199
We're home a long time.

537
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,959
- I thought you were all right.
- Yeah, well...

538
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,359
I, I, I don't think I am, Tommy.

539
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,759
Take this fucking thing away from me.

540
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,279
Just fuck off, Arthur.

541
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,399
You know what?

542
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,479
I've had enough.

543
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,839
I've fucking had enough.

544
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,079
Just fuck off!

545
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,679
What?

546
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,919
I'm supposed to treat you
like a fucking kid again?

547
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,799
Keep you away from guns
and fucking rope, is that it?

548
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,479
You think
I haven't got enough on!

549
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,719
- Stop it, Tommy.
- Arthur?

550
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,679
You think I haven't got enough on?

551
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,679
- Stop it.
- The war is done!

552
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,399
- Shut the door on it!
- Stop it.

553
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,279
Shut the door on it like I did?

554
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,879
- Can you do that?
- Yeah?

555
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,119
- Like I fucking did.
- I'm not fucking you.

556
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,279
- Shut the fucking door?
- But I'm not fucking you!

557
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,159
I am not fucking you!

558
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,439
Everyone fucking knows it!

559
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,799
God!

560
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,759
Look at yourself.?

561
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,239
Look at yourself.

562
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,119
Take a long, hard,
fucking look at yourself.

563
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,559
Time for lunch, sir.

564
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,399
I thought we could eat at the desk,
like the old days.

565
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,559
You remembered.

566
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,399
Tongue and pickle, sir.

567
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,239
But it's the single stroke
of mustard, that's the thing.

568
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,759
The fine detail.

569
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,119
Speaking of detail...

570
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,599
How much is Thomas Shelby
paying you in bribes per week?

571
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,119
Actually, I already know.

572
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,159
Two pounds a week, eight pounds a month,
plus extras for specific favours.

573
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,319
When I left, you were an honest man.

574
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,879
And now you're on
the Peaky Blinders' payroll.

575
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,079
Shelby is a worm and feeds off
the rotten parts of your mind.

576
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,759
He gets in through your ear,
with a whisper.

577
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,199
He crawls in over your tongue as you
lie to the judge and the pastor.

578
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,839
Mr Moss...

579
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,439
We are entering a bloody phase
of a bloody war

580
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,759
with no quarter asked or given.

581
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,159
But as of this moment, you are now
back on the side of the angels.

582
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,079
Shelby thinks you work for him,
but in truth, you work for me.

583
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,159
And I will use you mercilessly.

584
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,879
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

585
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,799
As you can see, one is white...

586
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,359
and one is black.

587
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,079
What you saw in your dreams...

588
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,519
was right.

589
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,839
Your daughter is dead.

590
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,639
Um... You do it, I can't read it.

591
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,159
After Anna was taken from you,
she was put with a...

592
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,559
With a family of a
railway station master in Stafford.

593
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,479
She never settled.

594
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,639
So she kept running away.

595
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,639
She got on a train to Birmingham once...

596
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,719
Eventually they sent her to Australia

597
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,959
where she died of something
called spring fever.

598
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,679
So my little Anna travelled
all the way back across the world

599
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,639
to be with me in my dreams?

600
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,639
She came all by herself.

601
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,319
Well...

602
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,839
That's one train
they couldn't get her off.

603
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,599
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

604
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,599
He's in England...

605
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,319
and I know where he lives,
I went there.

606
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,199
- But, Pol...
- And?

607
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,119
Okay, Polly, listen to me.

608
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,879
Just listen to me, please.

609
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,359
Pol!

610
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,599
The woman that he calls "mother"
will never let him come here.

611
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,959
Just tell me where he is, Tommy.

612
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,279
Polly, if you go there and you get mad

613
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,159
and she gets mad
and she calls the police,

614
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,519
they will never let you
anywhere near him

615
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,119
and the boy will get scared.

616
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,079
That's what will happen, Pol.

617
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,399
Polly.

618
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,639
Polly...

619
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,120
You just tell me where he is, Thomas.

620
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,199
Tell me where he is, Thomas!

621
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,679
Polly...

622
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,879
Pulling the gun...

623
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,799
Pulling the gun is why I can't tell you.

624
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,399
Pol, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to wait till he's 18.

625
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,879
Till he's old enough
to make his own decision.

626
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,119
Wait!

627
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,719
You tell me where he is!

628
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,959
If you shoot me, you'll never know.

629
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,039
Mickey!
Hurry up, the party's starting.

630
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,559
Good, carry on.

631
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,759
Finn, where you going?

632
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,919
- To talk to Arthur.
- Right.

633
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,639
Arthur?

634
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,359
Go away.

635
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,759
What's wrong? Why aren't you ready?

636
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,239
For what?

637
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,199
The Garrison.

638
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,119
The reopening of your pub. It's tonight.

639
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,839
Tommy don't want me there.

640
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,239
It was Tommy who told me to get you.

641
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,519
He says it's your name above that door,
so you've got to be there.

642
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,679
No... No, look at me.

643
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,199
I'm staying away.

644
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,759
Go away.

645
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,679
Get out.

646
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,599
I told you to go away.

647
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,959
Sometimes,

648
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,239
when we boys are feeling blue,

649
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,239
this is what we do.

650
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,759
It's called Tokyo.

651
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,919
It's good stuff, Arthur.

652
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,719
It'll help you.

653
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,639
For special occasions.

654
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,839
Boys!

655
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,399
My fucking Garrison!

656
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,319
Take that. Take that an' all.

657
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,919
'Ere you are, Lizzie.
Let me get you a light.

658
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,399
There you go, my darling.

659
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,479
Jeremiah, I'll be with you in a second.

660
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,079
Look at the place!

661
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,439
You all right?

662
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,519
Busier we are, the faster time passes.

663
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,919
Yeah?

664
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,719
Arthur. Tokyo, it's fuel for races?

665
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,759
But you've seen
a doped horse after a race...

666
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,119
Yeah.

667
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,959
Grand openings
and race days only, brother.

668
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,039
- All right?
- Go on then, Tommy!

669
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,519
- There you go, come on, drink up.
- Boys.

670
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,639
- All right, Mick?
- Tom.

671
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,399
Finn! Gimme that.

672
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,479
Keep him off the whisky, John.

673
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,239
Pol.

674
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,319
Ada! I didn't know you were coming.

675
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,599
- There's Aunt Polly.
- Aw.

676
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,959
Hi!

677
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,919
Hey, who's that?

678
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,399
D'you want a cuddle?

679
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,679
Polly, that's right. Take him. Polly...

680
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,959
Ada, why don't you think
about coming home?

681
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,199
Hello, Ada.

682
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,799
Say you'd...

683
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,839
Tommy...

684
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,799
So what do you think?

685
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,359
It's very...

686
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,479
- Gold?
- Yeah.

687
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,159
Hello, Ada.

688
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,719
Hello, trouble, how're you doing?

689
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,119
You're spilling my drink!

690
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,999
Hey, Arthur, look who it is.

691
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,759
So what d'you want me to say to her?

692
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,359
Just talk to her.

693
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,599
No one can get through to her.

694
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,199
Tell her I had no choice.

695
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,159
I appreciate this.

696
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,679
- Hello, brother.
- Ada, come here, you!

697
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,559
You big bear!

698
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,559
Polly? Why don't you come and join us?

699
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,279
- What?
- I'm not an idiot.

700
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,399
He asked you to come, didn't he?

701
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,719
I don't want conversation,
I want an address.

702
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,919
Until I have that,
I've not got anything to say.

703
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,959
Now, it's a party!

704
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,319
Yeah, it is!!

705
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,639
And I'm going to enjoy myself.

706
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,399
No, Pol, don't be silly.

707
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,799
Excuse me?

708
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,319
Would you care to dance?

709
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,639
It'd be my pleasure.

710
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,879
My love, pleasure hasn't even begun.

711
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,199
Excuse me?

712
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,039
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

713
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,839
I was told she lived here at number 17.

714
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,599
I came last night
but there was nobody here.

715
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,799
So I waited.

716
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,679
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

717
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,679
I think she might be my mother.
