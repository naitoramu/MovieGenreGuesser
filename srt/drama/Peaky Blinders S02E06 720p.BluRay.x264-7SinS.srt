1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,999
The pro-treaty Paddies
and the King want the same man dead.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,639
You've been chosen, Mr Shelby.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,959
The Epsom Derby, Pol.
We'll be drinking with the bloody King.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,319
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,576
If we're gonna take him down,
might as well make it there.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,879
It's good to see you, Grace.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,239
Tommy, do you have someone?

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,519
The horse will come fifth or sixth.
But I will win you.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,479
Mr Churchill was impressed.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,559
He has asked that the Colonial Office
grant him an Empire export licence.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,439
I want my son out of prison now.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,519
He can be freed
by tomorrow morning.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,999
I'm talking about
a simple transaction here.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,439
I will carry out
your assassination

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,759
at a place of my choosing.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,199
Epsom.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,519
Derby Day.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,119
My name is Thomas Shelby,

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,559
and today, I'm going to kill a man.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,239
Today is Derby Day.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,319
The murder will take place
this afternoon,

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,159
at the Epsom races.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,359
It may be that I am able to escape
after the killing.

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,559
The odds are not good,
which is why I am writing this letter.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,119
I've been forced by agents of the Crown
to carry out this murder.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,319
In the event of my own death,
I want the following facts to be known.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,839
My family are innocent
of any involvement.

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,719
Who are we?

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,839
Let's go.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,239
And while some of them
may be guilty of other things,

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,199
I've not shared details of this mission
with any of them,

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,479
and no company assets were used.

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,679
Agents of the Crown joined forces
with pro-treaty Fenians

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,119
to arrange this murder.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,959
I believe the governments intend
to falsely blame the anti-treaty IRA.

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,439
Therefore, the bullet I fire
this afternoon

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,159
will be the starting gun
for civil war in Ireland.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,959
The man I have been
instructed to kill

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,399
is Field Marshal Russell.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,519
Formerly a Black and Tan commander
who committed many atrocities

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,719
in the county of Cork.

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,759
There is no remorse in my heart
at the prospect of his death.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,039
However, the conspiracy
behind the killing

44
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,999
is cause for international concern.

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,479
Such is the gravity
of my secret mission,

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,759
that after I have served my purpose,
I believe they intend to kill me.

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,839
Do you want tea?

48
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,559
I therefore want to name
a particular individual in this letter.

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,599
The agent who has initiated
and orchestrated this crime

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,119
is Major Chester Campbell of
the British Secret Intelligence Service.

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,519
He chose me for this dirty business
as an act of vengeance,

52
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,439
prompted by hatred of long standing.

53
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,199
In the event of my death,

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,159
it is imperative
he be brought to justice.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,399
If you are reading this,
then I am dead already.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,399
I hope that, living as you do
in a truly free country,

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,759
you will be able to make the above facts
known to the world.

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,919
Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby.

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,679
Did you one anyway, you ignorant git.

60
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,239
Ada, sit down here for a minute.

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,319
Ada, if anything happens to me today,

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,439
I need you to post this letter.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,799
The stamp's already on.

64
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,679
Don't ask any questions,
it's to do with insurance.

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,079
Look, Tommy,

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,559
whatever it is you're involved in,
just tell us.

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,719
God, you never let anybody in.

68
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,479
We love you, Tom.

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,919
What are you doing up
at 6:00 in the morning?

70
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,799
- Ready?
- What the bloody hell's going on?

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,879
- Little errand.
- What errand?

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,559
- You just have to stand there, Ada.
- Stand where?

73
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,239
- Let's go, come on.
- James, what's going on?

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,519
Don't listen to him, James.
He'll get you killed.

75
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,279
What errand?

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,919
For the cause, Ada.

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,519
The good old cause.

78
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:44,343
<b>WwW.ZooCine.NeT
Watch Movies and Series!</b>

79
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,439
Hands off cocks, on with socks.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,279
One at a time.

81
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,159
One at a time, that's all I ask.

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,119
You're getting out, Mr Shelby.

83
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,999
All 10 witnesses against you
withdrew their statements,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,439
last night.

85
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,799
All at once. 9:00.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,119
Don't ask me why, because I don't know.

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,239
The next 10 minutes, you don't do
or say anything I haven't told you.

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,999
All right?

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,359
- All right?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,199
Hello, Ollie.

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,839
Well, hang on. Just you, yeah?

92
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,319
He stays out here.

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,719
You stay here.

94
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,519
Johnny fucking Dogs.

95
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,959
How did they get me
out of there?

96
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,159
I need to get you to a telephone.
You need to make a call.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,039
It's all part of Tommy's plan.

98
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,399
Apparently.

99
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,639
That'll probably be for you, won't it?

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,599
Hello?

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,719
Arthur.

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,759
You're out.

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,399
Right, so that'll be your side
of the street swept up, won't it?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,399
Where's mine?

105
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,599
What you got for me?

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,119
Signed by
the Minister of the Empire himself.

107
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,279
Yeah? So it is.

108
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,519
This means that you can put
your rum in our shipments,

109
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,559
and no one at Poplar Docks
will lift a canvas.

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,119
You know what? I'm not even going
to have my lawyer look at that.

111
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,879
- I know, it's all legal.
- You know what,

112
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,359
mate, I trust you. That's that. Done.

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,199
So, whisky...

114
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,079
There is, one thing, though,
that we do need to discuss.

115
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,359
- What would that be?
- It says here, "20%"

116
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,599
"paid to me of your export business."

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,079
- As we agreed on the telephone...
- No, no, no, no, no.

118
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,759
See, I've had my lawyer
draw this up...

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,559
for us, just in case.

120
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,239
It says that, here, that 100%

121
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,919
of your business goes to me.

122
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,679
- I see.
- It's there. Right.

123
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,559
Don't worry about it, right,
'cause it's totally legal binding.

124
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,399
All you have to do is sign the document
and transfer the whole lot over to me.

125
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,159
- Sign just here, is it?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,319
I see. That's funny. That is.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,599
- What?
- No, that's funny.

128
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,079
"I'll give you 100% of my business."

129
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,879
Yeah.

130
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,399
Why?

131
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,959
Ollie, no. No, no, no.

132
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,039
Put that down.
He understands, he understands.

133
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,319
He's a big boy, he knows the road.
Now, look,

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,399
it's just non-fucking-negotiable.

135
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,639
That's all you need to know.

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,959
So all you have to do
is sign the fucking contract.

137
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,439
- Right there.
- Just sign here?

138
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,799
- With your pen.
- I understand.

139
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,879
Good. Get on with it.

140
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,319
Well, I have an associate
waiting for me at the door.

141
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,719
I know that he looks like a choir boy,
but he is actually an anarchist

142
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,439
- from Kentish Town.
- Tommy...

143
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,879
I'm going to fucking shoot you.

144
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,279
All right?

145
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,799
Now, when I came in here, Mr Solomons,

146
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,079
I stopped to tie my shoelace.
Isn't that a fact?

147
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
Ollie?

148
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,879
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

149
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,319
And while I was doing it,

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,919
I laid a hand grenade
on one of your barrels,

151
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,119
Mark 15, with wired trip.

152
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,479
And my friend upstairs...

153
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,319
Well, he's like one of those anarchists
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

154
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,839
He's a professional.

155
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,839
And he's in charge of the wire.

156
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,119
If I don't walk out that door
on the stroke of 7:00,

157
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,199
he's going to trigger the grenade and...

158
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,399
your very combustible rum
will blow us all to hell.

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,919
And I don't care...

160
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,119
'cause I'm already dead.

161
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,999
He tied his lace, Alfie.

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,639
- And there is a kid at the door.
- From a good family, too.

163
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,159
Ollie, it's shocking what they become...

164
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,319
What were you doing when this happened?

165
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,279
He tied his lace, nothing else.

166
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,799
Yeah, but what were you doing?

167
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,999
I was marking the runners in the paper.

168
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,559
What are you doing?

169
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,119
Just checking the time. Carry on.

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,799
Right, Ollie, I want you to go outside,
yeah, and shoot that boy in the face

171
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,399
from the good family, all right?

172
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,919
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

173
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,119
- He tied his fucking lace...
- I did tie my lace.

174
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,479
I bet, 100 to 1,

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,559
you're fucking lying, mate.
That's my money.

176
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,999
Well, see, you've failed
to consider the form.

177
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,319
I did blow up me own pub...

178
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,679
for the insurance.

179
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,679
OK right...
Well, considering the form,

180
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,839
I would say 65 to 1 . Very good odds.

181
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,039
And I would be more than happy
and agree

182
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,559
if you were to sign over
65% of your business to me.

183
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,599
- Thank you.
- Sixty-five? No deal.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,479
- Ollie, what do you say?
- Jesus Christ, Alfie.

185
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,439
He tied his fucking lace, I saw him!

186
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,199
He planted a grenade, I know he did.

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,359
Alfie, it's Tommy fucking Shelby...

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,999
You're behaving like a fucking child.

189
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,039
This is a man's world.

190
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,959
Take your apron off,

191
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,239
and sit in the corner like a little boy.

192
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,079
Fuck off. Now.

193
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,559
- Four minutes.
- All right, four minutes.

194
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,799
Talk to me about hand grenades.

195
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,959
The chalk mark on the barrel,
at knee height.

196
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,559
It's a Hamilton Christmas.

197
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,839
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

198
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,639
Based on this...

199
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,679
forty-five percent.

200
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,759
- Thirty.
- Fuck off, Tommy.

201
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,319
That's far too little.

202
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,119
In France, Mr Solomons,
while I was a tunneller, a clay-kicker.

203
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,999
179.

204
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,599
I blew up Schwaben Höhe.

205
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,239
Same kit I'm using today.

206
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,839
It's funny, that.

207
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,559
I do know the 179.

208
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,679
And I heard they all got buried.

209
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,719
Three of us dug ourselves out.

210
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,959
Like you're digging yourself out now?

211
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,159
Like I'm digging now.

212
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,239
Fuck me.

213
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,479
Listen, I'll give you 35%.

214
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,519
That's your lot.

215
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,079
Thirty-five.

216
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,799
- You're late.
- Hey, it's my business.

217
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,999
How the fuck did you
get me out of that?

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,959
I need you today, brother.

219
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,039
I pulled some strings.

220
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,679
- You all right?
- I am now.

221
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,239
So Arthur's back in charge now?

222
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,159
He's in charge of you,
and you're both in charge of him.

223
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,359
Look-out duties only today.

224
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,799
- Tom, I'm getting sick of this...
- Finn.

225
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,399
You don't obey orders, you don't come.

226
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,359
- Johnny Dogs.
- Tommy.

227
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,799
- Your boys will meet us there?
- Well, at least they'll be there,

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,999
Captain.

229
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,119
- Captain?
- We promoted you.

230
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,319
Well, the boys decided you're no longer
like a Sergeant Major.

231
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,359
Fucking those rich women
and using those fancy words.

232
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,799
I'd say you're more like a captain
these days.

233
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,679
Fine, well, I'll take it
as a compliment.

234
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,079
Just don't bloody shoot me.

235
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,519
Let's go to the Derby, boys.

236
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,039
All right, then! Load 'em up!

237
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,519
Hello.

238
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
No, I'm afraid Mr Shelby is in London.

239
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,359
He can't be reached.

240
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,479
No, he won't be back today.

241
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,679
He's at the races.
The Epsom races, the Epsom Derby.

242
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,279
Can I ask who's calling?

243
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm going to the station.

244
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,639
- What's that?
- That money's yours.

245
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,839
You take the money, you get a train,

246
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,039
you start a new life in London.

247
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,279
I don't want to see you here
when I get back.

248
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,119
If I get back.

249
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,559
Everything's an "if"
in this Birmingham life.

250
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,039
You can write on Sundays
and visit on holy days.

251
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,159
But I want you to wash this city
out of your hair and your clothes.

252
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,919
It's what I should have done
at the start.

253
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,959
Now I've got business to attend to.

254
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,039
I do love you, Michael.

255
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,679
I love you too.

256
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,199
You'll miss your train.

257
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,879
Me beloved greyhounds.

258
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,159
Behold.

259
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,359
Today's rabbit.

260
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,399
When I give you the signal, I want you
to send that man to his maker.

261
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,519
I decided to use you men
because I couldn't trust

262
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,999
the hearts and the livers
of the English pansies and posies

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,959
they'd given me as operatives.

264
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,959
Right.

265
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,079
This is a man of some capability,

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,919
but I expect no excuses and no failures.

267
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,519
The Red Right Hand
of the Ulster Volunteer Force

268
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,719
will not let you down, Mr Campbell.

269
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,479
The Red Right Hand.

270
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,279
Good luck, gentlemen.

271
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,839
Gentlemen, today,
we are not fucking about.

272
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,519
I hope you've all obeyed instructions

273
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,439
and brought loaded firearms with you.

274
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
Very good.

275
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,039
You will all know that if you are lifted
on a racetrack these days

276
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,919
with a loaded weapon, you get 20 years.

277
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,679
That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

278
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,359
Because today, there will be
no coppers around to lift you.

279
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,719
At exactly 3:00, there will be
an incident in the owners' enclosure

280
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,399
and all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

281
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,519
They will be looking for someone.

282
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,159
- So you will be free to operate at will.
- Looking for who?

283
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,119
Me. They will be looking for me.

284
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
Now, while the coppers are busy with me,

285
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,479
you will make your move
on Sabini's pitches.

286
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,199
You will confiscate his takings,
you'll destroy his licences,

287
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,519
and you do it at gunpoint.

288
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,399
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

289
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,159
We should aim to complete the takeover
without a shot being fired, understood?

290
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,639
And remember, the licences are
more important than the takings.

291
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,679
All right. Before the fun begins,

292
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,039
you can all lay 10 bob
on Nom de Guerre.

293
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,199
I hear she's going to win.

294
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,919
Only beer beforehand, boys, and plenty
of time for rum and whisky after.

295
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,319
And remember,
do not make a move until 3:00.

296
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,999
When the coppers leave. That is all.

297
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,599
Incident? What are you going to do

298
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,279
that's going to make every copper
at the Derby look the other way?

299
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,079
Trust me, brother.

300
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,119
Ten, please.

301
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,719
She threw a shoe coming out of the box.

302
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,719
She looks in fine shape.

303
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,439
Hello, hello, hello.

304
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,719
I missed you, buck. Missed you, buck.

305
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,999
- Should I be worried?
- You should not.

306
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,599
Go and drink, enjoy the day. I'll come
and find you when the race is done.

307
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,079
That's nice. Is that yours?

308
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,399
My mother wore it to the Derby in 1895.

309
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,439
She was presented to Queen Victoria.

310
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,399
After the race,
I'll change in the horse box

311
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,080
and then come and join you up there
with the toffs, what do you say?

312
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,159
Yeah.

313
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,599
You don't want me to join you.

314
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,039
It's fine.
I'll stay down here in the mud.

315
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,159
Whatever happens today, it was good.

316
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,359
You mean, win or lose?

317
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,439
Yeah. Win or lose.

318
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,039
You know, I never watch the race.
Can't stand it.

319
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,879
I always like to find somewhere
dark and quiet.

320
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,119
Tommy?

321
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,279
If you can't find me up there,

322
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,199
I'll come and find you later.

323
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,319
What do you mean?

324
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,959
Whatever happens, May,

325
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,639
no regrets. No regrets.

326
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,719
And I will find you.

327
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,319
All right.

328
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,119
Remember that.

329
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,199
Bye.

330
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
Put this on Nom de Guerre.

331
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,039
Good day, sir.

332
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,679
There he is.

333
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,599
Fucking meatball blokes.

334
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,719
Right, let's go.

335
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,879
I have to talk to you.

336
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,079
- Grace. What are you doing here?
- I have to talk to you.

337
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,519
Grace.

338
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,319
This is not a good time.

339
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,919
What's all this about? Please excuse us.

340
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,119
Whatever it is, Grace,
it'll have to wait.

341
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,159
It can't wait.
It wasn't me who is at fault.

342
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,559
I'm pregnant.

343
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,919
The baby's yours.

344
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,119
Better believe...

345
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,919
Make your husband believe that it's his.

346
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,599
Is that what you want me to do?

347
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,599
Grace, I seriously have things to do.

348
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,159
It's not worth the toss
of a coin this time?

349
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,639
Grace, I have things to do.
When they are...

350
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,159
When they are done, I will decide.

351
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,719
- When will that be?
- After the race.

352
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,399
After the race?
After the fucking race, Tommy?

353
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,479
When the race is over
I will decide what to do.

354
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,719
What to fucking do, all right?

355
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,879
But Tommy...
I was right not to tell him?

356
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,639
I could have phoned him and lied,
but I didn't.

357
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
Just tell me that I was right.

358
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,839
Not to phone and lie.
Agree with that, Tommy.

359
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,959
Yes. Yes, Grace.

360
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,559
Because the thing is...

361
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,119
I love you, not him.

362
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,279
That is a thing.

363
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,079
A baby, Thomas.

364
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,919
Yes.

365
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,519
- Go to your race.
- Where will you be?

366
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,959
I'll be waiting.

367
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,039
I'll wait where they lay their bets.

368
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,159
Found a lost sheep.

369
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,319
Come on, Lizzie.

370
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,879
- What do you think?
- About what?

371
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,639
- About the dress?
- Undo two buttons. Come on!

372
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,599
Tommy, I never thought
I'd see the like of this.

373
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,079
Yeah.

374
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,279
But I do know that
I'm here to work,

375
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,119
so you may have noticed
I haven't taken a drink.

376
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,519
Well, here.

377
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,919
Take this. You might need it.

378
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,439
What's the work you want me
to do here today, Tommy?

379
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,079
Is it taking notes in a meeting?

380
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,999
No, Lizzie.
You're not here to take notes.

381
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,639
My shorthand won't be required.

382
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,239
Lizzie...

383
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,799
There's a man here
and I need him separated from the crowd

384
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,039
- and taken to a quiet place.
- A quiet place...

385
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,959
- Lizzie, I know what I said.
- Yeah, you know.

386
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,959
You know, you told me I shouldn't
do that kind of work any more.

387
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,319
I just need you to isolate him, is all.

388
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,639
No exceptions, you said.

389
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,359
I've drawn a map, all right,

390
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,319
of where exactly you need to take him.

391
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,919
For months I made no exceptions
because you told me not to.

392
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,319
Lizzie...

393
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,039
Just keep him busy.
I have the place marked with an "X"

394
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,839
and I'll get to you before it can start,
I promise. All right?

395
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,079
I mustn't smudge my eyes,
he might not like that.

396
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,439
Lizzie...

397
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,919
this is the only time.
After this, never again.

398
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,319
All right, I'll pay an extra five...

399
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,399
Do not talk to me about money now.

400
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,639
Not right now, I swear
I'll break this glass in your eyes.

401
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,519
No exceptions,
there's been no hardship.

402
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,919
You know why?

403
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,079
Doesn't matter.

404
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,799
Who is he?

405
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,079
To your right. Soldier.

406
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,799
Smoking a cigarette.
Just be alone with him at 3:00.

407
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,239
When the race starts,
and I'll do the rest. Yeah?

408
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,919
Got a piece of chalk?

409
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,799
- Chalk?
- It's how the soldiers know.

410
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,239
It doesn't matter,
just give me the fucking chalk.

411
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,279
Lizzie, it's gonna be all right.?

412
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,239
I'll get to you, I promise.
Before it can start.

413
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,959
I will be there.

414
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,959
Keep them fuckin' guns ready.
Keep them guns ready.

415
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,519
Coppers aren't moving.
Stood there like fucking gargoyles.

416
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,119
Keep your wits about you,
boys, all right?

417
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,839
Ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,679
the race will begin in four minutes.

419
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,159
So please make your way trackside.

420
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,479
Shouldn't you be busy?

421
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,399
When you've planned
something well,

422
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,239
there's no need to rush.

423
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,639
Do you know something?

424
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,599
I actually trust you to do this.

425
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,479
Do you think there might be some...

426
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,399
measure of respect
developing between us?

427
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,239
Ladies and gentlemen,

428
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,599
runners and riders are coming to order,
please take your seats.

429
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,559
Old foes that have grown
to admire each other,

430
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,359
and see each other's
professional virtues.

431
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,879
Personally, I think not.

432
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,439
I think not.

433
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,639
Well, I drink to that.

434
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,919
Ladies and gentlemen,

435
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,239
please be upstanding
for the national anthem.

436
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,959
It's always the plan
that you'll stay together forever.

437
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,559
Or perhaps she'll whore for you,

438
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,879
take her husband's money.
Is that the plan?

439
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,519
How wrong I was about her.

440
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,759
I was wrong about her as well.

441
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,719
You once said to me,

442
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,879
that men like us can never be loved.

443
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,559
She loves me. She told me.

444
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,359
She loves me.

445
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,159
And all you got was a bullet
and a fucking wolf head cane.

446
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,319
Well. Bully for you.

447
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,879
This I know.

448
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,119
Ahead of you is damnation,

449
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,319
but I have the love of God,

450
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,599
and the certainty of salvation.

451
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,719
I know what you did to Polly.

452
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,999
I know what happened
to my uncle in jail.

453
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,879
Today, it'll be me dead,

454
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,479
or you, but whoever it is,

455
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,119
gonna wake up in hell tomorrow.

456
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,319
Ladies and gentlemen,

457
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,719
the runners and riders
are under starter's orders.

458
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,079
And they're off!

459
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,479
Come on girl, come on.

460
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,599
At least make a showing.

461
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,679
Come on, Tommy.

462
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,639
What a pretty dress.

463
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,599
Take it off.

464
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,119
Let's take this off first, shall we?

465
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,479
Lift up your dress
and show me that you're clean.

466
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,479
Do as you're told!

467
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,239
We should take it slow, we've got time.

468
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,799
- This area's closed off.
- What?

469
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,239
The King will be coming this way
after the race.

470
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,879
- This area is secure!
- But I need to...

471
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,039
You'll have to go round.

472
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,639
- Get the fuck off!
- You bitch!

473
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,879
Fuck off!

474
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,799
Get the fuck off me!

475
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,919
Hey!

476
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,079
Russell!

477
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,159
Fuck!

478
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,879
Stop it!

479
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,799
- Lizzie...
- Where were you?

480
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,679
- Where the fuck were you?
- Give me the gun, Lizzie.

481
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,719
Lizzie, Lizzie.

482
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,119
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck off, fuck off!

483
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,599
Just go.

484
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,439
Go on, go!

485
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,799
Officers. Officers!

486
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,079
I was taking a shit

487
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,479
and I heard voices, Irish voices
and I heard a shot.

488
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,199
I swear to God,
there's a soldier lying dead in there.

489
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,239
Get every man in uniform
around the King.

490
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,959
Every man in uniform around the King.
Right now!

491
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,639
The IRA are on the course.

492
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,879
Everyone to the King.

493
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,199
All right, my pretty boys. This is it.

494
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,039
Right. Ready.
You get round the back.

495
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,559
Come on. Don't bunch.

496
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
Right, you stay with us.
I want you to stay back!

497
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,279
Let's go!

498
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,359
Put your hands in the air!

499
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,399
Turn around!

500
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,679
Is there a problem?

501
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,399
Fenians on the course.

502
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
A soldier's been shot, someone said
there was an Irishman in here.

503
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,279
That is correct.

504
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,079
Very sorry, sir.

505
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,399
Check the security to His Majesty.

506
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,439
I will now take your mind off
the situation.

507
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,879
Mr Sabini, you're late.
Have a seat.

508
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,119
What happened to your nose?

509
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,039
You want to have that brother
of yours put down.

510
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,719
I tried that. He bit the vet.

511
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,919
I've told the coppers that you're
a fucking gypsy racketeer Peaky Blinder.

512
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,759
They're coming.
They're gonna throw you out.

513
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,439
Before the King comes up here.

514
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,239
Well, from what I saw
the police are a bit busy right now.

515
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,159
Did you win any money today, Mr Sabini?

516
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,799
Where are the coppers?

517
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,879
Said to that sergeant, "one minute",
he said, "two", it's fucking ten!

518
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,039
Like I told you, they're a bit busy.
Same as my boys.

519
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,319
- What the fuck does that mean?
- What does that mean?

520
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,119
Well, my boys are on the track.

521
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,999
They're having a little bonfire.

522
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,559
Gaming licences, you know.

523
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,559
Fuck!

524
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,679
You place too much reliance on
the police for your security, Mr Sabini.

525
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,279
That was a mistake.

526
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,159
You're gonna now
think about who you are,

527
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,359
think about where you are.

528
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,399
You pull a weapon,
you are the King's assassin.

529
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,799
Now sit down, stay calm.

530
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,999
Good.

531
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,119
Now your next mistake, Mr Sabini,

532
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,159
was breaking your promise
with Alfie Solomons.

533
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,599
You promised Alfie
that his bookies could come to Epsom.

534
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,439
He was very hurt when you said no.

535
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,999
He was very hurt.

536
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,079
That's why me and Alfie
are back in business.

537
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,439
Hold it! Hold it!

538
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,039
It's all right,
it's all right, Officers.

539
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,079
He's just a bad loser.
What the fuck? Hey!

540
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,279
You fucking lose,
you fucking gypsy bastard!

541
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
You lose!

542
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,839
What the fuck are you looking at?

543
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,199
Step back, move.

544
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,999
You're now a prisoner
of the Red Right Hand.

545
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,599
Now, take his hat and gun.

546
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,159
Get him up.

547
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,719
Easy.

548
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,599
Take a seat.

549
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,959
Sit down!

550
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,679
That's it.

551
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,559
You make yourself nice and comfortable.

552
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,999
We're just going for a wee drive,
Mr Shelby.

553
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,159
Let's go.

554
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,319
I guessed and then John confirmed it.

555
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,199
Guessed what?

556
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,119
Who are you?

557
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,279
I'm May Carleton.

558
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,719
I train Tommy Shelby's horse.

559
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,519
And you're the woman who he said
was going to sail away.

560
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,839
I see he didn't tell you about me.

561
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,879
He did tell me about you,
I wonder if that's significant.

562
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,079
Tell me what about you?

563
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,999
Do you have any idea where he is?

564
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,119
I'm waiting for him here.

565
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,559
There's been trouble on the track.

566
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,119
All the bookies have had
their licences burnt.

567
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,559
Shouldn't you be down with the horses?

568
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,960
Which means they'll have to re-apply
for their legal pitches.

569
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,199
It's all part of Tommy's plan
for the future.

570
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,319
What do you know about Tommy's future?

571
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,479
The applications will be denied,
of course.

572
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,999
Then all the pitches will be
allocated instead to Tommy's bookies.

573
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,159
I know because I'll make sure of it.

574
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,079
I have influence with the board.

575
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,039
- There's business and there's love.
- Is there?

576
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,839
There's Thomas Shelby.

577
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,079
- What do you want from him?
- Same as you.

578
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,679
I want to feel alive.

579
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,239
Did he tell you my name?

580
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,479
My name is Grace.

581
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,039
In your statement
to the House, sir,

582
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,159
I believe that you should say
that witnesses

583
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,759
heard the killer say that

584
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
they were members of the IRA
and that the killing was in retribution

585
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,559
for actions of the Field Marshal
in County Cork.

586
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,879
Our friend from Birmingham?

587
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,639
He's been taken care of.

588
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,479
A very good day, sir.

589
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,439
Thank...

590
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,239
Sorry, I must go.

591
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,879
Goodbye.

592
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,719
Polly.

593
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,239
Tommy told me you'd be here.

594
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,439
And I told Tommy it should be me
who finishes you.

595
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,759
Small and weak.

596
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,279
That's how you like it, isn't it?

597
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,199
Well, this time small and weak
has got a gun.

598
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,479
No, you wouldn't do that here.

599
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,839
No.

600
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,079
Do you see any coppers?

601
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,919
Well, I don't.

602
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,119
They're all around your precious King.

603
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,199
Polly, Polly...

604
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,519
- Some part of you...
- I have no parts.

605
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,199
Some part of you wanted me as well.

606
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,159
I know that, I felt it.

607
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,919
And sure as hell some part of me
wants you still.

608
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,799
And not just that part, but...

609
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,959
some part of my soul.

610
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,679
Some part of my soul.

611
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,279
Curious how that is to me
and curious that it should be you.

612
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,879
Opposites perhaps.

613
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,599
Opposite, and that...

614
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,039
That thing sticking in my heart,

615
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,159
you own, you own part of that heart,
you do.

616
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,559
You do, Polly. You do.

617
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,959
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

618
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,279
Let's get you home.

619
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,679
Come on.

620
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,479
Look at this place, we own it!

621
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,399
Put your money away
before I take it off ya.

622
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,239
- Fuckin' clean up!
- Get up!

623
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,799
Lizzie, what the fuck
are you doing here?

624
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,199
- Working for Tommy, same as all of us.
- You work for the Blinders.

625
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,759
- What happened to you?
- Fell over.

626
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,519
Don't fuckin' give me that.

627
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,439
Lizzie...

628
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,119
Come here, come here.
Come here, come here.

629
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,959
Were you working?

630
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,839
Yeah?

631
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,279
Thought you'd earn yourself a few bob
at the races?

632
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,519
It's gotta stop, Lizzie.

633
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,919
It's gotta stop,
Tommy's already told you.

634
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,359
Toffs at the races are the worst,
you know that.

635
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,639
Hey, come here, come here.
Look at me.

636
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,279
Cheer up.

637
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,639
We won.

638
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,479
We fucking took Epsom.

639
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,879
We kicked the Cockneys' fucking arses.

640
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,439
Congratu-fucking-lations.

641
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,399
We fucking beat them, all right.

642
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,999
John didn't even shoot his gun!

643
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,999
We're kings! Kings of the fucking world!

644
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,119
John, I don't see the same thing
in your eyes that I see in Tommy's.

645
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,839
You should get out.

646
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,519
Where is Tommy, anyway?

647
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,599
Any of you boys in France?

648
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,559
You know, I wouldn't mind a cigarette.

649
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,159
The Somme.

650
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,919
Black Woods.

651
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,199
Somme, the Bulls.

652
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,079
Smoke.

653
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:49,040
So fucking close.

654
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,479
And there's a woman.

655
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,279
Yeah.

656
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,639
A woman...

657
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,239
who I love...

658
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,919
and I got close.

659
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,039
Nearly got fucking everything!

660
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,759
What the fuck?

661
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,879
Get it done, boys.

662
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,079
Comrade,

663
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,559
we have our orders,

664
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,999
you know how it is.

665
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,479
I know how it is.

666
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,479
In the bleak midwinter.

667
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,679
At some point in the near future,

668
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,679
Mr Churchill will want to speak to you
in person, Mr Shelby.

669
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,679
He has a job for you.

670
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,359
We will be in touch.

671
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,319
Get out of the grave, tinker.

672
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,839
Be on your fucking way!

673
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,079
Fuck!

674
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,999
Right!

675
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,599
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to raise a toast.

676
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,399
- To the Small Heath Rifles.
- Small Heath Rifles.

677
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,159
To the Lane Boys.

678
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,479
And to the Peaky fucking Blinders.

679
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,519
Who's gonna stop us?

680
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,439
Nobody.

681
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,199
Polly and I had a bet.

682
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,119
One of us bet

683
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,839
you'd take the money and go.

684
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,119
And one of us bet you'd still be here.

685
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,479
She wants me to stay.

686
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,279
You know something, Michael?

687
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,559
What Polly wants

688
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,879
will always be a mystery to me.

689
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,359
I've decided.

690
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,399
I want to make real money

691
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,839
with you.

692
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,719
I've got some ideas, Michael.

693
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,239
For the future of the company.

694
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,679
And also,
I'm planning on getting married.

695
00:58:58,003 --> 00:59:15,303
