1
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:03,155
- Good morning, Officer.
- Sir, can you turn the music down?

2
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:06,978
Down means off.

3
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,017
You know why I pulled
you over this morning?

4
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,515
Well...
I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.

5
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,798
I've been using the cruise control,
so I...

6
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:19,431
No, sir. Your windshield.

7
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,446
License and registration, please.

8
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,321
Right.

9
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:34,157
This was from Wayfarer 515.

10
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:37,449
My house was in the debris field.

11
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:44,007
And that's
what shattered my windshield...

12
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,660
some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

13
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:47,935
I understand.

14
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:56,047
You know of Flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

15
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,867
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

16
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:01,265
I was one of the first responders
on the scene that day.

17
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,931
Then what are you doing?

18
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,356
Citing you, sir.

19
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,399
{\What, }You don't believe me?

20
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:10,649
Regardless of how
that windshield was damaged,

21
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,836
this car is unsafe to drive
in this condition.

22
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,661
Stay in the car, please.

23
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,910
{\Wait. }Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

24
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:22,976
{\Sir, }I asked you to stay in the vehicle.

25
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:25,414
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...

26
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,343
No. You listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.

27
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,425
{\Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath, calm down. And get back in that car now.}Calm down and get back in that car.

28
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,964
This is America. I have rights.
Do you understand that?

29
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:36,967
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

30
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,792
- {\I need you to }Step back right now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

31
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,640
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you

32
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,526
that my house
was in the debris field.

33
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,488
Do you have the remotest
inkling of what that means?

34
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:50,776
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house

35
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:54,860
{\Sir, I need you to step back now.}where my children sleep!
There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,821
- Sir, this is your last warning.
- You gotta be kidding me!

37
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,615
{\You got about two seconds to stand down, or }I'm gonna pepper spray you.

38
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,367
You're gonna pepper spray?
Perfect!

39
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:04,328
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man

40
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,164
who's expressing his opinion
under the First Amendment!

00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:35,715
Lastly, a little something
from down El Paso way.

44
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:38,804
Border Patrol came across
multiple homicides

45
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,050
just this side of the border.

46
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:45,152
Truck turn out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez and Laredo.

47
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,534
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek with these <i>polleros</i>

48
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,706
for two years.

49
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:52,079
{\pos(192,220)}But this time,
as soon as they made it across,

50
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:53,359
{\pos(192,220)}someone hit them.

51
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:54,684
{\pos(192,220)}Hit them hard.

52
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:57,317
{\pos(192,220)}We're talking a driver
and nine illegals.

53
00:04:57,442 --> 00:04:58,741
{\pos(192,220)}No sign of the shooters.

54
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,884
{\pos(192,220)}This truck was carrying
more than just people.

55
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:03,339
{\pos(192,220)}What are we looking at?
Weed, coke, or meth?

56
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,375
{\pos(192,220)}Doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

57
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,443
{\pos(192,220)}Why did the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

58
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,318
{\pos(192,220)}They didn't. I pulled it.

59
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:12,619
{\pos(192,220)}You ask me,
this high-end cartel work.

60
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:14,094
{\pos(192,220)}Los Zetas, maybe.

61
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,947
{\pos(192,220)}Question is,
why do we have Juarez-style action

62
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:19,722
{\pos(192,220)}on our side of the DMZ?

63
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,363
{\pos(192,220)}They sending a message
or clearing a path?

64
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,918
{\pos(192,220)}Or was this about
stopping one particular border-hopper?

65
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,662
{\pos(192,220)}Maybe one of those extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

66
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,425
{\pos(192,220)}Anyway, keep your eyes open.

67
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,150
{\pos(192,220)}All right. That's it.
Slow news day.

68
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,064
{\pos(192,220)}Add one more to the countdown.

69
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:38,911
What's that, Gomie?

70
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,424
We're waiting
on that famous blue meth of yours.

71
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,542
{\pos(192,220)}29 days since we saw it last.

72
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:46,179
{\pos(192,220)}It's still out there. Don't worry.

73
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,524
Local PD. I gotta take this.

74
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,692
{\pos(192,205)}Gomie, go beat your <i>pinata</i>.

75
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,617
{\pos(192,205)}Rest of you jokers...
too damn quiet in here.

76
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,682
{\pos(192,220)}Go catch some bad guys.

77
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,523
What's up, Paul?

78
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,946
{\pos(192,205)}Hey, Dad.

79
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:02,895
- So you're fixing up the house?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

80
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,809
I'll bounce. It's cool.

81
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,147
You doing okay?

82
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:17,061
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by

83
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:19,534
{\pos(192,205)}and saw the sign.

84
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,775
{\pos(192,205)}So, you're selling the place.

85
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:25,147
In this market.

86
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:26,722
Can you believe it?

87
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,953
{\pos(192,205)}I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

88
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:33,697
{\pos(192,205)}Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

89
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:36,060
{\pos(192,205)}We did, all new stucco,
all the master suite,

90
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,635
{\pos(192,205)}sandblasted,
fumigated the basement...

91
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:42,949
{\pos(192,205)}Right on.

92
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,218
{\pos(192,180)}Fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

93
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,836
{\pos(192,205)}I read that in...
I want to say, like,

94
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,244
{\pos(192,205)}<i>Time magazine.</i>

95
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:58,220
{\pos(192,205)}So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

96
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:01,272
{\pos(192,205)}All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens,

97
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,940
{\pos(192,205)}granite countertops, new appliances...
all top of the line.

98
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,516
{\pos(192,205)}Damn.
That's great, Dad.

99
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,114
Think... I can get a tour?

100
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,830
{\pos(192,205)}These guys are trying to finish up.

101
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,889
{\pos(192,205)}Maybe we'd better
stay out of their way.

102
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,268
There are pictures on the Web site,
if you wanna take a look.

103
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,761
{\pos(192,205)}You're looking healthy.

104
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:32,066
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.

105
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,381
{\pos(192,205)}Thanks.

106
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,310
You know, I could come by

107
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,054
{\pos(192,205)}sometime for... dinner or something.

108
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:46,381
Sometime.

109
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:53,822
Later, Dad.

110
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,831
<i>You know, look,</i>

111
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:11,559

teacher over at Wynne.</i>

114

118

{\pos(192,205)}You remember Officer Cavanaugh?

119
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:49,646
Officer, I'm very sorry
that I lost my temper.

120
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:53,318
There's no excuse for my behavior.

121
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:55,369
It was disrespectful.

122
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,644
She's divorcing me.

123
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,951
I don't know
what to tell you, buddy.

124
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:32,665
It is what it is.

125
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,364
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

126
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,453
She said that?

127
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,366
You don't write? You don't call?

128
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,712
It's a disaster.

129
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:24,684
It is not a disaster.

130
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,770
It's not a disaster, all right?

131
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:31,353
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.

132
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,928
You wanna know why?

133
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:34,546
One word:

134
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:36,305
"blowback".

135
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,323
If she blabs,

136
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,000
it'll be a disaster...

137
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,125
for her.

138
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,661
That DEA brother-in-law?

139
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:46,407
Screwed.

140
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,158
You were right under his nose.

141
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,462
He'll be lucky if they let
him bust glue-sniffers

142
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:51,987
at the hobby shop.

143
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,910
The kids...
Paging Dr. Phil.

144
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:58,751
My daddy's a drug dealer,
and my mommy turned him in.

145
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,004
And the house... gone.

146
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,088
The feds will come and RICO her
and the kids out on the street.

147
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:06,058
Good luck arguing with them on that.

148
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,026
No. It's not gonna happen.

149
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,594
She's bluffing,

150
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,806
and she knows it.

151
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:20,825
Her going to the police

152
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,468
is not the point, Saul.

153
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,090
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

154
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,842
I've lost my family,

155
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,369
everything that I care about.

156
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:35,277
Buddy,

157
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:38,215
it's bad.

158
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:40,589
It's a calamity,

159
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,706
but we live to fight another day.

160
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,937
And after a decent interval of time,
well,

161
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,687
there are other fish in the sea.

162
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,649
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

163
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,867
I mean, you'll be just amazed
at what's out there.

164
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,471
Thailand, the Czech Republic...

165
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,571
Those women are so grateful

166
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,243
to even be here.

167
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,388
In the meantime,

168
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,157
idle hands
are the devil's playthings,

169
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,392
so you should get back on the horse
and do what you do best.

170
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:18,842
First step:

171
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,460
talk to our friend and get cooking.

172
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:30,965
I can't be the bad guy.

173
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,470
I can't be the bad guy.

174
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,737
You know, we'll...
We'll revisit.

175
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Promise me you won't hang yourself
in the closet.

176
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:35,018
Pop-pop, the ice-cream man!

177
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,449
Don't tell your mom.

178
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,428
- Yeah.
- <i>It's me.</i>

179
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,562
<i>We may have a wife problem.</i>

180
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,559
<i>Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

181
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,519
You got an address?

182
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,063
Dinner's gonna be late.

183
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:31,438
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout. But...

184
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,008
if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

185
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,227
{\Hey, buddy, }Pass the ketchup, will you?

186
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:21,105
I've had enough trans fat
for one lifetime.

187
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,558
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean,
and you're eating raw fish.

188
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,902
That's all I'm saying.

189
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,315
Been a while since that minnow
been swimming. Right, buddy?

190
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:39,613
You know... Flynn, here,
is looking for a part-time job, so...

191
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:41,084
I don't know. If you...

192
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:44,667
- know of anything, you might wanna...
- My name's Walter Junior.

193
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:48,102
Like... {\Like... }What, you...
You can't even say his name?

194
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,262
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn,

195
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,472
all you need to do is just tell me

196
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,598
that you don't want
to be called Flynn.

197
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:58,998
Dad didn't even show
up till fourth period,

198
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:02,085
and his eyes were all red
like he'd been crying or something.

199
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,210
But you...

200
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,192
you don't even care.

201
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,635
And now,
he won't even drive me home.

202
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:10,442
He won't say why,

203
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:13,317
but I know
it's because you told him not to.

204
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:15,291
- Honey, I...
- What?

205
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:18,413
I don't know what your problem is.

206
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,440
You may not love him anymore,

207
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,596
but I do.

208
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,961
I mean, why you gotta be...

209
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:29,161
Why you gotta be such a... a bitch?

210
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,185
You don't talk to your mom that way.

211
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,749
It's... It's all right.

212
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,504
Skyler, I know
that you must have your reasons

213
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,673
for... all of this.

214
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:55,153
I know it's none of my business,
but...

215
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,927
keeping Walt from the kids...

216
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,702
You're right, Hank.

217
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:11,758
It's none of your business.

218
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,140
Oh, my God.

219
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,991
After all of that, please tell me
that you are still not curious.

220
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:27,390
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Please.

221
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,959
The day I heard
there was a second cell phone, I knew.

222
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:32,188
Believe me.
I've seen it a hundred times.

223
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:36,241
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.

224
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:39,352
What is it exactly
that you have seen a hundred times?

225
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:40,870
Please, enlighten me.

226
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,718
Look, a guy like Walt...

227
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,643
a nice guy, decent, smart{\, you know}?

228
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,379
Let's face it... underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

229
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,674
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Midlife crisis.

230
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,936
He acts up. Steps out.

231
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:59,526
Then the wife... she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

232
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:01,872
Look, do the math, Marie.

233
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:03,766
Only comes out one way.

234
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,233
Knowing Walt, he...

235
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:09,899
felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

236
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,654
I don't know. I think...

237
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,990
if he cheated on her,
that she would've told me by now.

238
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:18,708
It just feels like...

239
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:21,848
something more.

240
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:35,467
24-7 coverage. Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?

241
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:39,637
Jesus. I'm in the wrong business.

242
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,004
Yeah. I'll call you.

243
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,017
Return of the prodigal.

244
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,811
- Welcome back{\ to the land of the living}. How you feeling?
- I'm good.

245
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,279
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

246
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:52,974
Unencumbered young man with...

247
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:55,437
stacks of cash.

248
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

249
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,713
Yeah, speaking of cash,

250
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:05,830
you know what's giving me
heartburn lately?

251
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,098
Your former partner. This guy...

252
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:11,836
He works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business, single-handed.

253
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:16,383
Finally, the big money shows up,
and what does he do? He walks out.

254
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,166
Talent like that,

255
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,555
and he just flushes
it down the crapper.

256
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,759
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

257
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:28,444
Look, I know you're out of it
and all, but you...

258
00:20:29,152 --> 00:20:31,189
you wouldn't talk to him, would you?

259
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:33,274
{\I mean, }Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

260
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:36,428
Scratch that.

261
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:39,280
He won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you,

262
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,466
all due respect.

263
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,198
You want a job?

264
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,945
A job?

265
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:50,834
Who's got a job for me?

266
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,002
I do.

267
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:25,885
Thought I'd...

268
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:29,980
- well, visit, if you don't mind.
- No, of course not. You don't...

269
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:31,957
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No.

270
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:34,835
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

271
00:24:35,218 --> 00:24:38,130
Just wanted to say hello
to little Holly here. Hey, girl.

272
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:45,759
She is a beauty. Look at her.

273
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:49,186
Thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

274
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,996
I just wish we had you back
full time.

275
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,071
You do brighten up the place.

276
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:01,432
Listen, believe me, this is...

277
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,934
I don't wanna bring this up,
but I... I can't sign off

278
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,257
sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry.

279
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:08,575
I just can't.

280
00:25:12,402 --> 00:25:13,602
Is that right?

281
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:21,233
If you're gonna do this,
you can't be so glaring about it.

282
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:24,572
Glaring.

283
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:31,144
That does sound bad.

284
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,533
Show me what's bothering you.

285
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,673
Keller.

286
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,334
Again...

287
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,544
God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

288
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,593
Revenue with no backup.

289
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,512
Here, here, and here.

290
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,556
I don't even know what to say.

291
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,161
This is fixable, right?

292
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:14,773
How about if I just push... 28,800,

293
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:18,369
out of this into next quarter?

294
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,450
Would you sign it then?

295
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:27,184
I'm just saying

296
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:31,331
I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

297
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,470
Fair enough.

298
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:36,014
I'll take care of it.

299
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,348
Thank you for the heads-up.

300
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,782
You won't have to deal
with this again, I swear.

301
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:45,939
What if your kids found out?

302
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,119
If my kids found out?

303
00:26:51,717 --> 00:26:54,072
This... what you're doing.

304
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,658
Someday,
they're gonna be old enough.

305
00:26:56,826 --> 00:26:58,575
How would you explain it to them?

306
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,807
Put me on the spot, why don't you?

307
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:09,351
I guess maybe I'd...

308
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:13,826
I'd say that...
I might have feet of clay that...

309
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,845
But that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

310
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,279
You know? Trying to provide.

311
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,074
And I'd ask them

312
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,084
to try to take the time
to understand...

313
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,466
You know what? Truth is,

314
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:31,971
I haven't thought that far ahead.

315
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:34,583
I'm just trying to keep
my head above water, so...

316
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:37,592
I better get back to it.

317
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:52,153
Hi, Walt.

318
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:55,583
Listen. I can't talk.
I'm at work right now.

319
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,803
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

320
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,297
No. Of course.
No. He's not staying.

321
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:04,922
He understands that.

322
00:28:05,332 --> 00:28:07,315
I'll bring him anywhere you want.

323
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
Dad...

324
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:15,329
It is rush hour. {\I mean, }I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now,

325
00:28:15,454 --> 00:28:17,854
but wouldn't it be easier if we...

326
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:22,546
Right. Okay. Good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

327
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:27,773
Why are you doing this?

328
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:30,698
She's just trying
to keep me from seeing you,

329
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:33,412
and you're helping her.

330
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,549
No. No, son. I mean, your...

331
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,964
your mother... she has her reasons.

332
00:28:40,023 --> 00:28:41,173
What reasons?

333
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:45,242
They're...

334
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:52,802
Well, they're just a little

335
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:54,748
difficult to delineate, but...

336
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:55,973
I mean, yes,

337
00:28:57,226 --> 00:29:00,276
there are two sides to every story.
Always. But...

338
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:02,961
she...

339
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,445
This is just how it has to be.

340
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,570
For now.

341
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,517
And, look, your home is your home,

342
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,892
and that is where you belong, okay?

343
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:23,021
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

344
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:25,522
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...

345
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:28,845
everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

346
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:32,600
Everybody is on your side.

347
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:41,565
It's not about taking sides, though.

348
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:45,479
How can you let
her treat you like this?

349
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:46,980
Now, come on.

350
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:50,456
- How can you just... just take it?
- Just listen to me, okay?

351
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:52,088
No matter what,

352
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,310
all of this has nothing to do
with how we feel about you, okay?

353
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:59,194
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

354
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:02,240
You and your sister
will come first, always.

355
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:07,332
Now, come on.

356
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:14,195
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay?

357
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,409
Both of us.

358
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:17,760
Let's just buck up.

359
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,362
Then I'll take you home.

360
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:27,282
Let me first just

361
00:30:28,415 --> 00:30:30,215
hit the old bathroom here.

362
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,817
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you.

363
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:57,273
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

364
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,791
Better call Saul!

365
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:02,820
I get it all the time.

366
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:07,492
We're here to discuss the sale
of the property at 9809 Margo.

367
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:10,922
I get it. Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?

368
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,821
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

369
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:17,647
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

370
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,794
However, for our purposes,
you might just as well

371
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,969
visualize a large bag of money.

372
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:27,162
This individual wants to buy
your house today, for cash.

373
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:30,188
- Cash?
- Cash. I know. In this economy.

374
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:33,584
In fact, the money is already burning
a hole in my client's account.

375
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,020
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown him
all the pertinent financials.

376
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,310
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

377
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:41,474
Fair enough.

378
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,278
We... get a few papers signed
and notarized,

379
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,947
we can take care of this right now.

380
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:48,991
In fact, I can wire you your money
this very afternoon.

381
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:52,787
There's just one
little hair in the soup...

382
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:54,482
the price.

383
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,700
We feel 875 is very fair.

384
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,869
But I suppose there's always a little...
wiggle room.

385
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,431
You wiggle us on down to 400

386
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:11,514
and you got yourselves a deal.

387
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:15,312
400,000? What is that, a joke?

388
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,518
No, that's my offer.

389
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,869
That's less than half price.

390
00:32:20,386 --> 00:32:22,495
We put almost that much
into the renovations alone.

391
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,277
Why don't we just cut the clown act

392
00:32:24,852 --> 00:32:27,530
and you tell us
what you're willing to come up to?

393
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:30,254
400,000. That's my final offer.

394
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,026
This is a waste of time.{\ Ridiculous.}

395
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,716
How could you possibly imagine
that we would entertain this?{\ Come on, hon.}

396
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:38,833
{\I don't know. }I {\just }thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab...

397
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:41,478
{\The one }that used to be in the basement.

398
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:44,669
I looked over your signed
disclosure statements,

399
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:47,340
and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab.

400
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,565
You got your termite inspection.

401
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:51,512
That's good. But no

402
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,381
... meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud

403
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,907
in service of concealing a felony.

404
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:00,314
I, myself, am more open-minded.

405
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,861
But it is tricky.

406
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,902
Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your <i>cojones</i>.

407
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,070
I mean,

408
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:11,458
good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past the buyer.

409
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:15,077
{\I mean, you know,}Could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.

410
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,194
Now, I could...

411
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,901
file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely,

412
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:23,369
or I could start
some criminal proceedings.

413
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:26,494
But I don't think
any of us want that now, do we?

414
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,439
How about it, counselor?

415
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:30,024
Do you concur?

416
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,032
Here you go{\, son}.

417
00:33:54,695 --> 00:33:57,235
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

418
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,398
- Brought pizza.
- Well, I'm making dinner.

419
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,902
I'll just... put it in the fridge.

420
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:32,163
It's even better the next day.

421
00:34:35,985 --> 00:34:36,909
Hi, honey.

422
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:42,101
Sorry.

423
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:51,674
Honey, what...

424
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,066
What kind of example
do we want to set here?

425
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,735
Right? I mean,
can't we at least just sit down

426
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,639
and eat a piece of pizza together?

427
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:01,506
Just to hash things out like adults?

428
00:35:03,355 --> 00:35:04,355
We have...

429
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,678
discussed everything
we need to discuss.

430
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:10,053
I thought I made myself very clear.

431
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:15,894
I got dipping sticks.

432
00:35:53,695 --> 00:36:03,537
{\pub}

433
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,984
<i>You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please leave a message. </i>

434
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:49,157
<i>When I went out this morning
to get the newspaper,</i>

435
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:52,368
<i>I saw a pizza on our roof.</i>

436
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,743
<i>Would you know anything about that?</i>

437
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,436
<i>Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.</i>

438
00:36:58,764 --> 00:37:01,075
<i>Calm down, accept the situation,</i>

439
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,101
<i>and keep your distance.</i>

440
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,131
<i>If you can't manage that,</i>

441
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,664
<i>I will get a restraining order.</i>

442
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,640
I got your restraining order
right here!

443
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:22,965
Restrain this!

444
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,664
Breaking even's not so bad.

445
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:43,874
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

446
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,443
Poor Jake. He had his heart set

447
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:48,563
on going to space camp.

448
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,923
Oh, God, this is all we need.

449
00:37:58,117 --> 00:37:59,540
Hey, Mom, Dad.

450
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:01,733
How's it going?

451
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,020
It's really not a good time.

452
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:11,299
Jesse, the house has been sold.

453
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:13,595
The new owners
are expected at any moment.

454
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,129
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

455
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,611
I bought the place.

456
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,243
Be back by 7, okay?

457
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,650
I love you.

458
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:44,811
Bye.

459
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,885
It's me. There's something
you should know about.

460
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,950
Hold on.
