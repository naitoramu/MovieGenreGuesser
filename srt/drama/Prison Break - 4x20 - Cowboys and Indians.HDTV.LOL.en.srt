1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:02,785
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:04,186
When were you planning on

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,956
telling me that your mother
was behind you on this?

4
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:09,007
You have today,
one day.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,428
When Burrows brings
Scylla back to us,

6
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,029
you will be the one

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,965
to put a bullet
in his brain.

8
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,967
Naveen Banerjee,

9
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:20,769
the son of Prime Minister
Nandu Banerjee.

10
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,872
Soon, this will
all be behind us,

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,741
and maybe I can
meet my grandson.

12
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:26,842
Where's Linc?!

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,644
There's an energy conference.

14
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:30,713
The Panda Bay Hotel.
He'll be there.

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,848
Christina's plan...
what she needed

16
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,883
<i>to profit from Scylla,</i>
<i>an incident</i>

17
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,585
that'll domino
into global warming.

18
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,054
No!

19
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,026
They rented this in Linc's name.

20
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,628
Look at this.
- It's a setup!

21
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,563
His hands are
all over the shells.

22
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,866
<i>Lincoln's right back</i>
<i>where he started.</i>

23
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,735
It really is too bad
about Michael.

24
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,270
We gotta go.

25
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:00,242
I need a doctor here!

26
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,418
There they are!

27
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,453
They're up there!
They're up there!

28
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,821
Let's go upstairs, now!

29
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,223
Move it, move it!

30
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,560
Look, let's just blend
into the crowd.

31
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:19,895
No, we can't go that way.

32
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,664
The door is locked, Michael.

33
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,766
Stand back.

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,741
This whole thing
is falling apart.

35
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,676
Is it?

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,611
Is it really?

37
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,779
What, do you think
this is funny? Huh?

38
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:11,947
How long you think
it's gonna take

39
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:13,282
before the General
sees this on the news?

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,750
If he thinks we
can't get Scylla,

41
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:15,818
how long do you
think it's gonna take

42
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,186
before he comes after us?

43
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:18,654
And then he comes
after our families?

44
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,255
Yeah, it's really
funny, isn't it?

45
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,616
Michael, where are you?

46
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:48,617
We're still in the hotel.

47
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,618
Is there any other way

48
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:50,886
to get out of here
without being seen?

49
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,955
No, there's cops and feds
all over the place.

50
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,056
Did you get Scylla?

51
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:55,257
No.

52
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,692
Some guy got assassinated.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,394
And guess who got set up for it.

54
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,697
We need Scylla.

55
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,065
Scylla is gone!

56
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,566
The only thing I care
about right now

57
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:05,701
is getting out of here.

58
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,202
Oh, yeah?
Where you gonna go, Michael, huh?

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,370
With the Company breathing down

60
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,738
our back again.

61
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:13,609
Scofield, it's Don.

62
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,676
What do you want?

63
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:15,744
To try to fix this.

64
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:16,845
How?

65
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,013
By stabbing us
in the back again?

66
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,415
Put Alex on.

67
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,183
He's a little
preoccupied right now.

68
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,218
Look, you want to
be mad at me, be mad

69
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,420
at me after we get Scylla back.

70
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,587
Now listen to me.

71
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,222
Okay, the southwest
loading dock is a

72
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,624
large industrial door.

73
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,492
It's not conducive
to a quick exit.

74
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,594
They only have one cop on it.

75
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:34,863
When you get to the door,
I can incapacitate the cop.

76
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,931
Problem is, we're
on the other side

77
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:36,965
of the hotel, and they've got

78
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,066
the ground floor covered.

79
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,035
What else can you
see on the outside?

80
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,336
Nothing, just the cop,

81
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:44,273
a couple of Dumpsters, jack
pallets and some laundry bins.

82
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,074
That must mean the
on-site laundry's

83
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,509
on the other side of the hotel,

84
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,278
near the loading dock door.

85
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,747
If we get to the laundry,
we can get to the door.

86
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,382
You said we can't
make it across the hotel.

87
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,451
But we can get
access to the roof.

88
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,520
Hotels use rooftop ventilation,

89
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,122
so the hotel guests don't
smell the laundry fumes.

90
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,360
Okay, so, listen, take
the ventilation system

91
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,429
to the laundry room; if you
can get to the laundry room,

92
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,897
you're gonna get
right by the door.

93
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,834
Put me on speaker.

94
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,069
Alex, you want to get

95
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,537
The Company off our backs?

96
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,105
Go to 4 Dunn Place.

97
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,041
Sara's holding my mother there.

98
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,143
Make her tell us
where Scylla is.

99
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,678
And clear our names in all this.

100
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:28,784
Mahone, you need to do whatever
you gotta do to get her to talk,

101
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,118
you hear me?

102
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,119
Do whatever you gotta do.

103
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,754
Got it.

104
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:36,658
Come on.

105
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,324
It is complete mayhem
at the Panda Bay Hotel

106
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,492
where Naveen Banerjee,

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
the son of India's
Prime Minister,

108
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:12,794
has been assassinated.

109
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,430
Amazingly, there have
been unconfirmed reports

110
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,633
identifying the assailants
as none other than

111
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,568
Lincoln Burrows, the man
who'd been suspected

112
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:20,936
of murdering Terrence Steadman,

113
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:21,937
and Michael Scofield,
his mastermind brother...

114
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,706
Christina sandbagged all of us!

115
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,877
If the brothers are caught,

116
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,445
we have no control over what

117
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,214
they might say
to the authorities.

118
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,715
Get down to that hotel

119
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,018
and make sure they don't
have that opportunity.

120
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,786
Uh, General, I'd be
more than willing

121
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,521
to take on that assignment.

122
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,823
And I assure you I will
dispatch of it efficiently.

123
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,660
This is not an Alabama
coon hunt, Teddy.

124
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:47,195
Don't judge me by
desperate actions

125
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,830
I've taken when there's
been a gun to my head.

126
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:50,566
I ran an entire
prison gang syndicate.

127
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,067
Hardened felons
called me "Mister."

128
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:54,336
I'm so much more
than a snitch.

129
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,204
And if you continue
to treat me as such,

130
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,374
it will be your loss,
General, not mine.

131
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,577
Son, I have the fate

132
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,846
of a multi-trillion dollar
enterprise in my hands,

133
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,183
and you want me to let
you earn your stripes

134
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,953
now?!

135
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,555
Take care of the brothers.

136
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,764
Here we go!
Here we go!

137
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,135
This should be it.

138
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,441
Perfect.

139
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,812
They say ours should
be here shortly.

140
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,146
I want you guys on full alert

141
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:40,248
and get all geared up,
all right?

142
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,316
It's them!

143
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,884
Stop!

144
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:05,140
They could be on any floor.

145
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,942
Can you override the door locks?

146
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,976
Yeah, they're electronic.

147
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,177
We control everything
from down here.

148
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:12,848
I want every room in this
hotel locked down now!

149
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,920
Why don't we just take
the stairs to the roof?

150
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,989
Because we'll set off
the fire alarm.

151
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,558
The ducts in the crawl spaces
above these top floor rooms,

152
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:26,194
that's how we get
our rooftop access.

153
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,030
Once we find the laundry vent,

154
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,232
we take that down
to the loading dock.

155
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,541
That should do it.

156
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,859
Go! Go!

157
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:06,802
What's going on?

158
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:09,404
They locked us out.

159
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,639
We can't get to the roof.

160
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:11,807
Let's head back down.

161
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,175
There'll be cops
in the stairwell.

162
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,610
We can't go up,
we can't go down...

163
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,346
We're trapped.

164
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,615
There has been a new development

165
00:08:24,682 --> 00:08:26,016
in the Panda Bay assassination.

166
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,618
An anonymous source
has provided FOX

167
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:30,887
with documents
showing a wire transfer

168
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:33,757
from Chinese operatives
to Burrows and Scofield.

169
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:35,959
The fallout from this from
a geopolitical standpoint

170
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:37,894
is staggering.

171
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,029
Relations between
China and India...

172
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:41,164
Nandu reached out.

173
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:44,301
He wants to meet with you.

174
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,036
This couldn't have
worked out better.

175
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,171
Nice audible on the
Chinese document.

176
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:50,440
Thank you.

177
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:53,210
Now we just...

178
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,279
watch the dominoes
begin to fall.

179
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:59,850
I just wish they weren't
falling on Michael.

180
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,719
Christina, you gave him options,

181
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:05,055
he made his choice,
he picked his side.

182
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,126
Yes, but he is my son.

183
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:15,399
My only son.

184
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,833
And right now it is believed

185
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,268
both Burrows and Scofield

186
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:19,536
are still in the hotel,

187
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,039
but it appears
the police are closing in.

188
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:27,427
Live just outside
the Panda Bay Hotel...

189
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,396
No, no, no, you see,
that's the problem, Michael.

190
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:30,731
There's cops everywhere.

191
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:32,599
It's like a freaking
cop anthill out here.

192
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,602
Look, it's just a matter of time
till they find you anyway.

193
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,738
Find out what their
plan of attack is.

194
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,239
Sure, you know what?

195
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:40,307
Yeah, I'll just go up

196
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,608
and ask them, all right?

197
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:43,410
They look like
a real friendly bunch.

198
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:45,512
We don't have much time,
so get it done now!

199
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:51,118
Burrows and Scofield
could be armed to the teeth.

200
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:52,419
It's tight quarters
in the stairwell,

201
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:53,887
so I don't want a lot
of shooting, all right?

202
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:54,921
This guy's from
Homeland Security.

203
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:56,590
I'll file my report as soon as

204
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:57,924
I've apprehended the shooters.

205
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:00,660
Whoa, whoa, let me
be clear here, Captain.

206
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,762
The shooting that happened today

207
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,163
wasn't your typical gangbanger,

208
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:05,332
public service killing
you're used to here in Miami.

209
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,402
This was an international
assassination with ramifications

210
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,637
that directly affect the
security of this country.

211
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:12,672
So, if you turn your
back on me again,

212
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,608
I'll jam you up for hindering
a federal investigation.

213
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:15,842
You understand?

214
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:19,946
Fine.

215
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,615
But I want you on my hip.

216
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:23,917
I'm not gonna have you running
around playing weekend warrior

217
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:25,585
so you can go back
to your buddies at the office

218
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:27,521
and tell them you saw some
real gun play, understood?

219
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,722
Not a problem.

220
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,923
Now, why don't you
start by telling me

221
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,958
how you're gonna
diffuse the situation?

222
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,628
We're gonna gas them out floor
by floor until we find them.

223
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,630
Whoa, hold on there, Tex.
If you use gas you're gonna

224
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:38,465
compromise visibility,
and I can't afford

225
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,300
another diplomat
getting shot in the fez.

226
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:42,035
We're using chloropropane.

227
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:43,804
It's colorless, it's odorless.

228
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:45,305
They won't even
know what hit them.

229
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:48,575
All right, listen up.

230
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,844
I want two men in the east
stairwell with the gas,

231
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:52,479
two at the base
of the west stairwell

232
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,114
in case they try to
come back down again.

233
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:56,016
I'll have backup detail
ready, all right?

234
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:57,884
Let's go, move, move!

235
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:26,446
Sara?

236
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,352
Oh, my God.

237
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,687
Sara.

238
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,856
Sara,

239
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:37,090
you hurt? You okay?

240
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:39,059
I'm fine. Christina's gone.

241
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,627
There's a knife
in the last drawer.

242
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:42,462
Do you have any idea
where she went?

243
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,998
No.

244
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:50,704
She has Scylla.

245
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:52,639
She set up Linc
and Michael.

246
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:53,640
She could be
anywhere.

247
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,108
Michael <i>and</i> Lincoln?

248
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,344
Yeah, they were framed for the
murder of an Indian official.

249
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,345
It's all over the news.

250
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:00,180
That was Christina's plan,
and...

251
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,048
Where are they now?

252
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:04,484
They're trapped
at the Panda Bay Hotel.

253
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:06,286
The police are looking
for them.

254
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:07,587
Okay.

255
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:09,789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't go there.

256
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,791
The cops are everywhere.
- I really need you to get out of my way.

257
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,126
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

258
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,898
You don't care for me,
I don't care for you

259
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:21,601
much either,
but I owe Michael, okay? Run.

260
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:23,470
He's in a sea of trouble right now.
- I'm not abandoning him.

261
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,071
I'm not telling you

262
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,573
to abandon him.
There's nothing you can do for him.

263
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:27,707
Listen, I'd run
if I could run.

264
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,443
But if I run,
they go after my wife,

265
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:31,978
so I have to jump back in.

266
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:32,979
You don't.

267
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:34,948
I'm not running.

268
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,721
I'll stay here, okay?

269
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,456
That way, Michael
knows where I am.

270
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,560
So does Christina.

271
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,995
If she wanted me dead,
I would be already.

272
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:50,830
Suit yourself.

273
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,432
Alex?

274
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,904
Thanks.

275
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:00,407
And if you see Michael,
tell him I'm here.

276
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,808
Yeah.

277
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:08,315
<i>I know how difficult</i>
<i>this must be for you.</i>

278
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:11,518
Mr. Prime Minister,
I, too, lost a son

279
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:13,253
when he was just a child.

280
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:17,424
Was your son murdered
by an assailant's bullet?

281
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:18,692
Of course not.

282
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:25,332
I've heard the news that
the Chinese are behind this.

283
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,768
Yes, I've heard
that as well.

284
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,170
And that's why
I'm here.

285
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:34,174
Not to discuss how my son died,
but how to avenge him.

286
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:38,478
Your technology--
as you put it--

287
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:41,848
I've heard rumors
of its varied applications.

288
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,717
Nandu, let's take a breath here.

289
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:49,723
No! The time to take a breath
expired when my son died.

290
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,159
Your son and I had planned
to use the technology

291
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:56,162
for humanitarian endeavors.

292
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,564
Warfare applications

293
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,165
were not our goal.

294
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,968
But now they are mine,
and at the end of the day,

295
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,637
you're a businesswoman
with a product

296
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:04,904
and I am a buyer.

297
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:06,039
I want to commit

298
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,808
to all the intellectual property
you possess.

299
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,410
I want the People's
Republic of China

300
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:13,813
to feel the pain I feel
right now!

301
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:19,819
Do you comprehend
the ramifications

302
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,022
of what it is you're proposing?

303
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:26,192
More than you know.

304
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:35,235
If it is what you want.

305
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:38,738
I must go now...

306
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:43,910
to make arrangements
for your payment and arrangements

307
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:46,913
for my child's burial.

308
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:18,978
Yeah?

309
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,980
Congratulations.
You're famous again.

310
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:22,615
You're all over the news
for killing Gandhi.

311
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,484
I figured as much.

312
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:26,553
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

313
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,988
They're gonna gas you out.
When?

314
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,423
They already started.
They're going floor-by-floor.

315
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:32,258
They're about at the third
or fourth floor right now.

316
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:34,627
Why are you just
telling me about this now?

317
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,096
I had to leave the lobby.

318
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:37,530
I can't make anybody
more suspicious.

319
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:45,105
Hello, Michael? Michael?

320
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:50,944
Linc, I need
your help.

321
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:52,512
When I was in fourth grade,

322
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,715
I... I got an A for guessing
all the answers on this test.

323
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:59,319
I never thought
I'd beat those odds.

324
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:02,689
What kind of loser
gets set up

325
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:07,761
for two high-profile
assassinations within five years?

326
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,629
Are you kidding?
This is not your fault.

327
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:11,264
If they didn't get
away with it then,

328
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,433
they're not gonna
get away with it now.

329
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:15,335
But I need you to focus.

330
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,704
I need your help, Linc.

331
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,145
Right. Let's
get out of here.

332
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,619
601-30 on Tac Two.

333
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,020
Darrin Hooks, Homeland Security.

334
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:36,222
Can you point me
to whoever's in charge here?

335
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,125
Homeland? How many of you guys
are they sending here?

336
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:40,727
Agent Self's already inside.

337
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:41,995
Who?

338
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,496
Agent Don Self.

339
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:45,231
Got here a little
while ago.

340
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:53,673
Yeah, it's Hooks.

341
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,175
The name of that agent

342
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:58,711
that was supposedly killed
recently in L.A.?

343
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,713
Was his name Don Self?

344
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:09,876
It's all falling out
exactly as Christina planned it.

345
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:14,781
Now she's going to have
everything she ever hoped for.

346
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,219
She's trying to reignite
the 1962 China-India Border War

347
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,987
which ended in an uneasy truce

348
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:24,057
when neither country could
withstand the losses

349
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,659
they were sustaining in those

350
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:26,793
remote and desolate
mountains.

351
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,696
If she succeeds
in provoking another war,

352
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:32,399
and framing China

353
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:35,035
for the killing of India's
Prime Minister's son,

354
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:36,236
it's certainly
provocation enough.

355
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:38,104
She'll set off
a military conflict

356
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,373
that will last for decades

357
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:41,908
that may never
be resolved.

358
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,510
Why didn't you do it
yourself?

359
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:49,416
Power, money, seem
to be things you love.

360
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:52,819
Because if India's involved,
that drags in Pakistan.

361
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:54,888
Then Russia's gonna want
to defend its borders.

362
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,324
Then within a year,
Europe's in it

363
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,758
and after that,
the United States.

364
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,494
It's an apocalypse
in which everyone loses!

365
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:04,965
And Christina has always
been too prideful

366
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,934
and too unstable to accept it.

367
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:36,997
Got it.

368
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:44,804
Can I help you?

369
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:48,541
Hi. Yes, I think you can.

370
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,652
Agent Self.

371
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,092
Donald Self?

372
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,868
Agent Darrin Hooks.

373
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,310
It's good to see you.

374
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,779
It's good to see you, too.

375
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:37,490
Hold it. Hold it right there.
Don't move.

376
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,428
What the hell are you doing,
Hooks?

377
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,096
You always pull guns
on fellow agents?

378
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:46,866
Yeah, when agents
that are supposedly dead

379
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,703
and are found later in a hotel
with the guys that killed him.

380
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,871
You mind telling me
what you're doing here

381
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:52,872
with Burrows and Scofield?

382
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,873
My cover called for me

383
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:55,141
to be dead, okay?

384
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,143
People were catching on
to what we were doing,

385
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:58,712
and my death freed me up

386
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,349
But Burrows and Scofield
have been set up, okay?

387
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,950
There's no record of you
in covert ops.

388
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:05,518
That was by design.

389
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,787
Look, when this is all over,
we'll call the home office,

390
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,055
I'll punch in my clearance code,

391
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:11,124
you can buy me
a couple of drinks,

392
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,659
and we'll share
some laughs about this.

393
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,261
But right now I need
to do my damn job.

394
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:16,896
No.

395
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:19,766
You're gonna follow
and we're gonna

396
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,001
clear this up right now.

397
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,741
Okay, but what I said about
Scofield and Burrows is true.

398
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:28,975
They've been set up.

399
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:30,310
You need to look into this.

400
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,978
Oh, I'm gonna look
into everything

401
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:33,480
as soon
as we get outside.

402
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:34,681
Let's go.

403
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,183
Did you clear
the loading dock doors?

404
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,785
No, but someone else did.

405
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,720
What do you mean?

406
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:48,955
Someone must've taken him out.

407
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:50,390
Which means there's someone
in the hotel

408
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,058
other than the police
that's looking for you.

409
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:54,794
Linc,

410
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:55,795
we got to move.

411
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:57,497
Got more than just
the cops after us now.

412
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:58,832
Whoa, whoa.
You know what you're doing?

413
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:01,267
No.

414
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,975
Let's go.

415
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,180
Captain Hutchinson!

416
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:15,381
We've got a room breach

417
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:16,583
on 16.

418
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,384
This is Hutchinson.

419
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:19,719
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.

420
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:22,088
I repeat, Scofield and Burrows
are on 16.

421
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,190
Go, go, go!

422
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:25,425
Move, move, move!

423
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:34,467
This way.

424
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,441
Make sure the
door can shut.

425
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:42,742
We need the pressure to build.

426
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,592
They're coming.
They're coming!

427
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:16,376
We're on 16.

428
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:17,644
Copy that.

429
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:18,978
On my mark.

430
00:23:20,214 --> 00:23:21,114
Go.

431
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:51,611
# #

432
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:04,057
Backup detail!

433
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,458
Move! Go,
go, go, go!

434
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,528
Move, move, move!
Go, move!

435
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:11,464
Move, move!

436
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:12,832
What the hell happened?

437
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,200
They booby-trapped us.

438
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:15,702
They made a move
for the roof.

439
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:17,303
All right,
get them to a hospital.

440
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:18,972
All right.
Let's go! Move, move, move!

441
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,058
Stop right there!

442
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:41,861
Don't make a move
for that weapon, Burrows.

443
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:45,498
Take the masks off.

444
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:47,500
Take them off now!

445
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,306
Hands behind
your head.

446
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:57,076
You'd better pray to God that
my men are found out all right.

447
00:24:57,144 --> 00:24:58,511
It was a concussive blast.

448
00:24:58,579 --> 00:24:59,879
They're just unconscious.

449
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,547
Shut up.

450
00:25:03,384 --> 00:25:04,884
Easy!

451
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:06,886
Easy.

452
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:09,889
And I'd follow that advice
about not going for your guns.

453
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:14,627
The General would
like you back at the office.

454
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:17,764
Now.

455
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:38,290
Did all go well at the hotel?

456
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:40,259
What's going on

457
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:42,028
with Sara and my mother?

458
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,596
Christina escaped.

459
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:44,964
Sara's okay.

460
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:46,599
She's in the condo.

461
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:49,301
Excuse me, would you boys like
a little alone time

462
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:50,503
to catch up?

463
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,438
What exactly do you
expect from us?

464
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:53,606
You need to take
responsibility

465
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:54,673
for your failures.

466
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:56,442
Hey, we failed nothing.

467
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,644
This whole thing
was a setup.

468
00:25:58,712 --> 00:25:59,678
You know it.
- Lincoln Burrows

469
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:02,281
was outsmarted.

470
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:03,716
Who could have anticipated that?

471
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:12,224
I think you need to accept
that this is over.

472
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:19,365
I've been holding a chip
for far too long.

473
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,334
It's time
to play it.

474
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,038
I made you boys a promise.

475
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,706
You would find Scylla

476
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:31,844
and I would see to it
you got some cash

477
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:33,212
and had the slate wiped clean.

478
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,048
I intend to keep
that promise.

479
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,149
However, if I keep

480
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:38,984
one promise,

481
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:40,886
I have to keep them all.

482
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:43,189
Now...

483
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,057
I wonder

484
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:48,227
who the big winner will be.

485
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:51,330
Don't do this.
- Don't do what?

486
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:54,600
When I sent you those envelopes,
I wasn't just playing games.

487
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:56,602
I made it very clear

488
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,003
that you
had one day

489
00:26:58,071 --> 00:27:00,172
to accomplish your job,

490
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,574
or there would be

491
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:03,075
consequences.

492
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,376
What's that?

493
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:05,945
The consequence.

494
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:07,413
Call our man in Queens.

495
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:10,549
Queens? What are you calling
New York for?

496
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:12,084
Put it on speaker,
please.

497
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:15,754
Yes.
- Move

498
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:16,789
on subject four.

499
00:27:16,857 --> 00:27:17,957
I'm a block away.

500
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:20,226
ETA is less than two minutes.

501
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:21,327
You son of a bitch.

502
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:23,462
You son of a bitch!

503
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,397
My wife is a
defenseless woman.

504
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:28,534
Mr. Self didn't inform you
that he had a wife, did he?

505
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:29,802
Well, I wouldn't talk

506
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,704
about my wife either
if I'd had a few too many

507
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,305
bourbons, got behind the wheel,

508
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:35,407
and turned
a beautiful young woman

509
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:37,910
into a piece of broccoli.

510
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:38,944
Don't do anything.

511
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,412
I assume that is
why you tried

512
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,481
to run away with Scylla?

513
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:43,782
To screw
a government

514
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,151
that was giving you benefits
that would only pay

515
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:47,486
for a county
facility overlooking

516
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:50,456
the Belt Parkway, and to sell it

517
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:53,125
so that you and she
could disappear

518
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,461
and be hidden forever.

519
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:58,397
C'est la vie.

520
00:27:58,465 --> 00:27:59,565
I have the subject in sights.

521
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:00,666
She's in a wheelchair

522
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,234
under a tree
in the hospital courtyard.

523
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:03,269
Do I have a go?

524
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,570
Please don't do this.

525
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:05,971
Okay, please,

526
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,573
you can kill me,
okay, you can kill me

527
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,341
right now,
please, kill me.

528
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:11,477
You don't need to do this;
we'll get Scylla.

529
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:13,779
That's what I wanted to hear.
Well, that's what we're trying to do!

530
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,681
We're getting it.
But you have to know what awaits you

531
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:19,185
and your loved ones
if you don't.

532
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:20,452
We understand, okay?

533
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,754
Execute the order.
- Please don't do it!

534
00:28:23,423 --> 00:28:25,491
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

535
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:27,793
Get help, hel--!

536
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:35,668
I believe
you made a request.

537
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,799
Bagwell,
make sure he's dead.

538
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:10,369
Does everyone understand now?

539
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:16,575
Are we all on
the same page?

540
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,512
Good.

541
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,915
Let's get down
to business.

542
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,019
Three-quarters
of a billion dollars

543
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:28,387
in a numerical account

544
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:29,855
in Luxembourg.

545
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:33,092
If you are still worried
about humanitarian efforts,

546
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,861
write a check
to UNICEF.

547
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:41,233
All the data will be delivered
within 24 hours.

548
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:44,036
That's what I expected.

549
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:51,877
You played it perfectly.

550
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:58,684
Reach out
to our contact in China.

551
00:29:58,752 --> 00:30:00,686
I have a feeling
they may be interested

552
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:02,221
in what we're selling as well.

553
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,394
Christina, I
don't advise

554
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:10,029
playing both sides
of this coin.

555
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:11,530
Pigs get fat

556
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:13,465
and hogs get slaughtered.

557
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:23,676
Reach out to China.

558
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:37,389
No!
Keep our people

559
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:40,292
at every private airfield
in Florida <i>and</i> in Georgia.

560
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,494
We can't have
Christina leaving the state.

561
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:45,331
She played on
India's emotions,

562
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:46,632
which probably means
she'd want to meet

563
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,267
with one of their
emissaries today

564
00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:49,301
while they're
still running hot.

565
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:50,769
She could still
be in Miami,

566
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:51,837
maybe at
the embassy.

567
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:54,440
No, she's not at the embassy.

568
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:55,774
Any deal she makes
with India

569
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:57,009
will be
strictly off the radar.

570
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:58,010
Right now
she's concerned

571
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,745
with two things.

572
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:01,747
One is closing the deal
on Scylla,

573
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,782
which I'm assuming
she's already done,

574
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,317
and the second is getting paid.

575
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,886
No sign of Self.

576
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,123
How much can she get
for Scylla?

577
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:14,126
Half a billion from India,
the same from China.

578
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:15,160
Overseas account?

579
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:16,462
Foreign wire transfer?

580
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,698
I doubt she's taking
any food stamps.

581
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,667
She's going to want confirmation

582
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:23,202
that that money is
safely overseas

583
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,771
before she leaves the U.S.

584
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,806
We find the money,

585
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:29,007
we find
my mother.

586
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:31,710
Normally it takes
three business days

587
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:33,379
for an international
wire transfer to clear,

588
00:31:33,446 --> 00:31:36,148
unless the bank is

589
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,283
a Federal Reserve signatory,
in which case

590
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:39,718
the transfer is immediate.

591
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:41,286
You think she'll head
to the bank?

592
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:43,622
All she has to do is withdraw
a few grand from the millions

593
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,792
that that buyer has probably
transferred overseas

594
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,993
already.

595
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:49,661
She'll know
it's all there.

596
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:52,598
So let's find a Federal Reserve
signatory bank in Miami.

597
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:54,032
We'll have a shot
at finding her.

598
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,801
And Scylla.

599
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,302
There, Michael,
you see, that's

600
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,704
why I didn't put

601
00:31:58,772 --> 00:32:00,706
your name
in the bowl.

602
00:32:00,774 --> 00:32:02,574
You're the only one here
that's irreplaceable.

603
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:06,044
Agents, informants, muscle--
they're nice to have, but...

604
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:07,246
finally they're replaceable.

605
00:32:07,313 --> 00:32:08,580
There's a branch

606
00:32:08,648 --> 00:32:10,015
about 20 minutes away.

607
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,650
That mind
of yours--

608
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:13,852
it's one in a million.

609
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,054
Nice to see it finally working
for me.

610
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:18,023
I do not work for you.

611
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:20,125
Not yet.

612
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:35,864
It's legitimate,

613
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,866
I assure you.

614
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,934
Oh, okay.

615
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:42,337
I just want
to withdraw the $10,000

616
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:43,605
so I can be sure

617
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,241
the Luxembourg account
is properly set up.

618
00:32:46,308 --> 00:32:47,742
Well.

619
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:07,929
Is she in there?

620
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:09,597
Yeah, I saw her
through the window.

621
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:11,900
She's talking to a tall,
dark-haired guy.

622
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:14,202
They're the same guys
who set us up at the hotel.

623
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,470
We wait until she comes out,

624
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,338
just jump.
- So...

625
00:33:17,406 --> 00:33:18,807
what do we do
about her security?

626
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,509
I mean, we jump her, we gotta
jump the guys she's with,

627
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:24,312
and God knows how many other
agents are gonna come crawling

628
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,314
out of the woodwork like ants.

629
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,786
Look, um...
I hate to bring up the obvious,

630
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:34,622
but last time I checked,
you two still disagreed

631
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,624
as to what to do
with Scylla

632
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,660
if we actually get it.

633
00:33:40,763 --> 00:33:42,530
Yeah, that's what I thought.

634
00:33:42,598 --> 00:33:45,099
Well, let's skip the damn thing.
I mean, who's gonna stop us?

635
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:47,001
A 17-year-old
security guard?

636
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,336
No, probably the guy
with the gun.

637
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:51,406
He'll open fire
as soon as he sees our faces.

638
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:57,078
Then, uh... maybe they
shouldn't see our faces.

639
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,982
So then the pizza guy showed up,

640
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,650
and Wayne jumped
out of the bushes

641
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:04,385
and tried to grab the pizza,
but the...

642
00:34:04,453 --> 00:34:06,321
but the guy...

643
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:08,456
My God.

644
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,997
Are you okay, mister?

645
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,833
Yeah.

646
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:19,968
Go call 911.

647
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,369
Go, go.
- No.

648
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,404
No, don't call anyone.

649
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:25,406
Okay?

650
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:27,342
Don't call anybody.

651
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:30,011
Don't call anyone.

652
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:37,118
You know, once baby
brother's got his little hands

653
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:38,453
on that magic box of yours,

654
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,121
I don't think it's going
to be too hard for him

655
00:34:40,189 --> 00:34:42,690
to trick Magilla Gorilla,
if you know what I'm saying.

656
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:43,691
No,

657
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:44,759
I don't.

658
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:46,094
And you really think

659
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,162
that Scofield's going to
risk his nephew's life?

660
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,530
He's gonna
figure out something

661
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:51,900
before he hands first prize
over to the bad guys.

662
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,569
Scofield thinks pure,
like a little Cub Scout.

663
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:57,572
Burrows, he just thinks
like a cub.

664
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,107
He's right.

665
00:34:59,174 --> 00:35:00,775
I don't feel comfortable
having Scofield

666
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:02,110
out there with something I want

667
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:04,445
while I'm stuck here
with nothing he wants.

668
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:06,114
I need leverage.

669
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:09,417
You saw the way
Mahone pulled Scofield over

670
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,419
when they first got here.

671
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,754
Bet you a wooden nickel
they was talking

672
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:16,190
about little Dr. Underpants
and her whereabouts.

673
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:18,359
Too bad we don't know
where that is.

674
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:20,194
Wrong again, Curly.

675
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:22,697
While everyone was up here
flapping their gums,

676
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:25,066
I took the liberty of toddling
down to Mahone's car,

677
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:28,603
checking out the last address
he put in his GPS.

678
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:33,942
There's a gambler's chance
we might find the leverage

679
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,110
you're looking for right here.

680
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,211
I'm on it.

681
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:38,613
No.

682
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:45,253
You wanted to get
in on the action,

683
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:46,955
here's your chance.

684
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:55,296
Okay, I'll just count this out
for you.

685
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:57,398
That won't
be necessary.

686
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,467
All righty.

687
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:01,970
Here's a printed record
of your transaction,

688
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,237
and I think a balance

689
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:04,772
that high, are you sure

690
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,307
you don't want to talk to one
of our investment specialists?

691
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,142
No, thank you.

692
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:11,779
Everybody down
on the ground!

693
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:13,114
Now!
Nobody move,

694
00:36:13,182 --> 00:36:14,582
nobody gets hurt.

695
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,484
You, down.

696
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,652
Oh!

697
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,320
What are the odds?

698
00:36:21,824 --> 00:36:23,524
Don't.

699
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,633
The case.

700
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:37,472
I'll take that.

701
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,913
Hi, Mom.

702
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,194
Scofield and Burrows
leaving the bank, now!

703
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:17,979
Take Scylla and go!

704
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:19,047
We gotta stay together!

705
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:19,881
I said go!

706
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,282
Come on!

707
00:37:52,114 --> 00:37:53,347
I think he's out.

708
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:54,382
Move in.

709
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,616
Move in.

710
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:01,335
After today's events,

711
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:03,705
how much egg does the U.S.
court system have on its face

712
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:04,939
for exonerating Lincoln Burrow?

713
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:06,674
in the first place.
- An omelet's

714
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,576
worth, Paula. If you remember

715
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:10,211
I was never in favor
of the exoneration.

716
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:11,612
Lincoln Burrows

717
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,749
is a thug for hire, and his
little brother is no better.

718
00:38:14,817 --> 00:38:16,217
I'm amazed

719
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:18,519
that the court system just
glossed over the warning signs.

720
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,888
Such as?
- For one,

721
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,391
they should've never let Burrows
and Scofield in the same prison.

722
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,460
They should've looked
at Scofield's past.

723
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:28,196
It's clear that he had
no criminal background.

724
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:31,566
Why would a brilliant structural
engineer rob a bank?

725
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:34,102
Maybe he needed
to pay off his student loans.

726
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:36,270
It wasn't about the money.

727
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:38,573
What do you think
the judicial system is going

728
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,074
to learn from all this?

729
00:38:40,142 --> 00:38:42,410
This has been a huge
wake-up call for the courts.

730
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:44,278
Judges will have to look
all the relationships

731
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,347
in his life...

732
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,742
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

733
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,744
Easy now, Doc, easy.

734
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,746
It's just your friendly,
neighborhood T-Bag.

735
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,981
Now I'm gonna need
your cooperation.

736
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:35,763
Get your hands off me,

737
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,998
you son of a...
- Hand,

738
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,332
not hands,

739
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,700
thanks to your boyfriend.

740
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:41,169
Now, as I was
saying before,

741
00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:43,237
I just need
your cooperation.

742
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:02,056
All right.

743
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:05,359
All right.

744
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:07,361
He's taking too long.

745
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:09,363
Something's wrong.

746
00:40:09,431 --> 00:40:10,898
We gotta go back for him.

747
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:11,732
He said he'd catch up.

748
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,968
No, something's wrong.

749
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,670
Call him.

750
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:18,773
Call him.

751
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:25,646
Michael,

752
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,649
now that we have this,

753
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,519
what the hell are we
going to do with it?

754
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:40,061
He's not answering.

755
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,331
Linc?

756
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:47,001
I heard about the bank
robbery on the radio.

757
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,605
You boys just can't stand to be
out of the news, can you?

758
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:53,441
I assume you've got Scylla?

759
00:40:53,508 --> 00:40:54,942
We're getting close.

760
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,410
We'll keep you posted.

761
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:59,480
I wouldn't hang up just yet
if I were you, son.

762
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,417
Michael, we're in the apartment.

763
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:06,187
I know you have it.

764
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,855
Otherwise,

765
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,891
Christina would never have
risked a public shootout.

766
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,292
Now, I'm going to make

767
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,294
this easy for you,

768
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:14,795
bring me Scylla,

769
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:18,065
or this time, Sara's death
will not be faked.

770
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:26,407
What is it?

771
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,912
What is it?

772
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,249
The General has Sarah.

773
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:43,624
Take it.

774
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:51,132
I swear if you touch her...

775
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,201
Hello, son.

776
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:58,673
I believe you have
something I want.

777
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,075
And I have something you want--

778
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,344
although I'll never really
understand why.

779
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:04,612
All right,

780
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,914
maybe we can work
something out.

781
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,250
I gave you the opportunity

782
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,719
to work something out.

783
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:14,922
You rejected me, Michael.

784
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,190
Look, let's meet
and talk about this.

785
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:17,191
Now the time for talking

786
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:18,326
passed about the time

787
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:19,660
you put those ski masks on,

788
00:42:19,728 --> 00:42:20,995
don't you think?

789
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:22,797
So, here's what I'm going to do,
Michael.

790
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,333
I'm going to shoot Lincoln

791
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,435
through the right rib cage,

792
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:28,336
just grazing

793
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:29,670
the lower quadrant

794
00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:30,805
of his right lung.

795
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,306
It will slowly collapse,

796
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:34,775
making it very difficult
to breathe.

797
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:36,477
If he doesn't get
medical attention,

798
00:42:36,545 --> 00:42:37,778
within five hours,

799
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,046
he'll be dead.

800
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:43,250
Christina... Mom... please

801
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:50,024
Linc!

802
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,997
Second hand's spinning, Michael.

803
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:57,798
Looks like you have
a little decision to make.

804
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,133
Scylla

805
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,035
or someone you love.

806
00:43:06,408 --> 00:43:07,742
