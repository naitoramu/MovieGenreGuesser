1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,350
- Where do you keep these things? Bank?
- We have our own treasury.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,770
- Wine cellar.
- And a tunnel under the river.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,650
My guess is they've turned one
of the cellars into a strong room.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,130
Did you find someone, Arthur?

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,970
Stefan Radischevky.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,450
- And he speaks Russian?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,810
He works in the house for four
weeks, keeps his ears open.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,010
All right?

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,610
I have a bright future too...

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,170
mapped out.

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,050
But you want to try things first?

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,330
Michael...

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,930
why does a pen pusher who
sits on his arse all day

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,810
want to fire a gun?

15
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,730
There's going to be a vacancy
at Shelby Company Limited.

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,050
No revolvers, all legal.

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,340
Get me a meeting with someone
from the Soviet embassy...

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,250
♪ Look up here, I'm in heaven

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,100

He was in a tunnel collapse.

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,770
He won medals.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,180
Take care of him.

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,820

Thank you, nurse.

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,580
Tommy...

33
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,740
I need to speak to you about the priest.

34
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,370
I know things about him.

35
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,690
Hmmm.

36
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,140
From when I was a...
from when I was a boy.

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,300
I will shoot him myself, Tommy.

38
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,820
Just teach me how to shoot.

39
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
It's easy, Michael.

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,580
Just point... pull the trigger.

41
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,140
He asked for me today, Mary...

42
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,970
.. not his mother...

43
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,000
.. for the first time.

44
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,240
He missed you.

45
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,690
Where is he? Is he in the kitchen?

46
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,680
Yes, he's with the girls and Johnny.

47
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,440
Did you remember your medicine, sir?

48
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,960
Do you ever read the Bible, Mary?

49
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,090
Sometimes.

50
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,820
Do you ever read it out loud while
standing naked, next to my bed?

51
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,170
Cos... when I take the morphine the
doctor gave me, that's what you do.

52
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,210
I'm wide awake but you are
standing there naked, plain as day,

53
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,620
reading from the Book Of Leviticus.

54
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,460
Do you want to know what happens next?

55
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
No... neither do I.

56
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,930
That's why I pour the medicine away.

57
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,250
Go and get Johnny, Mary.

58
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,850
Without the firing pins,
the guns won't work.

59
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,330
And there are no replacements?

60
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,210
They don't make these anymore,
these are the end of the line.

61
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,730
We had the foreman take
out all the spares.

62
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,810
Take the pins, they'll never fire a shot.

63
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,850
Nobody will know until they unload
the bloody things in Tbilisi.

64
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,530
Or until they are facing
our guns at Kutaisi.

65
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,570
Take them all out and give them to me.

66
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,970
Come on, boys, no fucking about.

67
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,490
I will tell the Soviet
Ambassador that there is no longer

68
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,810
a need to blow up the train.

69
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,960
I will tell Tommy, you accept his plan.

70
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,410
You know, some mornings I
wake up, I think I've died

71
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,370
and this is heaven, Tom.

72
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,930
I mean, the wives and the
kids camped out by the valley,

73
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,370
not being moved on.

74
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,620
Sure, me, meself, I'm surrounded
by maids and food and booze.

75
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,520
See that line, there?

76
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,570
No.

77
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,890
That's the edge of heaven.

78
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,940
The border between
Birmingham and paradise.

79
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,100
And today, my friend, you're
going to step over that line,

80
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,450
back into the world.

81
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,160
You mean you have something
for me to do, Tom?

82
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,180
Have you ever heard of
Hampton Court Palace, Johnny?

83
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,250
No. I can't say I have.

84
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,210
You and three families of the
Lees are going to set up camp

85
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,970
100 yards from the gates of the palace.

86
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,890
You won't be moved on because
I have just bought the land.

87
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,930
You'll be joined by
some old friends of mine

88
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,850
who are going to open a hole
underneath your tents and caravans.

89
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,770
You see this blow to the
head you took, Tom...

90
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,490
And for allowing the hole to
be dug, you will get £5,000.

91
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,260
Which you will split between
the three Lee families.

92
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,580
I take a lot of this money is to
do with not asking questions, Tommy?

93
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,010
Dead right, Johnny.

94
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,140
And when the hole is filled in
again, you can go back to paradise.

95
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,900
Mr Shelby, your brothers are here.

96
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,740
And there's someone who described
himself as, "the wandering Jew".

97
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:08,290
Will you take the Jewish
gentleman to the drawing room

98
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,010
and take my brothers to the
kitchen and give them tea and rum?

99
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,530
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,140
Good morning, Mr Solomons.

101
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,050
Yeah, it is.

102
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,690
Nice little place you've got here, Thomas.

103
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,890
What is it?

104
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,610
A foreclosure of a gambling debt
from some poor young lord who

105
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,970
you pumped full of opium
in one of your casinos?

106
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,410
Or is that just tittle-tattle?

107
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,810
No. Drink?

108
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,370
Nah, I don't touch it, mate.

109
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,980
Your housekeeper said you're
not allowed to drink. Eh?

110
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,770
She said, you are suffering
from so many ancient injuries

111
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,730
from your sporting life
that your head is like some

112
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,940
sort of smashed vase what's been
stuck back together by an horse.

113
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,450
Now... word in London
is that you can be found

114
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,770
wandering the streets of Birmingham,
stark naked, throwing away money.

115
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,930
You talk to dead people.

116
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:26,180
Also, that you believe that you
are powerful enough to summon up

117
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:34,290
Jews of a very particular standing
up to the gentile wilderness

118
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,690
wherein you live in order for them
to do your fucking bidding, mate.

119
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,290
And still, you came.

120
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,040
Yeah, well, you know...
I was passing, weren't I?

121
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,930
Do you know something, Alfie?

122
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,930
This morning, I tried to read the
paper and I realised that the

123
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,540
only consequence of my terrible
accident is that I now need glasses.

124
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,300
Right...

125
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,140
Right, well, I know a man...

126
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,410
.. who can make you a pair of these,

127
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,770
he is a magician, mate.

128
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,690
He is a magician.

129
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,610
So, not only will you be
able to read your newspaper,

130
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,220
but you will also be able
to see into the future.

131
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,020
Now, I know this, right, because
he made this pair, here, for me.

132
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,810
So, you don't have to
worry about telling me

133
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,900
what this is all about, do you?
Because I have already seen it.

134
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,650
You're fucking about with
Russians, in't you? You silly boy.

135
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,210
Right, you've got two choices, Michael.

136
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,170
You fuck off to America with
Arthur, join the Apaches,

137
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,530
or you marry the girl.

138
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,250
This isn't a joke.

139
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,170
Arthur, are you really going
to live with the Apaches?

140
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,730
- Told her father yet?
- No.

141
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,250
He'll fucking shoot you, man.

142
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,570
Are you sure the kid's yours?

143
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,610
I wish I hadn't told you.

144
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,130
Then think of marriage
as a beautiful road...

145
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,810
flowers all the way down it.

146
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,250
Is he joking?

147
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,840
It's hard to tell these days.

148
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,370
Do you, er...

149
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,560
Do you love the woman?

150
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,450
Fucking what?

151
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,090
Go and marry her, like the rest of us.

152
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,490
She doesn't want her family to know.

153
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,090
She doesn't want to have the baby.

154
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,130
- We know a woman...
- Shut up, John.

155
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,210
Same woman who helped you out twice.

156
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,010
They weren't my women.

157
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,050
That's why you had them fixed, Arthur.

158
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,570
Charlotte will want the best.

159
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,050
- She is the best.
- The best.

160
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,450
Used to be a nurse.

161
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,770
20 minutes, done.

162
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,850
Don't have to go in, or wait outside.

163
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,650
You go to the Garrison,
drink whisky, have a laugh.

164
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,690
Remember, John?

165
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,170
Then this kid walks in, no shoes
on, and says, "It's done".

166
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,770
Second time we was in there...

167
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,180
same kid, this time he's
wearing shiny new shoes.

168
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,490
And he shouts, "It's done, Arthur."

169
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,020
And what?

170
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,220
She bought new shoes...

171
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,120
.. with the money I gave her.

172
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,250
It was for a good cause.

173
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,570
Arthur... If you're going to get
on like this with the Apaches,

174
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,220
they'd fucking scalp you, boy.

175
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,220
Tommy said when that bell rings
we've to all go to the big room.

176
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,540
Come on. Tommy has a plan.

177
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,210
Arthur.

178
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,250
Arthur.

179
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,240
Arthur, come here.

180
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,730
Shalom!

181
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,580
Arthur, shalom!

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,650
Alfie.

183
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,930
Shalom. Come here. Come on, listen...

184
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,770
I owe you a little something, don't I?

185
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,290
I do. Come on. Sit down.

186
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,010
Come on, sit down here.

187
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,050
There you go.

188
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,650
Right...

189
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,210
Listen...

190
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,730
Arthur...

191
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,370
I want you to know, right?

192
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,890
That whatever happened between us, yeah?

193
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,250
Back then... that was business.

194
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,970
It was just business. All right?

195
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,290
And I also want you to know
that I have made my apologies

196
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:04,130
via my own God for abusing a very
holy day to get you clinked up

197
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,650
and battered, which I did.

198
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,260
And now, I would also like to extend
my personal apologies unto you.

199
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,200
All right?

200
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,700
I hear that you have allowed
Jesus to come into your life.

201
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,210
You heard, then?

202
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,130
Yeah, that's beautiful. That's wonderful.

203
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,650
Now, that's lovely, isn't
it? That's... that's lovely.

204
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,650
But I was wondering, how
does that work for you on a

205
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,300
day-to-day, considering
your line of work, mate?

206
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,370
Your apology's accepted.

207
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,660
Cos I hear you're a right
fucking nuisance with it.

208
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,820
Hello...

209
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,730
You see, all I'm saying is that
every man, he craves certainty.

210
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,410
Don't he? He craves the certainty,

211
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,090
even if that certainty of yours, right...?

212
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,860
Well, I mean... it's fucking
fanciful, mate, in't it?

213
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,460
Eh?

214
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm Old Testament.

215
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,140
Fucking hell. Look at that. Now, that...

216
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,420
.. that scares me more. Yeah.

217
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,210
Congratulations, Tommy.

218
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,570
You now have the finished
article right there, don't you?

219
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,290
See, that man, right, he
will murder and maim for you

220
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,480
with God on his side.

221
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,140
Yeah.

222
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,800
You don't want to let him go.

223
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,100
If we're going to do business with
this fucker, I demand to know why.

224
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,450
Right...

225
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,540
While I was in the hospital,
I formulated a plan

226
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,850
and this is how it's going to work...

227
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,490
So, the Russians cannot
be trusted to pay us.

228
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,340
we are going to take what is ours.

229
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,100
We need to see what's in their treasury.

230
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,540
And that's why we need Mr Solomons.

231
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:08,130
Right boys, just remember
they are fucking insane...

232
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,290
and dangerous.

233
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,130
And drunk on stuff we've never heard of.

234
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,880
And they're worse than
us for spirits and ghosts.

235
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,880
And today, they're going to test us.

236
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,380
Fuck them.

237
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,210
The Russians all turned and ran.

238
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,930
The Cossacks didn't run, Arthur.

239
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,250
Mr Shelby, welcome.

240
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,570
How is my car?

241
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,570
I think I'm in love with it.

242
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,610
And I, yours. So, we should
keep what we love, yes?

243
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,090
Excuse the reception.
Whenever we open the treasury,

244
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,540
the Cossacks are on guard.

245
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,250
'In Russia,

246
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,010
'men on the other side of the law
decorate their body in tattoos.'

247
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,410
- Right.
- Right.

248
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,450
Now, some of these tattoos are
proof of allegiance to underground

249
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,530
organisations, which are the sworn
enemies of the Royal household.

250
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,450
So, it's customary in Russian
Royal households to check for such

251
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,170
tattoos before engaging a man in business.

252
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,210
And as we approach the
allotted day, these ladies here

253
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,930
would like to make sure that you're
not assassins or infiltrators...

254
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,290
No, we're all good.

255
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,050
So, they'd like to check your skin.

256
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,570
They want to check our skin?

257
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,850
Yeah. Now my body's already been checked.

258
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,970
Although, at the time, I
wasn't sure that was the reason.

259
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,610
And now it's your turn.

260
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,730
Come on, boys.

261
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,920
Take your clothes off.

262
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,330
Fuck off.

263
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,290
No, no, no, no, no, no.

264
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,890
Obey.

265
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,290
That's it...

266
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,010
Obey, Arthur.

267
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,410
No, I won't be obeying nobody.
Get out of my way, I'm leaving.

268
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,530
Arthur, come here...

269
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,050
Come on, Arthur.

270
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,860
Shut up, John.

271
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,580
I will have a maid gather the
buttons and sew them back on.

272
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,970
Right. Fuck it.

273
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,770
There you go, ladies.

274
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,220
Made in fucking Birmingham.

275
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,420
All right, I think we've seen enough, eh?

276
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,460
Tatiana...

277
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,730
Your face, Arthur, is a fucking picture.

278
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,540
Sometimes assassins hide their
allegiances behind their balls.

279
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,660
You pass the test, soldier,
with flying colours.

280
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,850
You see...

281
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,380
He wants to be a good man.

282
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,450
But there now.

283
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,840
There.

284
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,420
Inside every man, there is a devil.

285
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,890
The real diamonds, eh?

286
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,650
It is traditional to seal the
successful examination with

287
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,570
vodka and music.

288
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,010
Holy fuck, Tommo, what was that?

289
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,130
Well done, boys. Eh?

290
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,800
Well done, Arthur.

291
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,820
Now you know what you
have to do next. All right?

292
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,650
One last job.

293
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Make contact and play nice.

294
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,370
Five minutes.

295
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,330
I brought Michael because as chief
accountant, he has to be witness.

296
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,210
Ada, can I... can I use your phone?

297
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,340
Michael, business first.

298
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,280
Michael, stop looking at your watch.

299
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,490
Ada, whilst you're reading this,
can I go and use your phone?

300
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,090
Who's the lucky girl, Michael?

301
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,810
Her name is Charlotte and
Michael cannot breathe

302
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,450
if he does not talk to
her every two hours!

303
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,690
Ada, please...

304
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,850
Phone's in the hall.
Dial nought for the line.

305
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,930
Thank you.

306
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,770
And keep it quick, I pay the bill.

307
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,810
I will.

308
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,530
Not for long!

309
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,890
Think about it, Pol,
together we can take control.

310
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,690
With two of us in the company,
we can straighten things out.

311
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,970
What about the politics?

312
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,970
You and me fighting together
and winning, that is politics.

313
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,620
That's a new kind of politics.

314
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,660
It's just this way, I get paid
and Karl gets a nice Christmas.

315
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,600
Good. Welcome to the Bourgeoisie.

316
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,210
My name is Smith.

317
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,330
My girlfriend is... is pregnant.

318
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,660
And, er... we'd like you to help us.

319
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,840
We need to fix a date.

320
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,300
Welcome to Shelby Company Limited.

321
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,050
Shelby Company Limited.

322
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,610
Limited and unarmed.

323
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,090
Michael, would you like to welcome
Ada, our new Head of Property

324
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,410
and Acquisitions.

325
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,200
Congratulations. Where do I sign?

326
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,970
Ada, have you got... um... whisky?

327
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,690
Yeah, Tommy.

328
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,170
I've already told him.

329
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,810
He's becoming too like his cousin.

330
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,290
I thought that was the idea.

331
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,650
Yeah, Tommy but with a bit
more fucking charm and class.

332
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,330
- Yeah.
- Oh, that'll help(!)

333
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,170
Yep. Where am I sleeping, Ada?

334
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,370
- Michael...
- In the room next to Karl's.

335
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,370
- Michael...
- Good night!

336
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,820
Oh. Heartbroken, poor love.

337
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,010
So how shall we celebrate?

338
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,100
Well, with Michael in
bed, I thought I might...

339
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,530
.. go for a little drive.

340
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,650
A drive? Where are you going to drive?

341
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,850
Polly?

342
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,010
Things have begun to develop with
the man who's painting my portrait.

343
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,400
Polly?

344
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,140
It's when you stand there in the dress...

345
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,650
.. you just find yourself talking
about every little thing.

346
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,570
- And have you...?
- No.

347
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,530
Not yet.

348
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,290
But he called me two nights ago to
say the portrait was finished and

349
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,610
I said I'd go there in the morning

350
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,960
but he said, no, he
wanted me there tonight.

351
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,450
Ada, you don't breathe a fucking
word of this to the boys.

352
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,130
- OK, but is he nice to you?
- No. No. I mean it, Ada.

353
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,610
Is he rich?

354
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,810
His friends write the papers, Ada.

355
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,290
Tommy would try and close him down.

356
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,330
So go.

357
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,480
He's like a tiny bird pecking at you...

358
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,410
.. and I think he's given up on me.

359
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,770
So bloody go.

360
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,200
Why should the boys have all the fun?

361
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,380
♪ Baby did a bad, bad thing

362
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,620
♪ Baby did a bad, bad thing

363
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,500

364
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,540
♪ I feel like dying... ♪

365
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,090

366
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,740
♪ Baby did a bad, bad thing. ♪

367
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,060
Don't move.

368
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,660
Wait there.

369
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,340
You're doing good, Stefan.

370
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,090
- It's a fucking mad house.
- Yeah, I know.

371
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,080
The Prince wants me to suck his cock.

372
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,050
And how much would you need to say yes?

373
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,800
That's on top of the day
rate for the arse slaps.

374
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,410
When am I out of here?

375
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,970
Soon.

376
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,690
What you got?

377
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,210
The strong room's not
guarded at night, but

378
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,050
they said they would kill the three
brothers in the "uglya dvor" --

379
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,970
coal yard.

380
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,730
The Duke was talking about
using a sword but the woman,

381
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,780
she was talking about using machine guns.

382
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,410
It's a fucking mad house, John.

383
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,570
We're doing up your pub in Nechells.

384
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,490
It looks a treat.

385
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Keep your fucking head up, Peaky boy, eh?

386
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,540
Fucking mad house, man.

387
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,100
We are almost there. This way.

388
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,290
This treasury was built
200 years ago to protect

389
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,740
the King's jewels in
case of French invasion.

390
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,380
We are now underneath the River Thames...

391
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,170
Your jeweller.

392
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,010
I don't think they trust me, Tommy.

393
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,770
Mr Solomons is the only
jeweller I trust in London.

394
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,740
Yes, trust. Yes. Might have to
add that on the old invoice.

395
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,570
Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,250
As we agreed, your jeweller
will now select items

397
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,170
to a total value of £70,000.

398
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,050
When you have selected your chosen items,

399
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,130
they will be put into a box and stored.

400
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,210
When you have fulfilled
your part of the deal,

401
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,000
the box will be delivered to you.

402
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,730
May I just start, right, by saying
that I may choose to stay here

403
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,290
and just starve to death
and choke on sapphires

404
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,240
rather than ever go back
to the fucking world again?

405
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,530
Yeah, well, there is a good reason
for that, you know, little man.

406
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,970
Because my shop, right, is just
above a rum house, so all the...

407
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,050
- You speak Russian?
- I do, yeah. I do.

408
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,050
Cos of me mum. Yeah, my mother.

409
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,290
You people, all right,

410
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,610
you hunted my mum...

411
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,810
with dogs...

412
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,730
through the snow.

413
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,730
Yeah.

414
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,250
But today, right, is for
forgiveness, ain't it?

415
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,040
For selection.

416
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,300
So, now...

417
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,410
Hello...

418
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,170
Right. I think it's
fair to say, yeah, 1,500.

419
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,330
1,500?

420
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,850
All right, I'll give you 1,800.

421
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,210
I know the current market value. 18 it is.

422
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,250
That's very gracious of you.

423
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,450
Right, then. How about
say we look at this.

424
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,050
This is a nice little bit
going on there, isn't it?

425
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,210
Oh, but that was a gift
from Tsar Nicholas.

426
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,170
I ain't asking you, though,
am I? I ain't asking you.

427
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,730
All right. I come here to do business,

428
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,810
offer my professional services.
If you keep interrupting me,

429
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,090
I won't be able to focus and
do my job, you understand?

430
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,250
Mr Romanov, let me remind
you, we were told to come here

431
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,610
and choose what we like...

432
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,330
and now we have chosen.

433
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,330
Tsar Nicholas give you
that? I'll give you four.

434
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,180
Five... with the royal provenance.

435
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,850
Done.

436
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,610
Right, Rumplestiltskin, let's go over here

437
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,850
and have a look what's in these boxes.

438
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,730
Two. That's much nicer. Ten.

439
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,970
That there is definitely a five.

440
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,210
Are you keeping score?

441
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,730
- Yes, I am.
- Another five.

442
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,650
- Seven. - Six. - Let's call it six, eh?

443
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,410
- Beauty. Look at that.
- Beautiful, isn't it?

444
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,010
- That is splendid. - Splendid,
yes. - Beautiful, is it not? - It is.

445
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,490
- It's a work of art. You recognise
this work, do you? - Immediately.

446
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,370
I'm guessing, right, that all the
bad ideas around here, they're you.

447
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,450
They are you, aren't they? Hmm?

448
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,690
What do you mean?

449
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,090
Yeah. Tommy, see this, right?
It's got paste in it. That's paste.

450
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,570
Let me tell you something, son.

451
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,250
Somebody comes into my shop
with some paste like this,

452
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,050
usually what I make them do, right,

453
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,170
is fucking swallow it.

454
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,820
Eh? What game are you playing?

455
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,620
- Eh?
- Mr Solomons...

456
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,610
- .. shall we, er... shall
we clean it up? - Be careful.

457
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,980
Eh?

458
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,290
Mm?

459
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,050
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Right, what we got?

461
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,740
37,600.

462
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,020
Well...

463
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,600
Do you have any eggs?

464
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,810
I am simply asking...

465
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,210
Faberge is not part of the deal.

466
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,330
We would not offer you Faberge eggs.

467
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,010
Mr Romanov, my jeweller here,

468
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,930
he advises me to insist...

469
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,330
on Faberge.

470
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,780
It's a deal-breaker, Tommy.

471
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,100
Oh...

472
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,650
I brought that from Crimea myself.

473
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,370
Fucking hell.

474
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,940
With the provenance of that being
laid by such a delicate beauty...

475
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,980
.. that does indeed bring the
entire selection to £70,000.

476
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,490
- Good man. - And now, Mr Shelby,
you will join your brothers and

477
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,210
Mr Solomons will take his leave.

478
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,100
I demand absolute honesty.

479
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,690
- Oh, sorry. Can I...?
- I insist.

480
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,240
There.

481
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,180
A woman of style and substance.

482
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,860
I'm a student of silence. Is
this good silence or bad silence?

483
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,440
It's good.

484
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,200
It's good.

485
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,060
- It's very good.
- No. It's still wet.

486
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,610
I know it isn't saying much in
the grand scheme of things but

487
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,600
this is the best work I've ever done.

488
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,840
I'll miss Sundays.

489
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,300
There will be more Sundays.

490
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,210
Sorry.

491
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,130
Sorry, can you not do that, please?

492
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,290
Can you just not do that, please?

493
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

494
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,140
- It's all right. - I'm sorry. - It's
all right. No, honestly, it's all right.

495
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,400
Vodka!

496
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,280
I sewed your buttons back on.

497
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,320
I wanted to see if I did a good job.

498
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,160
Yeah, you did.

499
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
You did a good job.

500
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,580
Sir?

501
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,810
No.

502
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,330
I didn't.

503
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,200
My aunt only employs the best whores.

504
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,250
How did you feel when I held him?

505
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,170
You were jealous.

506
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,490
You wanted to kill me.

507
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,130
Or him.

508
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,320
No?

509
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,680
Why do you play games with people...

510
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,290
.. when there is no benefit to you?

511
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,240
In Russia, because we were bored.

512
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,080
In England, because...

513
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,560
.. we don't know how to stop.

514
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,280
At least there are silly
games and orgasms.

515
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,970
So let's fuck.

516
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,330
Here?

517
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,330
No.

518
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,520
No, in a darker place.

519
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,580
You still love her, don't you?

520
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,050
You want her?

521
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,450
Why would you fucking say that?

522
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,850
Why would you fucking say it?

523
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,690
- Just tell me. You love her.
- What are you fucking saying?

524
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,140
You want her? You want her.

525
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,500
Who the fuck are you? Eh?

526
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,340
Hm?

527
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,410
What are you fucking saying?

528
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,020
You want her...

529
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,300
.. tonight?

530
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,460
Watch...

531
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,970
In the palace in Tbilisi,
there was a priest...

532
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,690
and he would put his hands here.

533
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,010
And with that strangulation
there was also ecstasy.

534
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,160
It's called Khlysty, a Siberian prayer.

535
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,370
You are almost hung over.

536
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,210
You are almost dead, but in that moment...

537
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,770
Women who had lost men
in the war would lay down

538
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,930
and they would fuck...

539
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,290
the ghost.

540
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,650
You want her.

541
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,010
You want her, don't you?

542
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,730
You want her.

There.

I tell you what...

I tell you what, I swear at one point...

576
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,330
at one point I looked down,

577
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,490
I got the top of her head,

578
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,210
and I thought she was going to
pull me cock off in her hand

579
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,370
and fucking throw it out of the window.

Oh...

581
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,090
She sucked me dry, I swear to God.

582
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,010
Like fucking spud water at the end.

583
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,540
We've had worse nights.

584
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,570
You're quiet, Arthur, eh?

585
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck off.

586
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,330
How was your night, brother?

587
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,930
- You got all your buttons back, eh?
- Yeah, all right. Fuck off.

588
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,210
Yeah, what's God going to
say about it, Arthur, eh?

589
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,400
Fuck off, both of ya.

590
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,780
He tells Linda everything.

591
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,290
Every single thing.

592
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,740
Yeah, well, we'll see.

593
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,700
We're going to miss you
when you're gone now, Arthur.

594
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,860
Just drive the fucking car.

595
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,090
Private Letso reporting
for duty, Sergeant Major.

596
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,010
At ease, Private.

597
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,730
Good to see you.

598
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,690
Seven left...

599
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,530
out of 50.

600
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,610
Should I get them tea?

601
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,010
Get 'em beer, Curly.

602
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,690
They used to run on it
like cars on petrol.

603
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,490
Give them the Black Country stuff.

604
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,330
It's in a barrel with the tack.

605
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,650
They're going to fucking clean me out.

606
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,090
Whatever they take, they'll
put back. They're good men.

607
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,010
John, Arthur.

608
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,330
You remember these boys?

609
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,570
Well, if it ain't the Tipton
fucking Clay-Kickers, eh?

610
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,420
- Clay-Kickers.
- Come here, you.

611
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,490
This is William Letso, from the
South African Native Labour Corps.

612
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,090
Sent to Flanders from the
Bloemfontein diamond mines.

613
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,810
The best tunneller I ever met.

614
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,130
So there's three cellars
underneath the house.

615
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,250
Wine, kitchen, septic.

616
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,370
There's a tunnel here that
runs from the house underneath

617
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,690
the river to an underground strong room.

618
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,410
Now this used to be the Palace treasury.

619
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:36,970
The tunnel runs directly west and
it's separated from the house

620
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,570
by three iron doors

621
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,570
with locks we can't open.

622
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,100
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room direct.

623
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,340
Primrose Hill, 23. Ada Thorne.

624
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,170
Ada?

625
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:34,420
Is Michael still there?

626
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,450
Right, would you tell him
that I've taken the car?

627
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,970
He can take the train.

628
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,020
Try and find out why he's
been so bloody sour lately.

629
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,930
Shouldn't go looking through
other people's private things.

630
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,650
He's my son.

631
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,690
The bullet was mine. I never
got a chance to fire it.

632
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:40,330
And the gypsy rules say
it must be passed on.

633
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,170
It's not about rules, Pol.

634
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,420
It's about he asked me.

635
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,410
It's about he told me

636
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,660
why he wanted to do it.

637
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,090
Now, if I tell you,

638
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,810
I can't take the knowledge back.

639
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,680
Better off without it.

640
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,570
So this is when he was with the parish.

641
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,020
Better off without it, Pol.

642
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,050
This is when he was with the Fathers...

643
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,000
This is when he was in the
care of the Holy Fathers.

644
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,410
Michael wants it so you don't know.

- That priest...

646
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,090
who was there...

647
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,410
when he was taken in...

648
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,930
and who is still walking
the fucking earth.

649
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,250
Fuck.

650
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,170
Fuck.

He asked me, Pol...

652
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,540
and I said yes.

653
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,170
And I said,

654
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,940
"You put a bullet in
that fucker's brains...

No.

657
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,620
Not my son.

658
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,850
He'll still be as dead if Arthur does it.

659
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,900
And part of him will always stay dead.

660
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,930
I swear to God...

661
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,370
In whose house it took place.

662
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,160
.. if my son pulls the trigger...

663
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,380
.. I will bring this whole fucking
organisation down around your ears.
