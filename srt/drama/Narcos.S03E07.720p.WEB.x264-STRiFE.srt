2
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,826
On the road from Galilee,

3
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:41,833
Christ came upon a beggar
who had thrice been denied alms.

4
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:49,591
Christ asked him if he'd taken before
that which wasn't his.

5
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,760
"Yes," the man said.

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:57,349
He'd taken what he felt hadn't been given.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,979
Christ asked him...

8
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:08,026
Christ asked him
where had it left him...

9
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,381
Give him some.

10
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,949
Boss, I think I know whose car this is.

11
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,978
My name is Pacho Herrera.

12
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,232
I want Gerda Salazar
and her fucking sons delivered to me.

13
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,529
Until that happens,
nobody in the North Valley is safe.

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,323
Is that clear?

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,619
Make sure Orlando Henao gets the message.

16
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,996
And now...

17
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
pray.

18
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,709
Pray.

19
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,538
<i>War had returned to Colombia.</i>

20
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,375
<i>Cocaine cartels are about succession.</i>

21
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,797
<i>The number two guys realize that
the number one guys are on their way out.</i>

22
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>So they decide to speed things up.</i>

23
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,596
<i>With Gilberto Rodríguez in jail,
there was blood in the water.</i>

24
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,390
<i>And blood begets more blood.</i>

25
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,311
<i>I told you that Cali ran their empire
like a business.</i>

26
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:16,650
<i>Well, when your business gets too big,
you start selling franchises.</i>

27
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,947
<i>Cali basically allowed traffickers
who would normally be their rivals</i>

28
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,116
<i>to work under the umbrella
of their political protection...</i>

29
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,036
<i>to use their cocaine distribution network</i>

30
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,540
<i>and to take advantage of their muscle
when shit got heavy.</i>

31
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:36,461
<i>In return, they demanded loyalty
and a hefty cut of the profits.</i>

32
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,922
<i>And for a long time, that was cool.</i>

33
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,884
<i>But as brilliant
as Cali's surrender plan was,</i>

34
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>it didn't take into account that
nobody wants to retire in second place.</i>

35
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,225
<i>North Valley cartel
was ready for first place.</i>

36
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,144
<i>Traffickers like Iván Urdinola...</i>

37
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,814
<i>Henry Loaiza,</i>

38
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,899
<i>Gerda Salazar,</i>

39
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,570
<i>and the North Valley boss, Orlando Henao.</i>

40
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,947
<i>They didn't need to retire.</i>

41
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,616
<i>They controlled not only
the rural North Valley,</i>

42
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,577
<i>but the port of Buenaventura,</i>

43
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,662
<i>from which most of the world's
cocaine shipped.</i>

44
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
<i>It was the jewel in their crown.</i>

45
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>And they did business...
differently than Cali.</i>

46
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,599
<i>Let's just say they didn't give a shit
about public relations.</i>

47
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,312
<i>"Fuck the Gentlemen of Cali,"
they figured.</i>

48
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,024
<i>With the port and Cali's
current legal troubles,</i>

49
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,942
<i>they had a shot at taking over.</i>

50
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,069
<i>It is often said in organized crime...</i>

51
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,071
<i>war is bad for business.</i>

52
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,866
Unless it's won.

53
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,202
Buenaventura is in Henao's territory.

54
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:55,290
We have to get the port back
so we can maintain our delivery schedules.

55
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,418
You think that...

56
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,630
Can it be done?

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,387
Negotiating with the government,
and the fucking surrender...

58
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,142
it all means one thing.

59
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:20,815
Our allies and enemies think we're weak.

60
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,152
My brother Gilberto
is responsible for that.

61
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
How's Alvaro?

62
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,079
What do you want me to say, Miguel?

63
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,707
The doctors still don't know
if his cock will ever work again.

64
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,877
He's 22 years old.

65
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:48,259
I swear to you, Pacho,
the Salazars will pay for that shit.

66
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,238
You know where Miguel is.
Why haven't you arrested him?

67
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,389
It's not that simple, Jorge.

68
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,766
This kind of operation
needs to be vetted, approved.

69
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,143
Wait a minute.
How many people know about this?

70
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,229
Very few. And nobody knows your name.

71
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,564
We're gonna arrest
Miguel Rodríguez, all right?

72
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,316
And you can put all this behind you.

73
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,195
- Can I ask what your plan is?
- Small team, just before dawn.

74
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,197
- When?
- Zero-four-hundred. Tomorrow.

75
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,741
Transpo's three trucks
coming from different directions...

76
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,453
No, that's not gonna work. Miguel has
rotating security around the building.

77
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,581
They see anything unusual,
a call goes out to Fercho Castillo.

78
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,708
That's Miguel's assistant.

79
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,751
They'll be out
before you get through the lobby.

80
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,045
So then help us find
a blind spot in the perimeter.

81
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,965
There's no blind spots.
These people are professional.

82
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,593
- What about if we hit at shift change?
- We overlap shifts because of that reason.

83
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,763
Guys!

84
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,558
That's it? That's the plan?

85
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,518
Christ.

86
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,283
Have your entire team take<i> Carrera Diez.</i>
Make a turn at<i> Avenida Siete.</i>

87
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,703
I'll post a man there
that's gonna let you guys through.

88
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,498
You're putting a lot of faith in this guy.
You sure we can count on him?

89
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,334
I'll be posted there,
but if you don't get Miguel,

90
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,295
they're gonna kill me.
Do you understand that?

91
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,274
- They're gonna kill my family, my kids.
- We're not gonna let that happen.

92
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,010
Next time we see you, we're putting you
and your family on a plane to America.

93
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,139
You're getting out.
Just like we promised.

94
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,059
With Miguel Rodríguez in charge,

95
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,942
we're dealing
with a different kind of cartel.

96
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,146
Then maybe you
shouldn't have arrested his brother.

97
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,441
This operation could significantly impact
the cartel's day-to-day,

98
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,525
stop the bloodshed.

99
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,111
Based on information
you're unwilling to share.

100
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,864
- Well, due to the sensitivity...
- Yes, you've said.

101
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,701
But gentlemen, to ask me to sign off
on this operation blindly?

102
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,537
You haven't given me anything
other than a code name.

103
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,708
How much can you trust this informant...
"Natalia"?

104
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,462
Or is that too much to ask?

105
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,380
I understand your frustration.

106
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,134
But I've been assured
that this intelligence is viable.

107
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,349
If you won't tell me what you have,
then please, get to what you need.

108
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,520
- A small team. No more than ten men.
- Contact General Vargas.

109
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,232
- I'll authorize him to provide you one.
- Actually, sir,

110
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,485
we were hoping you would provide
somebody independent of General Vargas.

111
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:16,616
If you would
just indulge us this one request.

112
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,288
Shall I assume you have someone in mind?

113
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,624
General Serrano, sir.

114
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,759
<i>Agente</i> Peña...

115
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,347
another setback and I won't be able
to help you, nor will I want to.

116
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,309
The case for the surrender deal
will only be strengthened.

117
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,270
And you and your team will be gone.

118
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,774
I appreciate your honesty, sir.

119
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,195
Thank you, Minister.

120
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,625
<i>Through intimidation and corruption...</i>

121
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,005
<i>the Cali Cartel had effectively taken much
of the Colombian National Police force...</i>

122
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,088
MONASTERY OF EL CARMEN

123
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,507
<i>and bent them to its will.</i>

124
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,219
<i>But there was one force it couldn't bend:</i>

125
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,850
<i>a man named General José Serrano...</i>

126
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>whose faith and integrity
were exactly what we needed.</i>

127
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,692
Agent Peña, nice to meet you.
Your reputation precedes you.

128
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,531
<i>Serrano took two things seriously:</i>

129
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,700
<i>his service to God...</i>

130
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,995
<i>and his belief in the rule of law.</i>

131
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,290
<i>He expected the same from his men.</i>

132
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,628
<i>For him, it began at an early age.</i>

133
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,881
<i>He was a</i> campesino,
<i>the son of a dirt farmer...</i>

134
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,508
<i>He had never owned a pair of shoes.</i>

135
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:03,139
<i>One day, a group of mounted policemen
rode into his village.</i>

136
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,810
<i>It reminded him of the holy knights
that he had read about,</i>

137
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,648
<i>religious warriors on a mission from God.</i>

138
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,945
<i>He knew then...</i>

139
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,199
<i>that he would be one of them.</i>

140
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,791
<i>He joined the force expecting
to find other like-minded men.</i>

141
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>But instead, he found corruption.</i>

142
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>From where he could, he rooted it out.</i>

143
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,091
<i>When he became chief
of his first small town,</i>

144
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,969
<i>he fired over two-thirds of the department
for being on the take...</i>

145
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,053
ANTI-NARCOTIC POLICE

146
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,182
<i>declaring war on corrupt cops
and traffickers alike.</i>

147
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,435
<i>I will put
in maximum effort, with all my soul,</i>

148
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,563
<i>into fighting corruption.</i>

149
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,441
<i>Because when there is corruption...</i>

150
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,237
<i>there is no procedure,
there is no peace of mind.</i>

151
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,574
<i>Twenty years, numerous
failed assassination attempts later...</i>

152
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,077
<i>he was still waging his war.</i>

153
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,705
<i>By the book, of course.</i>

154
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,382
This informant of yours,

155
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,668
is he close to Miguel Rodríguez?

156
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,962
He's provided us with Miguel's location.

157
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,798
That's why it's urgent we move now.

158
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,968
May take a miracle
to get this close again.

159
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,886
Only God creates miracles.

160
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,976
It's for us to use the tools he's bestowed
to resolve these matters.

161
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,690
Any chance God's bestowed the right men
to pull off this operation?

162
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,317
God has many soldiers.

163
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:44,157
Mine are honest men
who answer to higher powers than you or I.

164
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,827
I'm not concerned about them.
But I'm worried about other issues.

165
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,122
Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
has led to new stipulations.

166
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,624
From now on, any warrant I sign

167
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,878
has to be filed
with the local<i> fiscale</i> office in Cali.

168
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,672
Which the cartel will know about.

169
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,591
Possibly.

170
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:06,471
Truth is, your tactics
won't be allowed a second run.

171
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,931
Just have to find new ones, General.

172
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,643
Your men, General, where are they now?

173
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,854
Awaiting their orders.

174
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,648
The target is Miguel Rodríguez.

175
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,151
Our operation will succeed

176
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,654
because you fulfill your duty to your God

177
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,366
and to your country. Understood?

178
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,950
Yes, sir!

179
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,162
The operation from a strategic
point of view is a nightmare.

180
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,706
There's a security perimeter.

181
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,169
As soon as the lead team hits the lobby,
the target knows we're inside.

182
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,799
Agent Feistl and I will be
right behind you, arriving by helicopter.

183
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,469
We'll land on the roof
and come in from above.

184
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,097
- We're going to box them in.
- Yes.

185
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,681
We have an inside man.

186
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,769
He'll be posted right here,
giving us our best way in.

187
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,487
Which one do you want?

188
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,406
- This one!
- Okay. Perfect.

189
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
Girls, please get ready.

190
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,664
Paola... you can't do this.

191
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,875
- I'm taking the girls to my parents'.
- Paola, you can't do this.

192
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,839
Especially with what's going on
with the cartel.

193
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,462
What? What are you saying?

194
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,633
Are you telling me I can't protect
my daughters? Is that what you're saying?

195
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,887
No. What I'm saying is that we need
to act normal, like everything is fine.

196
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,558
Everything isn't fine, Jorge.
Everything isn't fine.

197
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,601
They could be watching you, me, the girls.

198
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,104
Miguel's become paranoid.
Do you understand?

199
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,734
I'll call you in a few days.
The girls will want to hear from you.

200
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,238
Paola. Please.

201
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,826
The Americans are going to try
to arrest Miguel.

202
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,745
I'm going to make sure they succeed.

203
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,748
Tomorrow, we will be on a plane.
You, me, the girls.

204
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,250
We're leaving Colombia.

205
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,669
Who told you I want to live in the U.S.?

206
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,674
Who told you our girls want to leave
the only home they've ever known?

207
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,676
So we need to disappear.
Is that your plan?

208
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,219
Explain to me again, I don't get it.

209
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,681
What happens if the Americans fail?

210
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,024
Paola, please. Please... wait.

211
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,748
Don't leave.

212
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,543
We weren't poor, Jorge.

213
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,548
We always had choices.

214
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,720
This was your choice.

215
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,858
What about the warrant?

216
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,528
You still haven't filed the paperwork,

217
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,405
and I can't authorize this raid
without it.

218
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,032
We're bringing the<i> fiscale</i> with us.

219
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,953
Until we're on-site,
no one else knows the real target.

220
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,412
Arrest him quickly.

221
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,249
Because if word of this gets out,

222
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,626
they'll try to stop us
with everything they've got.

223
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,002
General...

224
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,712
General...

225
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,174
one more thing.

226
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,970
I'd like to ask you to remain in Bogotá.

227
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,933
Those are my men.
That's my signature on the warrant.

228
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,061
Which puts your name on the line, sir.

229
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,480
If anything goes wrong,
and we look like...

230
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,482
Like what? Like idiots?

231
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,652
It wouldn't be the first time,
as I understand it.

232
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,822
You don't trust me.

233
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,992
But you can't do this without me.

234
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,870
That's true,
but I know the system we're up against.

235
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,541
With your name on the warrant...

236
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,044
there's no doubt
the cartel's watching you.

237
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,180
As soon as you make the arrest,

238
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:23,311
I'll be the one to lead Miguel Rodríguez
into custody when the press arrive.

239
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,815
I'll stay here praying for your success,
because there's no doubt...

240
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,775
it's your reputation now on the line.

241
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,113
Hi, boss. What's going on?
Getting a little late for you, huh?

242
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,366
Just checking in.

243
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,077
You run those taps over in El Lido

244
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,787
- like I asked?
- Yes, sir.

245
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,872
- Perfect.
- All right. Well done.

246
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,255
Enrique, why don't you take off
and I'll keep an eye out here tonight?

247
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,675
Is this some kind of test?

248
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,679
Someone offers me a day off, I say yes.

249
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,355
My wife's been hounding me.

250
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,235
I could use a night away
from all of her questions, Enrique.

251
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,405
I'm glad I'm not married yet.

252
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,532
Don't make that mistake.

253
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,994
Thank you, boss.

254
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,713
It's Miguel.

255
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,384
Don't worry, boss.
I'll hang out until you get back.

256
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,345
Good.

257
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,518
Miguel's just finishing his call.
Come on in.

258
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,856
We can discuss that later.

259
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,902
He's here now.

260
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,531
Yes, you've said.

261
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,034
Bye.

262
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,246
My son.

263
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,042
You know how he is. A little...

264
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,169
complicated.

265
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,379
He is your son.

266
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,242
This the guy with the warrant?

267
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,732
Yeah, I think so.

268
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,691
Yeah.

269
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,528
Looks friendly.

270
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,365
Yeah, I don't give a shit,
as long as he does what he's told.

271
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:11,455
Good things
are coming, Jorge. You'll be part of it.

272
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,251
I'm glad, sir. Is there anything else?

273
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,962
Take a seat.

274
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,177
You know that my brother...

275
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,556
he doesn't like this war thing.

276
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,684
He thinks it's a mistake,
being at war with the North Valley.

277
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,229
He said this brings too much tension,

278
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,982
with the violence and everything.

279
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,111
He's getting counsel from men
I don't trust at all.

280
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,198
Those phones that you...

281
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,493
how do you call it? Wiretaps?

282
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:52,954
Wiretap.

283
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,416
Do you think...

284
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,004
you could put one
on my brother's phone in prison?

285
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,306
You want me
to tap Gilberto's phone in prison?

286
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,767
Mm-hmm.

287
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,644
For his own good.

288
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,525
Only if it became necessary.

289
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,236
So... for him.

290
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,990
Of course, sir. Anything you need.

291
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,575
Good.

292
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,911
This stays here.

293
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:34,997
Of course, sir.

294
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,631
Well, I should get back downstairs.
I'm posted outside tonight.

295
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,967
You? Nonsense. You're too old for that!

296
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,678
I don't mind at all. It's part of my job.

297
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,973
No. No way.
Have one of the young guys do it.

298
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:57,061
You know, I'm eating late.
Fercho was about to make something.

299
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,187
You'll join us.

300
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,898
You'll join us, Jorge.

301
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,276
Fercho! We will be two. Come.

302
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,439
Do you like filets, Jorge?

303
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,233
Yes, very much.

304
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,195
Hey, I've been meaning to tell you...

305
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,118
the building guys,
they've been idling in front of the house.

306
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,035
Blocking our exit.

307
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,124
You see that?
Feels good when one's been taken care of.

308
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,711
Yes. Keep your walkie charged.

309
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,380
And the exits clear.

310
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,756
Like you said.

311
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,425
You want one?

312
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,803
Yes, thanks.

313
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,729
Look,
I have a bottle of white wine that is...

314
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,733
Excuse me, boss, if it's not
too much trouble, I prefer red wine.

315
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:29,236
Okay. It's a shame, but... okay.

316
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,907
But I have a really nice bottle
of red wine. I'll bring it. I'll be back.

317
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,214
<i>You're in for a treat tonight.</i>

318
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:53,927
Miguel has me cooking
with these Japanese bread crumbs.

319
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,389
Sounds crazy,
but it's actually more tasty.

320
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,266
That's very interesting.

321
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,978
Hey, Fercho, looks like the oil's ready.

322
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,855
Yes.

323
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,246
Boss! Boss! Boss!

324
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,250
We have cars heading towards the building.
I repeat, boss, three trucks with cops...

325
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,071
Gentlemen, by law, I can't let you in.
This is a residence...

326
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,656
We have a warrant. Hey.

327
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,159
A residence?

328
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,243
What?

329
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,461
Hear that?

330
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,554
Enrique! What the fuck is going on?

331
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,305
You didn't inform us
there's a helicopter?

332
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,850
- How the fuck did they find us?!
- Sir, calm down.

333
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,727
We need to get you out of here now.
There's no time to discuss this.

334
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,021
- Miguel, what's happening?
- You need to hide.

335
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,816
Is there somewhere we can take you?
A<i> caleta</i> in the apartment?

336
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,486
Stop. Get to the lobby.
Get to the lobby and stop them.

337
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,114
It's better if he goes.
Every second counts.

338
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,907
Get to the lobby! Stop them.

339
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,075
María.

340
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,676
No, no, no.

341
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,403
- Colombian law.
- No, but if he's got a<i> caleta</i> in there...

342
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,990
If you want anything we do in there
to count, follow the fucking rules.

343
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,536
Van Ness. Where are you?

344
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,122
I need the<i> fiscale</i> upstairs.
Where the fuck are you?

345
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,082
This isn't a financial building.

346
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,251
Miguel Rodríguez is upstairs.
We have the warrant.

347
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,962
Yes. Without an address filed in Cali.

348
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:34,880
So fill it in.

349
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,926
As I've told you, my office authorized
the search of a financial corporation.

350
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,427
What the fuck is this?

351
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,710
Hands in the air!

352
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,688
Look, sir, as I told your agent,
I can't do...

353
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,691
Write the address in right now.
That's why you're here.

354
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,569
You decide how you want this to go.

355
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,739
Okay.

356
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,917
- Are you Fernando Castillo?
- What's all this?

357
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,712
We're here to arrest Miguel Rodríguez.

358
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,506
Miguel isn't here.

359
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
There's nothing.

360
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,107
Look above.

361
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,899
Take that off!

362
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,986
Cabinets!

363
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,570
There's nothing here.

364
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,864
Try the ones below.

365
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,879
Who's in charge here?

366
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,174
I asked you a question.

367
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,386
I'm sorry, sir. We're not authorized
to let anyone inside.

368
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,888
You see this fucking badge?

369
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,229
Your superiors failed to report
this operation with the local bureau.

370
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,273
I'd like to know
who'll be answering for that.

371
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,317
These are direct orders
from my superiors, sir.

372
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,526
Step out of my way.

373
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,991
Peinados, stay here.

374
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,908
Let's go!

375
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:27,992
Move!

376
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,997
Sergeant, you copy?
The local police are heading up.

377
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,629
Go to the back, please.
You can sit on the couch.

378
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,008
How long is this going to take?

379
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,091
Chris.

380
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,516
What are you doing?

381
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,521
Hey, kid. Where is he?
Was Miguel Rodríguez here?

382
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,023
Don't speak to my son.

383
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,691
Okay.

384
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,569
Can he please go to his room?
He's just a child.

385
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,863
- Is the room clear?
- Clear.

386
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,616
Okay, leave. Go ahead.

387
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,495
Flores.

388
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,208
- Who's in charge here?
- DEA.

389
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,253
I assume with Colombian support.

390
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,508
I don't see a ranking officer.

391
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,344
Guess that puts me in charge.

392
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,926
There's an exit over there
that leads to the street.

393
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,974
Do you have anyone posted there?
Of course.

394
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,061
If you'd properly notified my unit,
we could have blocked that exit

395
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,772
- and prevented this escape.
- There's no evidence he got out.

396
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,525
That's why you're looking
through the kitchen cabinets?

397
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,992
David!

398
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,329
David!

399
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,375
Wake up, man! We have to go.

400
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,378
Let go of her already.

401
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,463
Come on, man!

402
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,618
I think it's time
you call Natalia.

403
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,117
Find out what she's heard.

404
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,201
Um...

405
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,620
Boss, that's Natalia on the couch.

406
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,626
Find out what the fuck is going on.

407
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,930
Just don't say a word, brother.

408
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,798
We need to put them each
in separate rooms.

409
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,383
Fercho. Let's go.

410
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,222
To the right.

411
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,902
This is messed up, man.

412
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:12,240
- If your dad's still inside...
- Just drive the fucking car.

413
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,749
I'm just trying to do my fucking job.

414
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,824
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Gotta be hiding somewhere.

415
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,046
- Gotta be a<i> caleta.</i>
- Where?

416
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,209
- I don't know.
- Help us. We're running out of time.

417
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,656
I don't know this fucking place.
I've never been here before.

418
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,678
I don't know the floor plan.
I don't know anything. This is new.

419
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,388
Wait.

420
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:41,894
Get back out there.

421
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,398
Fuck! Okay. Come on.

422
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,943
Wait. I need you to hit me first.

423
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,079
<i>What we know is that agents of the DEA</i>

424
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,997
<i>burst into the building this morning,</i>

425
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,999
<i>just before dawn...</i>

426
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,127
Hey, what did Salcedo say?

427
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,130
Salcedo! What did he say?

428
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,384
Sir, the thing is...
no one's heard from him.

429
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,261
Motherfucker!

430
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,305
Do me a favor.

431
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,976
Go to his house and check
what the fuck he's doing

432
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,478
that's more important than this. Please.

433
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,898
Bye. Bye.

434
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,821
<i>There's a surreal atmosphere
outside the San Jardín building.</i>

435
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,324
<i>While curiosity is growing
about the operation</i>

436
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,248
<i>and this has grabbed
the attention of the city,</i>

437
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:42,247
<i>it isn't clear who the target
of the operation is.</i>

438
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,419
- Think he made it to another floor?
- No, I think he changed the one he's on.

439
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,640
Good morning, ma'am.
We need to get into your apartment.

440
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,602
Help me.

441
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,104
- Lift.
- Hold on.

442
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,399
Okay. One, two...

443
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,539
Sir, listen to this.

444
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,174
635.

445
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,095
486.

446
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,439
480.

447
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,288
Having fun over there, Van Ness?

448
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,624
Pretty sure the door upstairs
didn't close properly.

449
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,550
What happened here?

450
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,511
- It fell over.
- It fell over?

451
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,262
I mean, in a way, it did.

452
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,890
Check this out.

453
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,987
Come on, there's something we gotta do.

454
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,120
Try to control the wrist.

455
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,037
Okay, let's go.

456
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,997
The motherfucker's practicing
his backhand.

457
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,791
That's it. Try to control it.

458
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,877
- Hey! You bastard!
- Hey, fellas. Where are you going?

459
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,481
- We're in the middle...
- Who are you talking to, motherfucker?

460
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,090
We're in the middle of a lesson here.

461
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,425
Who are you talking to?

462
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,708
Why the fuck is there a raid going on
at my dad's house,

463
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,679
while you're here having tennis lessons?

464
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,015
David, I don't know what
you're talking about. I don't understand.

465
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,519
You're going to go
and help my fucking dad. Now! Understood?

466
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,602
- Yes.
- Let's go.

467
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,356
Go on. Quickly. What were you saying?

468
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,275
It's fine.

469
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,317
Pussy.

470
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,280
What exactly am I looking for?

471
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,074
This area downstairs
measures in at 108 inches.

472
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,618
Guys, I'm reading 84.

473
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,334
Can you set me up?

474
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,795
- Got the perfect shot.
- Pan towards the top.

475
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,145
You guys can't tear down that wall.
You don't have authorization.

476
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,189
What are you going to do to stop us?

477
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,399
Let's go.

478
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,757
There's an air space back there.

479
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,362
- Stop what you're doing.
- We've been over this.

480
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,826
As head
of the Attorney General's office in Cali,

481
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,475
I have to insist
you put down that hammer right now.

482
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,728
You're currently in violation
of Article 22 of the...

483
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,688
What's that? Arresting a fugitive?

484
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,106
- Chris.
- No, fuck that!

485
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,525
Miguel Rodríguez is right here.
Inside this wall.

486
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,444
And you've broken the law.

487
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,866
As the legal authority in this room...

488
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:13,119
I demand that you cease and desist
your search of the premises immediately.

489
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,212
Put it down. We're done here.

490
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,926
Yes, and I'll need
your documentation from the embassy.

491
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,009
Your passports.

492
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,472
Your passports.

493
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,852
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Give him your passport, Chris.

494
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm filing
an official complaint against each of you.

495
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,281
<i>It has now been confirmed that the search</i>

496
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,283
<i>of the San Jardín building
has been abandoned.</i>

497
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,536
<i>Agents from the DEA,
along with the Colombian special forces,</i>

498
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,163
<i>have been seen leaving the building.</i>

499
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,582
<i>We can now confirm
that the target of this investigation</i>

500
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,001
<i>was in fact cartel godfather
Miguel Rodríguez.</i>

501
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:05,213
<i>With the search now over
and no arrest made,</i>

502
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,549
<i>questions regarding the actions of the DEA
and the credibility of their sources</i>

503
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:09,842
<i>will surely arise.</i>

504
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,429
<i>It's been a frenetic morning here</i>

505
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:17,141
<i>as a great number of police officers
exited the building.</i>

506
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,225
<i>The official word from the National Police
is the search has been abandoned.</i>

507
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:26,192
<i>Now the question is, what evidence
did the DEA have to run this operation?</i>

508
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,404
<i>The U.S. Embassy
hasn't released a statement yet.</i>

509
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,618
Thanks for having
our backs there, boss.

510
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,913
Keep our eyes on the building.
No way Miguel leaves here tonight.

511
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,040
And wherever he goes, we follow his ass.

512
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,875
We're on a plane to Bogotá.

513
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,213
Meet Crosby tonight,
Defense Minister in the morning.

514
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,673
He makes the call on our visas.

515
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,259
It's over.

516
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,720
We fucked up.

517
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,063
It's all good.

518
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,774
He's in front of me.
I'm about to tell him.

519
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,778
Hey, I just talked to Manny.
They've left the apartment.

520
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:18,578
Okay, good. But my dad isn't safe
until he's here with us. Call Fercho.

521
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,122
- Right.
- Just make sure. You hear me?

522
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,206
Sounds good.

523
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:29,588
Okay.

524
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,983
What about my family?
What happens to them?

525
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,902
- You need to get them out.
<i>- I know.</i>

526
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,279
I put their lives in your hands.

527
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,614
<i>I'm sorry, Jorge.</i>

528
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,575
<i>Yeah, we're being recalled to Bogotá.</i>

529
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,369
Bogotá?

530
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,746
They're gonna know
someone gave up the location.

531
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,667
<i>Someone on the inside.
If you leave, I'm a dead man.</i>

532
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,961
You gave me your fucking word.

533
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,629
We'll figure this out.

534
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,721
Fuck.

535
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,479
<i>Hello?</i>

536
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,650
They almost had you today, brother.

537
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,113
- They didn't, Gilberto.
<i>- Thank God.</i>

538
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,532
<i>It's a miracle you got away.</i>

539
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,410
<i>You need to revise your security network.</i>

540
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,665
Bring this to an end, brother.

541
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,545
<i>You have to embrace
that this is the reality we've built.</i>

542
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,547
<i>It's what's best for all.</i>

543
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,008
<i>Accept it, before it's too late.</i>

544
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,676
You, Gilberto.

545
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,430
The reality you built.

546
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,266
<i>And where the fuck has it gotten you?</i>

547
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,477
You're upset, brother. I get it.

548
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:52,315
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty fucking pissed.</i>

549
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,485
Then listen to me. Embrace it.

550
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,281
Look, everything we have,
everything we've ever built,

551
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,075
is because of the decisions I've made.

552
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,828
<i>Our best strategy is non-violence.</i>

553
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,040
The best option we have is surrender.

554
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,752
I'm not going to surrender, Gilberto.

555
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,760
That was just a dream
you fell in love with.

556
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,429
It isn't mine.

557
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,601
Miguel.

558
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,809
It takes balls, I'll give him that.

559
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,895
Balls I wasn't sure he had.

560
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,484
You can appreciate
needing to show them off.

561
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,822
You again with those trucks?

562
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,031
I have orders to follow.

563
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,908
And I have new orders.

564
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,084
I don't like it,
this disagreement between them.

565
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,044
Doesn't feel right.

566
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,464
It isn't us.

567
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,678
Maybe.

568
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,724
But times are changing.

569
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,810
Let's go!

570
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,812
Follow me!

571
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,413
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

572
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,208
- Don't you worry.
- I'm not worried.

573
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,923
Makes you wish you were out there.

574
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,341
Yes, I know she doesn't want
to talk to me.

575
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,134
That's why she's not fucking home.

576
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,512
But it's important I talk to her.
Understood?

577
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:15,184
<i>Look, I don't know what's going on
between you guys, but she's upset.</i>

578
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,603
Pass her the fucking phone now!

579
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,606
<i>No, Jorge. Give her some space.</i>

580
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,608
<i>She'll call you when she's ready.</i>
