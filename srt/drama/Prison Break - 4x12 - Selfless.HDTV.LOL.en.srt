1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,780
Previously on Prison Break

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,580
From now on

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,680
I'm asking that everyone keep their cards on them

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,240
At all times

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,730
Gretchen didn't get us the sixth card.

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,830
Where does that leave us

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,410
Gretchen did pass on this one piece of information for you.

8
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,350
This could be helpful.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,770
I got a call from an old friend.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,350
Heard scylla was in play.

11
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,350
He wants to know if he can get in on it.

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,150
I've set up a safe house

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,080
Where we can hear him out. Do you have a pen?

14
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,040
Just a minute.

15
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,610
1917 piermont.

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,490
Agent self

17
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,710
We have been waiting

18
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,960
When scofield and burrows walk through the door,

19
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,750
Give them an opportunity to surrender.

20
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,060
There's no way they're gonna hand it over without a fight.

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,190
If they take that position, we'll respond in kind.

22
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,790
We make one wrong move,

23
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,660
The camera goes on,

24
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,760
And general krantz will know we're inside.

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,620
I need a team downstairs. Now.

26
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,020
Shouldn't be long

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,880
You sure we shouldn't be waiting down there

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,400
For Michael and Scylla?

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,310
If you know anything about the tactics

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,730
You know that this is the high grout

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,220
Besides, we're silencers

32
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,990
So Scylla isn't one card

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
It's six

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,730
Make sure he is not on those explosives

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,910
And kill him

36
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,310
Drop them

37
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,680
Or i blow his head clean off

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,200
You gonna want put that down

39
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,750
You gonna want put that down

40
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,850
Lower your weapons

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,430
Come on

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,750
Get over there

43
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,690
Come on, old man

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,010
The best minds in the world

45
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,490
Designed the security system

46
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,850
And you almost be there

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,100
Frustration must be killing you

48
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,600
You blow it

49
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,020
Actually

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,210
There is only one missing piece of the puzzle

51
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,270
And you just brought it to me

52
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm not sure what you are talking about it

53
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,930
Your Scylla card

54
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Now

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,030
Now what have you expected?

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,430
What i expected of a man like you,

57
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,000
Is a system

58
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,340
Where you have got all the advantage

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,310
Looks like you're a few cards short

60
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,410
Suck general

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,180
You are the worst parterner i've ever worked with

62
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,050
What

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,460
You leaving me

64
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,250
With the one-handed freaking

65
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,590
Crazy bitch when you hang out with g

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,050
Be quiet, be quiet

67
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,200
Don't tell me what to do, you coward

68
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,690
Listen to me

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,810
You think gretchen and bagwell will get you scylla

70
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,490
But the people they are gonna steal it and

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,780
They have a plan to trans... Shut up

72
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,420
-you shut up -be quiet

73
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,020
Don't tell me to shut up

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,920
Shut up shut your mouth up

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
Don't tell me to shut up

76
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,850
Don't move

77
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,630
We needed him

78
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,730
He's gonna kill you

79
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,310
Go get gretchen and bagwell

80
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,250
I'm gonna take care of this

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,900
You want to be ashamed of yourself

82
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,340
I don't have things work back home

83
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,210
But around here, we'd like to give our guest

84
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,190
A propre interaction.

85
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,830
I'm Gregory White, nice to meet you.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,820
Susan Anthony

87
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,570
I've seen you around past couple of days.

88
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,370
You're a prospective client?

89
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,990
Actually, no. I'm a former work colleage of Cole's.

90
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,460
She's a pretty convicing salesman herself.

91
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,850
Really? Where did you work together?

92
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,690
Florida.

93
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,620
Florida?

94
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,720
Weren't you in the northeast division?

95
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,870
I was. But my very first job

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
In Gate was in Clearwater.

97
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,050
I guess you don't like stay put much, do you?

98
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,780
Lord, I was born a ram man.

99
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,700
I was wonderful to meet you...

100
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,510
I have to go to job on a conference call.

101
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,130
He konws.

102
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,850
No, no, no.

103
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,180
What're you doing?

104
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,700
Hang it up.

105
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,360
Hey, that way. Back in that office.

106
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,610
Everybody just stay calm.

107
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,540
Mr White's office.

108
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,270
Sit.

109
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,570
Now listen very closely,

110
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,310
No one's gonna get hurt.

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,560
No one.

112
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,110
How...

113
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,520
Did you get all five cards?

114
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,030
The frustration must be killing you.

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Is that...?

116
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,900
What is that?

117
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,250
The cards were keys...

118
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,000
...And this...

119
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,260
This is scylla.

120
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,649
Guess right noyou wish

121
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,669
You'd framed somebody else, huh, general?

122
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,540
You're not even close to getting out of here.

123
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,580
Let's go.

124
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,730
You sure, papi?

125
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,139
We have no idea what's waiting for us back there.

126
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,269
Yeah, but we don't know what's be up there

127
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,929
Either. Trust me.

128
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,739
General, we're gonna need you

129
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,610
To activate this elevator.

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,080
Best of luck.

131
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,170
You're coming with us.

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,719
It's all right, damani. Put away the gun.

133
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,300
Everything's under control.

134
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,600
We have a major situation.

135
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,840
Michael, thank god.

136
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,580
We got it.

137
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,490
How's it going on your end?

138
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,100
Pretty damn good.

139
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,010
But give me five more minutes.

140
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,439
Is that thdesk

141
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,280
You sat at when you told wyatt to kill my son?

142
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,310
Don't worry, alex.

143
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,190
He won't be giving any more orders after today.

144
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,879
I'm curious.

145
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,050
How do you think you're getting out of here?

146
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,099
The second

147
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,409
We stepped off the elevator,

148
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,930
My guard made a call to put the entire building under lockdown.

149
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,360
Nothing gets in or out.

150
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,680
So whatever you're waiting for--

151
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,030
It isn't coming.

152
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,229
What are you looking at, huh?

153
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,329
Nothing. Nothing.

154
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,389
Huh? What are you looking at?!

155
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,460
Nothing.

156
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,360
Don't yobe eyeballing me, soldier.Back to work.

157
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,450
There's no way this is gonna end well.

158
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,150
We should get out of here.

159
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,799
Don't you think it's worth 20 minutes for $125 million?

160
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,170
Suck it up!

161
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,859
I want a team outside of the general's office.

162
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,490
We need to get a handle on this.

163
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,900
Check the elevator.

164
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,330
Cover the stairwell.

165
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,580
All that design just to hold some names and reports.

166
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,320
Names and reports?

167
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,060
Is that informatn from the government,

168
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,160
Or your father?

169
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,220
Careful.

170
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,970
Top right-hand drawer.

171
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,660
It's something that should be of interest to you.

172
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,900
I pulled it when your mes came up.

173
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,849
Why did you leave?

174
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,759
I took a position

175
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,669
With a group of multinationals we call

176
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,870
The company.

177
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,220
They call every shot this country takes.

178
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,460
I knew your father since before you were born

179
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,369
You do know he worked for the company?

180
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,510
Yeah. He was data analyst.

181
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,720
Is that what he told you?

182
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,339
Well, it makes sense.

183
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,000
He wanteto protect you from the truth.

184
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,049
I'm warning you.

185
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,090
Your father was a brilliant man,

186
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,320
But he could never have defeated the company.

187
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,660
You don't have to make the same

188
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:53,369
Misguided, fatal mistake that he did.

189
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,320
There's so much you don't know about the company...

190
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,020
About scylla...

191
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,130
About your dad...

192
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,850
About your mother.

193
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,900
I swear to god, I'll kill you.

194
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,560
Let's get through this.

195
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,200
What's the plan?

196
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,820
Agent self?

197
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,179
Where are we?

198
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,949
The men went I about two hours ago.

199
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,099
No confirmation on whether they've gotten scylla?

200
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,109
Not yet, but I promise you, herb,

201
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,639
You'll be the first to know, okay?

202
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,449
And as soon as I get word, I'm taking an unmarked car

203
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,759
To the pickup location, and then I'm gonna head bk over...

204
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,949
No. You go directlyto senator da

205
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,600
I'll have the attorney general standing by.

206
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,499
We can't veer from the plan here.

207
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,349
It's too dangerous.

208
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,460
Yes, sir.

209
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,650
We're almost at the finish line.

210
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,840
I know.

211
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,980
I never thought you'd make it this far.

212
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,010
I was wrong.

213
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,569
We need to be prepared to go in

214
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,350
As soon as the general gives the order.

215
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,220
What is it you all want?

216
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,809
Fernando.

217
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,090
Just say the word,

218
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,349
And your little girl's

219
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,159
College education is paid for.

220
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,759
We'll buy her a house to grow up in.

221
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,399
You think you can just

222
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,410
Throw some cash at us, huh?

223
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,420
We'll forget everything, call it a day?

224
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,480
Pam needs you, alex.

225
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,010
Now more than ever.

226
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,840
You're both still hurting,

227
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,290
But given time, it'll pass.

228
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,969
And maybe some day you'll be ready

229
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,459
To be parents again, and if money is no object...

230
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,120
You should hear yourself right now.

231
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,590
The desperation in your voice.

232
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,469
You hear it?

233
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,809
But listen to what it is I'm saying.

234
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,970
Get away from me.

235
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,809
Whatever you want...

236
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,060
Get away from me.

237
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,450
Whatever you want,

238
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,550
I can provide.

239
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,849
Airline tickets

240
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,230
For u and sara anywhere in the world.

241
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,090
What I want

242
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,510
Is to see the company burn to the ground,

243
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,630
And you in prison.

244
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,720
It's what we all want.

245
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,630
That'll never happen.

246
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,530
Hi. How have you been? Good.

247
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,449
I am so sorry.

248
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,650
Please back off.

249
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,309
Excuse me. Let me help you

250
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,139
Get some of that off.

251
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,640
You know what? Stop. Just...

252
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,740
Don't worry about it.

253
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,309
Are you okay?

254
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,520
Excuse me, gentlemen.

255
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,100
Thank u.

256
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,870
Damn it.

257
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,220
Everybody get into position.

258
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,899
This is going to end

259
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,410
Very soon, and it's not going to be pretty.

260
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,330
One last chance.

261
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,820
Lee scylla, and you can all

262
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,450
Go free.

263
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,380
Just walk out the door.

264
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,189
Where are you going?

265
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,940
You shoot me, and then what?

266
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,920
You jump out the window of my 19th floor office?

267
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,670
Michael, you kill me, you lose your levera.

268
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,720
Hello?

269
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,780
It's for you.

270
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,310
Oh, what is this?

271
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,530
Leverage.

272
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,180
It's me.

273
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,440
Lisa?

274
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm at gunpoint.

275
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,920
What's going on?

276
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,430
It's tancredi.

277
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,549
She ys if you don't

278
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,960
Let michael and the others leave with scylla, she'll kill me.

279
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,360
Dad?

280
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,130
Please.

281
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,260
Do what they want.

282
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,530
I suggest you take your daughter's advice, general.

283
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,290
You son of bitch.

284
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,800
Lisa, where you are?

285
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,649
Get her back on the phone!

286
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,849
You can talk to your daughter after we've left

287
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,800
With scylla, of course.

288
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,279
Look, I read enough intel on your girlfriend

289
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,259
To know that she wouldn't hurt a fly.

290
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,080
Maybbut she's changed.Ago,

291
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,870
But she's changed.

292
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,529
We've all changed.

293
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,900
This is a list of everyone you've killed.

294
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,400
Fathers, sons, friends.

295
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,569
Do you really ink

296
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,190
Your daughter's life is worth any more than theirs?

297
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,559
One of two things is going to happen now.

298
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,270
You're going to let us go, or lisa will die.

299
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,100
Either one is fine with me.

300
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,200
Just don't hurt r.

301
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,130
As long as you hold up your end of the deal, we won't.

302
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,540
You ordered scylla to be moved.

303
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,230
Show us how.

304
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,100
I'm walking them out!

305
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,649
Stand down.

306
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,160
Stand down.

307
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes, sir.

308
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,309
They must have found another way out.

309
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,599
That's impossible. Well, then, they're caught or dead.

310
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,260
How much longer are we gonna wait?

311
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,059
You were the one who said scofield had a plan.

312
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,219
And you put a gun in mr. White's face!

313
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,310
He was going to call the police.

314
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,130
Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. Federal agent.

315
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,550
Quick. I'll help you.

316
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,280
Quick. Help me untie the others.

317
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,729
Okay, I'll keep an eye on cole and the woman.

318
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,019
I want you to slip out two at a time.

319
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,239
Okay, you two first.

320
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,749
Why can't we all go together?

321
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,969
You're here. Go arrest them.

322
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,349
I want to get out as many of you as possible

323
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,880
Before they realize what's happening.

324
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,600
Theodore bagwell's wanted for murder.

325
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,000
Now cole pfeiffer's a hostage-taker.

326
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,449
What am I gonna do?

327
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,590
You're gonna run for your life,

328
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,080
You idiot.

329
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,869
I'm leaving.

330
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,250
No, mr. White.

331
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,109
No, mr. White. Wait!

332
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,330
No! Wait!

333
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,870
Everybody stay down! Drop your weapon!

334
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,200
Call 911!

335
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,870
How does it feel, huh?

336
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,200
Being forced to do something you don't want to do?

337
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,869
But knowing that if you don't go through with it,

338
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,519
Someone you care about is gonna suffer;

339
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,439
They're gonna pay?

340
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,239
Spanish

341
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,490
What goes around, comes around, huh, general?

342
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,739
I...

343
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,860
I can't imagine what you've been through.

344
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,270
I can't imagine that you'd want to.

345
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,500
Whatever they've done to you...

346
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,540
"they" are you, my friend.

347
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,320
Whatever they've told you,

348
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,090
You need to realize that...

349
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,450
Scofield and burws are bad men.

350
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,160
You used to be doctor.

351
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,299
You devoted your whole life helpg other people.

352
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,550
Now look at you.

353
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,330
They have you holding a gun on an innocent woman.

354
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,449
So you're innocent?

355
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,650
You're jus..

356
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,209
Crunching numbers and running data

357
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,030
To make the world a better place?

358
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,590
Mrs. Tabak?

359
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,219
You're fine.

360
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
You need a couple of minutes.

361
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,670
Hello, mrs. Tabak?!

362
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,180
You okay?

363
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,910
Say it.

364
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm soaking my skirt.

365
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,180
If I d't get the grease out before it gets to the cleaners,

366
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,800
It'll be ruined.

367
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,090
Okay, ma'am.

368
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,819
I don't know what it looks like up there

369
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,239
In your ivory tower.

370
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,899
Down on the ground, men and women are dying

371
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,640
And lives are being ruined.

372
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,240
So, I'm prepared to do absolutely anything

373
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,240
In order to stop you.

374
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
Turn around.

375
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,010
Turn... Around, lisa.

376
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,079
You should've let me try to convince mr. White

377
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,519
That everything was gonna be okay.

378
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,549
That way, I could've...

379
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,099
What?! Put on a monkey suit every day

380
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,179
And sit behind a desk.

381
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,900
How long you think that's gonna last?

382
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,830
You gonna walk down the street with an mp-5?

383
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,879
You can't be serious.

384
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,689
They can identify you, cole.

385
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,509
You're the only one linking me to that crime scene.

386
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,330
But, hey, it was nice working with you.

387
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,100
Don't move!

388
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,390
Turn around.

389
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,170
Turn around!

390
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,749
Gently now, sugar.

391
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,619
That's special agent miriam holtz to you, sugar.

392
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,890
Let's go.

393
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,989
I want to speakwith my daught

394
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,299
Get confirmation that she's being released.

395
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,479
Sara will be keeping your daughter in custody

396
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,789
Until she knows we're safely away from this place

397
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,600
With nobody trailing us.

398
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,469
Company agents aren't just embedded in the fbi

399
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,799
And the secret service.

400
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,590
They're in local law enforcement, hospils, dmv.

401
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,159
You'll never see us coming.

402
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,159
Actually, once we get scylla into the right hands,

403
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,629
Alyour agents, all your operations--

404
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,199
It'll all be out in the open,

405
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,020
And then everyone... Will see you coming.

406
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
We did this to you.

407
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,210
We did this to you.

408
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,820
Don't you forget that, old man.

409
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,740
Want to know what your father really did for the company?

410
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,369
He was an executioner.

411
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,420
He killed people who defected from the company.

412
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,630
Now the many he trained be coming after you.

413
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,420
Come on. Something's not right.

414
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,930
Mrs. Tabak?

415
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,640
Mrs. Tabak?!

416
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,369
She just left--

417
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,710
Tancredi-- she has to be right outside.

418
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,440
Are you all right?

419
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,339
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

420
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,429
I'm heading back now.

421
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,739
No. I want you in a secure location,

422
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,769
Under supervision.

423
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,649
You go home.

424
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,149
But I really need to be there.

425
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,710
I'll call youonce we get scy

426
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,489
We've given the truck's license plate and vin number

427
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,419
To the local police...

428
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,399
We lost our tactical initiative the minute

429
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,849
That scoeld figured out our sops.

430
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,939
If we want to defeat him,

431
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,820
We've got to alter our wbecome unpredictable.

432
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,750
It's them.

433
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,949
Michael, where are you?

434
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,000
The company's armored truck.

435
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,620
We have it.

436
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,299
They got it.

437
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,190
Okay, listen. Michael, stay on alert, okay?

438
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,540
I will.

439
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,830
See you at the rendezvous.

440
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,550
You guys get someplace safe.

441
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,289
Wait till you hear from us.

442
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,890
You got it. Good luck, bobby.

443
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,999
Where are they?

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,760
The rport. We have visual confirmation.

445
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,229
Make sure not a single plane leaves the ground

446
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,760
Before we've got them.

447
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,160
Understood, sir.

448
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,169
Stay with scofield and burrows.

449
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,780
Scylla's the priority.

450
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,120
Check it out.

451
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,830
They're right behind us.

452
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,150
Let's go.

453
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,740
Now

454
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,940
Now

455
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,299
Hey, my name's john burton.

456
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,319
I'm an off-duty cop from chicago.

457
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,299
Listen, I'm walking through ontario airport,

458
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,209
Terminal 2, right by the ticket counters

459
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,259
And I just saw something

460
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,270
That you guys definitely want check out.

461
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,830
We got company.

462
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,079
Michael scofield and lincoln burrows.

463
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,769
Let's get out of here.

464
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,069
No, no, no...

465
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,879
The last thing you want to do right now is run

466
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,480
Why is that? You gonna shoot us?

467
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,479
I say the word and my men will take you both out.

468
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,029
In front of all these people?

469
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,560
You'd never risk that kind of exposure.

470
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,809
I think it's clear by now

471
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,950
That you've miscalculated how far we're willing to go.

472
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,480
Give me the bag.

473
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,600
Give me the bag. Now.

474
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,299
Tell krantz this isn't finished.

475
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,060
Oh, you can tell him in person.

476
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,540
Sir? Please come with us.

477
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,990
Excuse me?

478
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,750
Just a security precaution.

479
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,590
Yeah, sure.

480
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,239
Is this really necessary?

481
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,999
Please empty the contents of your bag.

482
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,839
Look, all I've got in there is a laptop

483
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,590
And an external hard drive.

484
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,830
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy.

485
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,640
Let go of the bag, sir.

486
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,990
Yeah, we got it.

487
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,080
So you knew who I was from the start, huh?

488
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,919
My real name, my record...

489
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,120
I read your file, yeah.

490
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,680
What if you hadn't?

491
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,919
What's your point?

492
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,089
What if you never knew

493
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,820
I was theodore bagwell, the convict?

494
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,370
Would you have believed I was cole pfeiffer?

495
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,480
Stellar salesman...

496
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,270
Talented speaker?

497
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,070
I don't know.

498
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,670
You certainly had a lot of other people fooled, though.

499
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,740
Till you pled a machine gun on them.

500
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:45,050
I guess it's like

501
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,210
"we are captives of our own identities,

502
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,490
Living in prisons of our own creation."

503
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,269
Who would've thought they'd actually

504
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,330
Be right about something?

505
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,579
So if u drop this,

506
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,700
Does thamean we all go back to prison?

507
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,930
Don't worry.

508
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,589
If this doesn't get in the right hands in one piece,

509
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,830
I'm going to be in as bad a spot as you are.

510
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,850
Congratulations.

511
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,690
What now?

512
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,470
Now, I live up to my end of the deal.

513
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,849
The vans are going to be here in a half an hour.

514
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,299
They're going to be sent to a field office

515
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,030
Where you can go through processing.

516
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,179
Th is all your transfer paperrk.

517
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,889
Get this to an agent schmidt.

518
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,630
He's going to be heading up the convoy.

519
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,959
I wish I could drive you myself,

520
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,270
But I need to get to dallow asap.

521
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,570
Are you okay?

522
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,670
Yeah, I'm okay.

523
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,599
No, he's not.

524
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,160
He needs to go to a hospital.

525
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,459
All right, I'm going to send an ambulance with the vans.

526
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,700
You're going to get the best medical care available.

527
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,189
Thank you.

528
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,420
No, I should be thanking you.

529
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,639
Okay, because of what you've done,

530
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,630
Lives are going to be changed forever.

531
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,750
Listen, I need a, uh, ambulance to come with the convoy.

532
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,720
Sir, what are your orders?

533
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,540
Sir?

534
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,020
I don't know

535
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,469
None of us will ever have

536
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,200
To look over our shoulders again.

537
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,340
That's the most important thing.

538
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
No matter what comes next.

539
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,390
You're gonna make it, michael.

540
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,569
You'll have the operation and,

541
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,250
And you'll get through this.

542
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,690
Just like we've gotten through everything else.

543
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,590
She's worried about you.

544
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,829
It's nice to know that the next time

545
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,510
I want to drink one of these,

546
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,950
I won't have to drink it in this crappy warehouse.

547
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,169
I can't even remember being able to sit down at a restaurant

548
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,960
Or go to a bl game.

549
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,910
God... It seems like I've been running forever.

550
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,090
But time to stand still.

551
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,900
Take in the sun.

552
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,220
Salud.

553
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,580
I know I'm supposed to be happy right now.

554
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,870
I'm still scared.

555
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,679
I'm scared we're going to have come all this way

556
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,500
And I'm going to lose you anyway.

557
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,410
Come here.

558
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,690
Come on.

559
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,579
Sara...

560
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,439
Just don't tell me

561
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,820
That everything's going to be okay, please.

562
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,620
Okay.

563
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,970
I won't.

564
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,920
I see you brought your friend along.

565
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,359
What happened to gretchen?

566
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,760
Uh, she got away.

567
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,170
So here it is.

568
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,930
Oh, my god.

569
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,709
Wow. I can't believe it

570
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,349
So what's next?

571
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,669
Senator dallow?

572
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,749
No, I need to tie up some loose ends.

573
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,369
Did gretchen and bagwell say anything else about scylla

574
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,419
In terms of other buyers? Feng.

575
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,670
He's dead.

576
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,920
They didn't talk to anyone else?

577
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,779
We need to get as many indictments

578
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,059
On this thing as possible.

579
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,670
Well, bagwell might know.

580
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,039
Once we get him in an interview room and offer him a deal,

581
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,700
His mouth will start moving.

582
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,850
Remember wt I said to you the first y we got here?

583
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,909
Yeah, you said that when this was over,

584
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,540
We were gonna settle up.

585
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,280
We're settled.

586
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,810
Michael.

587
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,299
It's been an hour.

588
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,710
Would you call self and check on that ambulance?

589
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,790
Is he not picking up?

590
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
Maybe something's wrong with the signal.

591
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,079
The number you have reached is notn service at this time

592
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,200
And there is no new number.

593
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,420
What is it?

594
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,420
You did really good on this one, miriam.

595
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,220
You really held your own.

596
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,130
Thank you.

597
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,510
Can I take a closer look at that?

598
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,019
I'm sorry.

599
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,610
What're you talking about?

600
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,090
Self.

601
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,040
Self.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
