1
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,110
I know what you're thinking, Miguel.

2
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,453
Something's going wrong.

3
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,706
This is all very strange.

4
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,501
Yeah...

5
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,003
it is.

6
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,008
Everything's changed.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,977
Is it you?

8
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,200
You remember this place, don't you?

9
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,746
The children loved it here.

10
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,293
They would beg us to come.

11
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,840
And when you found those old bikes...

12
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,846
riding them up and down these hills...

13
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,975
the kids chasing...

14
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,395
dying of laughter...

15
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,440
screaming for you to stop.

16
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,039
They're chasing you, Miguel.

17
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,501
Run.

18
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,382
Run.

19
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,010
Run.

20
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,433
Run!

21
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,690
You have no idea...

22
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,193
what's coming for you.

23
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,863
What you've started.

24
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,288
I don't want to be here.

25
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,958
You haven't gotten far enough away.

26
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,298
I fucked up.

27
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,513
He told you so, didn't he?

28
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,600
Oh, Miguel.

29
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,605
You're too smart not to see it.

30
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,777
There's no going back.

31
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,502
Too slow.

32
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,798
What's wrong with you, asshole?

33
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,718
Grab your shit, Dopey.
Let's move.

34
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,729
The fuck you want?

35
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,731
Get in.

36
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,650
Need to get to the hospital and quick.

37
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,111
We're gonna kill some people.

38
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,032
Inside. Room 23.

39
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,246
He's at the end of the
hallway, to the left.

40
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,874
There's two guys guarding him.

41
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,801
My family and I are sorry
for what happened.

42
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,637
My brother had no business
getting tied up in all this.

43
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,765
Life's been hard.

44
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,726
It hasn't been easy.

45
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,446
She just drop a dime on
her fucking brother?

46
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,701
- I'm talking to you.
- That's why we're here.

47
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,329
- To get some fucking answers!
- Fucking answers to what?

48
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,584
Just cover my back.

49
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,562
Come here.

50
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,065
Quiet!

51
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,957
- Drop it, asshole!
- Lower the gun!

52
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,626
On the ground!

53
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,588
We only want him.
Don't be a hero for a dead man.

54
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,387
Unhook him from all that shit.

55
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,098
Please, if you unhook him, he'll die.

56
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,226
He's gonna die anyway.

57
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,230
Come on, man.

58
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,429
You were looking for a conspiracy?

59
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,183
Well, we found it.
Rubén Zuno Arce.

60
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,602
Your living, breathing grassy knoll.

61
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,146
A bloodline to the throne.

62
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,067
Married to former president
Luis Echeverría's daughter.

63
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,318
Zuno's uncle?

64
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,654
The Minister of Defense.

65
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,364
Couldn't make this shit up.

66
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,827
Besides acting as a go-between
for Mexico City and the narcos,

67
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,079
Zuno fancies himself as a businessman.

68
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,706
Very well.

69
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,709
Sits on the board of several companies.

70
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,793
Sir...

71
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,587
Hi.

72
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,380
Even owns a few himself.

73
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,013
Better put, he inherited a few.

74
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,935
Family has a thing for art.

75
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,895
Generous with their donations.

76
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,609
The Tate in London,
the Galleria in Rome,

77
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,988
and two Picassos at the Palacio,
here in Mexico City.

78
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,508
ACQUIRED VIA THE ZUNO ARCE FOUNDATION

79
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,800
But don't let Zuno

80
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,920
and his philanthropic
endeavors fool you.

81
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,470
Has a taste for more than just art.

82
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,707
Never met a line of coke he didn't love

83
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,792
or a call girl he didn't want to fuck.

84
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,671
Oh, yeah, and he loves golf.

85
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,329
What's wrong with golf?

86
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,805
Nothing. I'm just mentioning
that he likes it.

87
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,891
Arrive at your point.

88
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,686
Zuno owns property. A lot of it.

89
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,316
881 Lope de Vega. Ring a bell?

90
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,902
The house Kiki was killed at.

91
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,946
Yeah, the asshole isn't just connected.
He was fucking there.

92
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,670
All right? Zuno doesn't
just link Félix Gallardo

93
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,701
to the Mexican government.

94
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,911
It puts them both at the
scene of Kiki's murder.

95
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,245
So...

96
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,164
how do we get him?

97
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,334
That's sort of a problem.

98
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,940
You know, he heard
rumors that we're here,

99
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,798
he spooked and figures he's next.

100
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,508
Zuno's underground?

101
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,511
He's holed up in a compound
in Puerto Vallarta.

102
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:24,266
Oh, he asked his uncle for support,
and he sent the fucking army.

103
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,646
Oh, fucking Christ.

104
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,944
Guess that's the cost of
making noise, huh, Walt?

105
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,031
Thought you could shoot
it out in the street?

106
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,366
Not draw eyes?

107
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,369
Things didn't go as planned.

108
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,955
We adapted and did what was necessary.

109
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,833
Verdín's in the fucking morgue.

110
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,960
Was that necessary?

111
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,383
I sleep just fine, sir.

112
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,780
I did what I was brought
down here to do,

113
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
and I'm not gonna apologize for it.

114
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,681
Then don't.

115
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,766
Make it worth something.

116
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,230
We got the green light.

117
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,443
This is it, fellas.

118
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,694
The golden ticket.

119
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,696
The whole reason we're down here.

120
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,283
We know where he is,
so today we go get him.

121
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,077
What about the army?

122
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,287
Not leaving.

123
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,875
We go in guns a-blazing,
we'll get eaten alive, so...

124
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,169
we gotta do this one different.

125
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,256
I don't know. See how this man
handled an assault rifle?

126
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,634
Yeah, seen where that leads?

127
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,971
Kenny's right.

128
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,347
All right? I fucked up.

129
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,476
Shit got loud and a whole lot harder.

130
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,145
We're on their radar, but...

131
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,565
we're in this fight, so let's finish it.

132
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,736
Okay, so...

133
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,322
what's the play?

134
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,450
Well, what do we know?

135
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,620
Target and location.

136
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,997
And we know he's scared.

137
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,250
So, that's our hand. We play
all three of them against him.

138
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,586
Sounds really good, Walt,

139
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,713
but did anybody else see
the end of Butch Cassidy?

140
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,051
The guy's got military positioned
all over the fucking compound.

141
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,386
Well, we get creative.

142
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,472
It's not exactly our style.

143
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,560
Come on, guys. Every smash-and-grab
crew's gotta grow up sometime.

144
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,320
Comandante Sergio Verdín...

145
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,239
Félix, he's dead.

146
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,617
He was at Lope de Vega.
That makes two.

147
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:35,916
I have to see Calderoni.
Tell him to come here today.

148
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,426
Something out there
got you guys scared?

149
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,595
What've you heard?

150
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,345
Rumors.

151
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,683
It's an American operation.

152
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,228
Though, officially,
the embassy's denied knowledge.

153
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,773
- So, what are they looking for?
- Well, you.

154
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:01,984
Can't imagine why.

155
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,612
And what are you doing
to stop this bullshit?

156
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,450
The Americans' identities are unknown.
They are small-scale attacks.

157
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,285
So you're not doing shit?

158
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:18,125
Look, comandante, in case
you forgot, you work for me.

159
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,878
I own you. Don't play stupid.

160
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,341
They're connecting the pieces.

161
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,761
Anyone who was at Lope de Vega.

162
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,388
You want to know what this is?

163
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,725
It's revenge.

164
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,270
Okay.

165
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,066
Zuno's in hiding.
I'd recommend you join him.

166
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,817
You're not safe here.

167
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,571
Not an option.

168
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,659
- Right now, my organization...
- The scumbag business goes on.

169
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,620
Don't like my advice? Stick around.
See how it all plays out.

170
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,748
Do you think I hired you
for your bullshit advice?

171
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,292
Do your job.

172
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,046
Next time I see you,
I want a solution.

173
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,091
Now, leave.

174
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,146
Do you trust him?

175
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,608
I don't trust anyone, boss.

176
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,906
- Who else knows about this?
- Just Calderoni.

177
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,326
All right. It stays that way.

178
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,200
The old man and the
plazas can't find out,

179
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,789
or everything goes to shit.

180
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,835
Let's hope this blows over
before I sit down with Cali.

181
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,462
Do you think he can get it fixed?

182
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,881
This mess with the Americans?

183
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,137
Have them fuel the plane.
I'm getting my things.

184
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,435
Fucking bastard.

185
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,522
How much longer you
wanna be here, asshole?

186
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,026
Who paid you?

187
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,153
Answer, you fuck!

188
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,029
Give us names, you fucking bitch!

189
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,868
It was Arévalo.

190
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,707
They paid me.

191
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,128
Said there'd be more work
as soon as it was done.

192
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,759
It was just a job.

193
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,886
Please...

194
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,973
- I have children.
- You think I don't have children?

195
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,852
How much did they pay you?

196
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,398
- Two hundred and fifty thousand pesos.
- Son of a bitch.

197
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,818
You are an idiot!

198
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,071
If you'd come to me, asked,

199
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,281
I'd have paid as much not to kill me.

200
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,867
Now, because of you,
no one gets the money.

201
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,203
Go on, do it.

202
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,001
Give me a warning, asshole.

203
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:10,714
What's wrong?
Did your boots get dirty?

204
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,508
Who the fuck is Arévalo?

205
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,592
Does it matter?

206
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,762
Little shit took a run at me last
week. Out on the highway.

207
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,514
Damn near got me.

208
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
Even worse, in a bus full of kids.

209
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
What kids?

210
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,939
Who the fuck is Arévalo, and
why does he want you dead?

211
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,483
It's complicated.

212
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,653
Told you it was Fermín.

213
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,615
- Get moving.
- No, wait. Where to?

214
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,078
- Enough with the questions.
- Then give me some answers!

215
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,665
This about that feud, with the rancher?

216
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,752
Time we bring this nonsense to an end.

217
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,213
Before sundown...

218
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,215
one of us dies.

219
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,137
What? How... Wait, wait.

220
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,221
Pablo.

221
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,974
Let me call in a team.
We go in prepared.

222
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,893
Let's not leave this shit to
a fucking psycho like Marco.

223
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,938
- Sound good?
- Marco's involved.

224
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,272
Important he be there.

225
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,151
If you knew anything about
honor, you'd understand that.

226
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,660
Don't give me that bullshit about honor.

227
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,739
You wanna kill that guy?
Okay, sure.

228
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,242
I'm in, okay? I'll help you.

229
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:26,665
Just promise me, when this is
over, we go back to Juárez. Okay?

230
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,003
If it goes the way I think it will...

231
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,590
I'll need some rest.

232
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,845
The fuck are you doing?

233
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,599
Mimi sure knows how to keep me up.

234
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,373
It's fucking hot.

235
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,170
Now that's an improvement.

236
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,797
Had you pegged for a city guy.

237
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,342
- Please, you see this tan?
- Is that what it is?

238
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,223
- Oh, man, it's so nice here.
- All right, boys, stick to the plan!

239
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,390
- All right.
- Yep.

240
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,767
All right, I'm up front.

241
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,811
What?
Kenny, stick to the goddamn plan.

242
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,898
No cowboy shit, man.
That's the plan. I'm with Danilo.

243
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,193
All right, Amat, you're with me.

244
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,118
You babysitting me now?

245
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,375
This is gonna be so much fun.

246
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,051
No one understands what you do

247
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,303
for this federation more
than me, Benjamín.

248
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:08,642
And I need to know action's being
taken to resolve this shit.

249
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
They were out of line,

250
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,640
coming into your spot the way they did.

251
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,315
Those manners obviously
won't be tolerated.

252
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,567
It was a disrespect
towards you and Pancho.

253
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,736
I've talked to Palma,
and it's been handled.

254
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,322
But this bullshit between
you guys, it has to stop.

255
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,159
It's not just them.
It takes two to tango.

256
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,705
- Félix, no...
- Benjamín, each of you has a plaza.

257
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,086
Jealousy hurts business.
Money is lost.

258
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,965
This comes to an end, today.

259
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,601
Sorry, but it's not enough.

260
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,085
The Sinaloans don't show us respect

261
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,855
because you haven't
given them a reason to.

262
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,525
When you first came to my
family, you promised stability.

263
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,236
Growth. A better system.

264
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,572
Listen, Benjamín...

265
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,117
I'd be careful what you're saying.

266
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,288
My family provides the
infrastructure, the transport.

267
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,539
We do the work.

268
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
If this is about the money,
then give us an opportunity.

269
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,170
We'll make you a lot more.

270
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,505
It's not so simple.

271
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,344
I know it's getting harder to sell.

272
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,515
You heard about Ramón?

273
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,352
Almost lost his eye in that fight.

274
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:38,690
Doctor called him lucky. My brother,
in and out of the hospital.

275
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,489
I'm sorry to hear that.

276
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,283
So, help me out, man.

277
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,498
All right.

278
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,420
A ten percent tax on anything
Sinaloa moves through your plaza.

279
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,844
No more or less. I mean it.

280
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,097
Consider it done.

281
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,847
Pablo.

282
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,807
Pablo!

283
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,600
Wake up, asshole.

284
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,349
I won, pussy!

285
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,478
Lucky for me your aim sucks.

286
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,314
You got me half asleep.

287
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,525
Get over here, Dopey.

288
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,860
Get that down!

289
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,237
You're not going to heaven yet.

290
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,033
Those guys...

291
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,576
they're mine.

292
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,840
We roll out to Fermín's ranch unarmed,

293
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,581
it won't be much of a fight, will it?

294
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,124
What, you don't recognize Paco?

295
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,834
It's me, dude.

296
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,300
Desperate to get back to Juárez
and no idea who's there.

297
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,594
Boy, some leader you'll be.

298
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,803
Hey.

299
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,848
You have any idea how many men
this Fermín guy has with him?

300
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,645
How many guys work for Fermín?

301
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,605
A shitload.

302
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,899
See?

303
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,360
That's why we need the big guns.

304
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,156
This shit is insane, man.

305
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,202
You're gonna go there
with your fucking honor

306
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,204
and get us all killed.

307
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,749
And I'm the idiot that's
been covering for you,

308
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,085
telling Félix you had
it all under control.

309
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,503
But the truth is, Pablo...

310
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,632
you don't have a fucking
clue what you're doing.

311
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,387
You think I give a fuck
what a crook thinks?

312
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,141
- Ask your uncle what that gets you.
- Enough about my uncle.

313
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,228
What happened with Félix,
that's between them.

314
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,438
At least Félix knows who he is.

315
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,234
Oh, yeah? What's that?

316
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,029
You just said it, a crook.
Just like you.

317
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,156
We're all crooks.
At least he knows it.

318
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,243
I'm a bandit, not a crook.

319
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,080
Like there's some difference.

320
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,915
There is.

321
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,771
My blanket.

322
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,570
Gimme that.

323
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,244
- Cheers, boys.
- Cheers.

324
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,023
I don't know,
around seven Americans.

325
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,450
Who said Americans?

326
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,081
Baby, we're just talking.

327
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,876
Did you or did you not
mention Americans?

328
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,297
Well, one of the girls at the club

329
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,216
was telling me she was
with some Americans.

330
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,511
Shit, I am talking!

331
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,271
So, about these Americans...

332
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,732
Baby, don't worry.

333
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,485
You paid up front, so...

334
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,487
we're all yours.

335
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,656
Zuno, man!

336
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,990
Zuno, man!

337
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,368
They're hiding something from you, man.

338
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,413
Not them!

339
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,207
Those assholes over here!

340
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,292
You need to see this.

341
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,299
Holy shit.

342
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,927
What the fuck is this?

343
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,139
Nothing to worry about for now.

344
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,766
We don't know who they
are or why they're here.

345
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,062
How long they been out there?

346
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,230
Two hours.

347
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,402
And you were keeping this from me?

348
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,988
This is bad, man, real bad.

349
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,489
We need to be on this.

350
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,867
I'm going to handle this.

351
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,243
I'm going out there.

352
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,828
Please don't.

353
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,998
- You need to let me do my job.
- Do it then!

354
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,876
- Go back in the pool.
- No, they're circling us, Zuno!

355
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,628
There's more shit they aren't
showing you. Fucking show him, man!

356
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,464
These guys don't respect you.

357
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,342
Holy shit, there's more of them.

358
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,928
They're running surveillance.

359
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,516
Those fuckers are
prepping for an assault.

360
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,021
Maybe or maybe not. We don't know.

361
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,273
They know I'm here, man!

362
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,941
They know I'm here!

363
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,695
Who knows how many
Americans are out there,

364
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,991
waiting to attack me
like fucking Indians.

365
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,868
Zuno, what are we gonna do?

366
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,954
I'm gonna make some calls,
get some fucking answers.

367
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,923
What'd he say?

368
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,762
Agreed to a tax.

369
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,767
Ten percent on anything the
Sinaloans move through the plaza.

370
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,188
He flinched.

371
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,773
Yep.

372
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,027
So, what's our next move, Benjamín?

373
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,906
We wait for things to improve.

374
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,660
What do you mean, wait?

375
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,204
That's enough for you?

376
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,207
I just made this family a lot of money.

377
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,502
Oh, yeah? And whose fucking idea
was it to use this as leverage?

378
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,711
Yours.

379
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,592
Ramón's eye? Great touch.

380
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,887
I've got a lot of good ideas.

381
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,144
I can't keep apologizing
for the world, Enedina.

382
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,981
I'm doing my best.

383
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,410
The sister left 40 minutes ago.

384
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,329
No one's come or gone since.

385
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,622
Seen Fermín in there?

386
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,374
Just Antonia.

387
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,295
But there's no way he left on foot.

388
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,255
All right.

389
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,092
Let me go down there, talk to him.

390
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:29,596
Hey, hey. Wait, what's to say this
fucker doesn't blow your head off

391
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,139
the second you walk up there?

392
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,100
A hunch.

393
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,727
A hunch?

394
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,482
I'm coming with you. Gotta make
sure you don't get killed.

395
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,193
So we can go back to Juárez?

396
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:50,033
Tell me something. Why do you
care so much about Juárez?

397
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,202
'Cause I'm not in the
pride business like you.

398
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,960
We get Juárez going,

399
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,789
and I can get the fuck out of there.

400
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,251
Juárez is my way to do what I want.

401
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,050
Pathetic. At least it's
finally the truth.

402
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,760
Yeah, there you have it.

403
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,555
Come on, leave that shit over there.

404
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,709
Drug traffickers roaming
the halls of Congress...

405
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,964
What's this republic come to?

406
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,926
You've got a lot of
balls walking in here.

407
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,512
I'm doing my job.

408
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,305
Protecting our business.

409
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,766
That doesn't seem to be
your priority any longer.

410
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,186
What are you doing about
the American operation?

411
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,397
I've assigned Calderoni.

412
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,773
It's not enough.

413
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,151
Things are going to shit.

414
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,154
The doctor, the comandante...

415
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,140
The Americans are connecting the pieces.

416
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,912
Anyone tied to that agent is going down.

417
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,290
Perhaps killing him was a mistake.

418
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,796
But, as I recall, it was you who
insisted on returning the body.

419
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,048
This is our mess.

420
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:34,554
I'm respectfully asking
for you to do your job.

421
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,556
I'd consider your tone.

422
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,518
You're speaking to
Mexico's next president.

423
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,312
That's right.

424
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,560
You don't want this shit
hanging over your head

425
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,942
when you're president.

426
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,699
If the Americans...

427
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,030
The Americans don't know
what they're doing.

428
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,575
You think this'll stand?

429
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,414
Kidnapping foreign nationals
from a sovereign country...

430
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,752
this is bigger than your
fucking organization.

431
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,172
My nephew's in hiding.

432
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,635
I suggest you do the same until
this whole thing blows over.

433
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,929
Run off.

434
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:21,642
Scurry into the hole rats
like you crawled out of.

435
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,690
No.

436
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,695
Things are going to change.

437
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,990
You see, right now my organization

438
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,826
doesn't have the luxury
of going into hiding.

439
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,290
I pay for protection,
and you will provide it.

440
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:54,592
If you show up here again,
there'll be consequences.

441
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,770
You know anything about ancient Rome?

442
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,314
I guarantee more than you.

443
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,525
I'm sure you do.

444
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,111
It's just amazing, isn't it?

445
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,154
What they did.

446
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,824
Unite all the provinces.

447
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,993
United the barbarians.

448
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,495
And for what?

449
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,706
So that all the money
ends up in one place.

450
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,874
Rome.

451
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,918
Pretty amazing.

452
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:36,175
I've acquired the Gulf.

453
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,806
Every trafficker in this
country now works for me.

454
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,392
And you're Julius Caesar.

455
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,271
I'd finish that book...

456
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,399
so you know how it ends.

457
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:00,116
This year, Pemex earned
four billion dollars.

458
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,328
This country's biggest exporter.

459
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,168
My organization made
$15 billion dollars.

460
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,046
I pull my money from your banks...

461
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,675
this country crumbles.

462
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,094
Overnight.

463
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,765
I don't think you want to be
president of that country.

464
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,230
You're going nowhere without my money.

465
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,447
Fix this shit with the Americans.

466
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,074
Protect me.

467
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,456
Without me, you're nothing.

468
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,222
Zuno, brother.

469
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,850
Who do you keep calling?

470
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,393
How can we help you?

471
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,062
These guys are doing nothing!

472
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,731
I'm calling to get some answers.

473
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,192
That's what I'm doing.

474
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,069
Answer, you fuckers!

475
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,701
He's calling again.

476
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,955
Put him through.

477
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,468
Hotel Américas, how can I help you?

478
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,637
I need to speak to Miguel, now.

479
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,723
I'm sorry, Mr. Félix is in a meeting.

480
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,392
Interrupt him.

481
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,811
I'm sorry. That won't be possible.

482
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,771
I've been calling you guys...

483
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,024
I apologize, sir.
I'm happy to take a message.

484
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,484
May I ask who's calling?

485
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,697
Rubén. Rubén Zuno Arce.

486
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,700
Tell him it's very important
that I speak to him.

487
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,411
Rubén!
We've been trying to reach you.

488
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:14,000
No, no, no. Trying to reach me?

489
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,586
No.
I've been calling you like crazy!

490
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,300
Yes, sorry. Mr. Félix asked me
to pass a message on to you

491
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,758
as soon as you called.

492
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,842
Let's see...

493
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,221
They have the deed to
the house, Lope de Vega.

494
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,974
The Americans,
they know where you are.

495
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,106
Hello? Hello?

496
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,192
What's up, Zuno?

497
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,527
What did they say?

498
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,279
Zuno?

499
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,532
What's up?

500
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,289
I have to go.

501
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,626
I have to get out of here.
Right now.

502
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,714
Get the bags.
We're fucking leaving.

503
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,593
Let's go, fuckers!

504
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,378
Daryl, you talk to the boys?

505
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,640
Yeah. We're good.

506
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,893
Walt, this is Alex.

507
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,562
Alex, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

508
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,148
You clear on what we're asking?

509
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,193
I mean,
you think you can handle it?

510
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,863
I've been doing it twice a
week for the past six months.

511
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,448
Don't see why not.

512
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,118
Your boy said there was
some money involved.

513
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,623
You'll be compensated when it's done.

514
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,753
See?
I told you he was friendly.

515
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,877
Come here to kill me too, Pablo?

516
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,216
Time we buried the dead, Antonia.

517
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,553
Moved on.

518
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,931
I came here to talk.

519
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,060
Fermín isn't home.

520
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,812
Bullshit.

521
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,565
Tell him to get out here.

522
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,942
It's time we settled this shit.

523
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,819
I told you, he isn't home.

524
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,538
Got some nerve, bringing that
son of a bitch to my house.

525
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,293
- I'm here to explain all that.
- What's to explain?

526
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,753
How you two took my son?

527
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,800
I know you think I had something
to do with killing Lili,

528
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,220
but I didn't.

529
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,603
Lili's wife was standing
right there with him.

530
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,642
Saw that motherfucker put
two in my son's chest.

531
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,395
Without my permission!

532
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,564
I've gotten mad about it with him too.

533
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,068
Lili was stealing from us, Antonia.

534
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,822
Got people killed for his lies.

535
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,286
But he's never coming home, hmm?

536
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,583
So to hell with you,
and all you say he did.

537
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,508
All right then.

538
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,012
If you think it'll help him rest...

539
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,775
Go ahead then.

540
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,235
Kill me.

541
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,281
It's all you gotta do to end this.

542
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,709
Pull the trigger!

543
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,589
End this!

544
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,787
It's not my responsibility, Pablo.

545
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,144
Only you or Fermín can end this.

546
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,524
Otherwise, this will never end.

547
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,656
The hell with it then.

548
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,958
Guess I'll see you.

549
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,129
No, Pablo.

550
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,591
I don't think so.

551
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,935
He's not inside.

552
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,146
He's out there waiting for us.

553
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,317
He'll try and take us on the road.

554
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,653
So all this shit is because
you murdered their son.

555
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,072
How's your shot?

556
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,201
Need you up top, Marco up front.

557
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,911
Fuck that, why me?

558
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,540
It's your job to protect me, isn't it?

559
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,086
Move that shit over.

560
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,257
Keep your eyes on the horizon.

561
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,550
What am I looking for?

562
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,719
You'll know when you see it.

563
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,892
Sir, I'm asking you not
to leave the premises.

564
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,563
See, if you stay inside,
I can control the situation.

565
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,899
That's bullshit.

566
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,861
I need to go, that's what I need to do.

567
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,238
I need to get the fuck out of here.

568
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,948
Sir, listen to me.

569
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,910
Sir.

570
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,620
If you insist on leaving,
at least let me find out

571
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:28,832
what's happening out there!

572
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,586
Oh, gonna start doing
your job? Fuck you!

573
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,754
You wait for my clear.

574
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,882
Fuck the clear,
just start the fucking car!

575
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,425
Useless asshole.

576
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,388
Let's get the fuck out of here.

577
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,725
Man, we got activity.

578
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,311
They're blocking us in.

579
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,399
Don't move! Show me your hands!

580
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,407
Let me see some identification.

581
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,650
Good afternoon, is there a problem?

582
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,831
They got you now, pussies!

583
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,596
Let's go!

584
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,850
Secure the plane! Fast!

585
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,935
Open the fucking door!

586
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,104
- Do you have a gun?
- Yes.

587
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,397
Sir!

588
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,524
Thank you for nothing.

589
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,819
From now on, my guys
take care of things.

590
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,700
Go fuck yourself, corporal.

591
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,412
Let's go, Dani!

592
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,919
- Do you know the itinerary?
- I've got it memorized, sir!

593
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,337
All right, let's go!

594
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,346
All right, here we go.
The honeymooners.

595
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,057
- What are we drinking?
- Whatever you want. You're paying.

596
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,019
Says the guy who did nothing.

597
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,742
- How are you, cousin?
- Hey.

598
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,231
Thank you for your help, cousin.

599
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,942
Cece, Kenny. Kenny, my cousin, Cece.

600
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,403
Nice to meet you.

601
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,114
So did you talk to Walt?

602
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:25,656
Yeah.

603
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,118
Zuno's on the one-way.

604
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,954
Everything went smoothly.

605
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,123
All right.

606
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,419
Well, to the smash-and-grab crew.

607
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,922
All growed up.

608
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,860
Salud, you guys.

609
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,747
How's it going, Amelia?

610
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,749
- Welcome back, sir.
- Any calls?

611
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,502
Yes, Héctor Palma called a few times.

612
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,585
Okay.

613
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,348
Open the door.

614
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,852
Who are they, Zuno?

615
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,563
Where the fuck are we?

616
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,399
The fuck did they take us?

617
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,235
Pilot?

618
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,403
Let's go!

619
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,821
Don't open the door!

620
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,072
Pilot!

621
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,851
Welcome to Texas, boys!

622
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,603
You got a permit for that weapon, son?

623
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,170
Put it on the ground, now!

624
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,302
Put your hands behind your head!

625
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,762
Your head!

626
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,899
Hey, bud. Looks like they're
waiting for you down there.

627
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,738
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, well, I just did.

628
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,901
We have to move, or we're gonna die.

629
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:35,407
You see that tractor? Get to it.

630
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,379
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

631
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,346
Move, man!

632
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,830
Pablo!

633
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,709
Pablo!

634
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,695
Praying for this asshole?

635
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:44,578
When I first got into the game,
I was a stupid kid.

636
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,440
Must have been 20 when I got
popped crossing the bridge,

637
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,960
over in Tabalaopa.

638
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,462
It was just my second run.

639
00:52:56,131 --> 00:53:01,428
Twelve ounces of heroin,
duct-taped to my arm.

640
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,307
Some genius, huh?

641
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:12,230
Didn't have a penny. Sure as hell
wasn't paying for a fucking lawyer.

642
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,444
Fermín walks in...

643
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,155
pulls out his wallet.

644
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,991
He says...

645
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:29,372
You're not dying in here
for 12 ounces.

646
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,921
He gave me my life back.

647
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,302
So you owed him. What all
this was really about...

648
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:52,229
This nonsense with Fermín,
I started it. Was on me to finish.

649
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,946
Only thing that keeps
order in this game...

650
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,491
it's respect.

651
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,704
Fermín was a father...

652
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,293
a husband, before he
was ever a trafficker.

653
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:21,216
He deserves to leave
this world with respect.

654
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,441
Hello?

655
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:39,609
How's it going?

656
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,361
How are they?

657
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,364
They're good. They ask about you.

658
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,202
It's late. They've gone to bed.

659
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,912
Yes, I know.

660
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,791
I'm just calling to...

661
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,921
They got the gifts?

662
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,299
Abril loves her doll.

663
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,342
All right.

664
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,265
Thank you, Manuela.

665
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:11,725
Good night, sir.

666
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,060
Good night.

667
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,671
It was him again, wasn't it?

668
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,215
Asking about the gifts.

669
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,176
Tell him not to send more.

670
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,392
The next time he calls, you tell him.
