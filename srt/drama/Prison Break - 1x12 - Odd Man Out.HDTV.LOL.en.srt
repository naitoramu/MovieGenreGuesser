1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,453
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:04,368
What you're doing up
there in the infirmary,

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:06,120
what it's got to do with
what we're doing here?

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,239
Four days from now,

5
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:08,483
on the night of the escape,

6
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,378
we'll have 18 minutes to get the
bars off the infirmary window,

7
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:14,742
and for all seven of us to get
across the wire and over the wall.

8
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,811
- Is that doable?
- Of course.

9
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:19,105
Maricruz, it's me.
Baby, what the hell is going on?

10
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:22,227
Well, Hector says that you
can serve your full sentence.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,991
What are you doing here?
Where's Maricruz?

12
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,358
She's not gonna be coming
around here anymore.

13
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,015
- This is a joke, right?
- She's with me now.

14
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,533
I just need to know

15
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:35,148
what Michael Scofield wanted from
you in exchange for the green card.

16
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,790
Why would you need a
credit card in prison?

17
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,898
If I'd have known that this is how
this whole thing was gonna turn out,

18
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:43,699
I'd have gotten some
crap job with the Feds.

19
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:46,455
Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be
forced to put a bullet in your head.

20
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:49,531
I need to get out while
I still got my life.

21
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:50,663
Daddy! Daddy!

22
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:53,356
Things have changed. I want in.

23
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,424
What's up?

24
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:57,082
We've got too many people.

25
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:00,152
I've done the math,
and one of them has to go.

26
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:03,472
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:06,019
Oh, it's, uh, not a problem.

28
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:10,588
- Hmm. Impressive resume.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,246
Tell me why you chose to pursue
a career in engineering.

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,715
Well, um,

31
00:01:16,086 --> 00:01:21,283
I've always been interested in,
uh, structure, geometry.

32
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:25,310
How things fit together.

33
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:29,446
How an object that, uh,
performs a function can...

34
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:32,002
also be a work of art.

35
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:36,095
What about the future?
Where do you see yourself in five years?

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,515
One suit, black.

37
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,852
That baby boy all
growed up yet?

38
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:45,038
Oh, he's gonna raise
hell the next few years.

39
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,027
Take after his mama.

40
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,313
Yeah, you know,
it's the same old same up here.

41
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,975
But, uh...

42
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,279
things are getting
pretty tense,

43
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,863
like they're fixin' to, uh, collide.
You know what I mean, Jimmy?

44
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:11,949
There's a potential,
uh, situation.

45
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,526
I found our access to
the infirmary building,

46
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:16,517
but I'm gonna need some
time to make it work.

47
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,491
How much time?

48
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:21,967
Enough for me to find my way up a
20-foot vertical drain pipe without
using a ladder.

49
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:26,427
I'll probably need to skip PI tomorrow
if I want to get this thing done.

50
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:29,798
Can't just skip it.
It ain't class.

51
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,161
What if one of the
bulls decide to drop in?

52
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:34,073
Well, I don't have a choice,
do I?

53
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,652
Once we get through the pipe
below the guards' room,

54
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:38,182
it will be a whole lot easier.

55
00:04:38,197 --> 00:04:40,336
I can come and go
without using the door,

56
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,320
and with Westmoreland
as a lookout,

57
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,470
we'll have one more
man available for dig.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,181
Westmoreland's gonna
be a problem.

59
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,729
All seven of us can't break
over that wall in 18 minutes.

60
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,659
You said it yourself:
it's impossible.

61
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:54,226
Listen, man, I'm telling you,
one of us has got to take a hike.

62
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:54,832
I know.

63
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,668
Mind if I share that with
the rest of the class?

64
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,488
Apparently, College
Boy here did the math.

65
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:08,005
Figured out that we got
too many clowns in the car.

66
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,149
So, one of us is in here digging,
but his seat ain't guaranteed.

67
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,758
How is this your problem, man?

68
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,622
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

69
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:17,698
I'm not gonna dig if
I'm not gonna go.

70
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:19,750
We need to make a
decision on who gets cut.

71
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,254
Well, I think we can all agree
who that should be. Right?

72
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,150
Oh, pardon me for interrupting.

73
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:31,690
But, uh...

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,055
what's that smell?

75
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:42,242
It smells a little
like... conspiracy.

76
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:43,874
We need to get back to work.

77
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:46,144
Yeah, before you do,
I have an announcement to make.

78
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:49,566
I've been growing leery of the way
y'all talk, like I'm a lesser man.

79
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:52,548
So, I bought an
insurance policy.

80
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:56,018
I called up my guy on the outside,
and I told him about our plan.

81
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,918
And I told him, in all likelihood,
I'll be seeing him next week,

82
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:00,655
but...

83
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:06,528
if he don't hear from me five minutes
before the escape, and 20 minutes after,

84
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,121
I told him to call up the warden,
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

85
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,869
So if you all got ideas
about getting rid of me...

86
00:06:16,597 --> 00:06:19,452
I suggest you make other plans.

87
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,931
Son of a bitch has got a
countermove for everything.

88
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,331
Not for this.

89
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,493
Odd men out-- me and you.

90
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:09,954
What do you mean?

91
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:12,965
Look who you're
walking with right now.

92
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:14,622
You should be up there,

93
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:17,042
calling the shots with
the rest of the suits.

94
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,896
- Yeah. So?
- So?

95
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:23,122
Scofield is only
here for one reason:

96
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,576
his brother.

97
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,990
And he only needs two things:

98
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:30,602
the old man's money,
and the mob boss's plane.

99
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,635
He don't need you.

100
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:36,189
You just happened to be in the
same cell when he got here.

101
00:07:36,776 --> 00:07:37,865
You  and the toilet.

102
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,906
I've done a lot of
work on this thing.

103
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,287
Exactly, and me, too.

104
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,049
Yeah, we're just the damn
laborers on this thing, man.

105
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,088
And the night that Fish
goes into that hole,

106
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:49,668
you think he wants to carry
all that extra baggage?

107
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,677
'Cause that's all we are.

108
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:53,797
I don't know about you,
but I'm going.

109
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,686
How  much does he
tell you, anyways?

110
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,005
Or does he keep it
all to himself?

111
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:07,862
Yeah, he probably tells you,
the less you know, the better, right?

112
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,191
You don't know what
you're talking about.

113
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,728
He tells me everything.

114
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:16,196
If he tells you everything,
then you don't need him.

115
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:20,746
Now, we can go by ourselves,
me and you.

116
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:24,510
Or, you know, you can wait

117
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:28,080
and see if Scofield really
wants to carry heavy weight.

118
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:31,048
It's up to you, popi.

119
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,640
Yo, I still waitin'.

120
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:43,754
What for?

121
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:46,602
I swiped you that watch, man.
Where's my PI?

122
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:48,068
That's not gonna happen.

123
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,011
You promised.

124
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:52,533
I said I'd think about it.
Maybe somewhere down the road.

125
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,705
Yeah. Ain't gonna
hold my breath.

126
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,177
What do you want me to do?

127
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:08,411
Get somebody! Now!

128
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:11,512
No, no, no! No, they see a bullet,
they're gonna call the cops.

129
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,456
We don't have a choice, okay?
I'm not gonna let you die.

130
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,860
Find it, find it! Find it!

131
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,425
What?

132
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,532
The bullet--
just find it and dig it out.

133
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,129
- I can't.
- Do it!

134
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:48,343
Where's Scofield?

135
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:54,733
There you are.

136
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,844
I just looked for you in your cell.
Couldn't find you anyplace.

137
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:01,688
I couldn't find your
credit card, either.

138
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,585
You know the one
I'm talking about.

139
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:06,478
The one your whore wife
trunked in the other day.

140
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,991
She told me all about it.

141
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:12,382
Maybe whore's too strong.

142
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:17,287
What do you call a girl who married a
felon to get into the United States?

143
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:19,855
Why'd she have to come
here for, anyway?

144
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,741
No strip clubs in Whazistan?

145
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,688
- Officer Bellick.
- Captain.

146
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:27,585
Fine. Do you mind conducting your
inquisitions on your own time, please?

147
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,788
I have a schedule to maintain.

148
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:30,185
Excuse me, Doctor.

149
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:33,802
I was just asking Mr.
Scofield about the contraband

150
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,589
he had his stripper wife
trunk in the other day.

151
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,311
But you go ahead.
Your job's more important.

152
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:56,769
He's had it out for me
since the day I got here.

153
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,468
- Hold still, please.
- Sorry.

154
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,621
I only married her...

155
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,566
so she could get
her green card.

156
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:17,224
I saw you coming out
of the conjugal room.

157
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,936
That's just business.

158
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:24,482
You don't have to explain
it to me, Michael.

159
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:25,875
I know.

160
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,319
But I want to.

161
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:38,960
D.B.?

162
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:42,972
Oh,  is that who you is now?
I thought you was just a cowboy.

163
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,853
Take a couple of
steps back, boy.

164
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:47,667
You know what I
can't understand is,

165
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,222
why somebody like you wants
to get out of here anyway.

166
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,762
How you going to survive, huh?

167
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,327
The world's all different now.
It's scary...

168
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,562
They got computer phones,
boobies made out of silicone.

169
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:58,995
You wouldn't know what to do.

170
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:01,177
I don't have to
justify myself to you.

171
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:02,832
Oh, you're going to have to.

172
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:05,406
Them old bones just going
to be dragging us down.

173
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:08,572
Maybe I'll just snap a
few of 'em right now.

174
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,040
Take your best shot.

175
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,937
Hey, break it up down there!

176
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,756
Bow out, cowboy.
I'm not going to warn you no more.

177
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:45,880
What's up?

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,778
Records from the phone in the yard.
James Bagwell. Lives down in Gary.

179
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:56,915
T-Bag's insurance policy?

180
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:57,559
Yeah.

181
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:02,468
My guy's going to lock him up in a
moving van for a couple days until we're
in the clear.

182
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,184
- Moving van?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:10,307
Don't worry, he can breathe and all.
We do it all the time.

184
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,806
What about T-Bag?

185
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,676
He's no longer a threat.
Trust me.

186
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,861
You James Bagwell?
Got a delivery for you.

187
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,238
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

188
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:51,761
- You all right?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,688
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

190
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,153
Can I speak with you, please?

191
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,609
Of course.
You stay right here, okay?

192
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,171
Is he going to be okay?

193
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,040
We don't know yet.
He's lost a lot of blood.

194
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:07,353
I was going to call the police,
but I wanted to speak to you first.

195
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,783
His wound is obviously
the product of a gunshot.

196
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:12,029
You need to be honest with me.

197
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,050
What was he doing
when he got shot?

198
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,554
He was in the garage,
underneath his car.

199
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:18,844
He's in surgery right now.

200
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:22,553
The blood loss has caused his muscle
tissue to suffer from a lack of oxygen.

201
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,453
He's also sustained a fair amount
of damage to his shoulder,

202
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:28,683
and with a bullet there's always
an increased risk of infection.

203
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,299
So, he's going to
have to be admitted.

204
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,178
Is there anyone you should call?
Any family?

205
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,824
No. It's just me.

206
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,396
All right, well... I'll let you
know as soon as he's in recovery.

207
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:39,300
Thank you.

208
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:56,824
Yeah.

209
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:00,000
- Are you there yet?
- Almost.

210
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:05,445
You remember, be patient.
Follow his lead.

211
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,525
We want the trifecta today.

212
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:11,253
Yeah, I'm on it.

213
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:25,290
It's me.

214
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:27,560
Yeah. I got some bad news.

215
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,078
Yeah, like what?

216
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:31,542
The job you ordered went bad.

217
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,819
The guy was a paranoid,
he had a gun...

218
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,144
one thing led to another.

219
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:37,536
What, he's dead?

220
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,925
Yeah. And, unfortunately...

221
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:44,206
there was a kid there.

222
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:48,109
What are you... What are you
talking about? You killed a kid?

223
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,063
It was unintentional.

224
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,734
- It's a kid, man.
- I know, I'm sorry.

225
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:56,419
SOB used him as a shield.

226
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:01,055
- A boy or a girl?
- I don't know. Boy.

227
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:04,440
- How old?
- Four, maybe five.

228
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:15,382
- Who's here to see me?
- Hell if I know. Some lady.

229
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:19,994
Baby.

230
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:23,905
Hi.

231
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,896
You look so beautiful.

232
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,185
I came here cause I have
to tell you something.

233
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:34,589
What?

234
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,227
I'm pregnant, Fernando.

235
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,286
Pregnant?

236
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:46,211
With your baby.

237
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:50,940
I'm going to have your son.

238
00:16:53,898 --> 00:16:56,101
You...  you're going to...

239
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:57,612
We...

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,571
We're going to have a baby?

241
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:02,832
Oh, yeah, Papi, you hear that?
I'm going to be a dad!

242
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,906
- I'm not finished!
- What, Mami, what?

243
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,746
Okay, Hector...
he asked me to marry him.

244
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:09,403
What?

245
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,522
- Look, it's crazy, I know.
- Well, tell him no.

246
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,102
Tell him you're having my son.
We're going to be a family.

247
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:19,053
Fernando... Look,
my mom, she says...

248
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,559
that having a baby is the
hardest job in the whole world.

249
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:25,883
And it's even harder if
I do this by myself.

250
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:30,849
But all I know is is
I'm really scared.

251
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:33,291
I'm really scared
to do this alone.

252
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:34,772
You're not going to have to.

253
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,315
Well, I haven't
told him no yet.

254
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:40,457
Wait, wait.
You're not actually considering this.

255
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:44,994
Oh, baby... I don't know.
I don't know.

256
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,862
Oh, my God, baby, you got to
stop listening to these people.

257
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:49,900
They're poisoning your brain.

258
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:54,107
Your hormone things-- they're out of
whack. You're not thinking straight.

259
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,422
This is our child
we're talking about.

260
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:00,472
I want you to listen to me.

261
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,184
I want you to wait.

262
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm going to be out.

263
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,795
Sooner than you think.

264
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,972
You keep on telling me that.

265
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:15,419
All right, visiting time is up.
Let's go.

266
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,416
Tell me you're going to wait.

267
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,663
Hands off, Sucre!

268
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,838
You're all I got left in the world,
baby. Please.

269
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,112
I love you.

270
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,980
But you'll learn to
love again, right?

271
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,703
Tell me you're going
to tell him no, honey.

272
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:53,404
I don't know.
I don't know anything any more.

273
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,530
Sucre. Come on.

274
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,596
- The kid's here.
- Perfect.

275
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:25,061
Follow  him back to the
lawyers and call me back.

276
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,764
Where are you going?

277
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,788
I'll be back in ten minutes.

278
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,079
What do you have to do?

279
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:26,972
It's complicated.
I can't explain.

280
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,508
But if it works...

281
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:31,795
you'll see soon enough.

282
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,901
I want to go with you.
I want to see now.

283
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,635
Someone has to stay here.

284
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,380
I need a lookout.

285
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,986
I'm always on lookout.

286
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:44,944
You're my cellmate.
Who else is going to do it?

287
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,467
I'll be back in
ten minutes, okay?

288
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:54,547
Okay.

289
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:26,740
We're all lined up for tomorrow.
Where do you want him?

290
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:31,191
John?

291
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:35,414
Tomorrow. Where do you want T-Bag:
in the shop or the shed?

292
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:36,291
Shh...

293
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:37,848
I don't care.

294
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,422
You decide.

295
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,933
Thank God. Are you okay?

296
00:23:37,652 --> 00:23:40,105
Yeah, I'm okay.

297
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:42,940
She didn't do anything.

298
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:45,682
She didn't deserve this.

299
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:46,855
I know.

300
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,479
- Here you go, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

301
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,282
These were seriously
hard to get.

302
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:09,739
- What you need them for anyway?
- None of your business.

303
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,446
Thank you for
waiting, Theodore.

304
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,651
I don't mean to deny
your time in the yard.

305
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:24,791
What's this all about?

306
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,600
I, uh...

307
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,339
I'm afraid I have
some terrible news.

308
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:35,728
You cousin James was shot and
killed in his home yesterday.

309
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:39,103
His son, James Junior was killed,
as well.

310
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,600
I'm very, very sorry.

311
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,439
What does it mean?

312
00:24:57,027 --> 00:24:59,167
Am I chosen?

313
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:01,155
Or what?

314
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:06,903
Often, the Lord appears when you're
in particular need of forgiveness.

315
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:09,891
Maybe that's what's
happening right now.

316
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:19,813
John, it's never too late.

317
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:24,381
If you agree to accept Christ into
your heart and turn from your sin,

318
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:28,263
he will forgive you and
save you in eternity.

319
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,933
Do you agree?

320
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:43,333
Revelation chapter three.
Verse 20:

321
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,324
Jesus said, "Behold,
I stand at the door and knock.

322
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:52,084
If any man hear my
voice and open the door,

323
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:55,123
I will come into him."

324
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,564
He got to the infirmary
building last night.

325
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:16,951
Through  the old sewer pipe.

326
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:19,727
It's the same pipe that runs
under the guards' room.

327
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,803
That's all I know.

328
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,796
That's the little thumb-sucker
that swiped my watch.

329
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:30,390
Who? Tweener?

330
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,927
Solid gold.
Took it right off my arm.

331
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,868
It was a half hour before
I even noticed it.

332
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:36,498
Whose was it in
the first place?

333
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:39,079
I don't care that you stole it.
You can tell me.

334
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:41,242
Michael Scofield.

335
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:00,667
What are you looking at?

336
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,248
I'll be right
around the corner.

337
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,879
Westmoreland!

338
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:22,835
You scared me, boss.

339
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,869
Get back to work.

340
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,497
All right, let's go!

341
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:06,542
Move it, Scofield.

342
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:23,963
"As for me, I will call upon God,
and the Lord shall save me.

343
00:29:24,337 --> 00:29:28,008
I cry aloud,
and he'll hear my voice.

344
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:33,902
He shall hear my voice.
He shall hear my voice.

345
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,354
He shall hear my voice.

346
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:42,155
He shall hear my voice.

347
00:30:11,987 --> 00:30:13,706
What are you doing?

348
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:15,490
Nothing.

349
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:23,072
Well, keep an eye on the tier for me,
will you?

350
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:25,491
When are we getting
out of here exactly?

351
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:26,860
I need to know the time.

352
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:27,994
As soon as possible.

353
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:30,002
"As soon as possible"
is not a specific time.

354
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:32,427
- You tell Abruzzi the time?
- Yes, because he needs to know.

355
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:33,799
Why does he need to
know and I don't?

356
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:36,779
Because he's arranging the plane.
Why the sudden curiosity?

357
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:45,457
Why would you want to be responsible
for potentially dangerous information?

358
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:47,570
The less you know, the better.

359
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,744
It's for your own good.

360
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:58,352
I have to go.
I'll meet you in PI.

361
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:10,723
Stealing from a guard.

362
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:13,184
You can get thrown
in the SHU for that,

363
00:31:13,275 --> 00:31:15,280
maybe even add a few
years to your bid.

364
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:16,311
I don't know...

365
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,188
Don't deny it.
I already know it's true.

366
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,324
Lucky for you,
I got pull some around here.

367
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:25,925
I can make this sort of thing go away,
like it never even happened.

368
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,086
Mmm.

369
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:32,980
That's good.

370
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:35,670
Now...

371
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,614
I'm sure you've
heard the word "rat."

372
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,973
I don't like it.
"Snitch," neither.

373
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:48,967
Those sort of words aren't
appropriate for what I need from you.

374
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:51,468
What I need is a
little information.

375
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:54,204
Like when you're hanging
out with Scofield...

376
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,141
...just come back and
tell me what he said.

377
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:13,450
I got an extra burger.
But, man, I'm full.

378
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:18,524
What do you say, kiddo?
You want a cheeseburger...

379
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:21,178
or do you want to
go to the SHU?

380
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,667
That's my boy.

381
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:35,395
Hey, honey,
what are you doing here?

382
00:32:35,644 --> 00:32:36,971
I thought you left.

383
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:39,021
What's wrong?

384
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,627
I, um... I've been thinking.

385
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,565
I think we need
to make a change.

386
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:47,488
What are you talking about?

387
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:50,710
Remember when we first got married,
and we thought about moving out west?

388
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,841
Yeah, we were 22.

389
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:56,422
Well, maybe we should give it a shot.
It's not too late.

390
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:59,129
I don't understand.
What brought this on?

391
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,234
It's just work.

392
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,321
I'm tired of being on the road
and working for somebody else,

393
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:07,980
while you sit at home all alone,
night after night.

394
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,223
I want our lives
to be about us.

395
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:13,973
I do, too, but there's so much to think
about, like the kids and the house.

396
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:17,216
We got to go.

397
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,229
You're in trouble, aren't you?

398
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:27,442
Oh.

399
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:30,602
The crowd has
thinned out in here.

400
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:31,783
How you doing, Sucre?

401
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,878
Almost got it. Switch me out.

402
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,947
You're up, then Westmoreland.

403
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:39,202
We got to get through.
Michael's gonna be coming back this way.

404
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:03,618
- Hello?
- Veronica Donovan?

405
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:04,964
Who is this?

406
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:09,764
It, it doesn't matter who I am.
Don't hang up.

407
00:37:09,925 --> 00:37:12,695
I have information that
you may be interested in--

408
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,293
information that will lead to the
exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.

409
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:18,710
What? What is it?

410
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:20,521
I can't tell you that now.

411
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:25,320
Meet me tonight at the Highland
Cafe on Kennedy Avenue.

412
00:37:25,756 --> 00:37:29,183
This isn't a trap. I will tell
you everything you need to know.

413
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:31,256
Highland Cafe, 8:00 p.m.

414
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,725
All right, that's enough.

415
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,507
- Leave us alone.
- You sure?

416
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:47,929
Get out of here.

417
00:37:58,563 --> 00:38:00,126
You don't have to do this.

418
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:03,191
You don't have to do this.

419
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,588
You don't have to do this.

420
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:11,272
You brought it on yourself.

421
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:15,831
I'm just an emissary for all the
pain and suffering you caused,

422
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:19,244
all the families you ruined,
all the kids.

423
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:20,912
What about Jimmy?

424
00:38:21,929 --> 00:38:24,929
He had nothing to do with this.
You didn't need to kill him.

425
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:27,590
And what about
his beautiful son?

426
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:30,535
He had his whole life
in front of him.

427
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:33,635
You didn't need to kill
a beautiful child.

428
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:38,640
After all I've done,
maybe I do deserve to die, maybe I do.

429
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:40,351
But you are no better than me.

430
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:44,564
But I can be, if I want.

431
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:49,193
God has given me the
chance to choose.

432
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:55,959
Maybe I should give
you a chance as well.

433
00:38:56,478 --> 00:39:00,184
Yes, anything,
anything, please.

434
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:01,838
Please.

435
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:03,790
Please.

436
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,261
Back out.

437
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:13,904
Of the escape?

438
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:15,637
Or die.

439
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,959
I would, I...

440
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:23,261
I wouldn't make it
out there, anyway--

441
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,957
not with my proclivities.

442
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:31,371
I want you to give
me your word.

443
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:35,393
You hear me?
I want you to give me your word!

444
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:39,131
Yeah, you got it, John.
You got it. Come on, you got it.

445
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:40,744
- Please.
- Swear.

446
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:45,274
I'm out, I swear!
I swear to God!

447
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:49,046
I'm out, okay, I sw...

448
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,083
All right. All right!

449
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,692
I have forgiven you.
I have forgiven you.

450
00:40:04,942 --> 00:40:09,504
You just have to pray that the Lord
Jesus Christ will do the same.

451
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,603
Hey, John, you know,
actually, about Jesus...

452
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:29,473
Say hi to Him for me, will you?

453
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:41,736
I'm through.

454
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:43,800
- Keep it up.
- Come on, stomp it.

455
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,104
Bulls.

456
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:05,403
You got to stall them.
We're not ready.

457
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:09,316
Hey, boss.

458
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:10,549
What you doing out here, Linc?

459
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:11,477
Taking a break.

460
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:13,437
Got to check the
status in there.

461
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,257
It's all good.

462
00:41:15,441 --> 00:41:17,396
Then you won't mind
me checking it out.

463
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:20,329
Hey.

464
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:23,317
What the hell's
your problem, con?

465
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:28,420
Hey, hey!
Step off or you're going to the SHU!

466
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:36,185
Get off him!

467
00:41:57,827 --> 00:41:58,583
Thanks.

468
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:00,671
Well...

469
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,013
we leave tonight.

470
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:09,261
Where's my brother?

471
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,147
Michael, we got a big problem.
