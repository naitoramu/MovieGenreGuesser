KDK-12.

She all right?

00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:17,290
<i>Her daughter called from California,</i>

6
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,966

kind of worried.</i>

7
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:21,814
Will do.

8
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,513
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

9
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,330
KDK-12 here.

10
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,104
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

11
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,360
- <i>Come again?</i>
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

12
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,632
- I need some backup out here.
- <i>On their way.</i>

13
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:30,858
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now.

14
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,930
Hold it right there!
Let me see your hands.

15
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:45,475
Hands!

16
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,523
All right, down.
On your knees.

17
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:55,236
You understand me?
Do you speak English?

18
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,821
I said down!
On your knees. Down!

19
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,730
Damn it, get down!
On your knees!

20
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:09,720
Do it!

21
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,239
On your knees or I'll fire!

- the model, so...
- Yeah, I like it.

67
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,133
{\pos(192,210}I like...

00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:38,798
{\pos(192,210)}Good.

74
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,877

- Yes, sir.

76

Main valve on, main switch on.

77
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:53,891
Give the compressor time

That's what I say.

82
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,008
My man Jesse can cook.

83
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:18,035
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

84
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,541
Just the right shade of blue.

85
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,876
- Good shade.
- Check out that crystal size,

86
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,921
If that bitch was any bigger,
it would be a Jolly Rancher.

87
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:26,631
Be my guest.

88
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,236
You sure?

89
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:35,039
I feel kind of diggish with
you being in rehab and all.

90
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,172
{\pos(192,185)}I can watch.

91
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,451
I can cook, and I can watch.

92
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:44,497
Go for it. I tried it, like, last week.
I'm still coming down.

93
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:45,817
Go easy.

00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:17,765
Bow before me.

97
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:20,835
I am Lord of the Dance.

98
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:25,671
{\pos(192,210)}Shit.
I gotta try that again.

99
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:27,774
I think you're good.

100
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,963
That is awesome, Jesse.

101
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,811
I feel like somebody took
my brain out

102
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:35,343
and boiled it

103
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,351
- in, like, boiling hot...
- It's the bomb, man, seriously.

104
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:40,663
Like anthrax.

105
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:42,468
Good.

106
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:44,548
So...

107
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,462
You ready to talk some business?

108
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:52,290
{\pos(192,210)}This is not, like, just...
recreational?

109
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,512
{\pos(192,210)}I know...

110
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,952
{\pos(192,210)}what you're thinking.

111
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,144
{\pos(192,210)}Trust me. It's not going
to be like it was...

112
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,701
never gonna be like it was.

113
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,927
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

114
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,082
{\pos(192,210)}All right? We sell it smart.

115
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,784
{\pos(192,210)}We don't get greedy...

116
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,029
Like before.

117
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,198
I don't know, man.

118
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:17,316
Combo and all.

119
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,157
Still.

120
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,566
Man's gotta make his living.

121
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,596
{\pos(192,210)}If it's like Jesse says

122
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,647
{\pos(192,210)}and we're not greedy...

123
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,011
{\pos(192,210)}I guess I can see it.

124
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,181
{\pos(192,210)}Had a good thing going before
we started pushing our luck.

125
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,601
{\pos(192,210)}If it can go back to being
like that and all...

126
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:45,976
It will be.

127
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,721
{\pos(192,210)}Step 1: we build inventory.

128
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,274
{\pos(192,210)}Badger, go see Clovis.

129
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:53,159
{\pos(192,210)}Get the RV in shape...
tune up, oil change,

130
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:54,861
{\pos(192,210)}brake lights, and whatnot.

131
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,296
{\pos(192,210)}Cops always pull you over
for brake lights.

132
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,345
{\pos(192,210)}Not us.

133
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,076
{\pos(192,210)}Cautious.

134
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,428
You got it.

135
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:03,121
You know that buzzer thing.

136
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,166
Leave the key in the ignition,
and it buzzes, whatever.

137
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,432
{\pos(192,210)}Just have him put
in one of those, too.

138
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:11,796
{\pos(192,210)}Skinny, you're
in charge of supplies.

139
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:13,657
I'll get you a list.

140
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,276
Right on.

141
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,834
Yeah?

142
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,138
OK.

143
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:23,276
So...

144
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,005
we good?

145
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:26,531
Good.

146
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,569
Let's do this thing.

147
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,723
I know you.

148
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,840
Small world, Albuquerque.

149
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,283
Want to talk about it?

150
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:59,460
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

151
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:04,119
You know, ironically,

152
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:07,781
I think you're going to see
much more of me from now on.

153
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,455
Sure.

154
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,908
Just as much of me at least.

155
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,506
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

156
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,821
What, I don't get a vote
in this, either?

157
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,606
I gotta stop going with Louis

158
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,538
just because you're feeling guilty?

159
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:26,200
I do feel guilty.

160
00:13:31,806 --> 00:13:33,969
I am the man that I am, son,

161
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:38,122
and there's plenty I would
change about that, but...

162
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,550
Here we are

163
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,455
and this is just what it is.

164
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,912
You know what?
Call me crazy,

165
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,367
but I'm actually
feeling very good about the future.

166
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:34,195
Morning.

167
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,334
They're back.

168
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,554
I'm just wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

169
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,972
Why?

170
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,590
They're doing nothing wrong.

171
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,423
Let's put this on table 33, okay?

172
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,851
Hello, there.

173
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,090
Mr. White, I presume?

174
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,521
Hi. I am...

175
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:28,815
Sorry.

176
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll be right down.

177
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,008
Hi. Gale Boetticher.

178
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,180
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

179
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:48,966
Yes, I am.

180
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,384
I suppose you'll want
to hear my qualifications.

181
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,144
I have my resume here for you.

182
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,364
I received
my bachelor's degree from UNM,

183
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:01,961
my master's from
the University of Colorado.

184
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,866
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in...

185
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,534
It's all right there.

186
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:10,271
"X-ray crystallography."

187
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:12,448
Really.

188
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,234
I could talk about that for hours.

189
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:18,711
I would love to.

190
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:21,691
Well, first, I'm curious about this.

191
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:27,682
That's a little pet project of mine.

192
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:30,657
See, in my opinion,

193
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:32,968
it's all about
the quinic acid level.

194
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:37,366
You want just north
of 4,800 milligrams per liter,

195
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,560
but if you over-boil to get there,
you're going to leach your tannins.

196
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,456
Bitterness. Yuck.

197
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,482
So I pull a mild vacuum.

198
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:50,450
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C,

199
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,655
Let's see.

200
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:58,478
Judge for yourself.

201
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:13,156
My God.

202
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:24,279
My God, that is the best
coffee I've ever tasted.

203
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,422
Sumatran beans,

204
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,381
and I also have to give
credit to the grind,

205
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:32,428
but...

206
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,057
thank you, Mr. White.

207
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:35,927
Walt, please.

208
00:18:36,052 --> 00:18:37,337
Call me Walt.

209
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,352
Why the hell are we making meth?

210
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,972
Tell me...

211
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,636
with the phenylacetic acid solution,

212
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,116
you said 150 drops per minute

213
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,931
for the first 10 minutes,

214
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,309
and then 90 for the remainder.

215
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:04,534
Why is that?

216
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,505
My thinking is,

217
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,377
by tapering the phenyl,
you get an...

218
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,153
oilier aqueous layer, and hence...

219
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,839
Better benzene extraction.

220
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:17,952
Exactly.

221
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,963
But actually I prefer ether.

222
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,764
I'll have it for tomorrow.

223
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:33,997
I'm wondering how you...

224
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:35,693
Ended up here.

225
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,184
Actually,

226
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:40,270
I'm still wondering
how I ended up here,

227
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:41,997
but, yes.

228
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,650
I mean, I can't imagine

229
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:47,184
we strike each other as criminals.

230
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,127
There's crime,

231
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,044
and then there's crime,

232
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,176
I suppose.

233
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,930
I'm definitely a libertarian.

234
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,909
Consenting adults
want what they want,

235
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,637
and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

236
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:07,473
At least with me, they're getting
exactly what they pay for.

237
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:10,646
No added toxins or adulterants.

238
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,826
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to,

239
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,484
pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,

240
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,115
NSF research grant.

241
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,321
I was on my way,

242
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,732
jumping through hoops,
kissing the proper behinds,

243
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:28,728
attending to all the non-chemistry

244
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:30,884
that one finds oneself
occupied with.

245
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,865
You know that world.

246
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:35,859
That is not what I signed on for.

247
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,514
I love the lab.

248
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:46,485
Because it's all still magic.

249
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:47,890
You know?

250
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:51,101
Chemistry?

251
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,946
Once you lose that...

252
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:58,150
It is.

253
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:00,493
It is magic.

254
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,190
It still is.

255
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,918
And all the while I kept thinking

256
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:08,925
about that great, old Whitman poem.

257
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,338
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

258
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:13,997
Walt Whitman.

259
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:15,441
I... I don't know it.

260
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:17,209
Anyway...

261
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:18,701
Well, can you recite it?

262
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:25,364
Pathetically enough I could.

263
00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:26,788
All right, well...

264
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,979
Come on.
Come on.

265
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:38,924
When I heard the learn'd astronomer;

266
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:42,193
When the proofs, the figures,

267
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,870
were ranged in columns before me;

268
00:22:45,404 --> 00:22:48,095
When I was shown the charts
and the diagrams,

269
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,420
to add, divide, and measure them;

270
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:54,146
When I, sitting, heard the
astronomer, where he lectured

271
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:57,584
with much applause
in the lecture-room,

272
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,528
How soon, unaccountable,

273
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,755
I became tired and sick;

274
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,582
Till rising and gliding out,

275
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:08,545
I wander'd off by myself,

276
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,717
In the mystical moist night-air,

277
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,533
and from time to time,

278
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,468
Look'd up in perfect silence

279
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,228
at the stars.

280
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:29,772
I am a nerd.

281
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,058
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

282
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:39,934
Come on, Pinkman.

283
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,767
You little rat bastard. Get off
your lazy ass and go break the law.

284
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,084
- Hey, baby.
- <i>Are you ever coming home?</i>

285
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,506
- {\Marie, }I'm working. All right?
- <i>Did you find it?</i>

286
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,674
The RV?

287
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,468
<i>Nope. Working on it, so...</i>

288
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:33,088
Why can't you just arrest him,

289
00:24:33,213 --> 00:24:34,407
make him tell you?

290
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:38,141
<i>It's not that simple{\, baby}.
There's a {\little }thing called the Constitution.</i>

291
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:40,243
The Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

292
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:47,063
<i>This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could...</i>

293
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,796
This is that Pinkman character?

294
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:52,461
<i>That's the one.</i>

295
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,701
<i>Positive the little bastard
has got an RV,</i>

296
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,945
and I just don't know
where he keeps it.

297
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,783
Until he actually leads me
to where...

298
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:02,760
or does something,
I'm stuck here, Marie.

299
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,461
<i>Sorry.</i>

300
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:09,034
Not to bring up ancient history,

301
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,057
but I for one can think of someone
who might know something...

302
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:15,508
possibly.

303
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:17,724
It's worth a shot.

304
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:22,225
Who?

305
00:25:27,884 --> 00:25:29,897
<i>Hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?</i>

306
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:31,572
Hey, Hank. What's up?

307
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,073
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.
I just...</i>

308
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:35,723
<i>I just have a quick question.</i>

309
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:37,025
Shoot.

310
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,037
<i>{\Now, }I'm only asking you this
because I'm at a{\, you know,}</i>

311
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,005
dead-end here potentially.

312
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,258
I'm working a case, and...

313
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,421
Listen, you gotta know

314
00:25:47,752 --> 00:25:50,274
<i>that I would never put you on the spot
or make you uncomfortable.</i>

315
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,202
You could just cut to the chase.

316
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,304
<i>Back when we...</i>

317
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:55,472
lost you

318
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:57,806
and I was trying to track you down

319
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,231
<i>through a former student
of yours, Jesse Pinkman,</i>

320
00:26:00,356 --> 00:26:02,145
<i>now, you know...</i>

321
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:05,815
that I know that once upon a time
he may have dealt you

322
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,030
<i>a little weed.</i>

323
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:10,777
<i>Just a little, and I so
do not care about that.</i>

324
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,196
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled, okay?

325
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,093
<i>Like you said, cut to the chase.</i>

326
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:17,981
<i>Do you remember if this Pinkman kid</i>

327
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:19,706
<i>ever had an RV?</i>

328
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,709
<i>You know, a recreational vehicle,</i>

329
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,360
you know,
like a Winnebago-type deal,

330
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,430
<i>brown and beige?</i>

331
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,542
Why?

332
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:38,484
<i>It's a long story, but I{\'m} personally
{\of the opinion }think that he's moved on from weed</i>

333
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,059
<i>and graduated
to selling crystal meth,</i>

334
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,623
<i>using it as a rolling lab.</i>

335
00:27:32,457 --> 00:27:34,448
<i>How's my favorite genius?</i>

336
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:35,940
Is this a secure line?

337
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:37,746
<i>Is this a secure...</i>

338
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:39,033
<i>Yes, what's with the...</i>

339
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,536
Hey, hello to you, too.

340
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:41,869
<i>{\Listen, }We've got a problem,</i>

341
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:43,245
a DEA problem.

342
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,024
- I'm listening.
- <i>My brother-in-law,</i>

343
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,749
<i>he knows about the RV.</i>

344
00:27:47,672 --> 00:27:48,501
What RV?

345
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:49,953
Our RV,

346
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:52,130
the one which contains a meth lab,

347
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:54,885
<i>which is covered with my fingerprints.
Ring a bell?</i>

348
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,138
What exactly does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

349
00:27:58,263 --> 00:28:01,055
No, he knows it exists,
and he's trying to find it.

350
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:03,709
<i>He has linked it to Jesse,
and it's only a matter of time</i>

351
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,310
<i>before he tracks it down...</i>

352
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:08,226
<i>So get rid of it. What are you doing
sitting here talking to me for?</i>

353
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:10,621
<i>Better yet,
have Pinkman get rid of it.</i>

354
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:11,858
You don't go near it.

355
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:14,903
{\No, listen, }My brother-in-law{\, he} is surveying Jesse{\'s house}.
Do you understand?

356
00:28:15,353 --> 00:28:17,906
<i>So he might've tapped the phones
or bugged his house.</i>

357
00:28:18,385 --> 00:28:20,116
<i>Jesus. Plan A, then.</i>

358
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:21,910
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

359
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:25,246
And do what exactly?

360
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:26,851
I mean, what...

361
00:28:27,356 --> 00:28:31,136
The thing...
The thing is the size of a...

362
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:32,888
It's RV size.

363
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:35,641
<i>I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?</i>

364
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:38,435
- I'm not David Copperfield.
- <i>What do I look like,</i>

365
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:41,313
the RV disposal people?
Did you not plan

366
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:43,273
- <i>for this contingency?</i>
- No.

367
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:45,150
Next time, plan for it, would you?

368
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:48,070
<i>The Starship Enterprise had
a self-destruct button. I'm just saying.</i>

369
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:49,821
Okay, shut up.

370
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:52,156
I'm just saying, you know,

371
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,753
you're good with tools and all.

372
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:55,650
Why don't you invent

373
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,575
a water-powered car, you know?

374
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:01,524
If you did that,
you would be rolling in it.

375
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:04,601
Socket wrench.

376
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:06,128
The big one.

377
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,093
You scared of the Arabs?

378
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:19,143
Are you out of your mind?

379
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:21,181
- Why is this out in the open?
- Who {\the hell }are you?

380
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:22,438
He's Heisenberg.

381
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:25,113
- Is this drivable? Does it run?
- Yeah, I was just changing the oil.

382
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:26,482
Finish it, quickly.

383
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:28,801
We'll wipe it clean
and take it out to the desert.

384
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:29,861
Help me.

385
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,230
Hold up.
What's this about?

386
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:34,031
The DEA,

387
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:36,994
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
You've heard of them, haven't you?

388
00:29:37,162 --> 00:29:38,155
I know you have.

389
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,664
They know all about this RV,
and they're trying to find it

390
00:29:40,832 --> 00:29:41,832
right now.

391
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,043
I want this off my property now.

392
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,645
We have got to destroy the evidence.

393
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,798
We've got to {\rig this thing to burn}burn this thing.
Do you understand?

394
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,342
- Not here you don't. Just get it {\the hell }out{\ of here}.
- Now, listen to me.

395
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,824
I need your help, okay?

396
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:55,930
If I go down, we all go down.

397
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,306
Do you understand?

398
00:29:58,658 --> 00:30:00,058
All right, just...

399
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,685
I know a better way.

400
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:04,313
I know a guy that'll wipe this off
the planet, no questions asked.

401
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:05,731
Call him.

402
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:13,702
What about Jesse?

403
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:14,782
What about him?

404
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:26,717
Hey, it's me.

405
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,420
Wanna hear something weird?

406
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:30,319
Now, listen to me.

407
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:33,085
You get that address.
Now, Badger, I don't care how!

408
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,410
You find out where he's taking it!

409
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,243
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

410
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:18,987
Excuse me, gentlemen.

411
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,626
This booth is for paying customers.

412
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,201
Cynthia, it's okay.

413
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,232
I'll handle this.

414
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:02,055
96, 97,

415
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,869
98, 99, 100.

416
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,979
Beyond recovery, right?

417
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:10,572
- Now, beyond recovery means...
- I get it. Beyond recovery.

418
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:13,435
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Don't worry.

419
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,460
When we're through with it,
it's going to be about yea big, okay?

420
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,534
Then we flatbed it
over to Long Beach,

421
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,456
ship it across the Pacific.

422
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:22,834
Chinese turn it
into patio furniture,

423
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,510
so... mind at ease.

424
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,446
Can you do me a favor?
I'm obviously going to...

425
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,251
need a ride.
Could you call a cab?

426
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,012
You got it.
Pleasure doing business.

427
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:36,013
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

428
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:16,546
{\The hell you think you're doing}What are you doing?

429
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:18,966
- Me?
- This is mine just as much as yours!

430
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,130
You don't get to just...

431
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,572
What?

432
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,001
What?

433
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:31,728
He's here.

434
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,600
Who's here?

435
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,670
You led him right to us.

436
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,678
Mr. Pinkman,
you want to add resisting arrest?

437
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:18,147
We'll add it.
No skin off my ass.

438
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:21,623
Last chance to do it the easy way.

439
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:03,475
Got a warrant?

440
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:06,791
Who are you?

441
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,668
What do you know about this RV?

442
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,197
Well, I'm the owner of this lot,

443
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:13,423
which means
you're trespassing on private property.

444
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,801
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked,

445
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:20,597
which means you're trying to break
and enter, so I say again,

446
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:22,165
you got a warrant?

447
00:36:23,842 --> 00:36:26,182
I don't need one
if I've got probable cause,

448
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:27,354
counselor.

449
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:31,358
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding,

450
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,985
you know, traffic stops and whatnot.

451
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,862
See these round rubber things?

452
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:38,054
Wheels.

453
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,991
This is a vehicle.

454
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,787
This is a domicile, a residence,

455
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:47,248
and thus protected
by the Fourth Amendment

456
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,904
from unlawful search and seizure.

457
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:51,086
- {\Look buddy, }Why don't you just go out and...
- Did you see this

458
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:52,353
drive in here?

459
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:53,672
How do you know it runs?

460
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,390
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

461
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,249
It seems to me
you're just out here...

462
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:00,374
fishing.

463
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:05,239
Don't see that
holding up in a court of law.

464
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:11,385
Well, look at these.

465
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,277
What do those look like to you?

466
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:19,280
They sure look like bullet holes
to me.

467
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,158
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this

468
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:23,376
"domicile".

469
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:27,487
Willing to bet there's a judge or two{\ out there}
who'd see that as probable cause,

470
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:29,601
but {\I'll tell you what.}why don't you call{\ the Albuquerque police}...

471
00:37:29,726 --> 00:37:32,352
How could you have known
that they were there

472
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:34,813
before you took off the tape?

473
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:36,160
What?

474
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,907
How could you have known
that they were there

475
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:41,432
before you took off the tape?
Say it.

476
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:43,002
Say it.

477
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,310
How could you have known that they were
there before you took off the tape?

478
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,417
That's right.

479
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,399
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

480
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,657
There's somebody in there.

481
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:02,459
... private domicile
and I won't be harassed.

482
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,022
Probable cause or no,
I'll give you three seconds

483
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:07,083
to get your ass out here.

484
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,584
1, 2...

485
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:12,259
This is my own private domicile,
and I will not be harassed.

486
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:14,017
Bitch.

487
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,681
Fine. You want your warrant?

488
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:32,497
I'll have my guys bring it out here
and deliver it {\to you }on a little satin pillow.

489
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:33,480
How's that?

490
00:38:34,424 --> 00:38:35,874
I waited this long.

491
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:38,201
Wait a little longer.

492
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,175
Hey, Vicky.

493
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:02,717
Yeah, Schrader.
Give me Merkert, will you?

494
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,857
You know, I say...

495
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:17,629
I say we just ram him.

496
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:19,096
All right?

497
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:24,095
We start her up

498
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,720
and just ram the shit
out of his truck.

499
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,920
We make our escape. Right?

500
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:38,181
He'd shoot me in the head.

501
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:42,374
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

502
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:44,832
So what do we do?

503
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,226
Please tell me

504
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:54,794
you got something.

505
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,660
I got something.

506
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:15,965
It's me.

507
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:18,695
We need your help.

508
00:40:43,054 --> 00:40:45,054
<i>Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

509
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:47,409
Yeah. Who's this?

510
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:51,012
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque Police.</i>

511
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:52,660
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

512
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:54,641
Yes, why?

513
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:58,320
<i>I'm sorry to inform you that your wife
has been in an automobile accident.</i>

514
00:40:58,445 --> 00:41:00,864
<i>She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center</i>

515
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:03,389
<i>and should be arriving there
shortly.</i>

516
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:06,933
How is she?
What's her condition?

517
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:08,058
<i>I don't...</i>

518
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,845
<i>have the most current information,
sir,</i>

519
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,526
<i>but I think you might want to get there
as soon as possible.</i>

520
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,019
You're going to have to start
paying me more.

521
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,579
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>
<i>I'd love to have some idea</i>

522
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,553
<i>of whether I should
cook dinner or not.</i>

523
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:23,047
Are you okay?

524
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:26,033
<i>Why?</i>

525
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:33,094
<i>What's up?</i>
