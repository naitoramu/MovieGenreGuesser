Abruzzi had some guy who was
already doing a life sentence

He's in.

495
00:34:55,116 --> 00:34:56,116
You're crazy!

496
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:01,149
Okay, after Lincoln,
we go alphabetically.

497
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:03,815
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on, A-bruzzi.

498
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:05,882
You want a seat
on the plane?

499
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,381
Line forms after me.

500
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,548
Got it.

501
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:22,782
Yeah.
Go, go, go.

502
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:31,515
Hey, Roy?

503
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:32,615
Yeah?

504
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:33,915
Did you see Pope leave?

505
00:35:33,982 --> 00:35:35,182
No.

506
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:36,849
No way he could
have walked by?

507
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:39,015
I haven't left my post
since I punched in.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Charles?

514
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:32,381
Charles.

515
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:34,548
You okay, old man?
No.

516
00:37:36,116 --> 00:37:38,982
Let's take a look.

517
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:49,015
It's just a few more steps.

518
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:50,248
You can make it.

519
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:54,116
Oh, I could make it another
foot, maybe two...

520
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:57,082
but why? I wasn't
going for me.

521
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,381
I was going
for my daughter.

522
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,049
And you can do that.

523
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:03,715
Will you promise me?

524
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,615
Yes, I promise.

525
00:38:06,682 --> 00:38:12,815
The money is buried
under a silo

526
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:14,381
at the Double K Ranch

527
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:17,782
just outside
of Tooele, Utah.

528
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:19,582
There's plenty

529
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,482
to split.

530
00:38:21,548 --> 00:38:23,949
The government
didn't want

531
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:24,949
any more embarrassment

532
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:26,749
after I took off
with the money.

533
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:29,615
So they lowballed it
to the papers.

534
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,515
The truth is, Michael,

535
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:35,082
it's not $1 million
under that silo.

536
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:40,182
There's $5 million there.

537
00:38:55,882 --> 00:38:58,882
You checked
the chow hall?

538
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,116
Yeah. Nothing.

539
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:03,782
Anybody try
his cell phone?

540
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:05,482
Oh.

541
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,281
Give Anna

542
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:11,749
her papa's love.

543
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:13,082
I will.

544
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:14,682
I will.

545
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:26,015
Here...

546
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:28,482
easy, easy.

548
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:45,648

00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:57,281

I have a code three

To the base.
Right now.

554
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:01,949
No, right now.
Sound the alarm.

555
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:15,949
Yo, bro, we got to go.

556

Go, Michael.

557
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,515
Go and don't look back.

558
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:29,182
No, no, no, no.
I better go last.
