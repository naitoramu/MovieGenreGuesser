1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,270
Factory break-in, that's what you said.
We should never have got into this, Tom.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,510
On the night of June 21st, a
general strike will be called

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,550
across the city.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,990
How do we know this foolish man
will hand over the diamonds

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,870
- when we're done?
- We don't, but that's another business.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,190
When this business is done,
it will all be over...

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,470
And afterwards you and Arthur
can begin your new life.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,550
So there's three cellars
underneath the house.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,070
There's a tunnel here that
runs from the house underneath

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,870
the river to an underground strong room.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,630
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room direct.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,620
I need to speak to you about the priest.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,950
I will shoot him myself, Tommy.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,200
I swear to God if my
son pulls the trigger...

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,760
I will bring this whole
organisation down around your ears.

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,310
Welcome to the opening of
the Grace Shelby Institute

17
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,160
for non-insured children of the poor.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,790
I would very much like you
to join me in thanking the man

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,590
that made the founding of this
establishment actually possible.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,780
Ladies and Gentlemen...

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
Mr Thomas Shelby.

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,310
SPEECH!

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Come on! Speech!

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,470
Say it, Tom!

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Say it, Tom!

26
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,470
I didn't come here today to make
a speech, but I will say this,

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,150
these children are now safe.

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,390
In our care, they will be safe

29
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,070
because we are from the same
cold streets as they are.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,190
And, in our care, they won't
be shipped away to the colonies,

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,030
or separated from kin,

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,480
or made to work for men
in their various ways.

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,110
They will grow up here, at home,

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,430
loved.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,480
In Birmingham.

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,150
Because this is our city.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,740
By order of the Peaky Blinders!

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,960
Now let us sing Immortal Invisible.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
You hear that, Grace?

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,390
The absence of my
invitation for this event

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,040
was obviously an oversight
on your part, Mr Shelby.

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,470
But look, I have the keys.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,870
I have allocated myself an office.

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,430
Just there, two doors in from the street.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,110
It's the one that already has the stove

46
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,830
and the crucifixion on the window.

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,790
Mr Shelby?

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,950
It is the one that has the
crucifixion on the window

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
in orange and red. That will be my office.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,880
And I will take them to St
Aloysius for confession.

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,430
You do understand that these keys

52
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,220
are part of our broader arrangement?

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,040
In the next 24 hours you will do
exactly as you have been instructed.

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,940
You'll not deviate. You'll not fail.

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,620
Come on, little fellas!

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,190
Slow down.

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,070
The, er...

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,150
The Lord Mayor would like
you to come and eat cake

59
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,140
and drink some tea.

60
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,500
Tommy says mingle and smile.

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,750
- It must be the trains.
- No Ruben?

62
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,790
Do you know any other guests
from London not turned up?

63
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,870
Some, I think, yeah.

64
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,110
Pol, I'm paid by the company now
so I have to talk to other people.

65
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,590
So you have moved from horses to
automobiles in just four years!

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,110
When you ship to New York,
you paying a higher dock duty.

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,350
You should consider coming
with us through Boston.

68
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,230
I just spoke to Johnny Dogs. He
said the tunnel's hit heavy clay.

69
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,910
- It's slowing him down.
- How long?

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,510
Two days before they hit the wall.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,390
Tell him to dig a sink
hole to drain the clay.

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,830
He asked if you could go down
and have a look yourself, Tom.

73
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,750
- I told him wild horses
wouldn't get you down. - Mm.

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,790
Mr Shelby, I would just like to say
that I wish I'd met your dear wife

75
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,470
before she was taken from us and I
would like to allocate an hour a day

76
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,950
of each of my lady's time to make
winter clothes for the little ones.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,590
Speak to my secretary, Miss
Stark, in the grey hat.

78
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,950
She knows my diary.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,590
Fuck me, Tom, I don't know
how you do it. Incoming!

80
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,710
- Mr Shelby?
- Yes!

81
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,390
Oh! Your little boy
looks so much like you.

82
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,710
Yes. He's a little rascal, isn't he?!

83
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,150
Mr Shelby, would it be too
inconvenient to steal you for a moment?

84
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,670
No. No. No inconvenience at all.

85
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,150
Tommy, I'm sorry. He wants you.

86
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,430
Aw! Come here, Charlie. Oh, little boy!

87
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,510
So lovely to see a man willing
to hold his child in public.

88
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,110
From the members of Moseley
War Widows' Institute...

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,790
made by Mr Winslow himself
of Winslow Castings.

90
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,310
Look at that!

91
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,950
From a photograph of your
horse that ran at the Derby.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,790
Oh, that is very kind.
Thank you very much.

93
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,510
- Grace's Secret.
- Thank you very much.

94
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,670
Would you mind holding it for us

95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,820
so we can have a
photograph for the gazette?

96
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Thank you very much.

97
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,780
- Thank you, Mr Shelby.
- Not at all. - Thank you.

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,510
Thank you for your time, ladies.
Thank you. Thank you for your time.

99
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,030
Thank you.

100
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,990
Where's Charles, Ada?

101
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,630
- I gave him to you. - Where
is he? - I don't know.

102
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,470
Boys!

103
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,790
Have you seen Charlie?

104
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,830
Ain't seen him.

105
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,470
Hold on, he's playing, ain't he?!

106
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,630
Pol, where's Charles?

107
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,830
- Lizzie, where's Charlie?
- I don't know.

108
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,950
Where is he?

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,230
Back door. Kitchen.

110
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,910
Get to Blake Street where the cars are.

111
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,790
Tommy, someone said they saw a nurse
take him through the back door.

112
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,580
- Fuck! - Which? - I don't know. Go!

113
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,030
- Arthur!
- What?

114
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,350
Somebody saw a woman and
a kid getting into a car.

115
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,870
Ah, fuck!

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,840
CHARLIE!

117
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,470
CHARLIE!

118
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,710
Charlie!

119
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,030
John!

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,510
- Where is he?
- John!

121
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,750
- Arthur! - Go find Moss!
- Arthur, where is he?

122
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,710
- Junctions, block them all off.
- WHERE IS HE?

123
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,670
- Tell me.
- Someone took him.

124
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,150
All right...

125
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,390
Listen to me. They put him in a car.

126
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,350
They put him in a car. They drove south.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,350
We've got road blocks and spotters.

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,270
- I'll set up shop. I'll
put every man... - Yeah.

129
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,230
.. on the junctions
between here and Maypole.

130
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,550
- Yeah. - Right? - You do that.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,270
You've got to go to the office.

132
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,110
- You've got to sit by the phone.
- Do that.

133
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,590
Whoever took him's going to call.

134
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,910
Polly!

135
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,350
Let's go, Pol. Stay by that phone.
Me and John will cover the roads.

136
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,270
I need Michael at the Maypole junction.

137
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
We need Moss to block all the roads south.

138
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,710
Get me Moss.

139
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,300
Gone where?

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,150
- Tommy.
- It's them.

141
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,910
- Who?
- It's fucking them.

142
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,910
Look, it might just be some random
woman. Sometimes women go mad...

143
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,070
No, it's them.

144
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,260
Did you break the phone?

145
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,470
You broke the phone.

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,230
It's all right, we've got another phone.

147
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
- Tommy?
- Ada?

148
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,230
There's someone outside. A priest.

149
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,360
Stay here, Pol. Stay
here. Don't do anything.

150
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,880
We have your son.

151
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,260
Get in the car.

152
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,630
First...

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,110
Is he safe?

154
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,230
Of course he's safe.

155
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,620
All children are dear to me.

156
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,510
You have all the cards.

157
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,070
Tell me what you want me to
do and I will certainly do it.

158
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,110
You ever drive one of these beasts?

159
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,590
I am asking you to conduct business.

160
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,190
I borrowed it.

161
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,230
Lent it by a Lord...

162
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,830
for the duration of this business.

163
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,790
I will certainly do what you
need me to do with no complaint.

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
We were forced into
doing this awful thing.

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,590
We did warn you that your
son would be in danger

166
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,110
if you deviated from the plan.

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,390
- It was you who made a mistake,
you understand that? - Yes.

168
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,950
What mistake did you
make? Do you even know?

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,540
Tell me what you want me to do.

170
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,990
- You made a deal with our enemies.
- I will do what needs to be done.

171
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,510
You went behind our backs

172
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
to stop the Soviets from
blowing up the train.

173
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,990
But it's all right. It's all right.

174
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
We've rectified your mistake.

175
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,670
You ask me, "What do I need to do?"

176
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, here is what you need to
do you fucking mongrel, ya...

177
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,230
Since the Bolsheviks will
not be blowing up the train,

178
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,950
you'll blow up the train yourself.

179
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,270
It has always been about the explosion.

180
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,430
From the beginning.

181
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,070
The bang. The outrage.

182
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,660
Understand?

183
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,710
Those are notes and fragments for
you to scatter in the wreckage

184
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,430
implicating named officials
from the Soviet embassy.

185
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,630
- I will scatter them.
It will be done. - Good.

186
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,230
Our friends at the Times and
the Daily Mail will do the rest.

187
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,710
And once the British Government
cuts diplomatic relations

188
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,320
with the Soviet Union, that
will be our mission accomplished.

189
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,320
You'll have been part of a fine adventure.

190
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,870
To help with the outrage we need
people to die in the explosion.

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,390
How many?

192
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
Let's say... six.

193
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Rail workers perhaps
or men from the factory.

194
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,680
Then I want my son returned to me
within an hour of the explosion.

195
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,830
Oh, it's conditions now, is it?

196
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,870
We need to fix the hand over in advance.

197
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I haven't finished with
you yet, Mr Shelby.

198
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,320
We also hear you're digging a tunnel.

199
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,560
Mining for precious stones
under Wilderness House.

200
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,550
I'm told they have a
Faberge in the strong room.

201
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
The Lilies of the Valley egg made in 1898.

202
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,470
One of the Odd Fellows has a wife
who is obsessed with Faberge.

203
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,240
- He wants to give her the egg for her birthday.
- Then he will have it.

204
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,430
And the Economic League will take
all of the jewels that you steal

205
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,150
to cover our considerable expenses.

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,670
The fight against Communism
is not cheap, you know.

207
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,910
- So if you want to see your...
- I will give you all the jewels.

208
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,560
A bang first.

209
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,670
Then bring everything you have
stolen to your office at dawn.

210
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,070
No.

211
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,030
No, I'll not be able to get
the jewels to you by dawn.

212
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,190
The tunnel has hit clay.

213
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,990
If the St Andrew's clock strikes
5am on the night of the robbery

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,510
and we don't have everything we ask for,

215
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,430
the bell will be tolling for your boy.

216
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,590
Now get out of my fucking car.

217
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,430
- Where's Linda?
- With Esme.

218
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,150
Esme's waters broke. I was just with her.

219
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,230
- Running around fucking broke
her waters. - Where's Finn?

220
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,510
Out with the young 'uns
looking for the Riley.

221
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,590
We couldn't reach him.

222
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,070
I need to know who spoke.

223
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,670
Our enemies know everything. Everything.

224
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,830
I need to know who spoke about
business outside the family.

225
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,350
I need to know who spoke
and who they spoke to. Now.

226
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,430
Tommy, listen.

227
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,350
Your wife, Arthur?

228
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,230
I am going to tell
myself that you're, er...

229
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,790
you're not thinking straight.

230
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,910
Your mind is not clear.

231
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,710
Or Esme getting cash
for cocaine, eh, John?

232
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,750
Fuck!

233
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,630
All of a sudden, back
in the family, Ada. Eh?

234
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,710
That's a surprise. Out of
the blue. On whose orders?

235
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,510
Tommy, this is not helping find him.

236
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,750
And you and your painter.

237
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,230
He said he knows you.

238
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,590
Things developed.

239
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,350
You talked.

240
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,190
If anyone has talked about
the tunnel to anyone else,

241
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,550
I need to know, and I
need to know this second.

242
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,070
- What about your clay kickers?
- Hmm.

243
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,470
Drunk in a pub.

244
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,710
- I trust those men with my life...
- More than you trust us.

245
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,590
Yeah. As of an hour ago, yes.

246
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,750
Where is Michael in this
fucking line-up anyway?

247
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,390
- You leave Michael out of this...
- Yeah? - No, he should be here.

248
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,710
I don't even fucking know him.

249
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,230
How long have you fucking
known him? Fucking three years.

250
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,950
- He's not your whipping boy.
- I don't even fucking know the boy.

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,040
I never told Michael about
the Lilies of the Valley.

252
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,680
The only people I told about the
Faberge eggs are in this room.

253
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,840
Tommy, I want you to know
I came back for love...

254
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
.. and common sense.

255
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,670
And Esme's got no need for extra cash.

256
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,500
You bring my wife into this.

257
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Means we speak when this business is done.

258
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,710
John, Arthur,

259
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,230
I need 50 sticks of BSA dynamite,

260
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,190
300 yards of cable

261
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,110
and six detonators by midday tomorrow.

262
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,870
This is evidence, I
need you to scatter it.

263
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,420
We're blowing up a train,
people are going to die.

264
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,360
Ruben and I talked about many things.

265
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,900
But not that. Not ever.

266
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,310
Tommy. I'm sorry I'm late.
We looked everywhere.

267
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,070
All the way to Hay Mills. So, nothing.

268
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,750
Put four cans of petrol in the
boot of my car and bring it round.

269
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,230
Put cigarettes and a lamp in the box.

270
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,750
And fetch Michael. I need him.

271
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,630
Ada told me he gave you red wine.

272
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,030
I imagine you can't remember
half what you talked about.

273
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,820
He was never interested in business.

274
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,440
He came to you at my wedding.

275
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,100
He pursued you, sought you out.

276
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,080
Why would an educated man of his
standing do something like that?

277
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,990
You mean, to a woman like me?

278
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,240
Yes.

279
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,920
I've done the odds on all
of you. Evens it's him.

280
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,800
There's another possibility.
But evens, it's him.

281
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,680
Bloody hell.

282
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,550
I asked you to come alone and unarmed.

283
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,150
Yeah, well, alone I ain't
never going to do, am I?

284
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,110
As for the cane, don't worry about it.

285
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,590
That's just me sciatica.

286
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,110
It always plays up around the
winter and the summer solstice.

287
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,870
What have you got for me, Alfie?

288
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,510
What you bring me out here for?

289
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,070
It's on the way to somewhere
I need to be in a hurry.

290
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,670
What have you got for me?

291
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,990
Well, seeing as you was prepared
to pay such an exorbitant amount

292
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,630
for this information, I decided
to give you value for money.

293
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,390
So, here are the names
of all the men in England

294
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,550
whom I would approach, right,
if I had a Faberge egg for sale.

295
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,150
Here you go.

296
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,230
And then, here is all the
men on that list, you know,

297
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,190
who would buy the old Faberge egg

298
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,710
even if they knew that
that item was stolen.

299
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,510
Yeah?

300
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,270
Then came your curious
fucking gyppo question.

301
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,910
I won't ask, but, um...

302
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,550
Here's a list of the men
who would buy a Faberge

303
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,270
because of their wives' obsession.

304
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,990
Oh, yes. Thank you, Mr Shelby.

305
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,580
Lovely doing business with you.

306
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,070
- You left a name off the
list, Alfie. - Did I? - Yeah.

307
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,670
I've already spoken to my
people in the jewellery quarter,

308
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,720
experienced dealers.

309
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,830
They tell me there are
only three men in Britain

310
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,070
whose wives are obsessed with Faberge --

311
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,630
makes them good customers.

312
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,350
- But you missed the richest one
off the list. - Yeah, well...

313
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,710
If you knew already,
how come you dragged me

314
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,910
- all the way out in the fucking
oggin, mate? - Two reasons.

315
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,430
Reason one.

316
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,870
By withholding a name that
you most certainly know...

317
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,470
you have proven to me that you have
done a deal with the Odd Fellows.

318
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,430
It was you who told them about the tunnel.

319
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,560
You who told them about the
fucking deal with the Soviets.

320
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,510
Reason two.

321
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,550
The name of the man you're
withholding must be my enemy

322
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,870
otherwise you wouldn't be protecting him.

323
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,710
He's now a man I can use.

324
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,230
Listen, sweetie, you can't take a man...

325
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,830
You gave information

326
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,470
in exchange for a share...

327
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,950
Tommy, there were things in that treasury

328
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,990
that God himself, he
spoke to me, and he said,

329
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,230
"Alfie, you were meant
to have these things."

330
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,830
- You crossed the line, Alfie.
- You fucking what?

331
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,790
- You crossed the line.
- "The line"?

332
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
They're using my boy!

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,470
Did you fucking know?

334
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,550
Yeah, I knew, you know?

335
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,440
But damned as I am, it made no
fucking difference to me, mate.

336
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,950
Fucking hell, Tommy!

337
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,150
Oh, for crying out loud...!
What the fuck is going on?

338
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,990
What is the matter with you, Tommy, eh?

339
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,110
- Eh? You gone fucking angry, ain't you.
- I got fucking angry...!

340
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,590
It's in your fucking head, mate!

341
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,230
This bastard deserves it!

342
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,950
It's in your fucking head, mate!

343
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,990
I know this bastard deserves it!

344
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,070
I fucking know.

345
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,510
But if you kill him now, the
truce with the London outfits

346
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,430
- will be blown to fucking pieces, all right?
- Michael... Michael...

347
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't worry about that truce,
kid, right, because it fell apart.

348
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,150
You've got nothing to worry about

349
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,190
when it comes to the
old, scary London boys.

350
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,230
Which fucking side are you on, Alfie?!

351
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
I don't give a fuck right now, kid! Right?

352
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,320
I do not want him to "spare" me
because of some fucking peace pact!

353
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,030
I want him to acknowledge that
his anger is un-fucking-justified!

354
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,390
I want him to acknowledge

355
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,550
that he who fights by the sword,

356
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,590
he fucking dies by it, Tommy.

357
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,430
So, what, they took
your boy, did they, yeah?

358
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,350
They've got your boy?

359
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,100
And what fucking line am I
supposed to have crossed?!

360
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,510
How many fathers, right?

361
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,430
How many sons, yeah, have
you cut, killed, murdered?

362
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,670
Fucking butchered -- innocent and guilty.

363
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,920
Just sent them straight to fucking
hell, ain't ya?! Just like me!

364
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,510
You fucking stand there...

365
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,870
You judging me?!

366
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,240
Stand there and talk to me about
crossing some FUCKING LINE?!

367
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,630
If you pull that trigger, right,

368
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,070
you pull that trigger for a
fucking honourable reason.

369
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,350
Like an honourable man, not
like some fucking civilian

370
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,390
that does not understand

371
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,110
the wicked way of our world, mate.

372
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,870
Look, Tommy,

373
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,520
the killing of Alfie Solomons
is not going to help.

374
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,740
It'll be very bad for business.

375
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Michael...

376
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,990
Go and call Inspector Moss.

377
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Tell him it's Palmer.

378
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Well said, Alfie.

379
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,550
Well said.

380
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,240
- I did not know about
your boy, though. - I know.

381
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,160
I saw.

382
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,790
Hello?

383
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Good Lord...

384
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,040
Polly...

385
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Why didn't you come?

386
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,790
I was going to get on the
train last night, but then I...

387
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,120
I realised I simply wasn't
ready to enter your world.

388
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,590
- Good God, I'm shaking...
- Good.

389
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,680
But now, I am ready. I have
been searching all night for you.

390
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,700
Polly, whatever you've
been told, it's not true.

391
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,540
The painting was wrong.

392
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,460
She was too sure of herself.

393
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,640
And I'm not.

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,740
Not any more...

395
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
I can paint another.

396
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,560
Oh, Polly...

397
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,630
(Oh, Polly...)

398
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,880
What the fuck am I doing?

399
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,750
I want a dull life.

400
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,510
I want you. I want you.

401
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,830
I want you.

402
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,920
I want you to paint me in a
dress that I bought in a shop.

403
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,860
We have a life?

404
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,140
I think so.

405
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,880
Hello?

406
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,430
I demand to see my solicitor! I
have a right to have him here!

407
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,760
Gilbert Palmer, I want to talk
to you about a missing kid.

408
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,350
We are Peaky Blinders.

409
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,590
Where is he?

410
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,270
Deep breath.

411
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
Where is he?

412
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,470
- Johnny!
- Tommy?

413
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,350
What the fuck are you doing here, Tommy?

414
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,150
They've taken my boy, Johnny.
Everything's fucking changed.

415
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,590
I have to get the hole dug
before midnight or he's gone.

416
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,910
Do you hear me?

417
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,390
Are you not going after Charles yourself?

418
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,780
Tommy?!

419
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,600
I was, um...

420
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,360
This morning, I was on
the road with Tommy.

421
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,380
I killed a man.

422
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,870
He needed cover. I was all he had.

423
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,120
So, what did he give you?

424
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,190
He said it was good for close range.

425
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,550
You're better with my Smith & Wesson.

426
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,800
No, no. This is mine now.

427
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,390
Feels part of me hand.

428
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Where'd you hit him?

429
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,830
I hit him in the side of the head.

430
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,670
How was you when he went down?

431
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,060
Tommy said I did all right.

432
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,580
This is where we think
Charles is being held.

433
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,630
They're not expecting nobody,

434
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,600
so... he should be alone.

435
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,860
There's two good men there.

436
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
You do what they say.

437
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,000
But I fire the bullet, all right?

438
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,710
Yes, you can be there.

439
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,230
But it's better if they do it.

440
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,140
See, these are experienced men, Michael.

441
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,590
When you're sure the kid's safe...

442
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,310
.. you call Finn.

443
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,830
All right.

444
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,110
Come on, boys.

445
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,680
Ah, hello there.

446
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,480
There you go. How's that?

447
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,670
You'd like a spoon, a shiny spoon?

448
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,520
Do you want to hold the spoon, there?

449
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,510
All out, boys!

450
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,590
Wildcat strike!

451
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,360
This locomotive...

452
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,880
.. couples in 15 minutes.

453
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,620
If we do not hear word by ten o'clock...

454
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,240
.. we blow it up.

455
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
There's men on board, Arthur.

456
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,270
Yeah.

457
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,590
Six men on board, Charlie.

458
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,910
Driver,

459
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,640
stoker...

460
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,710
Four men I hand-picked meself.

461
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,040
Me and John picked those men.

462
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,600
So, it's me and John who pull the switch.

463
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,580
The rest of you men can go home.

464
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,910
Tommy! Tommy!

465
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,830
He's got the shakes, help me with him.

466
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,630
Get him out. Get him out!

467
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,350
OK. Bringing him through.

468
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
We need to move! Now!

469
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,310
You wait here.

470
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
I'll do the killing.

471
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,860
That's a fucking order.

472
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,990
You move too fast, Thomas!

473
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,030
We need more timber!

474
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,590
Make it safe. I'll go on.

475
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,910
Thomas, it's too fucking wet! It's sludge!

476
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,700
Make it fucking safe and I'll go on!

477
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,420
OK.

478
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,110
What do you think you're doing, boy?

479
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,390
Please, don't...

480
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,550
Please don't shoot...

481
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,790
Please, don't shoot.

482
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,640
Please, don't. Please...

483
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,030
You rat!

484
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,750
What do you think you're doing, eh?

485
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,900
Do you know who you're
fucking messing with?!

486
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,630
We don't have much time.

487
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,710
I'll take the fucking
life from ya, will I?

488
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,750
Let's go!

489
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,660
You're a gypsy bastard.

490
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,790
Who wants to be in heaven, eh?

491
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,750
Who want to be in heaven when you
can be sending men to fucking hell?

492
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,640
Hey...

493
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,390
I'll do it, Arthur.

494
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,990
Eh?

495
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,150
I'll do it.

496
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,340
No!

497
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,870
- I will take him.
- NO!

498
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,030
This bastard's mine!

499
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,680
Go call Finn!

500
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,060
I told Tommy I'll do it.

501
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,350
So, I'll do it.

502
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,710
Arthur, wait!

503
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,500
Charlie's safe!

504
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,260
It's all right.

505
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Let me speak to him.

506
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,170
Hello, Charlie?

507
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,670
Hello, Charlie.

508
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,520
Can you hear me?

509
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,920
Yeah.

510
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,510
Yeah, you go to bed.

511
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,030
Good boy.

512
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,120
Where the hell have you been?

513
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,320
I've been out in Maypole.

514
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,430
There's been some trouble.

515
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,400
I can't stay.

516
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,460
You can't stay?

517
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Tommy needs my help.

518
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,910
Family business.

519
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,990
- No, no... Please...
- I'm sorry.

520
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,560
Please...

521
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,220
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

522
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,910
Mr Shelby, this is Monsieur Silk.

523
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,230
He's here on behalf of
the Parisian buyers.

524
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,680
He needs to verify the value.

525
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,240
It was a pleasure doing business
with you these past few months.

526
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,980
You would never steal from
your family, would you?

527
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,390
The collection was
mostly my mother's anyway.

528
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,470
It is more mine than theirs.

529
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,110
And they would never have sold it.

530
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,000
- They would have wasted it on a lost cause.
- You needed a tunnel.

531
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,390
I need your signature
to make this sale legal.

532
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,950
Confirmed.

533
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,600
The original Duke Alexander
Petrovich's collection.

534
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,310
To raise a legal bill of sale
and get this across the border,

535
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,350
I need authorisation signed by yourself

536
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,670
in the family name in my presence.

537
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,070
As we agreed. Half for the tunnel.

538
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,260
Half for the signature.

539
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,270
Where will you go?

540
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,660
Vienna.

541
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,560
There's a man waiting for me.

542
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,470
Poor man(!).

543
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,310
You?

544
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,960
Birmingham.

545
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm going to buy a racehorse.

546
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Have it trained.

547
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,280
Also...£5,000 for the sex.

548
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,680
And five for helping you through
the grief of losing your wife.

549
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,380
You didn't even come close.

550
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,300
The... papers are in order.

551
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,350
Now I just need your
signature for the provenance.

552
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,670
Of course. I have a pen...

553
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,460
At home, these jewels saw way worse.

554
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,220
That's why they are all cursed.

555
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,790
As are we...

556
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,440
Mr Shelby.

557
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,840
If you're ever in Vienna, look me up.

558
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,110
Yes, yes!

559
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,560
Before I begin...

560
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,140
.. I want you to let you
know I made a mistake.

561
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,300
I made a mistake...

562
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,280
.. and I want to apologise to all of you.

563
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,790
Arthur,

564
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,960
you warned me against getting
involved in Russian business...

565
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,070
.. and you were right.

566
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,400
Hm.

567
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,630
I doubted your wife.

568
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,680
For that, I'm sorry.

569
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,480
Linda, I've added 3,000 here
in the hope you will forgive me.

570
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,960
Apology accepted.

571
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,670
Esme, I doubted you, as well.

572
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,670
Now, John's got innocent
lives on his conscience.

573
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,510
- Ordinary working men...
- Yeah, all right, Esme. Got it...

574
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,830
No, she's right.

575
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,880
And you and Arthur are going
to have to share that burden.

576
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,430
But, I hope the house that
you could buy with this

577
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,620
can become a place of...

578
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,360
.. contemplation.

579
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,020
Perhaps redemption.

580
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,470
Charlie, for lost tools dangerous goods

581
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,310
and Curly's wise words.

582
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,920
Johnny, for board and lodgings.

583
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,600
Lizzie...

584
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,160
Michael.

585
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,040
For the killings.

586
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,910
Five for cutting and five for shooting.

587
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,710
- No, Tommy, no...
- What?!

588
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,670
Tell me, eh?

589
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,520
This is who I am!

590
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,190
And this is all I can give
you for what you give me.

591
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,880
For your hearts and your souls.

592
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,480
Yesterday, I nearly lost my son.

593
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,510
You should fucking understand that.

594
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,790
For what?

595
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,510
For what? For this?

596
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,160
For this...?!

597
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,630
And I know that you all want
me to say that I'll change,

598
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,590
that this fucking business will change.

599
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,870
But I've learnt something
in the last few days.

600
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,280
Those bastards. Those BASTARDS...

601
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,110
.. are worse than us.

602
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,830
Politicians, fucking judges,

603
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,790
lords and ladies. They're WORSE than us,

604
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,310
and they will never admit
us to their palaces,

605
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,160
no matter how legitimate we become...

606
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,670
.. because of who we are.

607
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,750
Because of who we fucking are,
because of where we're fucking from.

608
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,190
Isn't that right, Ada?

609
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,160
Our Ada knows.

610
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,030
She got smart about revolution.

611
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,400
And she knows you have to get
what you want your own way.

612
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,750
Lizzie, I want it known, that money

613
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,800
was for you because, some
nights, it was you...

614
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,280
.. who stopped my heart
from breaking. No-one else.

615
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,620
And the rest of you, you
took the King's shilling.

616
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,560
You took the King's fucking shilling.

617
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,310
When you take the King's shilling,

618
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,760
the King expects you to kill.

619
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,110
Right, Arthur?

620
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,430
Yeah.

621
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,000
That's how it works, right, John?

622
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,680
That's right.

623
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,040
That's right, Pol.

624
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,360
That's fucking right.

625
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,280
Tommy...

626
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,990
You've had a bad time.

627
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,270
We understand.

628
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,080
So, at an alternative time...

629
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,340
.. when we have all recovered...

630
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,750
.. I would like

631
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,870
to put before the family

632
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,080
an alternative view...

633
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,240
.. of the future of the
Shelby Company Limited.

634
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,800
A more hopeful view.

635
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,030
Which I, for one, would
quite like to hear.

636
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,230
As would I.

637
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,520
As would I.

638
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,230
Come on, Arthur.

639
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,380
The train for the dock
leaves in one hour...

640
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,110
.. then we'll get the boat to New York

641
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,560
and it'll all be in the past.

642
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,400
I'll be off, then, Tom.

643
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,920
I'll see you, eh?

644
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,310
I'll see you, brother.

645
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,160
Bye, Curly.

646
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,110
You can go, but you won't get far, Arthur.

647
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,750
Ah...

648
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,430
All right, Tom.

649
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,820
I spoke to Moss last night.

650
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,150
He told me that the Chief
Constable of Birmingham

651
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,470
has issued a warrant for your arrest.

652
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,990
Murder,

653
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,470
sedition,

654
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,990
conspiracy to cause explosion.

655
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,110
John, they're coming for you, as well.

656
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,830
Murder.

657
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,310
Conspiracy to cause explosion.

658
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,390
- Michael...
- What the fuck?

659
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,630
.. the murder of Hughes.

660
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,080
Polly...

661
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,910
Wait a minute, what the
fuck are you talking ab...?

662
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,350
.. the murder of Chief
Inspector Chester Campbell.

663
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,310
- Why didn't you fucking tell us? - The people
we betrayed last night want to bring us down...

664
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,230
They control the police,
they control the judges,

665
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,310
they control the juries,
they control the jails.

666
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,670
But they do not control
the elected Government.

667
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,590
- Listen to me!
- Why didn't you tell us before?!

668
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,430
- You're my brother!
- Listen to me...

669
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,230
So, I've made a deal...

670
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,870
- They'll hang us! - .. in return
for giving evidence against them.

671
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,070
- We'll fucking hang!
- It's all taken care of.

672
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,910
Lizzie, collect up the money
and bring it to the cellar.

673
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,150
You will all get your money in due course.

674
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,790
When the police get in, do not resist.

675
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,910
- You go with them, you do
not say anything... - Arthur!

676
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,550
Arthur, I've made a deal

677
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,070
- with people even more powerful
than our enemies. - Arthur!

678
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,550
Trust me, Brother.

679
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,740
Eh?

680
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,950
Trust me?

681
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,390
- Linda! Linda...
- You did this deliberately!

682
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,550
You made this happen to keep us!

683
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,910
Come here. Come here.

684
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,470
All I know, we run.

685
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,260
We have to run.

686
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,390
