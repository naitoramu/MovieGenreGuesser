1
00:00:00,803 --> 00:00:02,153
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:04,021
We're through the hard part.

3
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:06,050
Another 18 inches,
we'll hit that pipe.

4
00:00:06,188 --> 00:00:07,661
We'll be there by Friday.

5
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:14,947
Now we got a hell of a lot
to talk about, don't we?

6
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:18,804
This guy says he's
on the job in here.

7
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:21,118
Concrete is my specialty.

8
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,521
Okay, boss, sign him up.

9
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,469
Whites don't want you,
blacks don't want you.

10
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:31,320
You're just caught in the middle,
aren't you? A regular 'tweener.

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,121
- Hello.
- It's me.

12
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:35,068
- It's time.
- Yes.

13
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,725
Why are you so cynical?

14
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:39,307
Michael, I think there's cynicism
and then there's realism.

15
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,910
There's optimism, hope, faith.

16
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,620
Thank you for trying to make me smile--
not today.

17
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,607
You never know.

18
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:53,233
You want the Cooper story? I can't
give it to you, 'cause I'm not him.

19
00:00:53,326 --> 00:00:56,008
The lawyers you tried to blow up,
they're still running around.

20
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,382
Same thing goes with the kid.

21
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:59,512
You got to hand the
reins over to me, now.

22
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,390
First of all... Ow!

23
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,010
You and your partner are off
the job until further notice.

24
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:50,616
That one.

25
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:52,658
- Nice choice.
- Thanks.

26
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:53,887
Platinum.

27
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,304
Brushed.

28
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:58,394
- Six point two five?
- Six point two five.

29
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,428
She's a lucky woman.

30
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:05,125
Yes. She is.

31
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,826
You kept it.

32
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:13,473
Kept what?

33
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,173
The flower.

34
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:18,588
I'm a pack rat,
I never throw anything out.

35
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:22,735
Yeah, all this clutter,
it's, uh... overwhelming.

36
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:24,119
You should see my apartment.

37
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:27,151
Haven't even had
our first date yet,

38
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:29,526
and already you're
inviting me in.

39
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:31,560
Thought you were a nice girl.

40
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:34,749
Oh, Michael,
we all know nice girls finish last.

41
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:38,298
So where do you finish?

42
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:41,467
That depends on where I start.
Deep breath.

43
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,150
Exhale.

44
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,211
Inhale.

45
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:58,093
Sara, we're backing
up out here.

46
00:02:58,607 --> 00:02:59,696
Right. I'm sorry.

47
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,386
I'm going to get your shot.

48
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,354
This is not what
I signed on for.

49
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,051
What do you want us to do? Want us to
wave the white flag? Call a time out?

50
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,856
I just want to get
Lincoln off death row.

51
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:50,640
Lincoln?

52
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:53,728
We just learned that Vice President
Reynolds funneled millions of dollars

53
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:55,771
in research grants into
her brother's company.

54
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,244
That money was filtered into
millions of small accounts,

55
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,719
that made millions of small
donations to her campaign,

56
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:03,237
setting her up to be the next
leader of the free world.

57
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:06,604
This doesn't end with us
stopping an execution anymore.

58
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,311
For me, it does.

59
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,504
Okay. Let's rotate.

60
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,959
Sergeant Sodomy,
you're up next.

61
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:37,160
Yo.

62
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,584
Come on.

63
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:42,653
I don't know about you all,
but, uh...

64
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,958
this room is getting a little
too dark for me to dig.

65
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:53,027
You telling me that there's a hole in
Fox River that you don't want to
get into?

66
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,024
What?

67
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,011
Hey, no one gets hurt.

68
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,604
You know, I got a question.

69
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:05,061
How come Fusilli over here
ain't grabbing a shovel?

70
00:05:05,154 --> 00:05:07,343
I'm handling arrangements
on the outside.

71
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,671
Really? So what is
that transpo? Paper?

72
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,905
Exactly. That makes
me management.

73
00:05:12,098 --> 00:05:13,878
And that makes us just labor.

74
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,019
Mm-hmm. Now you're getting it.

75
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:22,365
You know, management better keep a
close eye on the conditions up in here.

76
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,008
Or the labor's liable to go on strike.
You feel me?

77
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,259
Get back to work.

78
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,300
Whoa, whoa. CO's coming.

79
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:41,966
Put that back up there.

80
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,561
Scofield.

81
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,933
Move it.

82
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:49,679
It's time for your conjugal.

83
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,444
Your wife is here.

84
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,510
So you're Mrs. Scofield.

85
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,278
You ever done this before?

86
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,734
Had a conjugal, I mean.

87
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:42,142
No.

88
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:45,323
Don't worry,
I'm just trying to make conversation.

89
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:49,480
Clear.

90
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,088
She look familiar to you?

91
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,987
Mm. No, Captain.

92
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,128
I know her from somewhere.

93
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:10,949
You came.

94
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:12,890
Of course.

95
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:15,236
How have you been?

96
00:07:15,655 --> 00:07:18,703
Fine. I found a job.

97
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,363
Good. I'm glad.

98
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:25,000
Is it awful being here?

99
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,839
Remember the first
place you stayed?

100
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,844
That hotel by the airport?

101
00:07:30,956 --> 00:07:34,484
Only  difference is $69
and the free shampoo.

102
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,417
Always the brave face.

103
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:40,950
You're still wearing it.

104
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,743
Every day.

105
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,200
I worry about you.

106
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:46,698
Don't.

107
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:50,415
Is there anything
else that I can do?

108
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,788
Just what we agreed on.

109
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:56,934
I  was so nervous when
they were checking.

110
00:07:58,674 --> 00:07:59,657
One question.

111
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,629
Why would you need a
credit card in prison?

112
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,651
See, I don't think the
riot changed anything.

113
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,372
Have you seen the latest
budget cuts for this place?

114
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,079
Another ten percent
from health care.

115
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:12,572
35% from prevention.

116
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,820
He might be the governor,
but he's also your father.

117
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,650
Maybe he thinks if he cuts
enough they can't afford you.

118
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:35,529
You understand this is standard
procedure following a
conjugal, Scofield?

119
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:37,424
Never can be too careful.

120
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:40,181
All right, bend over.

121
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:45,110
You have a good time in the
romper room with that Euro?

122
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:47,084
Whatever you say, boss.

123
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,820
She come around here before?

124
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,863
- First time.
- You sure?

125
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:55,052
'Cause damn if I don't
recognize her from somewhere.

126
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:58,034
Maybe she visits
some other con.

127
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,506
Killing two birds
with one bone.

128
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,276
- Catching my drift?
- I wouldn't know.

129
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,343
All right. He's clear, Captain.

130
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,481
Make sure you take
a shower, Scofield.

131
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:11,348
You never know what some
women can give you.

132
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,380
Swing low

133
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,984
Sweet chariot

134
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:23,433
Coming for to carry me home

135
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,795
Swing low

136
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:27,694
You know this one, don't you?

137
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,941
Sweet chariot

138
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,267
Coming for to carry me home.

139
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,777
Come on, give me something.

140
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:37,763
I thought you was
the musical people.

141
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,848
You know,
parents must be so proud of you, man.

142
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:44,320
I mean,
hitting the trailer park trifecta.

143
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,555
Racist... pedophile,

144
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,271
and stupid.

145
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:52,268
You know, it vexes me that...

146
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:55,235
that I'm made out to be
the bad guy in the room.

147
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,061
It's not like y'all are incarcerated
for stealing Girl Scout cookies.

148
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:01,472
None of us murdered any
Girl Scouts in the process.

149
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:04,364
Michael's coming back
from the bone yard.

150
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:06,683
Alone... alone.

151
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:14,827
I tell you everything
about me and Maricruz,

152
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,340
and you can't even tell
me you're married?

153
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,389
Later.

154
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,869
Rough day, huh, Scofield?

155
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,576
While the rest of us are
in here slinging concrete,

156
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,099
you got some little girl to play
on your rusty trombone, huh?

157
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:31,883
The man's got a point.

158
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,316
Just doesn't seem equitable-like.
You know what I'm saying?

159
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:35,806
Shut up and dig, T-Bag.

160
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:39,522
I think what the idiots inside
here wants to know is...

161
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,281
while we're digging this hole...
what are you doing?

162
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:49,273
I'm  going shopping.

163
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:52,462
We're good.

164
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:55,838
All clear.

165
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:00,299
A credit card?

166
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,802
The bulls catch you with that, they'll
be so far up your doggy door, you'll...

167
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:05,147
Don't worry.

168
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:07,380
They won't be
catching me with one.

169
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:10,052
- How you so sure?
- Because...

170
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:12,684
I don't have a credit card.

171
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:58,350
Nick?

172
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:01,181
Help! Please!

173
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,184
I had an accident...
my car... is totaled.

174
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:10,483
I just need... please...
is anyone in there?

175
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,167
We can't just ignore him.

176
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,879
The hell we can't.

177
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,179
Please!

178
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,382
Help me, please!

179
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,085
Oh, God.

180
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,829
What happened?

181
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:32,575
Uh... I must have dozed off.
I was driving for 12 hours.

182
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,203
Should I get some
water from the well?

183
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,616
- The well's dried up.
- Oh, God, my leg.

184
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,689
I think there's a
medical kit over here.

185
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,895
No one's going anywhere.

186
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:08,597
All right.
Say good-bye to junior.

187
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,406
No!

188
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:24,741
You know how many pints of
blood the human body has?

189
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:29,914
The answer is ten. Ten pints.

190
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,300
How many do you think Prince Charming
over there on the floor has left?

191
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,799
Eight? Going on seven?

192
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,840
Tell you what-- I'm gonna take him out
to the woodshed, have a little talk.

193
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,531
In the meantime,
I want you to chew on this.

194
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:48,713
You tell me everything that you have
discovered about the Burrows case,

195
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:52,088
and who else you've told about it,
and there's a chance

196
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:55,988
that I might let you go in time
to get Mr. Savrinn to a doctor.

197
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,351
You decide whose life
is more valuable--

198
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:05,088
the guy waiting to
die on death row

199
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:07,894
or the guy wishing he'd
die out in the woodshed.

200
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:23,252
One suit, black.

201
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,845
One pair of socks, black.

202
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,277
One pair of shoes.

203
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:32,600
Shoelaces.

204
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:38,479
One small tape recorder.

205
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,260
One gold watch.

206
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:08,077
You ever stay at
a fancy hotel, LJ?

207
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,724
You know, you leave your room
in the morning, it's a mess.

208
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:12,830
Wet, dirty towels on
the bathroom floor,

209
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:15,976
last night's room service
stinking to high heaven.

210
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:21,410
But then, when you come back at night,
it's all gone.

211
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,086
Fresh towels, clean sheets,
candy on the pillow.

212
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:26,713
It's just the best feeling
in the whole world,

213
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:28,819
'cause someone else
cleaned up your mess,

214
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,040
all you had to do
was walk away.

215
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,317
Don't you hurt them.

216
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:37,189
Okay.

217
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:41,921
But you got to tell me exactly what
they know and who else they have told,

218
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:43,801
and nobody has to die tonight.

219
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:49,150
You just walk away.
Let me clean up your mess.

220
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:52,778
I don't know what's going on.
I swear to God!

221
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,730
I wish I could believe that.

222
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,530
Bellick assigned me
a new cell mate.

223
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:06,570
Who'd you get?

224
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:11,053
Some new fish.
Ran a bump and swipe on an off-duty cop.

225
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:13,757
Fast hands, faster mouth.

226
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,449
Yo, what's crackin',
my peoples?

227
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:19,207
Speak of the devil.
Michael Scofield. David Apolskis.

228
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,079
What's up?

229
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,610
I seen you before, right?
You're part of that PI crew.

230
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:25,550
Maybe you could hook me up.

231
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:27,550
You know,
a brother needs to make some green--

232
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,546
some cash-eesh,
you know what I'm sayin'?

233
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,256
It pays 19 cents an hour.

234
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:34,243
19 cents? That's slavery, yo.

235
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:35,613
That's prison, yo.

236
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:39,324
And besides,
PI's all full up for now.

237
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,355
All right. I feel you.

238
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:46,341
But  keep a brother in mind, all right,
if something opens up, you know?

239
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:50,402
Hell, I'll pay 19 cents an hour to
get me some more time out the block.

240
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,997
Like having another kid.

241
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:56,388
Already raised one,
I'm too old to do it again.

242
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,940
You ever hear of anything
being stolen from R and D?

243
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,123
Of course.

244
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,663
Bulls steal from
personals all the time.

245
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:04,557
The problem is,

246
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:07,576
you never know what's gone until
you're on the outside of the walls.

247
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,642
At that point,
you can't do anything about it.

248
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,860
What if you knew now?

249
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,906
Look, I told you, leave me out
of whatever it is you got going.

250
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:20,219
I just need to know if you've
seen a guard with a gold watch.

251
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:23,692
There's a lot of people that can
get you a gold watch in here.

252
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:26,087
Yeah, but I need this
specific gold watch.

253
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,602
Westmoreland!

254
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:29,759
Pope wants to see you!

255
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:31,500
Let's go!

256
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:35,949
Look, I haven't seen nothing.

257
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,040
But there is this one CO--

258
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,607
word is,
he's the worst thief in here.

259
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:47,511
My wife just faxed this over
for you from county records.

260
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,497
Copy of Scofield's
marriage license.

261
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,497
She says you owe her big time.

262
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:55,047
Looks legit. He wasn't trying to
sneak in some whore for a conjugal.

263
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,692
Says here, they got married the day
before Scofield robbed that bank.

264
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:00,476
Why the hell would he do that?

265
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,296
- Heard from Veronica?
- No. You?

266
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,242
Just a note from LJ saying he's
with her, that he was safe.

267
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,527
But, you know, it's been awhile.
Doesn't feel right.

268
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:21,468
Feels wrong.

269
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,008
Really wrong.

270
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,316
I, uh...

271
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:38,450
I've come to a realization.

272
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:41,536
Either Miss Donovan and that
boy don't like you very much

273
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:45,686
or they have an unreasonable amount of
faith in your cardiovascular system.

274
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,204
So tell me, Nick,
this all you got?

275
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,791
This  paper trail of an indictment
that never even happened?

276
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:55,331
Is this it?

277
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:57,513
We know you don't have a
surveillance tape anymore.

278
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:59,657
We know you don't have
anybody to testify.

279
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,386
So is this really
all you've got?

280
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:08,831
Mr. Savrinn, that bullet went
through your teres major,

281
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,920
ripped the lateral
margin of your scapula,

282
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,952
leaving you absolutely no
medial rotation of your arm.

283
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,761
So, if you try to swing that
piece of lumber at me...

284
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:23,090
...it's gonna feel like your arm
is ripping out of its socket.

285
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,755
Come on, Nick. Mr.
Project Justice.

286
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:31,369
We both know why you're really here,
don't we?

287
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:34,273
And it ain't to save
Lincoln Burrows' life.

288
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:45,890
Inside these walls, I creep and I crawl,
looking for a way out.

289
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:48,305
But I know it's gonna
be no easy route.

290
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,102
This is gonna be a 12 round...
12 round bout.

291
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,851
With Bellick and
T-Bag on my mind...

292
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,926
...it's grindin' here...

293
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:01,982
Still interested in
getting in on PI?

294
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:04,436
Does my mama got
big breastices?

295
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:05,493
I wouldn't know.

296
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:08,490
Hell, yeah, she does,
and hell, yeah, I do.

297
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,180
All right, look,
I need a favor.

298
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,766
Word is, you made your
trade as a snatch and grab.

299
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:14,819
That's right.

300
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,888
I need you to steal something
back that was stolen from me.

301
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:20,221
What kind of somethin'
we talkin' about?

302
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:21,204
Just a watch.

303
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,913
Uh-uh, there ain't no such
thing as "just a watch."

304
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,970
Every design has
a different clasp,

305
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,995
every clasp has a
different swipe.

306
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:30,124
It's Italian, a Remedi.

307
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,604
Gold band,
pearl face, all-weather.

308
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,308
- What year?
- 2003.

309
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,619
There's a butterfly
clasp on that bitch.

310
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,486
- Which means what?
- Hidden deployment.

311
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,608
There ain't no way to snatch it
without the mark feeling it--

312
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:49,043
which just means I'm gonna have
to get whimsical on this ficky.

313
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:55,474
I get you this watch,
that mean I get in on some of that PI?

314
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:58,226
It means I'll think about it--
no promises.

315
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,543
Why you need this
watch so bad anyway?

316
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,533
Let's just say it means a
lot to someone in my family.

317
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,495
Come in, Charles. Sit down.

318
00:22:28,591 --> 00:22:29,764
What's going on?

319
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:35,440
I've got some bad
news, Charles.

320
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:38,280
Your daughter is very sick.

321
00:22:39,196 --> 00:22:41,372
She's got esophageal cancer.

322
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:44,393
Now, she's at Sacred
Heart in Indianapolis.

323
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:49,601
And she wants to see you
while there's still time.

324
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,260
How much time?

325
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,581
Doctors  say a few weeks.

326
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,800
The problem is, the D.O.C.
is not gonna let you go.

327
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:58,805
They think you're
still a flight risk.

328
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:01,526
- She's my only child.
- I know that.

329
00:23:02,594 --> 00:23:05,044
Believe me, Charles,
I've lobbied on your behalf.

330
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:07,605
It's state policy.

331
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:13,063
They will only extend furloughs
in the case of funerals.

332
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:16,537
You're telling me

333
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:21,652
I have to wait until she
dies before I see her?

334
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:34,212
Mr. Scofield, looks like I'll be
administering your shot today.

335
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:36,164
Where's Dr. Tancredi?

336
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:39,370
We've got a busy schedule today.
She's with another patient.

337
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:41,385
Hold him down before
he jumps off the cart!

338
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:43,335
Hold his legs!
Hold his legs down!

339
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,137
Hey, we need a doctor here!

340
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:46,366
All right. What's happened?

341
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:48,685
I don't know. The kid was in chow.
Then all of sudden,

342
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:51,123
he collapsed,
and he started spittin' up his food.

343
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:53,117
Looks like he's having
some kind of a seizure.

344
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:54,285
Get him up here,
get him up here.

345
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:56,248
And make sure he
doesn't hurt himself.

346
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,565
I gonna O2 and a cardio...

347
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,369
Hold him, hold him!

348
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:36,275
So, Ms. Donovan, how is that background
in real estate law going for you?

349
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:38,611
It's a big help? Hmm?

350
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,377
You know, frankly,
I think we caught a break.

351
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:44,973
Lincoln had nailed a
girl with half a brain,

352
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,160
she probably would have brought
this whole thing down already.

353
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:52,412
But you know what
the worst part is?

354
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:54,973
That you dragged these
people into this,

355
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:58,292
knowing that you had no
clue how to get them out.

356
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,521
I mean, if you had just
minded your own business,

357
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:02,263
people like Leticia Barris--

358
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:05,084
she wouldn't have a mouthful
of maggots right about now.

359
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:07,836
Your fiancé would not be
lying in his apartment

360
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,966
waiting for the smell
of his rotting corpse

361
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:13,812
to let the neighbors know that
something had gone horribly wrong.

362
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:17,230
That's right--
their deaths are on your head.

363
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:19,597
You made this mess.

364
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:21,946
Nobody else. You.

365
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:26,993
But you're also the one person
that can end it all right here.

366
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:30,974
All I need to know is
who else you've involved.

367
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:35,824
So, you just nod,
and I'll know you're ready to talk.

368
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:48,573
You know, Ms.
Donovan, I think that, uh,

369
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:50,642
you look a little cold.

370
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,909
Maybe you'll find it
easier to talk...

371
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:57,234
after you've warmed
up a little bit.

372
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:03,700
Where is he? What happened?

373
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:06,628
We got to move.
Come on, we don't have time. Come on!

374
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,168
Come on,
we're getting out of here.

375
00:26:12,787 --> 00:26:13,986
Where are the keys?

376
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:15,140
My pocket.

377
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:17,562
Start the car!

378
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,761
Okay. Is he gonna be all right?

379
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:20,137
Go start the car, LJ!

380
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:22,845
We're gonna get you to a hospital,
all right?

381
00:26:53,334 --> 00:26:54,785
A gift from my cell mate.

382
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:59,016
Thank you. And thank him.

383
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,856
The watch--
what's it for anyway?

384
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,296
Thought you didn't want to
know about any of this.

385
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:05,562
Things have changed.

386
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,367
I want in.

387
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:09,474
Why the sudden change of heart?

388
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,233
I have my reasons.

389
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,209
Don't take this the wrong way,

390
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:17,134
but everyone who's in is
bringing something to the table.

391
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,717
How about money?

392
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:21,186
- How much we talking about?
- I think you know.

393
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:25,595
I seem to remember several conversations
that ended with, "I am not
D.B. Cooper."

394
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,301
- I lied.
- You lied?

395
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,646
We're cons. We tend to do that.

396
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:32,578
I checked your alibi.
According to records,

397
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,158
you were incarcerated at the
time of the Cooper hijacking.

398
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:41,398
My father and I share more than
just a weakness for easy money.

399
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,119
We also share a name.

400
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:47,398
Charles Westmoreland,
Senior was the one locked up that day.

401
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:49,911
Now, do you want
the money or not?

402
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:52,619
No offense,
but it's a little convenient.

403
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,392
You want in, and suddenly,
you're the guy.

404
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:57,393
How do I know you're
not lying right now?

405
00:27:57,423 --> 00:27:59,773
Hey, Old Man River,
keep it moving.

406
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:36,864
Hey, Sucre...

407
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,800
I got a question about you
and the rest of the Mexicans.

408
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,698
I don't think I'll
be able to help,

409
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:47,484
seeing as I'm Puerto Rican.

410
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,536
Geographical semantics, amigo.

411
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,897
I'm speaking about the
general "Latin-o" population.

412
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:56,333
How is it that a
people so historically

413
00:28:56,593 --> 00:29:00,419
lazy ended up being such a big
part of the nation's work force?

414
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:04,785
The way I see things,
it's everyone else that's lazy.

415
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:07,979
Otherwise, there wouldn't be
any jobs for the immigrants.

416
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:12,318
The ones sitting at home collecting
unemployment, the lazy ones--

417
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:13,496
it's not us.

418
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,445
You gonna let him talk
about your people like that?

419
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:20,775
Uh, whatever, Deliverance.

420
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,240
You know what?
We may be a team in here,

421
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,713
but just so that you know,

422
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,393
the minute we get over that wall,
it's every man for himself.

423
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,755
Or sooner.

424
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:46,795
LJ?

425
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:52,039
LJ?

426
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:55,172
LJ?

427
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:02,564
Do you know how the
Russians do things?

428
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:08,572
They let you live, and they kill
everyone else in your family,

429
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,929
and, well,
any-anyone you've ever loved.

430
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,144
How does that sound?

431
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,983
- Go to hell.
- Oh, come on.

432
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:17,574
Is that any way
for a lady to talk?

433
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:21,392
Oh.

434
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,968
What, do you think
I'm an idiot?

435
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:28,177
I'm just going to
walk into a well?

436
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:30,748
Seriously, Ms. Donovan.

437
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:40,694
You all right?

438
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:32,975
Scofield, no sitting
down on the job.

439
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:35,213
I want you out here working
where I can see you.

440
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,364
I'm on it, boss.

441
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Move it, Scofield. Move it!

442
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,684
Hey, Brad. Good to see you.

443
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,900
Hey, baby.

444
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:53,295
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

445
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:55,824
put your hands together for
our next lovely young lady.

446
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:58,111
Up on the main stage,
it's Jasmine.

447
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:24,347
Would you like a private dance?

448
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,846
Why don't you sit down
and chat for awhile.

449
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:28,025
See if we hit it off.

450
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,500
- So, what's your name?
- Brad.

451
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:36,054
- Yours?
- Jasmine.

452
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,894
Come on... your real name.

453
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:43,782
- It's Nika.
- Nika.

454
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,078
Now that's a pretty name.

455
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:52,769
Tell me, Nika, how's your husband
feel about you working here?

456
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,014
I'm not married.

457
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:58,063
I hope you're lying for
the sake of titillation.

458
00:33:58,507 --> 00:34:03,007
Otherwise, your little visit to Fox
River this morning would have been
breaking the law...

459
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,617
Mrs. Scofield.

460
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:13,401
We are married.
But they tell all the girls to lie.

461
00:34:13,481 --> 00:34:15,326
It's better for
making business.

462
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:17,512
I'm not here to
get you in trouble.

463
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,739
I just want to know a little
more about your husband.

464
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:24,021
Well, he's a very good man.

465
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:28,674
I'm sure he is.
But even good men do bad things.

466
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:35,946
Your accent. You're from--
now, don't tell me-- Budapest, right?

467
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,077
- Prague.
- Prague...

468
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:43,137
How recently did you come over?
Only a couple months, I bet.

469
00:34:43,703 --> 00:34:45,349
You like it here in America?

470
00:34:45,439 --> 00:34:47,389
You know,
I really have to keep moving.

471
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,256
They don't like us to spend
too much time in one spot.

472
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:52,536
Now I don't want to have to check
into your immigration status...

473
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,991
I just need to know

474
00:34:56,161 --> 00:35:00,403
what Michael Scofield wanted from
you in exchange for the green card.

475
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:02,398
Nothing.

476
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:05,046
We met while he was
studying overseas...

477
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:08,050
I don't want to know what
you memorized for the INS.

478
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:10,828
Now, either you answer my
questions about Scofield,

479
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:13,912
or I call my guy in
the Chicago P.D.

480
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:17,504
And maybe he starts asking
some questions about you.

481
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:23,147
A credit card.

482
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:26,440
He asked me to bring him a credit card.
That's it.

483
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:56,998
Yeah. Trace this call.
Come and get me-- now.

484
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:00,334
New Glarus, I'm in New Glarus.

485
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:18,637
No, thanks, I brought my own.

486
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:26,433
Dorothy Andrews Elston Kabis.

487
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:29,847
United States Treasurer, 1971.

488
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:32,573
The year of the D.B.
Cooper hijacking.

489
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:39,240
DI192589--

490
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:43,996
the first number in a series of
bills used in the ransom drop.

491
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:47,101
Thanks for the history lesson.

492
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:50,412
All it proves is you
did the research.

493
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:52,173
Same as me.

494
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:33,298
So, you're married.

495
00:37:34,998 --> 00:37:38,384
Uh, well... not in the
traditional sense of the word.

496
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:41,278
Michael, we're both adults,
put your cards on the table.

497
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:47,070
Okay, I'll got first.

498
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,527
Um... as one of the very
few women around here,

499
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:54,510
I'm used to a certain amount of

500
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:59,343
innuendo and flirtation
being thrown my way.

501
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:03,527
I'm not used to enjoying it.

502
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:04,651
Look, Sara...

503
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:08,012
It's "Dr.
Tancredi," and please let me finish.

504
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:13,685
I'm not a jealous woman.
But I am a careful one.

505
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:17,395
And for some reason,
when I'm around you, I'm not. Careful.

506
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:19,427
- You don't have to be.
- Yes, I do.

507
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,220
There are so many questions
surrounding you, Michael.

508
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:25,330
There are way too many.

509
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,755
So here's the deal. Um...

510
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:33,078
From now on, your shots,
any medical concerns,

511
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:35,374
they're all fine,
as long as it's doctor-patient.

512
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:38,413
But personal questions
and favors of any kind,

513
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,549
are no longer a part
of our relationship.

514
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:45,847
The questions you
have about me...

515
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,846
there are answers.

516
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:00,266
Quinn!

517
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:04,408
I was getting worried.
You guys get lost?

518
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:06,686
We tried to call you again
to pinpoint your signal,

519
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:07,916
but you never picked up.

520
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,186
Yeah, the battery went dead
on the damn cell phone.

521
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,393
What are you going
to do, right?

522
00:39:11,423 --> 00:39:13,716
So, uh, how'd it go?

523
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:16,073
I have a broken leg down here.

524
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:19,781
Yeah, listen, you know, I think
maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

525
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,206
You have bosses, I have bosses.

526
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,559
but at the end of the day,
we're all on the same team.

527
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:27,350
Right? We're both just trying
to tie up some loose ends.

528
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,930
I could not agree more.

529
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,850
Yeah, so, can you guys get a
rope or a ladder, or something?

530
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:38,777
What the hell is that?

531
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:42,282
Hey... Hey!

532
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:44,204
Just tying up some loose ends.

533
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,789
You stupid son of...
Hey, guys! Hey!

534
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:49,451
Hey, don't do this!
Don't do this!

535
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:54,462
Please! My leg's broken, I can't stand!
You have to help me!

536
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,915
You can't just leave him down there.
He'll die.

537
00:39:57,364 --> 00:40:00,311
He's the only one who knows we
don't have the Burrows kid.

538
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:01,503
The only one.

539
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,173
There's room for you
down there too, Danny.

540
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:14,893
Don't leave me like this!

541
00:40:15,024 --> 00:40:16,174
Don't leave me! Please!

542
00:40:17,313 --> 00:40:18,144
Please!

543
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:26,105
You coming back to PI today?

544
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:28,574
It's getting kind of testy in there,
you know?

545
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:29,435
Yeah.

546
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:34,247
I just needed to
find something out.

547
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:36,455
What the hell is that?

548
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,157
Listen.

549
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:45,497
Am I supposed to be
hearing something?

550
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:48,088
Shh. Just hold on.

551
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:06,574
- There.
- What?

552
00:41:07,353 --> 00:41:09,576
We sat around here for 20
minutes waiting to hear that?

553
00:41:09,606 --> 00:41:10,867
18 minutes, actually.

554
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:12,957
And, yes.

555
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:16,794
- What was it?
- Keys.

556
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:18,719
The guards' keys.

557
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:22,111
18 minutes is how long we
have between each time

558
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:25,603
the guards pass beneath the infirmary
windows on their rounds at night.

559
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,706
Cons aren't allowed
outside after hours.

560
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,832
It was the only way I
could find out the timing.

561
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,059
- What does that mean?
- It means...

562
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,055
Four days from now,
on the night of the escape,

563
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:38,987
we'll have 18 minutes to get the
bars off the infirmary window,

564
00:41:39,017 --> 00:41:42,815
and for all seven of us to get
across the wire and over the wall.

565
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:45,075
- Is that doable?
- Of course.

566
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,644
What's up?

567
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:02,521
Nothing.

568
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:05,134
Hey, I know that look.
What's up?

569
00:42:06,017 --> 00:42:07,138
I hit it! I hit it!

570
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,147
There it is, the pipe!
We're there!

571
00:42:13,316 --> 00:42:14,158
Guys, guys.

572
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:23,131
Come on, Michael, talk to me.

573
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:24,941
You want the good
news or the bad?

574
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:25,970
The good.

575
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,524
Westmoreland and
his money are in.

576
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:31,435
- What's the bad?
- I've done the math.

577
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:36,176
It'll take at least 5 minutes for us to
get the bars off the window in
the infirmary.

578
00:42:36,484 --> 00:42:39,934
And two minutes each for us to get
across the wire and over the wall.

579
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:40,639
So?

580
00:42:40,818 --> 00:42:42,965
We've only got 18 minutes.

581
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,648
We've got too many people.

582
00:42:48,848 --> 00:42:50,322
One of them has to go.

583
00:42:51,061 --> 00:42:54,320
