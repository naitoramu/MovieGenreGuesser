1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,730
Previously on Prison Break...

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,830
How does a simple fisherman
know so much about the Company?

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,060
You gonna do this or not?

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,080
Yes,but once we're out,
I consider you collateral.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,030
Lincoln causes as many
problems as he solves.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,150
He needs to get way,and I
think you can assist him.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,210
I stay one step ahead,and
you get 50 grand.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,820
What happened?

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,210
She came up to me just like you said

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,780
and offered me a bunch of
cash to talk behind your back.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,210
- So we stick to the plan,right?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,970
Cool.

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,400
I found a passport.

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,660
Who's Gary Miller?

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,820
I've been working on a
way for us to be together.

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,600
James,how-how can I believe you?

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,850
How can I believe anything anymore?

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,400
We got a way out of this?

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,510
We need some kind of
support brace for the tunnel.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,570
Or what?

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,900
Or the whole thing
collapses,and we're buried alive.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,800
No more excuses.

23
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,300
Papa's dead because of this Yankee.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,280
I'll kill him myself if i have to, right.

25
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,700
He survived the box.

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,180
So what?

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,110
The guards went after Scofield.

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,650
Scofield won.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,580
He's a folk hero now.

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,530
Look,I want Scofield
dead as much as you,

31
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,000
but not at the cost of an uprising.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,270
Mail call.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,290
Who's that?

34
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,670
That's my son.

35
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,140
Bagwell gave the okay.

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,650
The coast is clear.

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,260
We gotta go.

38
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,300
I didn't think I'd see you again.

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,050
Once someone goes into the box,its...

40
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,430
it was a misunderstanding.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,280
They wanted to talk to you
about the helicopters,right?

42
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,910
What helicopters?

43
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,980
you really trying to escape?

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,540
I don't know what you're
talking about,and neither do you.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,310
Just so you know,
Bagwell's coming with us.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,380
You were gone.

47
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,040
He had something we needed.

48
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,540
I didn't have a choice.

49
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,010
Fine.

50
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,920
So what's the new plan?

51
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,380
- Did you tell him?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,730
I am coming with you.

53
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,460
Okay by me.

54
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,830
Everyone hear that?
You hear that,lawman?

55
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,050
But you're staying up here.

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,420
Maybe I didn't enunciate myself.

57
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,570
The work downstairs
requires two hands.

58
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,650
Hey.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,390
We need somebody to stay
outside in case Sammy returns.

60
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,670
I thought we couldn't
dig through this stuff.

61
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,940
The bracing's gonna be tricky.

62
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,867
Unless the tunnel gets
the proper support,

63
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,710
it's all going to
come down on our heads.

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,340
We should have the
materials for the braces,

65
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,220
but we'll need a a saw
to cut them to size.

66
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,260
And a hammer.

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,840
Can you help us out?

68
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah. I can do that.

69
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,220
Two days.

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,640
And if not?

71
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,550
Two days

72
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,020
Guillermo should have
everything we need.

73
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,030
You know where he is,right?

74
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,570
I think it's,uh...

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,640
it's down this corridor on the left.

76
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,950
Halfway down.

77
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,830
Cell 40.

78
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,720
Down the corridor on the left.
Cell 40.

79
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,470
Okeydoke.

80
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,830
Are you lost already,Teodoro?

81
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,480
No.

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,440
But you are.

83
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,820
This is my room now.

84
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,710
You're done in here.

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,714
If you had gone after Scofield today,

86
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,310
all would have been forgiven.

87
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,270
This is suicide.

88
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,050
Shut up,old man!

89
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll take my chances.

90
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,130
Yeah. You think you can run Sona?

91
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,070
You couldn't even run shipments
from one dock to the other,

92
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,380
but I still keep you by my side.

93
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,980
I'll let you walk out of here
out of respect for what you were.

94
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,380
Come on!

95
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,620
Get the hell out of here!

96
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,070
All of you ready to do this?

97
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,707
Until Lechero gets back,
we should start

98
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,570
looking for pieces about
4 feet in length.

99
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,890
I'm running things now!

100
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,960
Anyone got a problem with that?

101
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,780
Come get it!

102
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,010
Good.

103
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,500
First order of business,

104
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,840
A case of rum to the man who
brings me Michael Scofield!

105
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,040
Don't worry

106
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,270
We'll be there with all the cash

107
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,510
Okay? Gracias.

108
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,880
Osberto.

109
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,440
That's who you want to talk to.

110
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040
This guy on
the up-and-up?

111
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,330
The guy I was running things
into Sona for arranged this,

112
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,110
so it's as up as it's gonna
get for this kind of deal.

113
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,890
So,yes.

114
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,635
Osberto doesn't speak English, though,

115
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:47,020
so how do you want to work it?

116
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,550
I need to meet with Susan.

117
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,010
I'll take Sofia.
She can translate for me.

118
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,710
Don't worry about it.

119
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,060
So when I meet with Susan,
what do you want me to tell her?

120
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,730
Tell her whatever you
think she wants to hear.

121
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,220
Just buy us enough time
to do our thing,all right?

122
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,620
Home stretch,papi.

123
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,970
Listen,man. I want to
thank you for everything.

124
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,850
Oh,Linc,please.

125
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,540
When we get home,I got your back¡

126
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,380
Whatever you need,
whatever you want.

127
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,070
That won't be necessary.

128
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,740
When I'm back home,I'm a saint.

129
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm not even jaywalking.

130
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,950
Osberto. Don't forget.

131
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,670
Osberto.

132
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,390
Scofield steps outside
that tunnel,he's a dead man.

133
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,980
Far as I can tell,we have two options.

134
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,950
We can invite Sammy on the escape...

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,740
he can go to hell.

136
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,600
Which brings us to option number two.

137
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,330
You wouldn't last a
second in there with sammy.

138
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,820
Would you?

139
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,470
Then I guess we'll
just have to outsource.

140
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,390
I felt sorry for the guy,

141
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,110
but you don't chicken-foot an Ex-Delta
force and expect to make it out alive.

142
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,530
You're delta force?

143
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,590
Like chuck norris?

144
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,390
Norris? He wouldn't have
made it through boot camp.

145
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,200
Excuse me...

146
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,910
I see you're making friends.

147
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,380
Hey,once you get the hang of
it,this place ain't so rough.

148
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,680
Yeah.

149
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,870
Too bad.

150
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,610
Too bad what?

151
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,110
You were right.
We got a little plan going on.

152
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,080
But,you know,if you're
putting down roots...

153
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,220
no,no.

154
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,750
You were saying...

155
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,020
We're supposed to be
out of here in 48 hours.

156
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,380
Not through Scofield.

157
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,400
You heard the town cried.

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,510
College boy's life is
barely worth a case of booze.

159
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,430
Hence our current conversation.

160
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,130
I know how you got
your cherry yesterday,

161
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,906
Daubing your wraps in acetone,

162
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:05,360
smothering the guy until he
passed out from the fumes.

163
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,230
You do the same thing
to Sammy,and you're in.

164
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,190
Chicken-foot Sammy?

165
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,460
Chicken-foot Sammy.

166
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,410
It's all riding on you,champ.

167
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,820
Thank you.

168
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,450
This shouldn't take long.

169
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,430
What are you getting?

170
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,650
Supplies.

171
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,820
For?

172
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,760
I don't want to get
caught flat-footed again.

173
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,760
You know what that means?

174
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,690
No.

175
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
Well,these people
obviously have a plan.

176
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,480
We're gonna need one,too.

177
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,570
Does that plan include
screwing over James?

178
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,710
Is it James or Gary Miller?

179
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,982
Whatever his name is,
there's a part of me that

180
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,120
doesn't want to believe
he works for them...

181
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,766
'cause he's the man I loved,

182
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,380
the man who went to prison for me,

183
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,160
the man who was going to take
me to my first trip to Paris.

184
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,980
I haven't turned my
back to that man.

185
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,310
Do I have your word that
he's gonna be all right?

186
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,450
Yeah.

187
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,440
Now get in.

188
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,250
Do I have your word?!

189
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,170
Yeah,you got my word.

190
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,520
Now get in.

191
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,050
You know I just found out,

192
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,670
That "Sucre" means "Sugar. "

193
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,660
Yeah.

194
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,360
So every time I say your name,
I'm calling you "Sugar. "

195
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,210
Basically.

196
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,270
I like that.

197
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,180
Look,I don't have a
lot of information.

198
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,910
Which,I guess,that's
good news for you,right?

199
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,840
You care to elaborate?

200
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,250
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.

201
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,490
He's still planning on
exchanging Whistler for LJ.

202
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,320
He hasn't been talking
about running any games.

203
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,970
And did he become an
eagle scout last night,too?

204
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,580
Lady,he got the message.

205
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,930
He knows he doesn't have a
choice,he has to play it straight.

206
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,267
Look,I could have come up here and

207
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,450
made something up
just to get paid,but...

208
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,410
I'm not trying to get
on your bad side either.

209
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,090
You know what?

210
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,830
I believe you.

211
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,800
So,I'll call you if anything comes up.

212
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,590
Whoa,whoa! What am I,
a toothless crack whore?

213
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,410
Sit down.

214
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,830
I keep my promises.

215
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,070
People I work for,they don't
like to deal in greenbacks;

216
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:04,430
it's just too bulky.

217
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,790
Cashier's check payable to cash.

218
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,770
Same thing.

219
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,380
Half now and half
when you're done.

220
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,130
Keep your ears open,Sugar.

221
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,160
Alex,come on!

222
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,250
Hold it steady!

223
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,010
I am! I am!

224
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,390
I'm gonna need a little help here!

225
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,930
I got it.
I said I got it.

226
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,330
That little piece of metal's
gonna hold all this weight?

227
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,670
All right,let go,let go.

228
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,420
So,how many more are we gonna
need before we get to the top?

229
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,870
20 maybe.

230
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,580
That gets us to no-man's land.

231
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,570
Then what?

232
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,600
Helicopter'd be nice.

233
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,720
Hey,I was supposed to kill you.

234
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,270
Oh,so you're not a fisherman?

235
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,589
They threatened to
come after my family if

236
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,070
I didn't kill you and
jump on that helicopter,

237
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,050
but I didn't.

238
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,910
I'm so grateful.

239
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,220
So what happened to your family?

240
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,810
I don't know.

241
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,700
Maybe I'll find out if
we ever get out of here.

242
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,850
Well,it's a crazy world,isn't it?

243
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,610
We all agree on that.

244
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,270
And we have a lot of work to do.

245
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,270
Where the hell is Lechero?

246
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,460
Is everything set?

247
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,550
Huh?

248
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,640
Is everything set?

249
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,050
Yeah,no problemo.

250
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,940
Excuse me,sir.

251
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,770
Do we come to you if we
need the chicken foot?

252
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,400
Tiger pants.

253
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,080
Who you got a beef with?

254
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,010
I don't know his name.

255
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,370
Some Caribbean guy.

256
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,440
Stole my wallet a while back.

257
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,210
Better think long and hard
before you say another word,eh?

258
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,840
He's got this fruity little
mustache and this ugly-ass vest.

259
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,070
Please,I'm beggin' ya.

260
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,120
in the ring.

261
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,470
15 minutes.

262
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,590
I never thought I'd say this,
but I envy you,Brad.

263
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,180
I've wanted to shank that little
calypso kid ever since I first met him.

264
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm not a violent guy by nature,

265
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,970
but if a man makes me walk around
in my grunts for two days...

266
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,240
yeah,that's great! Just don't
take too long to finish him off, ok

267
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,330
The sooner he's dead,the
sooner we can get on the escape.

268
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,390
No games. I'm in.

269
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,910
You're in.

270
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,280
No,no,no.

271
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,890
What's wrong?

272
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,470
We got to call off the fight.

273
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,110
No,that's an impossibility.

274
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,640
No,no,no,you don't understand!

275
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,970
There's got to be more
Acetone around here.

276
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,020
No,that's it!

277
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,180
I can't go against
Sammy straight up!

278
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,050
I'm a dead man!

279
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,960
If you don't kill him,
we are all dead.

280
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,500
This isn't the best neighborhood.

281
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,180
I've been in a lot worse.

282
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,930
Just stick close.

283
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,910
Osberto?

284
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,580
Si.

285
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,940
You want to do this?

286
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,850
¿Tiene el dinero?

287
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,470
Yeah,yeah,I got it.

288
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,410
¿Donde esta?

289
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,840
"Where is the money?"

290
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,860
I want to see the product.

291
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,570
"Money first. "

292
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,050
Show me the stuff.

293
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,110
El dinero!

294
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,370
Lincoln,please,
let's get out of here.

295
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,000
Tell him to stop wasting my time.

296
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,540
No.

297
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,510
Tell him.

298
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,190
Oh,my god!

299
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,260
Big?

300
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,640
It's grande?

301
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,300
Si.

302
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,600
Ask him how do i
trigger it by remote.

303
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,070
Boom.

304
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,640
"Dial one-one,send. "

305
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,040
One-one,send?

306
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,190
yeah

307
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,000
Adios.

308
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,970
Buena suerte.

309
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,410
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna buy a bomb?

310
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,080
You never would
have come otherwise

311
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,410
We need that saw.

312
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,720
You know,uh,I am a fisherman.

313
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,850
I am.

314
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,940
I'm just maybe a little bit
more connected than I've let on.

315
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,860
I think this is gonna work.

316
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,650
Yeah.

317
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,030
You know,I run
charters,just like I said...

318
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,720
I have for years.

319
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,510
Then one day,that
brunette,Gretchen well,

320
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,640
she asked me if I wanted to be
exclusive to her corporation,right?

321
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,150
And,uh,well,with the
money she was offering,

322
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,520
I had a pretty good idea she
wasn't just trawling for salmon.

323
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,100
So you two have history.

324
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,842
Yeah. And she's been
an absolute nightmare

325
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:13,230
in my life ever since that first job.

326
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,440
Alex,I need a wedge.

327
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,570
Wedge.

328
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,700
Look,I took 'em where
they wanted me to take 'em.

329
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,300
I have to figure out these coordinates
and I have to take them back there.

330
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,930
Quit embarrassing yourself.

331
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,820
What?

332
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,550
We're not two chicks at a
bar you're trying to pick up.

333
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,110
- Unless you need to hear this?
- No.

334
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:28,710
All right,good.

335
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,160
You work for the Company.

336
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,090
And when you break out of here,

337
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,760
you're gonna do whatever the
Company asks you to do,period.

338
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,700
Well,they're using me just
like they're using you.

339
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,990
Good,I'm glad you shared that with me.

340
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,030
So why don't we go back to work?

341
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,910
How's that sound?

342
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,250
Let those idiots chicken foot
themselves all they want,huh?

343
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,490
But if one of them
tries to use it on us...

344
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,930
you don't have to fight that guy.

345
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,200
It's my farewell tour.

346
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,910
the rest of those pieces are no good.

347
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,060
We're going to need
those tools,Michael.

348
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,520
I guess we'll just have to wait.

349
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,830
That book of yours- it's just a
bunch of coordinates in there,right?

350
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,480
Among other things.

351
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,350
So you wouldn't mind.

352
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,610
It's just a bunch
of,uh,numbers and dates.

353
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,830
"Gate. "

354
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,120
Gate netting company.

355
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,340
That's where I rent my trammels.

356
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,500
"Stampede. "

357
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,140
That's my buddy's cape islander.

358
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,610
And this is important to us how?

359
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,520
It's important because I'm being
accused of being someone I'm not.

360
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,990
And I don't want Scofield ditching
me once it's time to leave...

361
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,180
he's not ditching anybody.

362
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,850
If he could have gotten rid of
anybody,he would have gotten rid of me.

363
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,670
And if he tries to leave
the city he knows that

364
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,770
we're gonna turn him in
before he gets out of the city.

365
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,840
I'm going upstairs to find
Lechero and his equipment.

366
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,740
I'm with Alex.

367
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,820
Do you mind?

368
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,280
Sounds like someone's up there.

369
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,920
If Lechero gets stranded up
there,we're not getting out of here.

370
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,279
So when you think it's safe,or it feels

371
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,050
like it's safe,we got
to go,we got to go up.

372
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,070
we've been talking about
chicken footing Sammy for months.

373
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,340
No one had the courage.

374
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,520
Do you have any paint thinner?

375
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,830
Paint thinner?

376
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,370
Shoe polish,lighter fluid,glue?

377
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,590
There you are,champ.

378
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,380
It's time.

379
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,180
Stomp his face,Brad!

380
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,540
You know,this has all been
one big misunderstanding.

381
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,280
I wasn't talking about Sammy.

382
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,180
It was... that's him.

383
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,670
That's the guy I was talking about.

384
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,980
Yeah,I don't see no "fruity moustache,"
and where's his "ugly-ass vest," Brad?

385
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,830
Don't worry,you stand a real
chance of winning this one.

386
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,700
You cannot just hide out all day.

387
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,000
What else can I do,huh?

388
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,970
I've ruled these men
for a year with blood.

389
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,440
You don't think those men want to take
the head of the man who wore the crown?

390
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,690
Be that as it may,Bellick is
about to lose his head to Sammy.

391
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,390
You may not want to hear
this,but once that happens,

392
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,515
we are both very much
aware that Scofield is gonna

393
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:01,630
stop getting curious about
where the hell you are.

394
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,700
He's going to come crawling out of
his hole and right into Sammy's arms,

395
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,550
and then he and our
escape are gone forever.

396
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,930
Wait.

397
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,300
We get the tools and
we come straight back.

398
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,570
Come on

399
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,740
You guys want to watch the fight?

400
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,660
You know,chill out.

401
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,560
I'll get you a beer.

402
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,650
You like that?

403
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,330
Stop it!

404
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,300
It's Scofield!

405
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,180
Scofield's in there.

406
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,050
It's locked.

407
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,620
Open the door.

408
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,790
I don't have the combination.

409
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,890
I said... open it now.

410
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,160
We can't. We can't.

411
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,810
Open it now.

412
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,060
I don't have the combination.

413
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,350
Hey,I've got your man out here.

414
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,729
If you don't open the door,

415
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,960
he's the one who's
going to pay the price.

416
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,690
I need him alive!

417
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,650
You saw those guys.

418
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,130
What do you think they've got planned?

419
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,290
All of you is trying my patience.

420
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,120
What do you suggest,Alex?

421
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,160
Let's be ready for them.

422
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,970
Time's up.

423
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,110
You want another one?

424
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,860
Then you better be persuasive.

425
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,610
Michael.

426
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,640
Don't open the door!
He's got a gu...

427
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,190
Are you going to tell
me what it's for?

428
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,350
No.

429
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,130
Because you think I might tell James?

430
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,520
Because you don't need to know.

431
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,640
It's going to be all right.

432
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,350
- How'd it go?
- Good.

433
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,570
I told her what she wanted to
hear,just like you told me.

434
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,160
That it?

435
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,810
Yeah.

436
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,760
Cool.

437
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,450
Listen,I want you to call her up,
tell her you've got some information.

438
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,700
Make sure she picks you up,and
get in the car,all right?

439
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,450
Okay.

440
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,480
Is everything okay?

441
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,830
Yeah. Why?

442
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,890
She looks upset.

443
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,990
I'll call you later.

444
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,380
Got something down
here we can use,Michael.

445
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,230
If they come through that door...

446
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,040
you hit 'em right here.

447
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,950
Go ahead,take it.
Go ahead.

448
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,250
It'll puncture the heart.

449
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,830
you were hiding Scofield in your room?

450
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,810
Look at you- the power
make you mad already.

451
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,040
Come along, Norman.
It's cool.

452
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,050
What is so urgent?

453
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,360
Lincoln bought a gun.

454
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,850
I... I asked him what he planned on
doing with it,but he wouldn't answer.

455
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,250
So I just... I just thought
you might want to know.

456
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,220
If anything changes,I'll
get back to you,okay?

457
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,003
You know,the other day
when you and Lincoln

458
00:31:35,004 --> 00:31:37,650
had your little spat
in the lobby and you

459
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,940
all distraught and jilted- went
across the street to the bar,

460
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,080
a cynic might think that was staged.

461
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,780
I'm a cynic,Sugar.

462
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,610
You're high,Sugar.

463
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,100
If it's any comfort,
you guys almost pulled it off.

464
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:58,050
The Puerto Rican and the gorilla- you
really had me scrambling there for a minute.

465
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,510
Hey,if you don't want my
help,fine,I'm out,okay?

466
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,870
It's a little thing called a tracing
number- on the check I gave you.

467
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,980
Apparently your extensive expertise
in banking failed you that day.

468
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,020
You promptly wired all 25k to

469
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,120
Maricruz Delgado in Chicago at 123

470
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,900
"Please don't hurt me" Lane.

471
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,294
- I swear to god,if
something happens to her...

472
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:22,890
- if what?!

473
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,610
What,jackass?!

474
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,664
You're going to go back there and

475
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:33,940
you're going to get me
some real information,

476
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:39,120
or Maricruz and her head
are going to part ways.

477
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,690
Get out of my car.

478
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,360
Now.

479
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,620
Hey,Blanco.

480
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,710
I got your good buddy Lechero here.

481
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,130
Why don't you give it the secret
knock so he know's you,huh?

482
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,140
The combination.

483
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,170
What makes you think
I have the combination?

484
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,180
Just do what he says.

485
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,090
How many times you gonna
pull that little thing out?

486
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,600
As many times as
I feel necessary.

487
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,950
What,you think it
make you look strong?

488
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,120
All it does is magnify your weakness.

489
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,600
Funny,I'm feeling pretty
secure right about now.

490
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,430
Now,the combination,old man.

491
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,130
We're not asking again.

492
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,430
Sammy!

493
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,400
I'm opening the door.

494
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,570
Michael,do not open the...

495
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,280
Drop 'em!

496
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,110
Drop them,I said!

497
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,860
Now move!

498
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,270
You're escaping with him?

499
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,880
I was gonna tell you
all about this,bredda.

500
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,740
It just never came up,eh?

501
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,530
Take it. It's yours.

502
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,540
The tunnel,the escape
plan,everything.

503
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,770
We can go together.

504
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,720
I'm taking everything you got.

505
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,020
But you ain't going nowhere.

506
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,890
How you finishing up this hole?

507
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,820
Promise me you'll
take Whistler with you.

508
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,280
You making demands on me? Huh?

509
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,760
I understand...

510
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,370
why you're going to kill me,
but he's done nothing wrong.

511
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,090
I'll tell you everything you need
to know,just take him with you.

512
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,990
You need him.

513
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,780
He's the only one who
figured this one out.

514
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,040
Don't you worry,I'll
take care of your friend.

515
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,040
All right.

516
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,590
First,you need to keep building
braces to support the tunnel as you go.

517
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,700
How you do that?

518
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,670
Whistler can show you how.

519
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,060
Look like you just make some wood
squares from these boxes here.

520
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,040
Like I said,
Whistler can show you.

521
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,690
How much further to the surface?

522
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,360
Not far.

523
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,800
Can't be more than ten feet.

524
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,590
Impressive,Blanco.

525
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,590
Too bad you won't
be around to enjoy it.

526
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,470
How long is this going to set us back?

527
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,116
What's gonna set us back
is if the tower guards are

528
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:17,650
looking at a giant sinkhole
out in no man's land.

529
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,640
Michael?

530
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,530
- We're good.
- Yeah.

531
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,160
We're good.

532
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,640
Back in business.

533
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,500
I'm in.

534
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,200
For what,getting your ass kicked?

535
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:25,970
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.

536
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,870
You're in,champ.

537
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,160
Okay,you need to stay here.

538
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,440
I got to get something,all right?

539
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,240
Don't move.

540
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,770
can you get home from here?

541
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,320
Yeah,I'm two blocks away.

542
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,620
If he doesn't take you,I will.

543
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,970
Here. Use this.

544
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,100
- Thanks.
- Right there.

545
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,530
You know,for all the times you
wanted me to prove I was a fisherman,

546
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,210
I should have been asking
if you were a real engineer.

547
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,260
That could've been one
of us buried down there.

548
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,080
I'll do better next time.

549
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,670
I'm gonna go back down and try
to salvage some of those braces.

550
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,850
Yeah,I'll go with you.

551
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,080
Never gets any easier.

552
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,560
Scofield,visita.

553
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,880
Scofield, you have a visitor.

554
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,890
All the side jobs I do
at Sona for 3 years.

555
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,030
I save all of my money.

556
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,850
It's $173.

557
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,530
If you're really leaving,
it's yours.

558
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,610
Take me with you.
Please?

559
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't want to be here anymore.

560
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,960
You don't want any part of this.

561
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,290
You got a plan or are
we back to square one?

562
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,470
I have a plan.

563
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,600
Good,'cause I got something
cooking on the outside.

564
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:41,160
I ain't walking into a buzzsaw again.

565
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,440
How you dealing with
the animals in here?

566
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,540
Actually,it's starting
to feel like home.

567
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,870
Whistler still pretending
he's a fisherman and all this?

568
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,580
Why?

569
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,170
Sofia found a passport in
one of the apartments he kept.

570
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,450
Name's Gary Miller.

571
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,170
I'm shocked.

572
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,510
Guy's a fraud,Michael.

573
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,680
As far as I know,there
ain't fish in Scottsdale.

574
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,350
Well,if he's not a fisherman...

575
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:09,990
What is he?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
