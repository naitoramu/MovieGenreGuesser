1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,127
<i>Tell me about your morning.</i>

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,771
Start from the beginning.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,046
I woke up.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,040
How did you sleep?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,002
I didn't. I don't.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,450
You just said you woke up.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,206
I stopped lying down.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,567
<i>Alone?</i>

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,726
Of course, alone.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,006
I meant Rosie. Your daughter.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,440
Uh, she's with friends.

12
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,121
Why?

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,404
Can't always cope.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,008
And last night wasn't good.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,926
It's understandable.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,606
Is it, why?
Why is it understandable?

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,127
Why does everything
have to be understandable?

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,728
Why can't some things be unacceptable?
And we can just say that.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,770
I only mean it's okay.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,884
I'm letting my daughter down.
How the hell is that okay?

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,606
You just lost your wife.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,367
And Rosie just lost her mother.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,405
<i>You are holding yourself
to an unreasonable standard.</i>

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,527
<i>No, I'm failing to.</i>

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,206
So, there is no one you talk to?
Confide in?

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,727
No one.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,650
Oh, I'm picking up Rosie this afternoon.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,524
After I see my therapist.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,329
Got a new one.
I'm seeing her today.

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,730
Are you gonna tell her about me?

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,881
No.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,167
Why not?

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,490
- 'Cause I can't.
- Why not?

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,881
Because I can't, you know I can't.
She thinks you're dead.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,486
John, you've got to
remember, it's important.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,046
I am dead.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,770
Please. For your own sake and for Rosie's.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,491
This isn't real. I'm dead.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,847
- John, look at me.
- Mmm.

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,608
I'm not here.
You know that, don't you?

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,606
Okay. I'll see you later.

42
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,930
<i>Is there anything you're not telling me?</i>

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,804
 No.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,607
What are you looking at?

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,401
Nothing.

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,483
You keep glancing to my left.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,563
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,205
There is a difference between
looking away and looking to.

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,202
- I tend to notice these things.
- I'm sure.

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,961
Now, I am reminding you
of your friend, I think.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,049
That's not necessarily a good thing.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,647
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?

53
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,881
I haven't seen him.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,203
No one's seen him.
He's locked himself away in his flat.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,566
God knows what he's up to.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,881
Do you blame him?

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,368
I don't blame him...
I don't think about him.

58
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,489
Has he attempted to make contact with you?

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,847
No!

60
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,361
How can you be sure?
He might have tried.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,130
No, if Sherlock Holmes
wants to get in touch,

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,043
that's not something you
can fail to notice.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,924
Well, now.

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,130
Won't you introduce me?

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,967
<i>- Hello. Thank you, thank you.</i>

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,967
Hello.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,962
Mr. Smith, whenever you're ready.

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,401
Now, please.

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,167
Bring them through.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,123
It's difficult having such good friends.

71
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,923
Friends are people you want to share with.

72
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,643
Friends and family.

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,571
What's the very worst thing you can do...

74
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,528
to your very best friends?

75
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,562
Something on your mind?

76
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,650
Yes, Simon. Oh yes.

77
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,363
Whatever you tell us, stays in this room.
I think I speak for everyone.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,562
Well, what is the worst
thing you could do?

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,361
Tell them your darkest secret.

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,166
Because,

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,210
if you tell them, and they
decide they'd rather not know...

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,724
You can't take it back.

83
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,531
You can't unsay it.

84
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,802
Once you've opened your heart,

85
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,201
you can't close it again.

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,250
I'm kidding.

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,409
Of course, you can.

88
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,163
Well, everyone, please,
roll up your right sleeves.

89
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,727
Roll up your right sleeves.
Come on.

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,601
Oh, it's a bit of insurance.

91
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,485
I don't understand.
What is that?

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,369
TD 12.

93
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,002
- One of ours.
- One of yours?

94
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,403
We make it, my company. TD 12.

95
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,202
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals,
for minor surgical procedures.

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,527
Interferes with...

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,130
- The memory.
- The memory.

98
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,647
Yes.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,050
I want to thank you, Ivan,
for allowing me to use it.

100
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,561
Didn't exactly know who
you were gonna be using it on.

101
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,121
- You mean you didn't ask.
- Is everyone ready?

102
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,366
- No.
- Please.

103
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,241
Roll up your sleeves.
Come on, roll up.

104
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,211
This is obscene.

105
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,128
All I'm doing, Faith dear...

106
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,006
-...is getting something off my chest.

107
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,602
Without getting it on yours.

108
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,083
What you're about to
hear me say may horrify you. But...

109
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,367
You will forget it.

110
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,168
If you think about it,
civilisation has always

111
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,164
depended on a measure
of elective ignorance.

112
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,130
These drip feeds will keep the drug
in your blood streams

113
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,770
at exactly the right levels.

114
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,963
Nothing that is happening to you now

115
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,765
will stay with you for more
than a few minutes.

116
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,882
I'm afraid that some of the

117
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,600
memories you've had up to this point
might also be...

118
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,685
...corrupted.

119
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,442
I'm going to share
something with you now.

120
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,206
Something personal.

121
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,485
And of importance to me.

122
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,204
I have a need to confess.

123
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,127
But you, I think,
might have a need to forget.

124
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,410
By the end of this, you'll be
free to go, and don't worry,

125
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,529
by the time you're back
in the outside world

126
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,642
you will not remember any
of what you've heard.

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,247
- Ignorance is bliss.
- What's wrong with bliss?

128
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,725
Some of you know each other
and some of you don't.

129
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,444
Please, be aware that one of you

130
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,727
is a high ranking police officer.

131
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,408
One of you is a member of the judiciary.

132
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,569
One of you sits on the board
of a prominent broadcaster.

133
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,250
Two of you work for me. And one of you
of course, is my lovely daughter.

134
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,087
Faith.

135
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,651
You are the people I need to hear me.

136
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,921
I have made millions, for myself
for the people around this table,

137
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,247
for millions of people I've never even met.

138
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,890
There are charities that I support
who wouldn't exist without me.

139
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,923
If life is a balance sheet,
and I think it is,

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,571
well, I believe I'm in credit!

141
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,565
But I have a situation.

142
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,761
That needs to be managed.

143
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,802
I have a problem and there is only
one way that I can solve it.

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,207
And what's that?

145
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,969
I'm terribly sorry.

146
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,890
I need to kill someone.

147
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,687
Who?

148
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,608
Were we in a meeting?
Was there a meeting?

149
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,361
Need to kill someone. Faith.

150
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,962
- My dear, dear girl.

151
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,530
I can't remember.

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,967
I can't remember who you're gonna kill.

153
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,561
In five minutes,

154
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,166
you won't even remember
why you were crying.

155
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,770
The others are all fine.

156
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,444
You know,
they've gone down the pub.

157
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,361
It's all on me.

158
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,369
Oh Faith. Don't you think
I should take that?

159
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,529
It's only going to upset you.

160
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,371
Three years ago, my father told
me he wanted to kill someone.

161
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,804
One word, Mr. Holmes,

162
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,925
and it changed my world forever.

163
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,811
Just one word.

164
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,327
What word?

165
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,922
- A name.
- What name?

166
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,804
I can't remember.

167
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,281
I can't remember who
my father wanted to kill.

168
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,849
And I don't know if he ever did it.

169
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,846
You've changed,

170
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,604
you need to top up your tan
and your roots are showing,

171
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,091
you're letting yourself go.

172
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,569
Do you ever look in the mirror
and want to see someone else?

173
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,364
No. Do you own an American car?

174
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
- I'm sorry?
- No, not American.

175
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,450
Left hand drive.
That's what I mean.

176
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,205
No. Why do you ask?

177
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,131
Not sure actually.
Probably just noticed something.

178
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,326
Are you okay?

179
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,405
Of course, you don't own a car.

180
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,970
You don't need one.
Do you? Living in isolation.

181
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,730
No human contact. No visitors.

182
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,330
Okay, how do you know that?

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,680
It's all here, isn't it? Look.

184
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,489
Cost cutting is clearly a priority for you

185
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,403
look at the size of your kitchen,
teeny-tiny.

186
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,482
Must be a bit annoying when
you're such a keen cook.

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,806
I don't understand.

188
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,491
Hang on a minute. I was looking out
of the window. Why was I doing that?

189
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,767
- I don't know.
- Me neither. Must've had a reason.

190
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,365
It'll come back to me.

191
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,728
Presumably, you downsized
when you left your job.

192
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,451
And maybe when you ended your relationship.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,490
- You can't know that.
- Of course I can.

194
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,486
There wasn't anything physical
going on, was there?

195
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,245
Quite some time, in fact.

196
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,890
There, see, it's obvious.

197
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,849
You can't tell things like
that from a piece of paper.

198
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,651
Think I just did, didn't I?
I'm sure that was me.

199
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,364
- How?
- Dunno.

200
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,124
Sort of happens.

201
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,929
Like a reflex, I can't stop it.

202
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,327
Coat.

203
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,643
- I don't have a coat.
- Yes, well I just noticed, I wonder why.

204
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,281
- Who you talking to?
- Piss off!

205
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,442
- So, what do you think?
- Of what?

206
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,365
- My case.
- Oh, it's way too weird for me.

207
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,091
Go to the police. They're really
excellent at dealing with this...

208
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,807
complicated sort of stuff.
Tell them I sent you.

209
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,769
That ought to get a reaction.
Night-night.

210
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,370
Please. I have no one else to turn to.

211
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,611
Yes, but I'm very busy at the moment.
I have to drink a cup of tea.

212
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,528
This cup of tea...

213
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,965
- Code?
- It's a cup of tea.

214
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,681
Because you might prefer some coffee.

215
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,004
You're my last hope.

216
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,606
Really, that's bad luck, isn't it?
Good night. Go away.

217
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,761
What's bad luck?

218
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,003
Stop talking. It makes me
aware of your existence.

219
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,764
I've always had bad luck.

220
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,604
- It's congenital...
- Handbag.

221
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,491
That's not rude. Congenital.
It just means...

222
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,327
Handbag.

223
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,810
Stop! Wait!

224
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,041
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it. Do you hear me?

225
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,240
Off it. Off it!

226
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,124
Sorry. What?

227
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,846
What are you talking about?

228
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,684
- Your skirt.
- My skirt?

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,685
Look at the hem of it!
That's what I noticed. Sorry.

230
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,047
I'm still catching up with my brain.
It's terribly fast.

231
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,085
Those markings, do you see them?

232
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,207
You only get marks like that by
trapping the hem of your skirt

233
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,725
in a car door,
but they're on the left hand side,

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,404
so you weren't driving.
You were in the passenger seat.

235
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,881
I came in a taxi.

236
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,281
There is no taxi waiting
in the street outside.

237
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,125
That's what I checked when
I went to the window.

238
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
And you've got all the way to the door

239
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,727
and not made any move
to phone for one, and look at you.

240
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,207
You didn't even bring a coat, in this rain?

241
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,760
Now, that might mean nothing, except

242
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,684
the angle of the scars
on your left forearm,

243
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,808
you know, under that sleeve
you keep pulling down.

244
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,920
You never saw them.

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,367
No, I didn't. So thank you
for confirming my hypothesis.

246
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,087
I don't really need to check
that the angles are consistent

247
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,650
with self-harm, do I?

248
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,569
- No.
- Then you can keep your scars.

249
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,764
I want to see your handbag.

250
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,367
Why?

251
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,007
It's too heavy.

252
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,485
You said I was your last hope,
and now you're going out into the night

253
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,370
with no plan on how you're getting home.

254
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,767
And a gun.

255
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,889
- Chips.
- Chips?

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,082
You're suicidal.
You're allowed chips.

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,971
Trust me.
It's about the only perk.

258
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,125
Sherlock!

259
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
Are you going out?

260
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,845
I think I remember the way.
It's through there, isn't it.

261
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,526
Oh, you're in a state!
Look at you!

262
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,728
Yeah, well, I've got
a friend with me, so...

263
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,964
- What friend?
- Bye.

264
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,367
Oh.

265
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,366
Come on.

266
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,049
<i>I'm Culverton Smith, and this election
year, I'll be voting...</i>

267
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,567
For God's sake, I was talking
to the Prime Minister.

268
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,690
I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes.
It's your brother.

269
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,766
He's left his flat.

270
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,411
Was it on fire?

271
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,451
<i>Even when I'm on the road
I still like quality food.</i>

272
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,962
You see the fold in the middle?

273
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,361
For the first few months,
you kept this hidden.

274
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,044
Folded inside a book.

275
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,531
Must have been a tightly packed shelf,

276
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,728
going by the severity of the crease.

277
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,962
So, obviously you were keeping
it hidden from someone

278
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,008
living in the same house,
at the level of intimacy

279
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,441
where privacy could not be assumed.

280
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,522
Conclusion? Relationship.

281
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,161
Not any more, though. There's a pin
prick at the top of the paper.

282
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,686
The past few months,
it's been on open display on a wall.

283
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,171
Conclusion?
Relationship is over.

284
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,605
The paper has been exposed to steam and
a variety of cooking smells.

285
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,724
So, it must have been
on display in the kitchen.

286
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,810
Lots of different spices.

287
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,770
You're suicidal,
alone and strapped for cash.

288
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,968
Yet, you're still cooking to impress.

289
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,365
You're keen, and kitchen
is the most public room in any house.

290
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,922
And since any visitor could be expected
to ask about a note like this,

291
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,964
I have to assume you don't have any.

292
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,530
You've isolated yourself.

293
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,123
- Amazing.
- I know.

294
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,406
I meant the chips.

295
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,487
Hmm.

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,047
Let's go for a walk.

297
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,650
You should answer it.

298
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,767
It's Mycroft.

299
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,006
Might be about Sherlock.

300
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,447
Of course it's about Sherlock.
Everything's about Sherlock.

301
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,522
<i>How did you know my kitchen was tiny?</i>

302
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,762
The fading pattern on the paper.
It's not much,

303
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,161
but it's enough to know
your kitchen window faces east. Now.

304
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,286
Kitchen notice boards.

305
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,963
By instinct, we place them at eye level,
where there's natural light.

306
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,922
Now look. The sun's only
struck the bottom two-thirds,

307
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,530
but the line is straight. So, that means
we know paper is facing the window.

308
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,722
But, because the top section is unaffected,

309
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,171
we know the sunlight can only be
entering the room at a steep angle.

310
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,528
If the sunlight
was able to penetrate the room

311
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,523
when the sun was lower in the sky,

312
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,523
then the paper would be equally faded.

313
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,282
Top to bottom, but no.

314
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,442
It only makes it when the sun
is at its zenith.

315
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,726
So, I'm betting that you live
in a narrow street, on the ground floor.

316
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,048
Now, if steeply angled
sunlight manages to hit

317
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,690
eye level on the wall opposite the window,

318
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,371
then what do we know about the room?

319
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,647
The room's small.

320
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,042
- Oh, big brother is watching you.
- Literally.

321
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,566
We can keep tabs.
You didn't have to come in.

322
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,324
I was talking to the Prime Minister.

323
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,121
Oh, I see.

324
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,447
What's he doing?

325
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,642
Why is he just wandering about like a fool?

326
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,489
She died, Mycroft.

327
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,005
He's probably still in shock.

328
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,164
Everybody dies.

329
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,403
That's the one thing
human beings can be relied upon to do.

330
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,244
How can it still come
as a surprise to people?

331
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,164
You sound cross.

332
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,009
Am I going to be taken
away by security again?

333
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,606
I have, I think, apologised extensively.

334
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,320
You haven't made it up to me.

335
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,164
And how am I supposed to do that?

336
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,009
- Sex.
- I'm sorry.

337
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,522
Sex. How did you know

338
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,927
I wasn't getting any?

339
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,083
It's all about the blood. This one comes
from the very first night.

340
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,083
You can see the pen marks over it.

341
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,690
I think you discovered the pains

342
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,690
stimulated your memory
so you tried it again later.

343
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,843
I'm no expert, but I assume that
since your lover failed to notice

344
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,207
an increasing number of scars
over a period of months,

345
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,290
that the relationship
was no longer intimate.

346
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,283
How do you know he didn't notice?

347
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,125
Oh, well, 'cause he would
have done something about it.

348
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,281
Would he?

349
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,885
Wouldn't he?
Isn't that what you people do?

350
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,604
- Well that's interesting.
- What is?

351
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,324
- The way you think.
- Superbly.

352
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,205
- Sweetly.
- I'm not sweet. I'm just high.

353
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,327
This way.

354
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,848
- But we just came that way.
- I know, it's a plan.

355
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,361
What plan?

356
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,804
- What is it? What now?

357
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,646
Sorry, um, traced his route to the map...

358
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,651
Is he with someone?

359
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,882
Not sure.
We keep losing visual.

360
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,206
Mostly, we're tracking his phone.

361
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,483
<i>Don't call us. We'll call...</i>

362
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,166
I'm trying to sleep. Can you
stop ringing my damn phone?

363
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,641
<i>Sherlock has left his flat.
First time in a week.</i>

364
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,643
- So I'm having him tracked.
<i>- Nice.</i>

365
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,762
That's very touching how you can hijack

366
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,770
the machinery of the state to
look after your own family.

367
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,921
Can I go to sleep now?

368
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,930
Sherlock gone rogue
is a legitimate security concern.

369
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,850
The fact that I'm his brother
changes absolutely nothing.

370
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,321
It didn't the last time,
and I assure you it won't...

371
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,361
With Sherlock.

372
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,001
Sorry, what?

373
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,560
Please phone me if he gets in contact.
Thank you.

374
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,368
Do you still
speak to Sherrinford?

375
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,566
- I get regular updates.
- And?

376
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,122
Sherrinford is secure.

377
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,284
- Are we gonna walk all night?
- Possibly.

378
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,044
It's a long word.

379
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,124
- What is?
- Bollocks.

380
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,566
Culverton Smith, all this charity work.
What's in it for you?

381
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,730
We must be careful not to burn our bridges.

382
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,569
Do you know why I'm gonna take your case?

383
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,961
Because of the one
impossible thing you said.

384
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,280
What impossible thing?

385
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,246
You said your life turned on one word.

386
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,647
Yes.

387
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,650
The name of the person
my father wanted to kill.

388
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,241
That's the impossible thing.

389
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,243
- Just that right there.
- What's impossible?

390
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,483
Names are not one word.
They're always at least two.

391
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,648
Sherlock Holmes. Faith Smith.

392
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,564
Santa Claus.
Winston Churchill.

393
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,803
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Actually, just Napoleon would do.

394
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,081
Or Elvis?

395
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,845
Look, I think we can rule
both of them out as targets.

396
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,687
Okay, I got it wrong then. It wasn't
only one word. It can't have been.

397
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,842
Did you remember quite distinctly

398
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,002
that your whole life turned on one word?

399
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,163
So, that happened, I don't doubt it,
but how can that word be a name?

400
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,090
A name you instantly recognise
that tore your world apart.

401
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,440
Okay, well, how?

402
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,965
No idea yet.

403
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,928
But I don't work for free.

404
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,486
You take cash?

405
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,204
Not cash, no.

406
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,487
Taking your own life.

407
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,722
Interesting expression.
Taking it from who?

408
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,963
Once it's over,
it's not you who'll miss it.

409
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,684
Your own death is something that
happens to everybody else.

410
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,164
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it.

411
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,888
You're not what I expected, you're...

412
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,561
- What? What am I?
- Nicer.

413
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,842
- Than who?
- Anyone.

414
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,726
<i>My little master, who will find me...</i>

415
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,441
Sorry, I...

416
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,921
Faith? Faith!

417
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,281
<i>You said your life turned on one word.</i>

418
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,765
<i>A name can't be one word.</i>

419
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,521
If you were to come round asking after him,

420
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,802
that he'd rather have anyone but you.

421
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,881
Anyone.

422
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,722
<i>You're not what I expected.
What? What am I?</i>

423
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,370
<i>- Nicer.
- Than who?</i>

424
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,201
Anyone.

425
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,609
Don't think anyone else is going to save him,
because there isn't anyone.

426
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,327
<i>Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone.</i>

427
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,646
I have a situation.
Needs to be managed.

428
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,561
There's only one way that I can solve it.

429
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,005
And what's that?

430
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,330
I need to kill someone.

431
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,327
Who?

432
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,487
Who?

433
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,161
Anyone.

434
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,161
- Of course.

435
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,323
He doesn't want to kill one person.
He wants to kill anyone.

436
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,086
He's a serial killer.

437
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,681
Anyone.

438
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,162
- It could be...
- Anyone.

439
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,331
Why not?

440
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,203
Why shouldn't he be?

441
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,649
- What is wrong?
- What's the matter with you?

442
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,647
Do you know where you are?
Are you drunk?

443
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,205
- Shezzer.
- What are you doing here?

444
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,522
What were you doing in the
middle of a bloody street?

445
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,329
- You should be at Baker Street.
- I am. So are you.

446
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,722
They found your address.
They brought you here.

447
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,848
You've had too much.
And that's me saying it.

448
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,007
<i>Kill.</i>

449
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,005
<i>Sherlock...</i>

450
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,722
- Anyone.
<i>- Anyone.</i>

451
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,407
They're always poor,
and lonely, and strange.

452
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,730
- But those are only the ones we catch.
- Who do we catch?

453
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,047
Serial killers.

454
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,409
But if you are rich,
and powerful, and necessary...

455
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,091
<i>Anyone.</i>

456
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,210
What if you had the compulsion to
kill and money? What then?

457
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,491
Well now.

458
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,811
Won't you introduce me?

459
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,450
- Ah!

460
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,325
Right, you there!
Stop right where you are!

461
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,404
- Oh, John.
- Mrs. Hudson.

462
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,642
Do you have any idea what
speed you were going at?

463
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,001
Of course, not.
I was on the phone.

464
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,481
- Oh, it's for you, by the way.
- For me?

465
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,681
It's the government.

466
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,921
The what?

467
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,331
- What's going on? What's wrong?
- Hello?

468
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,161
<i>My name is Mycroft Holmes.
I'm speaking from the Cabinet.</i>

469
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,760
- What's happened?
- It's Sherlock.

470
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,843
You've no idea what I've been through.

471
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,681
I'm out of here. He's lost it.

472
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,205
He's totally gone!

473
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,681
"Once more unto the breach
dear friends, once more!

474
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,365
"Or close the wall up with our English dead

475
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,206
"Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide.
Hold hard the breath

476
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,806
"and build up every spirit
to his full height

477
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,681
"On! On, you noblest English whose blood
is fet from fathers, from war-proof!

478
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,886
"And you, good yeoman, whose limbs
were made in England, show us

479
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,043
"Here the mettle of your pasture!

480
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,403
"I doubt not, for there is none of you
here so mean and base

481
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,404
"that hath not noble luster in your eyes!

482
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,809
"I see you standing like greyhounds
in the slips straining upon the start!"

483
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,402
"The game's afoot."

484
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,161
Oh, hello.

485
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
Can I have a cup of tea?

486
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,328
- Did you call the police?

487
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,006
Of course I didn't call the police.
I'm not a civilian.

488
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,041
These pictures. They're that
man on the telly, aren't they?

489
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,561
- What pictures?
- They're everywhere.

490
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,445
Oh, these pictures?
Oh, you can see them too! That's good.

491
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,004
Culverton Smith, This I think
is relevant from this morning.

492
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,522
He's publicly accused Mr. Smith
of being a serial killer.

493
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,683
Christ. Sherlock on Twitter.
He really has lost it.

494
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,685
Don't you dare make jokes.
Don't you dare! I was terrified.

495
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,285
A cup of tea!

496
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,687
Oh, for goodness' sakes!
What's the matter with you?

497
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,450
Are you having an earthquake?

498
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,646
You need to see him, John.

499
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,290
- You need to help him!
- Nope.

500
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,487
He needs you!

501
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,891
Somebody else.

502
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,291
Not me. Not now.

503
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,801
Now, you just listen to me
for once in your stupid life.

504
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,810
I know Mary's dead and I know
your heart is broken.

505
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,804
But if Sherlock Holmes dies too,
who'll you have then?

506
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,083
Because I'll tell you
something, John Watson.

507
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,764
You will not have me.

508
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,001
Have you spoken to Mycroft, Molly, anyone?

509
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,241
They don't matter, you do.

510
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,685
Would you just see him, please, John?

511
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,842
Or just take a look at him as a doctor.

512
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,002
I know you'd change your mind if you did.

513
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,681
Yeah, look. Okay.
Maybe, if I get a chance.

514
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,486
- Do you promise?
- I'll try if I'm in the area.

515
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,807
Promise me?

516
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,325
- I promise.
- Thank you.

517
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,841
Well? On you go.

518
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,521
Examine him.

519
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,929
Right then, mister.
Now I need your handcuffs.

520
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,169
I happen to know
there's a pair in the salad drawer.

521
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,083
I've borrowed them before.

522
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,765
Oh, get over yourself.

523
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,161
You're not my first
smack-head, Sherlock Holmes.

524
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,325
That woman's out of control.
I asked for a cup of tea.

525
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,767
- How did you get him in the boot?
- The boys from the cafe.

526
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,080
They dropped me. Twice!

527
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,009
And you know why they dropped you, dear?

528
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,048
Because they know you.

529
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,171
Who's this one?

530
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,924
Is this a new person?
I'm against new people.

531
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,604
Excuse me for a moment.

532
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,091
She's my therapist.

533
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,290
Awesome. Do you do block bookings?

534
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,206
Whose car is that?

535
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,123
- That's my car.
- How can that be your car?

536
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,690
Oh, for God's sake!

537
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,046
I'm the widow of a drug dealer.

538
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,043
I own property in Central London.

539
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,610
And for the last bloody time, John,

540
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,051
I'm not your housekeeper.

541
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,044
I'm so sorry.
I answered your phone, you were busy.

542
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,123
I think you'll want to take it.

543
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,601
- Uh, yes, hello?
- Is this Dr. John Watson?

544
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,445
Yeah, who's this?

545
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,886
Culverton Smith.
You've probably heard of me.

546
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,803
Uh, well, yes.

547
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,407
Get me a fresh glass of water, please.
This one's filthy.

548
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,927
I mean, I'm aware of
this morning's developments.

549
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,891
Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.

550
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,883
Sorry, did you say all still meeting?

551
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,644
<i>You, me and Mr. Holmes.</i>

552
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,649
I sent a car.
It should be outside.

553
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,563
Mr. Holmes gave me an address.

554
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,722
Well, he couldn't have
given you this one...

555
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,969
When you're ready.

556
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,410
When did Sherlock give you this address?

557
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,323
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

558
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,687
<i>Yes. Two weeks.</i>

559
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,411
How did you know where to find me?

560
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,249
Oh, Sherlock told me.

561
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,767
He's not so difficult
when you've got a gun on him.

562
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,002
How did you know? How?

563
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,367
On Monday, I decided
to get a new therapist.

564
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,010
Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.

565
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,051
Wednesday morning, I booked today's
session. Now, today is Friday.

566
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,770
So two weeks ago, two weeks,

567
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,764
before you were abducted at gunpoint,
and brought here against your will

568
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,127
over a week before I even
thought of coming here,

569
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,204
you knew exactly where you'd need to
be picked up for lunch?

570
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,961
Really?

571
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,443
I correctly anticipated
the responses of people

572
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,885
I know well to scenarios I devised.

573
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,968
- Can't everyone do that?
- How?

574
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,009
Except the boot.
The boot was mean.

575
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,171
Never mind how. He's dying to tell us that.
I want to know why.

576
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,722
Because Mrs. Hudson's right.

577
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,527
I'm burning up.

578
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,842
I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still
falling, and I'm never climbing out.

579
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,005
I need you to know, John.
I need you to see that up here

580
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,241
I've still got it.

581
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,891
So, when I tell you that
this is the most dangerous,

582
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,647
the most despicable human being
that I have ever encountered.

583
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,530
When I tell you that
this monster must be ended.

584
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,003
Please remember where you're standing

585
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,243
because you're standing exactly where
I said you would be two weeks ago.

586
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,691
I'm a mess, I'm in hell,
but I am not wrong, not about him.

587
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,922
So what has all this got to do with me?

588
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,001
That creature, that rotting thing

589
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,527
is a living, breathing
coagulation of human evil.

590
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,281
If the only thing I ever do in this
world is drive him out of it,

591
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,085
then my life will not have been wasted.

592
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,851
Look at me.

593
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,729
Can't do it. Not now.

594
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,971
Not alone.

595
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,081
Uh...

596
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,969
Yeah, well, they're real enough, I suppose.

597
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,121
Why would I be faking?

598
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,806
Because you're a liar. You lie
all the time, it's like your mission.

599
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,202
I have been many things, John,
but when have I ever been a malingerer?

600
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,123
You pretended to be dead for two years!

601
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,804
- Apart from that.
- Listen, before I do anything,

602
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,961
I need to know what state you're in.

603
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,809
Well, you're a doctor.
Examine me.

604
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,126
No, I need a second opinion.

605
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,043
John, calm down.

606
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,329
When have you ever managed
two opinions? You'd fall over.

607
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,642
I need the one person who,
unlike me, learnt to see

608
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,410
through your bullshit long ago.

609
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,482
Who's that, then? I'm sure
I would have noticed.

610
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,840
The last person you'd think of.

611
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,331
I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.

612
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,489
Do you hear me?
I said Molly Hooper.

613
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,602
You're really not gonna like this.

614
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,768
- Like what?

615
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,324
Oh. Hello. Is, er...

616
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,288
I'm sorry.
Sherlock asked me to come.

617
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,441
What, two weeks ago?

618
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,329
Yeah, about two weeks.

619
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,244
If you'd like to know
how I predict the future...

620
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,486
No, I don't care how.

621
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,962
Okay. Fully equipped ambulance.
Molly can examine me on the way to save time.

622
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,087
Ready to go, Molly?

623
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,486
- Just tell me when to cough.
- Oh, well...

624
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,847
- Hope you remembered my coat.

625
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,203
Sorry. I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

626
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,810
I have absolutely no idea what's going on.

627
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,530
Sherlock's using again.

628
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,085
Oh, God. Well, um...

629
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,244
- Are you sure?
- No, it's Sherlock.

630
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,407
Of course I'm not sure.

631
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,049
Just check him out.

632
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,965
Is Molly the right person
to be doing medicals?

633
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,281
She's more used to dead people.

634
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,727
It's bound to lower your standards.

635
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,650
I don't know. I don't know
anything any more.

636
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,849
- Oh...
- Mrs. Hudson. As ever, you are amazing.

637
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,400
No. You're going to have to
buck up a bit, John.

638
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,851
You know that, don't you?

639
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,410
The game is on.

640
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,601
I'll do my best.

641
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,131
Anything you need.

642
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,766
Anytime. just ask.
Anything at all.

643
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,721
Thank you.

644
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,082
Uh... Sometimes, can I borrow your car?

645
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,086
- No.
- Okay.

646
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,488
He knew you'd get
a new therapist after I died

647
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,688
because you'd need to change everything.

648
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,364
That's just what you're like.

649
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,087
Thanks.

650
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,370
You keep your weekends for Rosie

651
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,442
so you needed to see someone
during working hours.

652
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,888
Because you're an idiot,
you don't want anyone at the surgery

653
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,644
knowing you're in therapy,
so that restricts you

654
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,048
to lunchtime sessions
with someone reasonably close.

655
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,406
You found four men and one woman.

656
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,041
And you are done with the world being
explained to you by a man.

657
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,009
Who isn't?

658
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,848
So all he needed to do was find the
first available lunchtime appointment

659
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,009
with a female therapist
within cycling distance of your surgery.

660
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,361
- My God, he knows you.
- No, he doesn't.

661
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,125
I'm in your head, John.
You're disagreeing with yourself.

662
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,647
- Are you ready, sir?
- Yes, I am.

663
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,844
He is the cleverest man
in the world but he's not a monster.

664
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,166
Yeah, he is.

665
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,691
Yeah, okay, right. He is. Ugh.

666
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,489
But he's our monster.

667
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,801
I'm a killer.

668
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,650
You know I'm a killer.

669
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,967
But did you know...

670
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,121
I'm a...

671
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,167
Cut that. What was that?
Was that a light?

672
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,842
Uh, was that me?
Was I too good? Huh?

673
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,844
He's here.

674
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,010
Well, how is he?

675
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,645
Basically fine.

676
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,802
I've seen healthier people on the slab.

677
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,803
Yeah, but to be fair,
you work with murder victims.

678
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,291
They tend to be quite young.

679
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,408
- Not funny.
- A little bit funny.

680
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,005
If you keep taking what you're
taking at the rate you're taking it,

681
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,446
you've got weeks.

682
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,285
Exactly. Weeks.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

683
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,249
For Christ's sake, Sherlock!
It's not a game.

684
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,203
I'm worried about you, Molly.
You seem very stressed.

685
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,731
I'm stressed.
You're dying.

686
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,081
Yeah, well, I'm ahead then.
Stress can ruin every day of your life.

687
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,328
- Dying can only ruin one.
- So this is real.

688
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,801
You've really lost it.
You're actually out of control.

689
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,723
- When have I ever been that?
- Since the day I met you.

690
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,848
Clever boy. Missed you
fumbling around the place.

691
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,206
- Thought this was some kind of...
- What?

692
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,166
Trick.

693
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,969
'Course it's not a trick.
It's a plan.

694
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,087
Mr. Holmes?

695
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,570
Thirty feet and closing, the most
significant undetected serial killer

696
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,001
in British criminal history.
Help me bring him down.

697
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,329
- What, what plan?
- I'm not telling you.

698
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,686
- Why not?
- 'Cause you won't like it.

699
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,886
Mr. Holmes.

700
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,567
I don't do handshakes.

701
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,524
- It'll have to be a hug.
- I know.

702
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,726
Oh, Sherlock.

703
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,681
Oh, Sherlock.

704
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,648
What can I say? Thanks to you,
we're, uh, we're everywhere.

705
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,081
Mr. Holmes, how did Culverton
talk you into this?

706
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,729
Well, he, he's a detective.

707
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,164
Maybe I just confessed.

708
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,407
Come on.

709
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,201
Now, it's uh...

710
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,520
It's a new kind of breakfast cereal...

711
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,840
Mr. Holmes, can you put on the hat?

712
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,967
Yeah, he doesn't really wear the hat.

713
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,762
Kids will be getting
two of their five-a-day

714
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,291
before they've even left home.

715
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,327
Sherlock's been amazing for us.

716
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,169
Breakfast has got to be cool.

717
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,770
We're beyond viral.

718
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,765
You know what makes it cool
when you're a kid?

719
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,120
What? Sorry?
Beyond what?

720
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,641
Dangerous.

721
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,281
And action!

722
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,606
I'm a killer.

723
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,491
You know I'm a killer.

724
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,167
But did you know...
I'm a cereal killer?

725
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,961
Mmm.

726
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,130
And cut there. Thank you.

727
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,167
You should bag that up.
Sell it.

728
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,366
Make money from that on eBay.

729
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,167
You can make more,
if you like. Anytime you like.

730
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,171
 Has it occurred to you,

731
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,602
anywhere in your drug-addled brain,
that you've just been played?

732
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,806
Oh, yes.

733
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,162
- For an ad campaign.
- Brilliant, isn't it?

734
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,806
Brilliant?

735
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,681
Safest place to hide.

736
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,007
Plain sight.

737
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,441
Mr. Holmes.

738
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,040
Culverton wants to know if you're okay
going straight to the hospital.

739
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,963
- Hospital?
- Culverton's doing a visit.

740
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,324
The kids would love to meet you both.

741
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,890
I think he's sort of promised.

742
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,887
Oh, okay.

743
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,843
If you'd just like to come this way.

744
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,365
So.

745
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,767
What are we doing here?
What's the point?

746
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,365
I needed a hug.

747
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,322
What do you think, Mr. Holmes?

748
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,765
Cereal killer.

749
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,769
It's funny 'cause it's true.

750
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,049
See you at the hospital.

751
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,242
Oh, you can have this back now.

752
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,089
- Have what back?
- Thanks for the hug.

753
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,567
Oh, I sent and deleted a text.
You might get a reply but I doubt it.

754
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,242
- It's password protected.
- Please.

755
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,604
We're going to have endless fun, Mr. Holmes.
Aren't we?

756
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,366
No.

757
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,206
No, not endless.

758
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,811
Need another hit, do you?

759
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,604
It can wait until the hospital.

760
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,569
You involved, much?

761
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,327
Sorry?

762
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,569
Um, with Mr. Holmes,
Sherlock, and all his cases.

763
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,971
Yeah, I'm John Watson.

764
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,647
Okay.

765
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,720
Dr. Watson.

766
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,802
- I love his blog. Don't you?
- His blog?

767
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,129
- Don't you read it?
- You mean my blog?

768
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,603
Say what you like about addiction,
the day is full of highlights.

769
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,211
Oh, Mr. Holmes, you're feeling better.

770
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,611
Psychedelic.

771
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,404
I was just saying I love your blog.

772
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,766
- Great...
- It's my blog.

773
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,967
It is. He writes the blog.

774
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,491
- It's yours?
- Yes.

775
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,089
- You write Sherlock's blog?
- Yes.

776
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,767
It's gone downhill a bit, hasn't it?

777
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,165
It's this way, then.

778
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,009
Oh, my God. I love your blog.

779
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,241
You're welcome.

780
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,886
Right. Here he comes.
The internet tech.

781
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,689
You all know Sherlock Holmes.

782
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,527
Oh, and Dr. Watson, of course.

783
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,607
Mr. Holmes, I was wondering.
Well, we all were, weren't we?

784
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,445
Maybe you could tell us
about some of your cases.

785
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,846
- No.
- Yes.

786
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,729
Yes! Absolutely, yes!

787
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,287
The main feature of interest in
the field of criminal investigation

788
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,761
is not the sensational aspects
of the crime itself

789
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,448
but rather, the iron chain
of reasoning from cause to effect,

790
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,364
that reveals, step-by-step, the solution.

791
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,850
That's the only truly
remarkable aspect of the entire affair.

792
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,006
Now, I will share with you the facts and
evidence, as they were available to me.

793
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,321
And in this very room,

794
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,564
you will all attempt to solve
the case of Blessington, the poisoner.

795
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,524
I think you slightly gave away the ending.

796
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,041
- There were five main suspects.
- One called Blessington.

797
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,969
It's more about how he did it.

798
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,121
- Poison?
- Okay.

799
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,286
Drearcliff House. Remember that one, John?
One murder.

800
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,885
- Ten suspects.
- Ten. Yeah.

801
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,725
- All of them guilty.
- Sherlock.

802
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,848
And what do you call that one, John?

803
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,809
Um, something to do with murder at the zoo.

804
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,450
Yeah, I called it "Murder at the zoo."

805
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,081
Or was it the case of the killer orangutan?

806
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,600
He should be wearing the hat.

807
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,927
The kids would love the hat.

808
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,244
- So, any more questions?
- No.

809
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,044
- I don't think so.
- No?

810
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,202
- Mr. Holmes...
- Good, then I'll...

811
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,526
How do you capture a serial killer?

812
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,605
Same way you catch any other killer.

813
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,569
No, no. But most killers
kill someone they know.

814
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,524
You're looking for a murderer
in a tiny social grouping.

815
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,961
Um, Mr. Smith.
Um, I'm just, uh, wondering

816
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,890
maybe this isn't
a suitable subject for the children.

817
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,041
Nurse Cornish.

818
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,726
- How long have you been with us now?
- Seven years.

819
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,041
Seven years.

820
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,087
Okay.

821
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,931
Serial killers choose
their victims at random.

822
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,162
Surely that must make it more difficult.

823
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,011
Some of them advertise.

824
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,321
Do they really?

825
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,569
Serial killing is an
expression of power, ego.

826
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,484
A signature in human destruction.

827
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:57,123
Ultimately, for full satisfaction,
it requires plain sight.

828
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,646
Additionally, serial killers
are easily profiled.

829
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,849
They tend to be social outcasts.

830
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,970
- Educationally sub-normal.
- No, no, no, no, no.

831
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,802
You're just talking about the ones you know.
The ones you've caught.

832
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,561
But, hello, dummy.
You only catch the dumb ones.

833
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:20,125
Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill
some people. What would happen then?

834
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,404
All that power, all that money,

835
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,643
sweet little government,
dancing attendants.

836
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,004
A whole country,
just to keep her warm and fat.

837
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,846
Hmm.

838
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,451
We all love the Queen, don't we?

839
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,045
And I bet she'd love you lot...

840
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,050
It's all right, everyone.
I can personally assure you

841
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,049
that Sherlock Holmes is not
about to arrest the Queen.

842
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,764
Well, of course not.

843
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,171
Not Her Majesty.

844
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,403
Money. Power. Fame.

845
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,645
Some things make you untouchable.

846
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,649
God save the Queen!

847
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,210
She could open a slaughterhouse

848
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,084
and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.

849
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,050
No one's untouchable.

850
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,010
No one?

851
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,924
Look at you all.

852
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,487
So gloomy. Can't you take a joke?
The Queen.

853
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,647
If the Queen was a serial killer,
I'd be the first person she'd tell.

854
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,927
We have that kind of friendship.

855
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,728
A big round of applause
for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

856
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,042
- Come on.

857
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,041
Wonderful.

858
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,448
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.

859
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,690
- Where are we going now?
- I want to show you my favourite room.

860
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,721
No, let's go in here.

861
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,928
So, you've had another one
of your little meetings?

862
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,770
Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.

863
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,563
Confession is good for the soul.

864
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,091
- Provided you can delete it.
- What's TD 12?

865
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,247
It's a memory inhibitor.

866
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,087
Bliss.

867
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,721
Bliss?

868
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,285
Opt-in ignorance.

869
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,730
Makes the world go round.

870
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,888
Anyone ever opt to remember?

871
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,087
Some people take the drip out.
Yes, some people have the same urges.

872
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,729
Now, come on. Wasting time.

873
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,929
Indeed you have,
I estimate, 20 minutes left.

874
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,361
Sorry?

875
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,965
I sent a text from your phone, remember?

876
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,600
It was read almost immediately,
factoring in a degree of shock,

877
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,803
and emotional decision, and a journey
time based on the associated address.

878
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,727
I'd say that your life as you know
it has 20 minutes left to run.

879
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,805
Well, no. 17 and a half, to be precise,
but I rounded up for dramatic effect.

880
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,810
So please do show us your favourite room.

881
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,322
It'll give you a chance to say good-bye.

882
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,966
Come along.

883
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,285
The game is on.

884
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,641
Do you still miss me?

885
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,170
Speaking of serial killers,
you know who's my favourite?

886
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,884
Other than yourself?

887
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,361
H.H. Holmes.

888
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,650
Relative of yours?

889
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,966
Not as far as I know.

890
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,641
You should check.

891
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,761
What an idiot.

892
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,527
Everyone out.

893
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,642
Mr. Smith, we're actually
in the middle of something.

894
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,801
Saheed, isn't it?

895
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,321
Saheed. Yes.

896
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,005
How long have you been working here now?

897
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,010
Four years.

898
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,366
Well, that's a long time, isn't it?

899
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,331
Four years.

900
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,330
Okay, everyone.

901
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,646
- Five minutes?
- Come back in ten.

902
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,207
Saheed.

903
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,521
This time, knock.

904
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,003
How can you do that?
How... How are you even allowed in here?

905
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,128
Oh, I can go anywhere I like.

906
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,721
Anywhere at all.

907
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,604
They gave you keys?

908
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,051
They presented them to me.

909
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,764
There was a ceremony.

910
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,929
You can watch that on YouTube.
The Home Secretary was there.

911
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,200
So, your favourite room.
The mortuary.

912
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,691
What do you think?

913
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,250
Tough crowd.

914
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,607
Oh, I don't know.

915
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,090
You know, I've always
found them quite pliable.

916
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,361
Don't do that.

917
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,680
She's fine.

918
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,407
She's dead.

919
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,562
H.H. Holmes loved the dead.

920
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,445
He mass-produced them.

921
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,404
Serial killer, active
during the Chicago Fair.

922
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,641
You know what he did?

923
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,521
He built a hotel,
a special hotel, just to kill people.

924
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,289
You know, with a hanging room,
gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.

925
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,926
You know, like Sweeney Todd.

926
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,042
"Without the pies."

927
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,121
Stupid.

928
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,610
So stupid.

929
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,927
Why stupid?

930
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,646
Well, all that effort.

931
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,683
You don't build a beach
if you want to hide a pebble.

932
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,967
You just find a beach and...

933
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,289
If you wanna hide a murder,
you wanna hide lots and lots of murders,

934
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,405
just find a...

935
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,967
hospital.

936
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,927
Can we be clear?
Are you confessing?

937
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,286
To what?

938
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,802
The way you're talking.

939
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,251
Oh, sorry.

940
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,961
Yes.

941
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,765
You mean, am I a serial killer?

942
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,884
Or am I just trying to mess
with your funny little head?

943
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,644
Well, it's true.

944
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,161
I do like to mess with people, and yes,

945
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,682
I am a bit creepy but that's just my USP.

946
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,241
I use it to sell breakfast cereal.

947
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,448
But am I what he says I am?

948
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,205
Is that what you're asking?

949
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,805
- Yes.
- Hmm.

950
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,726
Well. Let me ask you this.

951
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,524
- Are you really a doctor?
- Yeah, of course I am.

952
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,291
Oh. Well, no, a medical doctor,

953
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,001
you know, not just feet or
media studies or something.

954
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,486
I'm a doctor.

955
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,041
Are you serious?

956
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,371
No, really.

957
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,526
Are you?

958
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,091
Are you, are you actually serious?

959
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,923
I've played along with this joke.

960
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,883
It's not funny any more.

961
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,331
You know, look at him.

962
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,841
Go ahead, look at him, Dr. Watson. Hmm?

963
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,929
Oh no, I'll lay it out for you.

964
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,050
There are two possible
explanations for what's going on here.

965
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,561
Either I'm a serial killer,

966
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,207
or Sherlock Holmes is
off his tits on drugs. Hmm?

967
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,801
Delusional paranoia
about a public personality.

968
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,531
That's not so special.
It's not even new.

969
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,002
I think you need to tell
your faithful little friend

970
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,005
how you're wasting his time
because you're too high

971
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,361
to know what's real any more.

972
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,565
I apologise.

973
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,208
I miscalculated.

974
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,925
I forgot to factor in the traffic.

975
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,811
Nineteen and a half minutes.

976
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,970
Ah, the footsteps you're about to
hear will be very familiar to you,

977
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,765
not least because there'll be
three impacts rather than two.

978
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,247
The third of course, will be
the end of a walking cane.

979
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,967
Your daughter Faith's walking cane.

980
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,525
Why would she be here?

981
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,170
You invited her.

982
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,524
You sent her a text.
Or, or, or,

983
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,410
technically I sent her a text,
but she's not to know.

984
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,726
Um, let's see if I can recall.

985
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,280
"Faith, I can stand it no longer.

986
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,641
"I've confessed to my crimes.

987
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,327
"Please forgive me."

988
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,208
How would that have any effect?

989
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,327
You don't know her.

990
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,205
Oh, but I do.

991
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,646
I spent a whole evening with her.

992
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,245
We had chips.

993
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,201
I think she liked me.

994
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,410
You don't know Faith.
You simply do not.

995
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,721
I know you care about her deeply.

996
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,245
I know you invited her
to one of your special board meetings.

997
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,126
You care what she thinks.

998
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,807
You maintain an impressive facade.

999
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,491
I think it's about to break.

1000
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,287
Did you know?

1001
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,241
- She came to Baker Street.
- No, she didn't.

1002
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,647
Of course I didn't.

1003
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,569
She came to see me

1004
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,487
because she was scared of her daddy.

1005
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,328
Never happened. Is this another one of
your drug-fuelled fantasies?

1006
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,685
You didn't you see him take the scalpel?

1007
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,847
Nobody saw it.

1008
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,525
So you didn't know
what was about to happen?

1009
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,766
Of course I didn't know.

1010
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,161
Well, let's see, shall we?

1011
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,448
Faith, stop loitering
at the door and come in.

1012
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,648
This is your father's favourite room.

1013
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,682
Come and meet his best friends.

1014
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,605
Dad? What's happening?

1015
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,362
What was that text?

1016
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,643
Another one of your jokes?

1017
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,367
Who are you?

1018
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,201
Who the hell are you?

1019
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,327
Sherlock Holmes.
Surely you recognise him.

1020
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,204
Oh, my God.

1021
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,489
Sherlock Holmes?

1022
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,243
I love your blog.

1023
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,005
You're not her. You're not
the woman who came to Baker Street.

1024
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,050
Erm, well, no.
Never been there.

1025
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,244
Well, there must've been some build-up.
He didn't just suddenly do it.

1026
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,209
Look, I didn't know
he had the bloody scalpel.

1027
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,767
Sorry, I'm not sure
I completely understand.

1028
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,842
Understand what?

1029
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,003
But I thought you two were,
were old friends!

1030
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,321
No, we've never met.

1031
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,528
Oh, dear!

1032
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,762
- Have we?

1033
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,927
Sherlock?

1034
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,682
So who came to my flat?

1035
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,722
- Well, it wasn't me.

1036
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,601
You look different.

1037
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,610
- I wasn't there.

1038
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,201
<i>Who came to my flat?</i>

1039
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,449
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes, but...</i>

1040
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,522
I don't think I've ever been
anywhere near your flat.

1041
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,050
Oh, dear. Oh, no.

1042
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,361
Who you talking to?

1043
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,603
- What friend?
- Anyone.

1044
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,761
Oh, no!

1045
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,121
Faith?

1046
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,886
Oh God. Come on.

1047
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,607
Sherlock.

1048
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,129
Sherlock, you all right?
Sherlock, you okay?

1049
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,402
- Watch him. He's got a knife.
- Got a what?

1050
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,245
Got a scalpel. You picked it up from
that table. I saw you take it.

1051
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,004
I certainly did not!

1052
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,565
Look behind his back!

1053
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,564
- Look.
- I saw you take it! I saw you!

1054
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,129
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Sherlock, put that down.

1055
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,687
- Oh my God. My God!
- Put it down.

1056
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,283
- Stop laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing.

1057
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,010
- He's not laughing, Sherlock.
- Stop laughing at me!

1058
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,127
- Sherlock!

1059
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,365
Christ.

1060
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,287
I keep wondering
if we should've seen it coming.

1061
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,681
Not long ago, he shot
Charles Magnussen in the face.

1062
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,842
We did see it coming.
We always saw it coming.

1063
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,608
- But it was fun.

1064
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,170
- Come in.
- Sir.

1065
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,610
You probably wanna see this.

1066
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,205
<i>Harold Chorley reporting earlier today.</i>

1067
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,120
<i>Mr. Smith stated he had
no interest in bringing charges.</i>

1068
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,808
<i>I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes,
I'm a big fan.</i>

1069
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,805
<i>I don't really know what
happened today. To be honest,</i>

1070
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,965
<i>I don't think I'd be standing here
now if it wasn't for Dr. Watson.</i>

1071
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,804
- Stop laughing at me!

1072
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,167
Sherlock!

1073
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,721
Stop it! Stop it now!

1074
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,888
<i>Is it true he's
been treated in your hospital?</i>

1075
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:46,966
<i>It's not actually my hospital.
Well, it is a little bit my hospital.</i>

1076
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,244
<i>But I can promise you this.
He's going to get the best of care.</i>

1077
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,322
<i>I might even move him
to my favourite room.</i>

1078
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,528
<i>Culverton Smith, earlier today.</i>

1079
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,881
<i>In Nottingham...</i>

1080
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,571
He's right, you know,
you probably saved his life.

1081
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,607
What are you doing? Wake up!

1082
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,525
I really hit him, Greg.
Hit him hard.

1083
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,082
Is this a game?
A bloody game.

1084
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,523
Please, please, please, no violence.

1085
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,249
Thank you, Dr. Watson.

1086
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,250
I don't think he's a danger any more.

1087
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,601
Leave him be.

1088
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,125
No.

1089
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:41,605
It's okay.

1090
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,728
Let him do what he wants.

1091
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,210
He's entitled.

1092
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,804
I killed his wife.

1093
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,131
Yes, you did.

1094
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,327
Oh, hi.

1095
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,170
Just in to say hello?

1096
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,684
No, I'm just in to say goodbye.

1097
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,689
I'm sure he'll pull through.

1098
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,922
Yeah, he's made a terrible mess of himself,

1099
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,005
but, he's awfully strong,
so, we must look on the bright side.

1100
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,322
Well...

1101
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,126
Parting gift.

1102
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,884
Aww, that's nice.

1103
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,121
A walking stick.

1104
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,646
Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.

1105
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,964
Hello? Ward 73.

1106
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,563
Oh, uh, Dr. Watson...

1107
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,727
Hmm?

1108
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,725
It's for you.

1109
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,486
Hello, Mycroft.

1110
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,050
<i>There's a car downstairs.</i>

1111
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,887
You know he should
definitely have worn the hat.

1112
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,891
Still thinking about Sherlock?

1113
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,331
No, you are.

1114
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,729
You've got your disapproving face on.

1115
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,088
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head,
I think we can call that self-loathing.

1116
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,811
Where is she?
Where is Mrs. Hudson?

1117
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,211
She'll be up in a moment.

1118
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,645
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Sorry...

1119
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,291
Have you noticed the kitchen?
It's practically a meth lab.

1120
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,331
I'm trying to establish exactly what
drove Sherlock off the rails, any ideas?

1121
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,561
Are these spooks?

1122
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,649
Are you using spooks now,
to look after your family.

1123
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,650
Hang on, are they tidying?

1124
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,250
Sherlock is a security concern.

1125
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,890
The fact that I'm his brother
changes nothing.

1126
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,809
- Yeah you said that before.
- Ask him.

1127
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,768
Why fixate on Culverton Smith?

1128
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,644
He's had his obsessions before, of course.

1129
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,000
But this goes a bit further than

1130
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,770
setting a man trap for Father Christmas.

1131
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,921
Do it. Ask him.

1132
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,686
Spending all night talking to
a woman who wasn't even there.

1133
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,001
Oh shut up, you.

1134
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,491
Mycroft, last time
when we were on the phone...

1135
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,803
No, no, no, stop.
I detest conversation in the past tense.

1136
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,967
You said the fact that
you're his brother made no difference.

1137
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,327
It doesn't.

1138
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,086
You said it didn't the last time,
and it wouldn't with Sherlock.

1139
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,525
So who was it the last time?

1140
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,090
- Who are you talking about?
- Atta boy.

1141
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,600
Nobody.

1142
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,844
I misspoke.

1143
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,930
- He's lying.
- You're lying.

1144
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,361
I assure you I'm not.

1145
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,522
He really is lying.

1146
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,361
Sherlock's not your only brother.

1147
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,171
There's another one, isn't there?

1148
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,362
- No.
- Jesus.

1149
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,886
A secret brother. What, is he locked up
in a tower or something?

1150
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,130
Mycroft Holmes.

1151
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,643
What are these dreadful
people doing in my house?

1152
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,041
Mrs. Hudson I apologise
for the interruption.

1153
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,970
As you know, my brother has embarked in
a programme of self-destruction,

1154
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,963
remarkable even by his standards,

1155
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,805
and I'm endeavouring
to find out what triggered it.

1156
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,201
- And that's what you're looking for?
- Quite so.

1157
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,731
What's on his mind?

1158
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,041
- So to speak.
- And you've had all this time?

1159
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,964
Time being something of which
we don't have an infinite supply.

1160
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,804
So, if we could be about our business.

1161
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,887
You're so funny, you are!

1162
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,571
Mrs. Hudson?

1163
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,170
He thinks you're clever.

1164
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,730
Poor old Sherlock.

1165
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,166
Always going on about you.

1166
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,651
I mean he knows you're an idiot.

1167
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,768
But that's okay, 'cause
you are a lovely doctor.

1168
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:37,248
But he has no idea what an idiot you are!

1169
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,561
Is this merely stream
of consciousness abuse,

1170
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,250
or are you attempting to make a point?

1171
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,004
You want to know what's bothering Sherlock?

1172
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,606
Easiest thing in the world.
Anyone can do it.

1173
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,169
I know his thought processes
better than any other human being.

1174
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,924
So please try to understand.

1175
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,691
He's not about thinking.
Not Sherlock.

1176
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,606
- Of course he is.
- No. He's more emotional, isn't he?

1177
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,009
Unsolved case, shoot the wall.

1178
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,847
Unmade breakfast karate the fridge.

1179
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,285
Unanswered questions...

1180
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,051
Well, what does he do
with anything he can't answer, John?

1181
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,451
Every time.

1182
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,371
He stabs it.

1183
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,889
Anything he can't find the answer for, bang!
It's up there.

1184
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,530
I keep telling you,
if he was any good as the detective

1185
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,125
I wouldn't need a new mantle.

1186
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,802
<i>If you're watching this, I'm...</i>

1187
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,041
<i>Probably dead.</i>

1188
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,805
Okay no, stop that now, please.

1189
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,729
Everybody out now.

1190
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,606
All of you!

1191
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,325
This is my house, this is my friend,
and that's his departed wife.

1192
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,484
Anyone who stays here a minute longer

1193
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,489
is admitting to me personally,
they do not have

1194
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,001
a single spark of human decency.

1195
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,084
Get out of my house.

1196
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,685
You reptile.

1197
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,682
You've been ages wakin' up.

1198
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,930
I watched you.

1199
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,762
It was quite lovely in its way.

1200
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,002
Take it easy, it's okay.

1201
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,842
I don't want to rush this.

1202
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,362
You're Sherlock Holmes.

1203
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,127
<i>I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.</i>

1204
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,009
<i>Might be the hardest case of your career.</i>

1205
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,451
<i>When I'm...</i>

1206
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,885
<i>Gone, if I'm gone.</i>

1207
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,963
<i>I need you to do something for me.</i>

1208
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,211
<i>Save John Watson.</i>

1209
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,566
<i>Save him.</i>

1210
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,041
<i>Sherlock...</i>

1211
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,521
John, you want to watch this later?

1212
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,727
<i>Save him.</i>

1213
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,202
<i>Don't think anyone else is going to save
him because there isn't anyone.</i>

1214
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,051
<i>It's up to you. Save him.</i>

1215
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,208
<i>But I do think you're going to
need a little help with that,</i>

1216
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,970
<i>because you're not
exactly good with people.</i>

1217
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:09,806
<i>So here's a few things you need to
know about the man we both love.</i>

1218
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,404
<i>And more importantly, what you're going
to need to do to save him.</i>

1219
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,569
How did you get in?

1220
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,685
Policemen outside, you mean?

1221
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,411
Come on, can't you guess?

1222
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,760
Secret door.

1223
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,768
I built this whole wing.

1224
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,367
Kept firing the architect
who built it, so no one

1225
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,603
knew quite, how it all fitted together.

1226
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,921
I can slip in and out.

1227
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,563
Anywhere I like, you know.

1228
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,601
When I get the urge.

1229
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,565
H.H. Holmes.

1230
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,444
Murder castle, but done right.

1231
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,444
I have a question for you.

1232
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,891
Why you are here?

1233
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,726
It's like you walked into my den
and laid down in front of me.

1234
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,121
Why?

1235
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,130
You know why I'm here.

1236
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,041
I'd like to hear you say it.

1237
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,485
Say it for me please.

1238
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,642
I want you to kill me.

1239
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,481
John.

1240
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,806
My car.

1241
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,561
Increase the dosage four,
five times, the toxic shock

1242
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,564
should shut me down, within about an hour.

1243
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,124
Then I'll restore the settings.

1244
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,286
Everyone assumes that it was a fault, or...

1245
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,165
- You just gave up the ghost.
- Yes.

1246
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,805
You are good at this.

1247
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,002
Before we start, tell me how you feel.

1248
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,681
I...

1249
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,843
- I feel scared.

1250
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,842
Be more specific.

1251
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,843
You only get to do this the once.

1252
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,601
Scared of dying.

1253
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,365
You wanted this though.

1254
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,124
I have reasons.

1255
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,806
But you don't actually want to die.

1256
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,007
No.

1257
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,161
Good.

1258
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,884
Say that for me.

1259
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,363
- Say it.
- I don't want to die.

1260
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,641
And again.

1261
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,326
I don't want to die.

1262
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,164
Once more for luck.

1263
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,730
I don't want to die.

1264
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,321
I don't...

1265
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,810
I don't want to die.

1266
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,170
Lovely.

1267
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,207
Here it comes.

1268
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,411
<i>Please, I don't think he's safe.</i>

1269
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,010
<i>No, he's fine, got a man on the door.</i>

1270
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,320
<i>What do you think's happened?</i>

1271
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:18,006
I don't know, something.
Mary left a message.

1272
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,366
What message?

1273
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,090
<i>John Watson,</i>

1274
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,371
<i>never accepts help, not from anyone.</i>

1275
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,286
<i>Not ever, but here's the thing,
he never refuses it.</i>

1276
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,681
<i>So, here's is what you are going to do.</i>

1277
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,126
So tell me, why are we doing this?

1278
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,521
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1279
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,643
I wanted to hear your confession.

1280
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,244
Needed to know I was right.

1281
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,524
Why do you need to die?

1282
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,285
The mortuary,

1283
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,361
your favourite room.

1284
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,689
You talk to the dead.

1285
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,401
You make your confession to them.

1286
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,565
I'm sorry, sir, what?
What do you mean?

1287
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,120
- I think the door is jammed.

1288
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,961
Oh, has that door locked itself again?

1289
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,485
Yeah, it's always doing that.

1290
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,889
<i>You can't save John,
because he won 't let you.</i>

1291
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,886
<i>He won't allow himself to be saved.</i>

1292
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,448
<i>The only way to save John,</i>

1293
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,571
<i>is to make him save you.</i>

1294
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,405
Why do you do it?

1295
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,526
Why do I kill?

1296
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,605
It's not about hatred or revenge.

1297
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,044
I'm not a dark person.

1298
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,645
Killing human beings...

1299
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,689
It just makes me...

1300
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,011
Ah. Incredibly happy.

1301
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,802
You know, in films when
you see dead people,

1302
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,171
pretending to be dead,
and it's just living people lying down?

1303
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,681
That's not what dead people look like.

1304
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,131
Dead people

1305
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,404
look like things.

1306
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,842
I like to make people into things.

1307
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,203
Then you can own them.

1308
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,969
You know what,
I'm getting a little impatient.

1309
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,606
Take a big breath if you want.

1310
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,690
<i>Go to hell, Sherlock.</i>

1311
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,285
<i>Go right into hell.</i>

1312
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,169
<i>And make it look like you mean it.</i>

1313
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,082
Murder is a very difficult
addiction to manage.

1314
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,481
People don't realise how
much work goes into it.

1315
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,050
You have to be careful.

1316
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:01,409
But if you're rich, or famous and loved,

1317
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,371
it's amazing what people
are prepared to ignore.

1318
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,281
There's always
someone desperate about to go missing,

1319
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,329
and no one is supposed to suspect murder
if it's easier to suspect

1320
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,482
something else.

1321
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,888
I just have to ration myself,
choose the right heart to stop.

1322
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,889
<i>Go and pick a fight with a bad guy,
put yourself in harm's way.</i>

1323
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,482
Maintain eye contact.

1324
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,364
Maintain eye contact.

1325
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,445
Maintain eye contact.

1326
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,570
I like to watch it happen.

1327
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,249
<i>If he thinks you need him, I swear...</i>

1328
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,240
And off we pop.

1329
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,647
<i>He will be there.</i>

1330
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,326
Mr. Holmes, you okay?

1331
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,971
What were you doing to him?
What were you doing!

1332
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,528
- He's in distress, I'm helping him!
- Restrain him now, do it.

1333
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,080
- I was trying to help him!
- Sherlock, what was he doing to you?

1334
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,400
Suffocating me.

1335
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,970
- Overdosing me.
- On what?

1336
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,371
- Saline.
- Saline?

1337
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,966
- Yeah, saline.
- What do you mean, saline?

1338
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,801
Well, obviously,
I got Nurse Cornish to switch the bags.

1339
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,484
She's a big fan, you know.

1340
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,130
Loves my blog.

1341
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,084
- You're okay?
- No of course I'm not okay.

1342
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,929
Malnourished, double kidney failure,

1343
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,367
and frankly, I've been
off my tits for weeks.

1344
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,726
What kind of doctor are you?

1345
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,811
I got my confession though, didn't I?

1346
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,641
Well, I didn't recall
making any confession.

1347
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,449
What would I be confessing to?

1348
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,040
You can listen to it later.

1349
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,202
Well, there is no confession to listen to.

1350
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,523
Oh, Mr. Holmes, I don't know
if this is relevant, but

1351
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,605
we found three potential recording
devices, in the pockets of your coat.

1352
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,851
All your possessions were searched. Sorry.

1353
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,250
There must be something
comforting about the number three,

1354
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,005
people always give up after three.

1355
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,010
What? What is it? What?

1356
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,527
Oh...

1357
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,051
- You cock.
- Yeah.

1358
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,485
Utter, utter cock.

1359
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,005
Heard you the first time.

1360
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,401
How does that open?

1361
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,126
Screw the top.

1362
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,290
- Two weeks ago?
- Three.

1363
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,647
I'm that predictable?

1364
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,287
No.

1365
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,007
I'm just a cock.

1366
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,841
It's funny.

1367
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,203
Never realised confessing
would be so enjoyable.

1368
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,890
Should have done it sooner.

1369
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,726
We'll carry on tomorrow.

1370
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,403
Well, we could carry on now,
I'm not tired.

1371
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,206
There's a loads more.

1372
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,686
Tomorrow.

1373
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,482
You know,
I am gonna be so famous now.

1374
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,486
You're already famous.

1375
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,004
Yeah, but with this...

1376
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,484
I could break America.

1377
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,809
<i>I had of course
several other back up plans.</i>

1378
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,690
<i>The trouble is, I couldn't
remember what they were.</i>

1379
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,485
And of course I hadn't really anticipated

1380
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,449
that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.

1381
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,408
Basically he trashed himself on drugs

1382
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,369
so that you'll help him,
so that you'd have something to do,

1383
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,568
something doctory,
you get that now, don't you?

1384
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,961
Still a bit troubled by the daughter.

1385
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,166
Did seem very real.

1386
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,526
She gave me information I couldn't
have acquired elsewhere.

1387
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,122
But she wasn't ever here?

1388
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,204
Interesting, isn't it?
I have theorised before

1389
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,049
that if one could attenuate
to every available

1390
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,168
data stream in the world simultaneously,

1391
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,211
it would be possible to anticipate
and deduce almost anything.

1392
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,480
Hmm.

1393
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,848
So you dreamed up a magic woman
who told you things you didn't know?

1394
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,242
That sounds about right to me.
Possibly I'm biased.

1395
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,730
Perhaps the drugs opened
certain doors in my mind.

1396
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,402
- I'm intrigued.
- Look, I know you are.

1397
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,046
Which is why we're all taking it in
turns to keep you off the sweeties.

1398
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,451
I thought we were just hanging out.

1399
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,086
Molly will be here in 20 minutes.

1400
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:39,406
Oh, I do think I can last twenty minutes
without supervision.

1401
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,207
Well, if you're sure.

1402
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,482
Christ, John, stay, talk.

1403
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,407
Um, sorry, it's just, uh, you know, Rosie.

1404
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,331
Yes, of course, Rosie.

1405
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,323
Go and solve a crime together,
make him wear the hat.

1406
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,041
- You'll be okay for 20 minutes?
- Yes, yes.

1407
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,243
Sorry, I wasn't thinking of Rosie.

1408
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,443
- No problem. Listen, uh...
- We should, uh...

1409
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,249
I'll come and see you, soon.

1410
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,326
Yes.

1411
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,289
Actually, he should wear
the hat as a special tribute to me.

1412
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,966
I'm dead.
I would really appreciate it.

1413
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,169
Oh, by the way, the recordings will
probably be inadmissible.

1414
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,287
Sorry what?

1415
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,725
Well, technically it's entrapment, so...

1416
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,041
It might get thrown out as evidence.
Not that that matters.

1417
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,122
Apparently he can't stop confessing.

1418
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,244
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1419
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,649
- Are you okay?

1420
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,169
No, I'm not okay.

1421
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,924
I'm never gonna be okay.

1422
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,402
We just have to accept that.
It is what it is.

1423
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,885
And what it is, is...

1424
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,364
- Shit.
- John, do better.

1425
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,167
You didn't kill Mary.

1426
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,485
Mary died saving your life.

1427
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,607
It's her choice.

1428
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,848
No one made her do it,
no one could ever make her do anything.

1429
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,570
But the point is,

1430
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,529
you did not kill her.

1431
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,649
In saving my life
she conferred a value on it.

1432
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,886
It is a currency I do not
know how to spend.

1433
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,125
It is what it is.

1434
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,168
I'm tomorrow six till ten,
I'll see you then.

1435
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,607
Looking forward to it.

1436
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,247
Yeah.

1437
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,650
- That noise, that's a text alert noise.
- What was that?

1438
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,929
Hmm? What was what?

1439
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,049
That's the text alert of Irene Adler,
she's the scary mad one, right?

1440
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,327
That noise.

1441
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,447
What noise?

1442
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,410
She's dead.

1443
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,481
Oh I bet she isn't dead.
I bet he saved her.

1444
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,365
Oh, my God!

1445
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,731
Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix!

1446
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,286
He's never knowingly under-clichéd, is he?

1447
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,647
John?

1448
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,766
I'm gonna make a deduction.

1449
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,806
- Oh okay, that's good.
- And if my deduction is right,

1450
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,803
you're gonna be honest and tell me, okay?

1451
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:05,166
Okay. Though I should mention that it is
possible for any given text alert

1452
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,891
- to become randomly attached to...
- Happy birthday.

1453
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,091
Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.

1454
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,644
Never knew when your birthday was.

1455
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,449
Well, now you do.

1456
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,480
Seriously, we're not going
to talk about this?

1457
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,721
Talk about what?

1458
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,609
- I mean, how does it work?
- How does what work?

1459
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:28,890
You and the woman, do you go to
a discreet Harvester sometimes, is there

1460
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,611
- nights of passion in High Wycombe?
- Oh, for God's sakes.

1461
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,291
- I don't text her back.
- Why not?

1462
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,571
You bloody moron!

1463
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,489
She's out there, she likes you,
and she's alive,

1464
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,763
and do you have the first idea
how lucky you are?

1465
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,486
Yes she's a lunatic, she's a criminal,
she's insanely dangerous,

1466
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,766
trust you to fall for a sociopath.

1467
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,205
Oh, married an assassin.

1468
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,209
But she's, you know...

1469
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,328
- What?
- Just text her back.

1470
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,970
- Why?
- Because High Wycombe

1471
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,726
is better than you are currently
equipped to understand.

1472
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,848
I once caught a triple
poisoner in High Wycombe.

1473
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,285
That's only the beginning, mate.

1474
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,371
As I think I've explain to
you many times before,

1475
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,566
romantic entanglement,

1476
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,244
while fulfilling for other people...

1477
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,924
Would complete you as a human being.

1478
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,082
- That doesn't even mean anything.
- Just text her.

1479
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,083
Phone her, do something
while there's still a chance.

1480
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,730
Because that chance doesn't last forever.

1481
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,007
Trust me, Sherlock,
it's gone before you know it.

1482
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,003
Before you know it.

1483
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,089
She was wrong about me.

1484
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,730
Mary? How so?

1485
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,448
She thought that if you put
yourself in harm's way, I'd...

1486
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,124
I'd rescue you or something.

1487
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,806
But I didn't, not 'till she told me to.

1488
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,126
And that's how this works,
that's what you're missing.

1489
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,851
She taught me to be the man
she already thought I was.

1490
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,450
Get yourself a piece of that.

1491
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,249
Look at me, you are
doing yourself a disservice.

1492
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,800
I have known many people in this world,
but made few friends,

1493
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,850
- and I can safely say...
- I cheated on her.

1494
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,890
No clever comeback?
I cheated on you, Mary.

1495
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,924
It was a woman, on the bus,

1496
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,164
and I had a plastic daisy in my hair,
I'd been playing with Rosie.

1497
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,244
And this girl just smiled at me.

1498
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,723
That's all it was, it was a smile.

1499
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,085
We texted constantly.

1500
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,084
You want to know when? Every time
you left the room, that's when.

1501
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,288
When you were feeding our daughter.

1502
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,806
When you were stopping her
from crying, that's when.

1503
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,204
That's all it was.

1504
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,925
Just texting.

1505
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,804
But I wanted more.

1506
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,971
And you know something?
I still do.

1507
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,444
I'm not the man you thought I was.

1508
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,646
I'm not that guy.

1509
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,051
I never could be.

1510
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,009
But that's the point.

1511
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,882
That's the whole point.

1512
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,688
Who you thought I was...

1513
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,562
is the man who I want to be.

1514
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,131
Well then,

1515
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,769
John Watson.

1516
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,128
Get the hell on with it.

1517
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,490
It's okay.

1518
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,164
It's not okay.

1519
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,966
No.

1520
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,209
But it is what it is.

1521
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,442
<i>So, Molly's gonna
meet us at this cake place.</i>

1522
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:10,887
<i>It's your birthday, cake is obligatory.</i>

1523
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,369
Well, I suppose a sugar high
is some sort of substitute.

1524
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,847
Behave.

1525
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,687
Right then. You know,
it's not my place to say, but,

1526
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,403
it was just texting.

1527
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,091
People text, even I text, her.

1528
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,601
I mean, woman. Bad idea.

1529
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,603
Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...

1530
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,322
It's not a pleasant thought, John.

1531
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,607
But I have this terrible
feeling from time to time

1532
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,001
that we might all just be human.

1533
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,045
- Even you?
- No.

1534
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,207
Even you.

1535
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,326
- Cake?
- Cake.

1536
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,047
Oh, erm...

1537
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,769
What. What is it?

1538
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,885
What's wrong?

1539
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,608
Seriously?

1540
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,489
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
I wear the damn hat.

1541
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,002
Isn't that right, Mary?

1542
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,921
You seem so much better, John.

1543
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,287
Yeah, I am. I think I am.

1544
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:25,249
Not all day, not every day,
but, uh, you know.

1545
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,208
- It is what it is?
- Yeah.

1546
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,087
And Rosie?

1547
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,605
Beautiful, perfect.

1548
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,283
Unprecedented in the history of children.

1549
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,089
That's not my bias,

1550
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,571
- that's scientific fact.
- Good.

1551
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,166
And Sherlock Holmes?

1552
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,366
Back to normal.

1553
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,841
Get out!
She's possessed by the devil.

1554
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,684
I swear my wife is channelling Satan!

1555
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,410
Yes, boring, go away.

1556
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,241
- I'm not channelling Satan.
- Why not?

1557
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,890
Given your immediate alternative.

1558
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,206
What about his brother?

1559
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,930
Mycroft? He's fine.

1560
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,203
So, you're off now, I won't
see you for a week?

1561
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,168
Just spending it at home.

1562
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,571
Unless she calls.

1563
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,886
The PM.

1564
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,049
- Here.
- What's this?

1565
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:18,681
My number.

1566
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,966
I already have your number.

1567
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,441
My private number.

1568
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,806
Why would I need that?

1569
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,965
I don't know.

1570
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,565
Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.

1571
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,526
Of what?

1572
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,371
Up to you.

1573
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,291
Call me.

1574
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,447
I mean obviously, normal
and fine are both relative terms

1575
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,726
when it comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.

1576
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,848
Obviously.

1577
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,567
She was real.

1578
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,443
But, I didn't mean Mycroft.
I mean the other one.

1579
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,241
Which other one?

1580
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,561
You know, the secret one.

1581
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,483
Oh, that was just something...

1582
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,722
I said. I'm sure there's...

1583
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,049
How did you know about that?
I didn't tell you that.

1584
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,402
- You must have done.
- I really didn't.

1585
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,086
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.

1586
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:37,649
Wait, you've met Sherlock
exactly once, in this room.

1587
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,801
He was off his head.

1588
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,961
Oh no, no.

1589
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,281
- I met him before that.
- When?

1590
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,962
We spent a night together.

1591
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,521
It was lovely.

1592
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,965
We had chips.

1593
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,322
You're not what I expected, Mr. Holmes.

1594
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,731
You're...

1595
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:02,927
Nicer.

1596
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,284
Culverton gave me Faith's original note.

1597
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,525
A mutual friend put us in touch.

1598
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,569
Did Sherlock ever tell
you about the note?

1599
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,087
I added some deductions for
Sherlock. He was quite good.

1600
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,888
But he didn't get the big one.

1601
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,204
In fairness though, he does
have excellent taste in chips.

1602
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,089
- What's that?
- What's what?

1603
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,924
The flower in your hair
is like I had on the bus.

1604
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,963
You looked very sweet.

1605
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,251
But then ...

1606
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,087
You have such nice eyes.

1607
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,082
Amazing, the times
a man doesn't really look at your face.

1608
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:14,609
Oh, you can hide
behind a sexy smile or a walking cane.

1609
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,806
Or just be a therapist, talking about you.

1610
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,685
All the time.

1611
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,010
Oh, please don't go anywhere, I'm sure
the therapist who actually lives here

1612
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,320
wouldn't want blood on the carpet.

1613
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,849
Oh, hang on. It's fine.

1614
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,770
She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.

1615
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,327
- Who are you?
- Isn't it obvious?

1616
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,524
Haven't you guessed?

1617
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:38,927
I'm Eurus.

1618
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,641
Eurus?

1619
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,122
Silly name, isn't it? Greek.
Means the East Wind.

1620
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,529
My parents loved silly names.

1621
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,683
Like Eurus,

1622
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,651
or Mycroft,

1623
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,006
or Sherlock.

1624
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,886
Oh, look at him.

1625
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:58,768
Didn't it ever occur to
you not even once,

1626
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:02,811
that Sherlock's secret brother
might just be Sherlock's secret sister?

1627
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,087
Oh.

1628
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,482
He's making a funny face.

1629
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,766
I think I'll put a hole in it.
