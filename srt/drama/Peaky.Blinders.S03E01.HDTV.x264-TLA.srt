young. Will there be cocaine?

Sweetheart, I am young,
informed and very well equipped.

You chose your man wisely.

Arthur, this lady wants
to play in the snow.

Kitchen, come on.

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,400
I just wish Tommy was here.

89
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,710
- Where are they?
- I don't know, Tom.

90
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,030
Arthur, John, where are they?

91
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,550
- I don't know.
- I am telling you now, we got lost.

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,510

be no bloody uniforms.

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,590
Nevertheless. Nevertheless, John.

98
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,070
Despite the bad blood,

99
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,830
I'll have none of it on my carpet.

100
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,030
Now, for Grace's sake,
nothing will go wrong.

101
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,510
Those bastards out there are her family.

102
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,270
And if you fuckers do anything
to embarrass her, your kin,

103
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,550
your cousins, your horses, your
fucking kids, you do anything...

104
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,630
Tom?

105
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,950
- .. to... What?
- What about snow?

106
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,750
Yeah, their women are
sports, I'll say that.

107
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,470
No. No. No.

108
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,150
No cocaine.

109
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,990
No cocaine.

110
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,470
No sport. No telling fortunes.

111
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,480
No racing. No fucking sucking
petrol out of their fucking cars.

112
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,510
And you, Charlie, stop
spinning yarns about me, eh?

113
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,830
I'm just trying to sell you to them, Tom.

114
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,150
But the main thing is,
you bunch of fuckers,

115
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,390
despite the provocation from the cavalry,

116
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,110
no fighting!

117
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,160
Oi!

118
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,750
No fighting.

119
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,550
No fucking fighting.

120
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,310
No fighting.

121
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,160
NO FUCKING FIGHTING!

122
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,670
Good.

123
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,000
Get the fuck off me!

124
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,990
You're needed downstairs.

125
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,790
Grace, you're needed
downstairs. People are hungry.

126
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,310
I was putting Charles to sleep.

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,430
I'll come down, but not
with you like this.

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,420
All right, fine.

129
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,470
Tommy.

130
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,710
I thought today was the reason for
the way you've been acting lately.

131
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
I know there's business on your mind.

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,190
And I know there always will be.

133
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,230
- Yeah. - Look. I am sorry
they wore their uniforms.

134
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,230
Yeah, they fucking did,
eh? They fucking did.

135
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
But I can tell it's more than that.

136
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,350
You've been like this for weeks.

137
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,230
I need you to tell me that it's
business making you like this...

138
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,620
and not regret over me.

139
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,580
Say it out loud and
I'll know if it's true.

140
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,960
It's business, Grace.

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,100
And bad, bad business it is, all round.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,270
And I'm scared, Grace.

143
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,510
I'm scared for you.

144
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,390
I'm scared for the baby.

145
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,350
And this is how I am when I'm scared.

146
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,110
It is unfamiliar to you but not to me.

147
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,600
I can fucking be scared and carry on.

148
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,160
And it's not pleasant to look
at and no joy to be around.

149
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
All right?

150
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,060
We just made vows to share everything.

152
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,460
Tell me what it is you're afraid of.

153
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,430
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

154
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,340
Arthur's speech.

155
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,420
I'm scared of fucking Arthur's speech.

156
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
All right?

157
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,200
Me too.

158
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,710
Tommy, what are you doing?

159
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,230
Tommy, there's half the British
Army waiting for us downstairs.

160
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,440
They're King's Irish. We waited
two weeks in the mud for them.

161
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,350
Tommy.

162
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,230
There are things that if I take them off

163
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,750
I won't be able to put back on.

164
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,470
That's good.

165
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,990
Hello, Mrs Shelby.

166
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,140
I'm sorry for being busy in my head.

167
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,790
Let us complete the ceremony.

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,870
Hey, listen. Listen. Listen.

169
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,790
What do you call an animal with
a prick halfway up its back?

170
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,780
A cavalry horse.

171
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,950
He gets it.

172
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,030
Fuck it. Fuck it.

173
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,310
Where the bloody hell are they?

174
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,760
You're best man, Arthur. Go and find them.

175
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,270
Yeah.

176
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,990
That's completely nonsense.

177
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,230
You know, we're part of a serious
political movement and organisation.

178
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,670
They're not "secret little
meetings", they're just meetings.

179
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,830
We talk about the world,
about the people in it,

180
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,510
about our current political
landscape and what's going on.

181
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,710
You know, we really need to re-evaluate

182
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,430
the way our government has...

183
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,110
- Very strange indeed.
- Polly, he's looking over.

184
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,830
But, erm...

185
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,220
He's coming. He bloody is.

186
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,950
Fuck. It's the wrong one.

187
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,070
What do you mean the wrong
one? How many are there?

188
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,830
There's two giving me the
eye. I prefer the other one.

189
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,020
He looked harmless.

190
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,830
It must be that bloody lipstick

191
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Tommy brought you back from New York.

192
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,350
I couldn't help noticing
you are unaccompanied.

193
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,340
I also am alone.

194
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,990
May I join you?

195
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,670
Tommy?

196
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,390
Oh. Didn't see a thing.

197
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,150
Not see a thing. Sorry, brother.

198
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,310
I need you downstairs.

199
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,510
That's all right, we're
done. Are you good?

200
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,590
- Yeah. Never been better.
- Yeah.

201
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,480
- Are you drunk?
- No. No.

202
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,270
Here.

203
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,950
All right, just one drink, then.

204
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,670
Linda's a good woman, Arthur.

205
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,070
Good whisky.

206
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,700
A good man needs to
hold out sometimes, eh?

207
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,950
I won't mention this
in my speech, then, eh?

208
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,470
Not unless you want to get cut, Arthur.

209
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,320
Sorry, sister.

210
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,990
Right. Look. Tell the maids
to break out the champagne.

211
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,510
I'll be down in a minute.

212
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,390
Champagne, yeah. OK.

213
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
- Got it right here.
- Good. - I'm ready. - Good.

214
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,340
Where are you from?

215
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,200
I'm a refugee.

216
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,750
From where?

217
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
Russia.

218
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,350
In the past few months
Thomas has developed some

219
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,200
business interests with Russia.

220
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,870
I see he has confided in you.

221
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,670
Hm.

222
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,320
You need his permission
to even speak to me.

223
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,750
My senior position within
the Shelby company means

224
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,510
I don't often have to ask permission
from anyone to do anything.

225
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,190
So perhaps you'll just tell me

226
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,520
why the fuck you're talking Russian
business on Thomas's wedding day.

227
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,190
Hold on, wait a second.

228
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,230
- So you're saying I'm not allowed a man.
- It's about your choice of man.

229
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm not allowed a man on my arm?

230
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,990
Fucking bastard.

231
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,670
Michael, speeches. Come on.

232
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,310
Arthur. You know why he
didn't come, don't you?

233
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,790
Why who didn't come?

234
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,070
My bloody man.

235
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,310
Oh, you mean the wop?

236
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,950
I just heard there was a
fire at his restaurant.

237
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,190
Midnight last night.

238
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,310
And a smashed back window
and a smell of petrol.

239
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,270
Lizzie, we tried to
talk some sense into you.

240
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,710
We did checks on him.

241
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,910
He's had five different
names in the last six years

242
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,670
- and he's got connections with the
Naples boys. - Come on, Michael.

243
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,830
What do you know about love,
about when lightning strikes?

244
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,310
So, it was lightning, hmm? Not petrol.

245
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,990
- I thought you were off the
whisky, Arthur. - Yeah, I am.

246
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,670
I'm having a couple now and again

247
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,110
to remind myself why I don't drink it.

248
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,310
You set fire to his
restaurant to stop him coming.

249
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,720
You have no right to choose who
I step out with in my own time!

250
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,720
Lizzie, you now have an important
position in this company.

251
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,300
You got the order the same as us.

252
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,120
You can do it.

253
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,790
Until further notice...

254
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,940
no fraternising with the foreigners.

255
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,030
Yeah, well, you can tell Tommy from me

256
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,440
all the girls in the office think
he's losing his fucking mind.

257
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,910
To the bride.

258
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,560
The bride.

259
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,190
And now, according to tradition,

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,790
my best man will say a few words.

261
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,440
Go on! Here he goes! Go on, Arthur!

262
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,230
I'd like to, erm... I'm
not one for speeches.

263
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,510
Sing, then!

264
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,030
I will later, John.

265
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,200
But I do, erm...

266
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,980
I do have some words written down here...

267
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,620
.. on this piece of paper.

268
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,030
This doesn't include
everything that I want to say...

269
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,390
(Arthur, just read what
we wrote down, eh?)

270
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,230
I will.

271
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,190
I will, mm-hmm.

272
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,910
But first...

273
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,280
First a few words from the heart.

274
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,500
Erm...

275
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,430
This man here, my brother, Tommy,

276
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,670
helped me survive through
some of the worst times.

277
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,750
It's a wedding, Arthur, tell a joke.

278
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,390
Yeah. Tell a joke.

279
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,310
What I am trying to say is this.

280
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,350
My brother,

281
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,200
and the love of a good woman...

282
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,160
.. pulled me through that time.

283
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
Now Tommy also has the
love of a good woman.

284
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Her name's Grace.

285
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,950
Like the grace of the good Lord.

286
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:04,270
And even though the circumstances
of their union was tragic...

287
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,830
Right, let's... Arthur,
let's raise a toast, eh?

288
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,350
To love, to peace, to marriage.

289
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,340
And to marriage.

290
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,310
Well done, Arthur. Beautiful speech.

291
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,030
Really nice.

292
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,260
Really, really nice.

293
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,390
Where's he fucking going now?

294
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,590
I think I messed it up.

295
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,750
No, not a bit.

296
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,430
You spoke with such truth.

297
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,550
And God heard you.

298
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,110
Can I have a word with
my brother, please, Linda?

299
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,260
What he was going to say was beautiful.

300
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,640
Alone, please.

301
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,480
All right. Come here.

302
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,320
Come here.

303
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,510
We talked about this, Arthur.

304
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,430
That's why we wrote it all down.

305
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,270
Most of Grace's side don't even
know her husband killed himself.

306
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,350
They think it was an accident.

307
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,950
- I know.
- You know.

308
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,390
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

309
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,040
What do you think I am, hm?

310
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,190
What do you think I am, Tommy, eh?

311
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,870
You think I'm a fucking idiot...

312
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,990
- All right, boys? - Yep. - Don't you?

313
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,390
Come on. Having a good night.

314
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,950
- You think I would say it?
- That's it. Right.

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,070
Yeah. Keep walking. You nosy bastards.

316
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,110
- Hey, you stay away from me, Tommy.
- Fucking hell.

317
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,160
You stay away from me, I've had it.

318
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,760
Ah, shit.

319
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,420
- Yeah. - Argh! - Yeah.

320
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,120
Argh.

321
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,910
Argh!

322
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,220
Ah, shit.

323
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,150
Three shots I've had, that's it.

324
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,590
- I know. - I drew the line. - I know.

325
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,590
I know you've turned a corner.

326
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,630
- Arthur. - Yeah. - I know.

327
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,950
- Yeah. I'm your best man.
- I know.

328
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,590
I wasn't going to tell no-one.

329
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,990
It's all right. It's done.

330
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,150
Get up. Get up.

331
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
Get up.

332
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,150
Right...

333
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,310
The Russians have made contact.

334
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,110
We have to get used to how
these bastards operate.

335
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,630
For them, family is a weakness
and they go after them.

336
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,750
For me, family is my strength.
And there's business to be done

337
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,070
and I need you.

338
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,870
Now, fuck speeches, fuck weddings.

339
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,920
You're my best man every fucking day.

340
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,870
OK.

341
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,070
Yeah?

342
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,550
Now go and get John, get him sobered up.

343
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,480
Find Johnny Dogs. It's the
Russians through the smoke tonight.

344
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,480
- All right.
- Good.

345
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,240
Oh, and, Arthur...

346
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,910
In future, it's not always
right to listen to Linda.

347
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,670
It's full of gypsies and blacks.

349
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,800
Grace says he exports
automobiles to the colonies.

350
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,140
Pol, now.

351
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,230
So, what does he say?

352
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,030
He won't meet you unless
you give us the name.

353
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,630
What name?

354
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,800
We were told to ask for a code
name when contact was made.

355
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,190
Constantine.

356
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
The code is Constantine.

357
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,870
Tommy said no racing, no gambling.

358
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,230
Yeah, he's changed his mind. Right!

359
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,510
Don't worry, Finn, OK?

360
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,790
Cavalry boys ride like a sack of stones.

361
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,710
John, there's an awful lot of
King's shillings around here today.

362
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,910
Now, out of loyalty to the regiment,

363
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,950
they'll all be putting their money
on this bad boy that I filled up

364
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,950
with morphine and water.

365
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,270
Here, Tommy's all right
if I do the book, is he?

366
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,710
He said betting's OK,

367
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,670
but all proceeds go to the
Shelby Foundation charity.

368
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,750
This charity of his for real, then?

369
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,870
He says he wants to be seen giving
back to the poor of Birmingham.

370
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,910
That'll be me, John. Myself, if I
can't earn a shilling here tonight.

371
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,150
- Huh? - They'll make him
fucking Lord Mayor next.

372
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,990
- That's the idea, Charlie boy.
- Fucking hell.

373
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,630
Right. All you lot make as
much noise and fuss as you can.

374
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,110
Especially fucking you.

375
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,190
Ah. So, we're a fucking
distraction, John, is it?

376
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,190
Tommy's doing business on a
night he should be just fucking.

377
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,270
Right, place your bets with me.
Your favourites. Your favourites.

378
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,710
Come on, boys.

379
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,510
Cos I hope my wife's friend doesn't
fall off the fucking horse.

380
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,990
Come on!

381
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,510
For charity?!

382
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,030
Shut up.

383
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,270
Ah, you found it.

384
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,390
We nearly gave up.

385
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Did he tell you what
my business with him is?

386
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,590
The same shit the Turks used to smoke.

387
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,600
I wonder, why does he trust his
aunt more than his brothers?

388
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,760
Go and watch the race, boys.

389
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
The Turk's clean.

390
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,000
- I am Russian.
- Same fucking thing.

391
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,550
So you make contact on my wedding day.

392
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,510
You now have very powerful enemies,

393
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,310
at the Soviet Embassy and
within your own government.

394
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,950
You are being watched --

395
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,710
at your house, your office,

396
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,030
your clubs, your bars.

397
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,750
You best be quick or I'll be
missed. Where's the money?

398
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,400
The Duke's niece is
bringing it from London.

399
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,550
I was told money on contact.

400
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,800
10,000 in US dollars.

401
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,150
My employer only trusts members
of his family with cash.

402
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,280
She will be at Snow Hill
Station at ten o'clock.

403
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,750
A woman alone in Birmingham
with 10,000 in cash.

404
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,590
She also has a revolver.

405
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,110
- Oh, I see.
- I thought you trusted women.

406
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,470
I don't trust Birmingham.
I'll have her picked up.

407
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,390
- By who?
- By the police, pal.

408
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
This is our city.

409
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,190
Fucking beautiful horse, Tom.

410
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,830
Beautiful.

411
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,630
- He's a natural, that boy.
- Yeah. Good posture.

412
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,110
- Rides like Dad.
- Right, listen to me.

413
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,150
Tell Johnny Dogs and his boys
to light a fire in the woods.

414
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
A big one, to take meat.

415
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,400
Send Finn to watch the gates.
Moss is bringing someone.

416
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,720
You don't?

417
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,510
I just needed to bring you
somewhere nobody could see.

418
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,390
But your friend gave this to
me. He said you all did it.

419
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,150
Not me. But it's all right.

420
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,540
Go on.

421
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,060
I see you don't either.

422
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,230
Don't be silly. Everyone does.

423
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,190
- So go on, then. Cut the snow.
- We call it Tokyo.

424
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,390
We call it whatever the customer calls it.

425
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,560
In London we were told
you were all gangsters.

426
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,870
So that's why you got on the
train to dirty old Birmingham.

427
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,190
For a dirty old night.

428
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,190
- You don't look like the others.
- That's the idea.

429
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,640
I put it all together but I don't partake.

430
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,060
See, I've got a bright future, you see?

431
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,070
Mapped out.

432
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,220
But you want me to be
like them, don't you?

433
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,150
There's a cavalry officer
stationed in Ceylon.

434
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,480
When his tour of duty ends
in March, we will be engaged.

435
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,710
So I have a bright future too.

436
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,430
Mapped out.

437
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,220
But you want to try things first.

438
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
No. Keep it.

439
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,080
As if I were a whore.

440
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,180
If that's the game you want to play...

441
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,150
Polly.

442
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,040
Hello, Grace.

443
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,500
You look absolutely beautiful.

444
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,350
Welcome to the family.

445
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,980
Oh, I see. Tommy's orders.

446
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,710
No upsets tonight.

447
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,700
Your hair, everything. Beautiful.

448
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,910
Do you know where he is?

449
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,070
Yes.

450
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
Yes, I do.

451
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,560
You know, Tommy really wants to
keep certain things a secret from me.

452
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,950
But it's very hard when
you're man and wife.

453
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,190
We were late coming down
because we were having sex.

454
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,180
Afterwards he told me everything.

455
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,480
Royalist Russians buying weapons
to fight the Bolsheviks in Georgia.

456
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,350
A lost cause, Tommy says.

457
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,990
Churchill is the go-between but
it's against government policy

458
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,140
so everything must be kept a secret.

459
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,660
You know it's begun.

460
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,040
They started the business tonight.

461
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,840
No.

462
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,140
I didn't.

463
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,680
But you just told me, so thank you.

464
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Let's not forget, I used
to do this for a living.

465
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,380
Oh, I haven't forgotten, sweetheart.

466
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,870
It's only Thomas that's
forgotten what you are.

467
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,630
Ladies and gentlemen.

468
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,470
The bride and the groom
will now dance alone.

469
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,340
Polly just told me there's
business being done.

470
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,300
I didn't ask them to come.

471
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Tommy, please don't let
anything happen tonight.

472
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,280
Just get this business done and
get away from things like this.

473
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,790
I'll run the foundation,

474
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,780
you run the tracks and sell cars.

475
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,800
Promise me. Hm?

476
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,540
A wedding vowel.

477
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
I promise.

478
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,920
No guns in the house and
Charles will never see one.

479
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,140
I love you, Thomas Shelby.

480
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,710
You keep us safe.

481
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,870
I love you.

482
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,320
And I promise I will make us safe.

483
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,700
Ladies and gentlemen, you may now join.

484
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,500
Gatehouse. Come on.

485
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,070
Tommy, Arthur, Collins,

486
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,640
may I introduce you to the Grand
Duchess Tatiana Petrovna...

487
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,750
.. from Tbilisi, Georgia?

488
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,230
Grand Duchess, may I introduce
you to the Shelby brothers?

489
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,680
Small Heath, Birmingham.

490
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,420
And, erm, good luck with this one, Tom.

491
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,070
Give me the money.

492
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,870
I was told to give it to Mr Kaledin.

493
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,820
Whoever it is up there,
he gave the wrong name.

494
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,910
We asked him the name and
he gave the wrong one.

495
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,760
- What name did he give?
- No.

496
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,230
I don't trust any of you.

497
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,980
Now you give me the money.

498
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,270
I know Mr Kaledin by sight
from Tbilisi. Is his hair dark?

499
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,790
The instructions I was given
was anyone using the wrong

500
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,080
code name was an infiltrator
for the Soviet Embassy.

501
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,030
Just let me go to the house.

502
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,580
I do not want this shit
anywhere near my fucking house.

503
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,870
All I know is no variations.

504
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,710
That's from Churchill himself.

505
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,840
Whoever is up at the house, he
gave the wrong fucking name.

506
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,840
And you do this to me on
my fucking wedding day.

507
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,160
The money is in the car, Mr Shelby.

508
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,020
Fetch it out and count it.

509
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,840
Good. Finn.

510
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,560
Yeah. We're good.

511
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,150
You can go. Moss.

512
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Can you do it?

513
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,020
Can you kill?

514
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,800
Moss, you take the Duchess
back to Birmingham.

515
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,310
Righto, Tom.

516
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,030
Go on, love.

517
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,880
That's right.

518
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,830
You've got to tell me the reason,

519
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,280
otherwise I'll never be able to trust you.

520
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,630
The truth is...

521
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,790
.. that I slept with the wife of
one of the colonels who sat for me.

522
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,440
But that was 12 years ago...

523
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,620
.. and the aristocracy don't
believe in forgiveness.

524
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,940
Neither do the Shelbys.

525
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,150
So we kill him?

526
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,870
He's a Red.

527
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,990
We're being paid by the Whites.
It's part of the contract.

528
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,580
Contract!

529
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,030
We should never have got into this, Tom.

530
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,220
There was no choice.

531
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,870
A factory break-in, that's what you said.

532
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
Yeah, that's what it is.

533
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,060
There's some shit that goes with it.

534
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,920
And who shovels it? Hm?

535
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,080
Who fucking shovels it? Eh?

536
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,230
- I fucking know.
- Arthur.

537
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,020
- I fucking know.
- Arthur...

538
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,990
There's ten times where
that's coming from, ten times,

539
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,550
for lifting vehicles off
a fucking shop floor.

540
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,990
Vehicles, Tommy. Fucking vehicles.

541
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,350
Nothing about tanks.

542
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,750
Arthur, you listen to me.

543
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,790
You listen to me, all right?

544
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,830
There are powerful people in this country

545
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,870
who want to help these mad bastards,

546
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,390
including the King, Churchill
and half the fucking Tory party.

547
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,390
And if we refuse, Arthur,
if we fucking refuse,

548
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,830
they will see to it that we
hang for all of our many sins.

549
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,270
Now, we've never earned
money like this. Never.

550
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,870
We'll use it to buy the
wharf at Boston docks.

551
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,920
That's why I've asked for dollars.

552
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,400
And when it's done it's business as usual.

553
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Come on, brother. It's my wedding night.

554
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,670
- Where's John? - Looking
for Esme. - Right.

555
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,950
Ruben Oliver. Portrait artist.

556
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,320
I really enjoyed the depiction
of you in the dining room.

557
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,280
Nice to meet you, Mr Oliver.

558
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,640
Danny, ragtime.

559
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,350
So, where were we?

560
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,110
- Crimea. - I mean before
I bored you with war.

561
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,640
- Politics.
- Yes.

562
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,070
You are the only one in your
family who is a communist.

563
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,520
Some of them are, they just don't know it.

564
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,590
And you are very close family, yes?

565
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,740
Mm, always within punching distance.

566
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,270
What does that mean?

567
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,420
It means yeah, we're a close family.

568
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,640
Arthur?

569
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,540
I do apologise for the interruption.

570
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,110
There is a woman here
to see you, Mr Kaledin.

571
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
She just arrived.

572
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,070
- So Tatiana made it from
London safely? - Yes.

573
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,220
- Where is she?
- Out by the stables.

574
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,580
Can I use the lavatory?

575
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,620
You can piss outside...

576
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,510
.. by the stables.

577
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,590
Very sensible idea, Mr Shelby.

578
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,640
Clear the air away from the ladies.

579
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,710
We are rather like
generals here, aren't we?

580
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,870
Watching our men do battle.

581
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,280
We are a bit too close to the
fighting to be generals, surely.

582
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,670
You know, Mr Shelby, some of
us only agreed to come today

583
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,990
to bless this union because
of your exemplary war record.

584
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,080
But as Grace's uncle, and a kind
of father to her for many years...

585
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:50,550
.. I am still deeply uneasy about
the many stories of corruption

586
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,340
and violence.

587
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,380
Drink the fucking wine and smile.

588
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,310
That's what I'm doing.

589
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,380
Oh, you got me good there.

590
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,480
Oh, you fucking bastard.

591
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,470
- Don't shoot.
- No!

592
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,870
- For the love of
God. Don't shoot. - No!

593
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,190
- No! - For the love of
God! - No! No! No! No! No!

594
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,910
- No!
- For the love of God!

595
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,960
- What was that?
- Probably just a car backfiring.

596
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,120
It wasn't the day I was expecting.

597
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,240
Nor me.

598
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,030
But it's over now.

599
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,620
Tomorrow it'll be just us.

600
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,440
Come here.

601
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,060
The water froze in my car.

602
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,780
They said I could stay.

603
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,960
I know this is preposterous.

604
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,940
Plenty of other rooms to stay in.

605
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,230
- Goodnight, Mr Oliver.
- You have my card.

606
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,480
Any time you're in
London we could have tea.

607
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,780
I went looking for you.

608
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,200
I thought you'd be in here.

609
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,000
I knew it.

610
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,100
I wanted to end with a bit of peace.

611
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,590
Look what I found.

612
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,440
It's beautiful. Thanks.

613
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,520
Arthur, you mustn't worry about
what happened with the speech.

614
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,400
What was in your heart was beautiful.

615
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,940
God hears all the speeches
that don't get said.

616
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,880
And isn't it nice to still be
yourself at this time of night?

617
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,880
Close your eyes, Arthur, and spend
a minute thinking about that.
