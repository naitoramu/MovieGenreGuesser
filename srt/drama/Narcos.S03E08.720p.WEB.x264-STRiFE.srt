2
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,497
Come. It's gonna be fine.

3
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,582
Nothing is going to happen to you.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,418
Please...

5
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,551
Please...

6
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,639
No.

7
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,429
Take that with you.

8
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,803
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,145
Were you shot?

10
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,312
No.

11
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,315
Get him out.

12
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,444
- You're scaring him.
- Out!

13
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,744
What happened last night...

14
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,537
someone pays.

15
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,750
We took care of Calderón,

16
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,086
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

17
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,840
Where the fuck were the guards?

18
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,010
Where the fuck were our men?

19
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,599
How the fuck did they know
where you were, Dad? How the fuck...?

20
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,896
We have a rat.

21
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,064
An informant.

22
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,193
They found my ledger.

23
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,655
Hey, what about Enrique?

24
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,494
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

25
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,376
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

26
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,169
Girls, please.

27
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,298
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

28
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,053
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

29
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,360
- Hello?
<i>- Salcedo.</i>

30
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,363
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

31
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,698
<i>David.</i>

32
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,414
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

33
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,333
but I'm monitoring my radio.

34
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,878
- Have you talked to Enrique?
<i>- Why?</i>

35
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,551
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

36
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,637
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

37
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,599
Do you have any problem with that?

38
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,935
I'll find him.

39
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,021
<i>Good. Bring him in.</i>

40
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,189
<i>And Salcedo, you come, too.</i>

41
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,540
I stand by the operation,
Minister, as does General Serrano.

42
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,792
Who was in Bogotá at the time of the raid,

43
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,211
while you and your men were there
for five hours,

44
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,464
drilling holes, breaking furniture.

45
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,674
We were one minute away
from getting Miguel Rodríguez.

46
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,925
But you did not.

47
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,055
I need you to hand over all intel,
including informants,

48
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,848
over to a special prosecutor.

49
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,061
And I'm afraid the DEA can no longer
be part of this operation.

50
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,812
- You're taking us off?
- Yes, I am.

51
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,232
Minister, we recovered something
from the house.

52
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,737
It's a ledger.

53
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,160
Cartel accounts, transactions,
going back years.

54
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,288
- What is this? I don't see names.
- It's coded.

55
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:39,542
It's bribes, money laundering...
cocaine sales.

56
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,546
- Cali's whole operation.
- That's right.

57
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,385
- And do you have someone who can read it?
- There are two possibilities.

58
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,720
There's the cartel accountant,
Guillermo Pallomari.

59
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,557
Yeah, but he's underground. Maybe worse.

60
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,186
And there's the money launderer
we extradited from Curaçao,

61
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,521
Franklin Jurado.

62
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,317
Jurado's the most important witness
to this case and he's in U.S. custody.

63
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,737
We're not handing him over
to a special prosecutor.

64
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,532
So you're welcome
to keep the ledger, Minister...

65
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,451
but we have the only guy who can read it.

66
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:26,798
Then, Agent Peña,
I suppose you have to see this out.

67
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,053
- Ambassador.
- Minister.

68
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,776
You make my job a lot fucking harder,
you know that?

69
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,448
Now you told me the only way Jurado talks
is if you find his wife.

70
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,786
Do you have any idea where she is?

71
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,372
I know someone who might.

72
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,251
<i>After the fall of Escobar,</i>

73
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,814
<i>Medellín went from being
the most dangerous city in Colombia...</i>

74
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,423
<i>to one of its safest.</i>

75
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,468
<i>This wasn't a result
of the end of cocaine trafficking.</i>

76
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,303
<i>That was alive and well.</i>

77
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>It was due
to the new godfather of Medellín.</i>

78
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,603
<i>His name is Diego Murillo,
but you know him as Don Berna.</i>

79
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,526
Did you find her?

80
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,322
Sure you don't want something?

81
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,075
- The<i> picada</i> here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

82
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,331
Pretty girl.

83
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,875
Long way from home.

84
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,232
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

85
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,853
I'm imagining the headline...

86
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:09,818
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle." Fuck.

87
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,073
- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

88
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,953
I'm going to help you
rescue the Barbie doll.

89
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,292
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

90
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,171
They can help us.

91
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:35,718
They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

92
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,858
What's it going to cost?

93
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,026
Cheap.

94
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,905
You just have to make me a promise, Peña.

95
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,451
When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list...

96
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,746
you pick up the phone and call me.

97
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,876
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

98
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,170
I see now.

99
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,507
A get-out-of-jail-free card.

100
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,553
Exactly.

101
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,182
To us, Peña.

102
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,645
Enrique!

103
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,690
Boss.

104
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,442
Open the door. Quick.

105
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,073
- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

106
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,703
- What happened?
- David has been calling.

107
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,748
What for? He never called before.

108
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,377
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big fuck up.

109
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,796
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

110
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,469
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

111
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,764
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

112
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,892
I should just run, bro.

113
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,269
Like Córdova?

114
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,063
What? It doesn't matter!

115
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,441
Stay, run. It's the same fucking thing!

116
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,526
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

117
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,195
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?

118
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,697
Nobody is going to die.

119
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,952
But right now,
let's just get you to tomorrow, Enrique.

120
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,173
Keep paging him
until he hits us back.

121
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,508
Nothing else we can do.

122
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,759
Fuck.

123
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,180
We should've arrested him.

124
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,142
You know, brought him in for assault
or something to save him.

125
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,312
Fuck. I hope we didn't
hang him out to dry.

126
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,941
I thought you didn't like him.

127
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,361
Yeah, doesn't mean I want him dead.

128
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,666
Why the fuck do I have
to hide here? I didn't do anything.

129
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,454
I know you didn't do anything.

130
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,708
This is David being an idiot.

131
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:18,131
But... trust me.
Have some patience. I'll handle it.

132
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,010
Jorge...

133
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,223
last week,
when you told me to not say anything...

134
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,811
- about the DEA and their safe house...
- Hey.

135
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,064
That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up?

136
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,983
Stay focused.

137
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,734
Sit down.

138
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,111
Sit down.

139
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,952
It's very important you do what I say.

140
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,079
Don't leave this room.

141
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,707
And don't call anyone.

142
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,045
Not your mother, your brother
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

143
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,340
Hey, look at me.

144
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,260
We'll get you through this.

145
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,971
I promise.

146
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,147
Thank you, Jorge.

147
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,941
Seriously.

148
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,451
- Jorge.
- Fercho, how's it going?

149
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,082
Don Miguel.

150
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,001
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

151
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,007
I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

152
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,134
but trust me, I'll find him.

153
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,096
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

154
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,806
He's a man we can trust.

155
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,018
The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.

156
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,438
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

157
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,651
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

158
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,278
I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

159
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,155
and we don't know them, David.

160
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,033
I find that funny, you know?

161
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,746
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

162
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,624
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge.

163
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,875
Huh?

164
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,671
When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

165
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:28,094
Don Miguel, I've been investigating
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

166
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,973
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

167
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,056
Dad...

168
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,894
Dad, please.

169
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,147
It could be.

170
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,232
It could be.

171
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,818
But you know what, Jorge?

172
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,322
That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

173
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,783
Yes, sir.

174
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,956
Someone sang and I want to know
who the fuck it was.

175
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,253
Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

176
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,922
We fucking fix this once and for all.

177
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,530
- Hi, fellas.
- Sir.

178
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,865
Welcome.

179
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,116
Hello.

180
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,494
<i>War makes for strange alliances,</i>

181
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,287
<i>putting you into business
with people that,</i>

182
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,499
<i>under other circumstances,
you wouldn't even shake hands with.</i>

183
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,375
Great machine.

184
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,713
You people know how to build
a fucking assault chopper.

185
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,591
<i>The same is true of your enemies.</i>

186
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,551
<i>They will unite when they need to.</i>

187
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,722
<i>FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia,</i>

188
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,975
<i>were a guerrilla army
about 17,000 strong...</i>

189
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,521
<i>engaged in the longest civil war
in modern history.</i>

190
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,776
<i>And in the early days of that war,
how did they finance their struggle?</i>

191
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
<i>Kidnapping.</i>

192
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,364
<i>Wealthy Colombians would pay a ransom</i>

193
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,741
<i>to have their loved ones
returned unharmed.</i>

194
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,161
<i>So when the Cali cartel
wanted to keep someone on ice,</i>

195
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,705
<i>safely hidden somewhere
in the middle of the jungle,</i>

196
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,415
<i>they hired the pros.</i>

197
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,252
<i>For a hefty fee, of course.</i>

198
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,796
Nice look, Berna.

199
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,048
You're coming on the raid?

200
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,050
Thanks, but no.

201
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm coming to make sure
all goes well with our friends.

202
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,180
Look at me.

203
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,933
Do you think an important man like me...

204
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,729
is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

205
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,612
You don't know how to take a joke.

206
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,422
I'll go in.

207
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,215
Sure.

208
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,011
But they go with you.

209
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:39,952
What about you, brother?
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

210
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,203
Calm down, Gilberto.

211
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,206
<i>Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.</i>

212
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,961
You don't want to surrender,
and you let them get the goddamn ledger!

213
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:53,132
Since you were a kid, I had to tell you
what to do and what not to...

214
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,258
<i>You know what, Gilberto?</i>

215
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,763
Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.
Why don't you just shut up?

216
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,100
He's fucking lost his mind.

217
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,103
All these acts of violence
in the North Valley

218
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,314
are straining our friends' patience.

219
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,609
Any surrender deal's hanging by a thread.

220
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,527
Uncle Miguel has to see that.

221
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,946
I told him, no violence.

222
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,492
Is this all my fault?

223
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,496
Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

224
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,000
Franklin Jurado.

225
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,713
I need to reach out to Chepe. Or Pacho.

226
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,840
But how the fuck...?

227
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,927
There's no one else I can trust with this.

228
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,804
Let's see...

229
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,808
Dad.

230
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,653
Nicolás...

231
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,701
I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

232
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,462
Hello.

233
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,550
Any news?

234
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,802
He has a girlfriend
on the other side of town.

235
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,932
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

236
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,143
Ah... Thanks.

237
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,437
I think I'll wait here.

238
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,607
You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

239
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,944
So now what?

240
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,490
Now you go to Toro Negro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

241
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,576
He'll give you
an assignment from my father.

242
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,996
Why didn't he call me?

243
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,125
I'm going to explain something to you.

244
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,713
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

245
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
Yes, sir.

246
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:05,181
Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

247
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,955
<i>Coming up to coordinates Kirk 5-7,
maneuver incoming.</i>

248
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,793
<i>Private militias
not only weren't illegal in Colombia,</i>

249
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,044
<i>they were encouraged.</i>

250
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,507
<i>A government program called CONVIVIR
was started in 1994.</i>

251
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,842
<i>And it authorized private security forces</i>

252
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,386
<i>to take up arms
against the communist guerrillas.</i>

253
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:49,642
<i>A free pass for crimes against humanity,
sponsored by Uncle Sam.</i>

254
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,812
Gentlemen. So good to see you again.

255
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,314
Third generation night vision goggles.

256
00:21:55,815 --> 00:22:00,820
The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

257
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:07,451
Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

258
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,540
<i>The Castaños ran
the largest private militia in Colombia.</i>

259
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,961
<i>Their AUC,</i>
<i>or</i> AutodefensasUnidas de Colombia,

260
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,004
<i>numbered in the tens of thousands.</i>

261
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,299
<i>Their victims...
in the hundreds of thousands.</i>

262
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,385
<i>Theirs was a perpetual war.</i>

263
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,098
<i>And if you're hunting communist guerrillas
in the jungle, they were your only call.</i>

264
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,434
This one has AFCS.

265
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,980
And the 701 engine. Hmm.

266
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,360
- Not like last time.
- Last time?

267
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,195
The CIA.

268
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,574
They had us out here hunting commies
on Christmas day.

269
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,410
- That's real dedication.
- It is God's work.

270
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,037
Merry Christmas.

271
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,641
<i>My dad trusts him, but...
did you see him?</i>

272
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,019
<i>That son of a bitch
looks nervous, right?</i>

273
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:19,481
<i>Never stopped
adjusting the mirror, staring.</i>

274
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,234
<i>I kind of love how much
this motherfucker hates me.</i>

275
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,156
<i>Our man in Bogotá
confirmed there must be an informant.</i>

276
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,365
<i>Huh?</i>

277
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,577
<i>Salcedo has to be the one
the gringos are calling "Natalia."</i>

278
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,413
<i>I'm going to love
killing that motherfucker.</i>

279
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,042
<i>You know who else I am going to kill?
His arrogant wife.</i>

280
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,878
<i>I'm going to leave
those poor girls orphans.</i>

281
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,421
<i>Poor things.</i>

282
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,714
<i>You can adopt them.</i>

283
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,300
<i>You son of a bitch...</i>

284
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,398
Answer.

285
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,738
<i>This is Paola, leave a message.</i>

286
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,073
Hello, love, it's me.

287
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,409
Paola, listen, I need you to call me back.

288
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,078
It's very important.

289
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,061
3 NEW MESSAGES

290
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,063
DELETE?

291
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,940
CONFIRM

292
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,400
0 NEW MESSAGES

293
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,162
Take me to where you stashed him,
Jorge Salcedo.

294
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,583
Stashed who?

295
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,377
Pallomari.

296
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,008
Are we taking him someplace?

297
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,010
Uh-uh.

298
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,429
I see.

299
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,109
What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

300
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,654
I have a business to run, Guillermo.

301
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:13,864
A meeting with who?

302
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,701
With Fredy. We're meeting a new client.

303
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:22,122
Fredy? Patricia,
the police almost caught Miguel yesterday.

304
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,208
For fuck's sake.

305
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,502
What's the problem?

306
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,004
You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

307
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,423
- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

308
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,510
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

309
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,553
Yes, but always within limits.

310
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,223
You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

311
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,935
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organization...

312
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:48,732
None of that matters, Patricia, none,
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

313
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,568
You're giving me a headache.

314
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,197
Listen to me.

315
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,827
My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

316
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,216
It's just a couple hours.

317
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,680
Call me if there's a problem.

318
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,994
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

319
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,250
What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

320
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,837
Hope that we don't.

321
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,344
We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

322
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:07,561
The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

323
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,732
That's great.

324
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,359
When was the last time you saw her?

325
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,278
Eight years.

326
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,823
Eight long years.

327
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,702
Why so long since last time you saw her?

328
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,581
You know, she was abroad.

329
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,751
- In Japan.
- Japan?

330
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,170
Working?

331
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,883
She fucked a police captain.

332
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,510
Then tried to turn me in.

333
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,640
All these years, I've been hanging around
her parents' house

334
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,475
waiting for her to come back.

335
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:52,522
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

336
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,274
She came back.

337
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,949
Beautiful day. Right?

338
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:06,954
How many tents, give or take?

339
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,706
I think around 20.

340
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,169
The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

341
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,216
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

342
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,759
Sun sets in three hours.

343
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,429
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

344
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,267
Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

345
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,769
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

346
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:35,357
Once the lights go, they'll use
guidelines strung into the jungle.

347
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,986
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

348
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:44,324
Once we find one of those ropes...

349
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,871
It's a fucking slaughter.

350
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:50,956
Berna.

351
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,352
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

352
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,855
Listen to me, Peña.

353
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,232
You want the girl...

354
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,985
there will be a body count.

355
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,903
This is a war zone.

356
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,825
But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

357
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,955
I need to get her back.

358
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,835
Just to be clear...

359
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,714
something goes wrong...

360
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,843
you still keep your promise.

361
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:12,204
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

362
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,998
- Then I come in.
- Okay.

363
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,671
Pallomari.

364
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
Pallomari!

365
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,501
He's not here, of course.

366
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,881
No luggage.

367
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,512
Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

368
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,434
You know, Pallomari, he's the smart one.

369
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,438
Guess that's why he's the accountant.

370
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,939
And not a thug.

371
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,111
Hey, Salcedo.

372
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,322
You'll need to find him.

373
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,992
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

374
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,075
I'll take care of it.

375
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,996
Let me know when you have him.

376
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,835
I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

377
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,795
Oh.

378
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:44,880
Sure.

379
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,551
Good luck then.

380
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,619
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- Salcedo! Busy today.

381
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,702
<i>Listen...</i>

382
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,080
any chatter from Pallomari?

383
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,209
None I've heard. But we got him.

384
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,338
- Who?
<i>- Enrique.</i>

385
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,217
He called his brother, the idiot.

386
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,177
<i>David's on his way to get him.</i>

387
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,930
That's great news.

388
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,599
Miguel must be pleased.

389
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,588
- David?
<i>- We have him.</i>

390
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,383
Yes?

391
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,885
<i>He showed up at the house?</i>

392
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,556
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

393
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,695
You ever hear anything from Judy?

394
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,572
Not since you sold her out.

395
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,325
Who would've thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

396
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,953
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

397
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,538
It's good.

398
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,082
You should see my house.

399
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:49,212
I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week. My wife loves it.

400
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,131
Your wife?

401
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,968
I'm a family man.

402
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,347
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

403
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,934
Guess catching guys like me...

404
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,938
makes it all worth it. Right?

405
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,741
Don't forget the suitcase.

406
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,201
Keep going!

407
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,371
Come on. Let's go!
Assume position!

408
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,471
<i>Be advised, team: five minutes to LZ.</i>

409
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,388
Let's see how our new toys work.

410
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:09,977
Get ready.

411
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,066
God bless America.

412
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,519
Ah...
Our guest of honor's arrived.

413
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,400
What's going on here?

414
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,116
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

415
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,883
Alpha in position.

416
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,010
Tell him what you told us.

417
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:27,722
Huh?

418
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,808
Salcedo knew about the DEA.

419
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,102
You're going to talk to me
like a man, motherfucker.

420
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,730
Salcedo works with the DEA!

421
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,483
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

422
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,446
He knew where they were at
and he told me to watch them.

423
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,574
And he told me not to tell you.

424
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,140
<i>Charlie in position.</i>

425
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
Bravo in position.

426
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,717
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

427
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,803
<i>Copy that.
We're going to push them out.</i>

428
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,681
<i>We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.</i>

429
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,851
Is that true, Jorge?

430
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,434
Tell me.

431
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,521
Tell me.

432
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,190
Are you working with the DEA?

433
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,903
Sir... it's true
I've been successful tracking the DEA.

434
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,698
But saying that I knew
where their safe house is, that's absurd.

435
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,866
That's absurd.

436
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,452
<i>Rotor ETA five seconds. We have visual.</i>

437
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,257
<i>FARC is on the move.
They're going dark.</i>

438
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:49,596
<i>Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.</i>

439
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,562
Let's move.

440
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,440
They're about to kill me because of you,
motherfucker!

441
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,526
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

442
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,654
If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

443
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,034
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

444
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,493
You son of a bitch!

445
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,746
Let go of me!
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

446
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,957
- Let it go, motherfucker!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

447
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,002
What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, motherfucker?!

448
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,211
Cut the bullshit!

449
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,053
<i>All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.</i>

450
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,890
<i>And don't be pussies.
This is easy. Get ready.</i>

451
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,935
<i>This shit is on!</i>

452
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,690
I'm tired of this, Dad.

453
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,359
Sir, no.

454
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,362
David, please. What is this?

455
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,198
- Sir, I have no idea...
- Dad...

456
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,959
What the fuck is that?

457
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,093
What the fuck is that?

458
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,054
Huh?

459
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,014
Is that you, motherfucker? Huh?

460
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,808
- No.
- What the fuck is that?

461
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,401
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

462
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,904
Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.

463
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,909
<i>Let's give those fucking
guerrillas a rain of bullets!</i>

464
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,870
<i>They're in the river! Give them lead!</i>

465
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,000
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

466
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,584
It's American high-end tech.

467
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,963
- Don Miguel, please.
- Shut up.

468
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,215
- What the fuck does it say?
- Let's see.

469
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,218
These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

470
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,638
Motherfucker, you're going to have
my family killed dragging me into this!

471
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:57,974
It's not yours?

472
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,183
It's not yours, Enrique?

473
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,103
- Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.
- Shh!

474
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,356
I swear on my mom
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel.

475
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,941
Can they track us with this shit?

476
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
I think so, sir.

477
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,861
Motherfucker!

478
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,531
- No.
- Don't move.

479
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,994
- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

480
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,579
No! Let me go!

481
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,125
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

482
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,377
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

483
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,504
Ah! Don Miguel!

484
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,387
Look, Jorge.

485
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,181
Your friend.

486
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,644
- Christina.
- Don't. Don't.

487
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,688
Stay where you are.

488
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,772
Put the gun down!

489
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,232
Don't move.

490
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,943
- Stay still.
- Please.

491
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,267
One more step and...

492
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,589
The rat is dead.

493
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,099
What's wrong?

494
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,267
Start.

495
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:29,808
- Feistl.
<i>- I have her.</i>

496
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,193
Get Franklin ready.

497
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,547
Yes, I know my signature.

498
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,926
- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

499
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,010
Where's Mom?

500
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,179
Jorge?

501
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,265
She doesn't want to see you.

502
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,225
Paola!

503
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,226
Paola!

504
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:49,812
Paola!

505
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,939
Have some respect. This is my mom's house.

506
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,028
What's going on?

507
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:01,908
What is it?

508
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,495
What's going on?

509
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,332
Breathe.

510
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,171
What happened?

511
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,716
What's going on? Come here.

512
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,580
In less than an hour,
we're on that plane.

513
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,460
Your husband knows.

514
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,922
He'll be waiting for you.

515
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,762
It's all behind you now, Christina.

516
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,603
And you think I should thank you for that?

517
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:15,814
No.

518
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,442
No, I don't.

519
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,699
No, you think you're a hero
because you, what,

520
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,910
executed a bunch of farmers to get me out

521
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,579
so that my husband would testify for you?

522
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,334
I did what I had to do
and I'm sorry for what happened to you.

523
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:41,257
No.

524
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,093
No, you're not.

525
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,928
And you know it.

526
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,807
You're a piece of shit.

527
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,940
- Salcedo?
<i>- I know where Miguel is.</i>

528
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,193
This needs to happen right now.

529
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,694
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

530
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,655
<i>Your code name for me? Natalia?</i>

531
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,825
- What about it?
<i>- They know. You have a leak.</i>

532
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:52,036
<i>The cartel knows about it.</i>

533
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,497
<i>It won't be long before
they know about me.</i>

534
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,501
This needs to happen now or I'm dead.

535
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,807
Call for you. Number four.

536
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,560
Hello?

537
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,231
Hello?

538
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,358
Hello?

539
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,484
Brother.

540
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,029
That phone doesn't work.

541
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,615
Try number five.

542
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,126
You're Colombian.

543
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,378
Right?

544
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,214
I'm from Cali.

545
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,235
Hello?

546
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,445
Hello?

547
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,211
Yeah?

548
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,006
Hey... it's been taken care of.

549
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,937
Yeah?

550
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,775
Yeah, we're about to get on the plane.
We'll be in Miami...

551
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,326
When?

552
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,378
Let me call you back.
