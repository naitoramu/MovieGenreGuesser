1
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:13,364
Yo, I thought I was going
to see some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,689
I didn't say she actually
painted vaginas.

3
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:22,732
I said

4
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:27,264
some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

5
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:30,512
Seriously?

6
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:32,427
Not even close.

7
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:37,403
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,664
Everyday items, her surroundings.

9
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,395
Some of it evoked

10
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:46,508
an erotic nature.

11
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:49,406
It's who she was.

12
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,504
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

13
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:56,639
This chick have medical issues?

14
00:00:58,072 --> 00:00:59,922
This particular painting...

15
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:02,098
...is of a door.

16
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,562
Any other doors we can check out?

17
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:09,157
Like, real ones or...

18
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:14,362
You know, I don't get it.

19
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:17,118
Why would anyone paint
a picture of a door

20
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:20,538
over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

21
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:22,707
But it wasn't the same.

22
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:24,892
Yeah, it was.

23
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,737
It was the same subject, but
it was different every time.

24
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:30,439
The light was different.
Her mood was different.

25
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:33,174
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

26
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,866
And that's not psycho to you?

27
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,974
Well, then, why should we
do anything more than once?

28
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:42,615
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

29
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,111
Maybe we should only have sex
once if it's the same thing.

30
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:50,187
Should we just watch one sunset?

31
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:52,634
Or live just one day.

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,594
Because it's new every time.
Each time, it's a different experience.

33
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,769
Okay, fine.

34
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,788
I guess the cow skull
pictures were cool,

35
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:05,732
but a door?

36
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,201
I will say it again.

37
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,826
A door.

38
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,454
Why not a door?

39
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,909
Sometimes you get fixated on something,
and you might not even get why.

40
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,804
You open yourself up
and go with the flow,

41
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:23,079
wherever the universe takes you.

42
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:24,818
Okay, so...

43
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:27,891
the universe took her to a door,

44
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,769
and she got all obsessed with it

45
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:34,857
and just had to paint it
20 times until it was perfect.

46
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,591
No, I wouldn't say that.
Nothing's perfect.

47
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:38,743
Yeah?

48
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:40,439
Well...

49
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:43,034
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,247
Some things.

51
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,898
That was so sweet,
I threw up in my mouth a little bit.

52
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:08,426
You can't admit just
for once that I'm right.

53
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:09,451
Come on.

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,001
That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over

55
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,026
until that stupid door

56
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,538
was perfect.

57
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:19,673
That door was her home,
and she loved it.

58
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,008
To me, that's about making
that feeling last.

59
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:39,259

61
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:01,348
All right, here we go.
You ready?

62
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,067
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

63
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:14,964
Nope.

64
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:16,827
{\pos(192,225)}Nope, that's it.
Take me up.

65
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:19,017
{\pos(192,225)}You can do this, Hank.
Come on.

66
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:22,882
{\pos(192,225)}It's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

67
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:24,781
{\pos(192,225)}Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

68
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,323
{\pos(192,225)}If you can get your leg
up that high, I say go for it.

69
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,668
{\pos(192,225)}- Take me up.
- All right, coffee break.

70
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,903
We're gonna let you rest for a minute.
{\*and then we're gonna try it again.}

71
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,972
Never mind about your coffee break.

72
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,259
I'm done.

73
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,433
{\pos(192,225)}We'll pick up where we left off.

74
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:42,858
{\pos(192,225)}Come on, Uncle Hank.
You can do it.

75
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:45,022
How else are you going
to get out of here?

76
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,579
Don't you have any friends?
Jesus, find something better to do.

77
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,006
I don't need everyone
staring at me hanging here

78
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,542
like a camel's ball sack.

79
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,584
{\pos(192,225)}He just wants to be supportive.

80
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:56,959
{\pos(192,225)}It's all right.

81
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:03,574
{\pos(192,225)}I'll be right back.
Okay? I'll be right back.

82
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:08,153
{\pos(192,225)}You gonna get me out
of here sometime today?

83
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:16,775
We got our first bill,

84
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:20,403
{\pos(192,210)}- and if you're still insistent...
- I am.

85
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,547
{\pos(192,225)}Prepare yourself.

86
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:39,688
They're gonna start coming in
weekly like that, so...

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,032
Okay.

88
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,309
You're sure you can do this?

89
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:47,330
{\pos(192,210)}Yeah.

90
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:25,985
{\pos(192,210)}I'll do that.

91
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,462
{\pos(192,210)}What the hell, man?

92
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,811
{\pos(192,210)}What, I can't work a scale now?

93
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,398
This is bullshit.

94
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,808
Just say it.

95
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:40,728
Just say the words.

96
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,551
You think I'm stealing.

97
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:00,202
{\pos(192,210)}Walk with who you are.

98
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,910
{\pos(192,210)}That was a phrase my sponsor
used to use with me

99
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:06,612
{\pos(192,210)}back when I first started
coming to meetings.

100
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:10,791
{\pos(192,210)}It's probably just a different
way of saying "Be yourself." Right?

101
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:14,510
{\pos(192,210)}But this idea of "walk"

102
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:16,423
also tells me

103
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:18,712
{\pos(192,210)}that I have to move forward.

104
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,857
{\pos(192,210)}Always good advice,
at least for me.

105
00:07:21,947 --> 00:07:24,796
{\pos(192,210)}I see we have some
new people here at group,

106
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,064
a couple new faces.

107
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:27,739
Let's see some hands.

108
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,332
First time?

109
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:37,999
Great.

110
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,067
Welcome.

111
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:42,136
{\pos(192,210)}Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

112
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,161
{\pos(192,210)}Say whatever's on your mind.

113
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,160
{\pos(192,210)}How about you?
You want to start us off?

114
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,595
{\pos(192,210)}My name is Andrea...

115
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,406
{\pos(192,210)}We don't bite.
No judgments.

116
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,400
{\pos(192,210)}You can be as open and honest
as you want to be.

117
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:09,595
Honestly,
I don't want to be here.

118
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,112
All right.
Fair enough.

119
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:16,621
Who else had their hand up?

120
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:23,631
Hey. 'Sup?

121
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:25,915
My name's Jesse.

122
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,031
Why, hello.

123
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:30,253
My name is Brandon.

124
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:34,283
And this is, I believe, Peter?

125
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:36,458
Right. I'm Peter.
How are you?

126
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:48,644
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

127
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,103
It's gonna get a little
slower smuggling product

128
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,848
with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

129
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,308
But don't worry.
I'll keep it flowing.

130
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,733
Great. Right on.

131
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,944
So how's it selling?

132
00:09:03,303 --> 00:09:04,353
Mad volume?

133
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,190
Yeah. It's, uh...

134
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:09,668
You know, it's, um...

135
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:12,593
It's not so good.

136
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,347
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

137
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:18,805
I sold a teenth.

138
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:20,213
One teenth?

139
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:21,841
That's it?

140
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:22,758
Yeah.

141
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:24,564
To who?

142
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:26,302
To him.

143
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:30,983
It's not so easy
selling to these people.

144
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,884
They're here trying
to better themselves.

145
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,097
Yeah, there's, like,
positivity and stuff going on here.

146
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:40,226
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

147
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,028
and you're too pussy to sell?

148
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:45,465
You're pathetic.

149
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,700
You know what?
I want it back. All of it.

150
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:51,525
I'll sell it myself.

151
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,056
{\*Come on, man.}
Don't be like that.

152
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,941
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

153
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,055
It's not natural.

154
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,443
Yeah, Jesse,
it's not easy like you think.

155
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:03,634
I'll show you exactly
how easy it is.

156
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,779
- Sorry.
- No. Go ahead.

157
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:27,862
It's Andrea, right?

158
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,083
Yeah.

159
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:32,778
My name's Jesse,

160
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,381
and, uh, I don't really
want to be here, either.

161
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,074
Sorry.

162
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

163
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,726
Your dad is.

164
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,676
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

165
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,779
Are you that boring?

166
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,139
I'm comforting.

167
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,612
I'm a comforting presence.

168
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:32,794
There we go.

169
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,031
Hey, so check it out.

170
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,817
See what that means?

171
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,454
Check out the date.

172
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,774
Next Thursday
is officially six months

173
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,849
that I have had my learner's,

174
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:53,007
which means I can get my provisional

175
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,446
and start driving by myself.

176
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:00,095
Since when? You don't
turn 16 for two more months.

177
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,722
It doesn't matter.
It's a provisional.

178
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,850
Look it up. They changed
the law, like, 10 years ago.

179
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,897
Well, I didn't vote for that.

180
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,820
Doesn't matter if you voted for it.
It's the law.

181
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,609
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you want to buy me.

182
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,278
{\*I think} I'd be good with either

183
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:19,486
an old IROC or a 'Stang.

184
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:22,925
A 'Stang.

185
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:27,539
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

186
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,918
Makes a nice motor-y sound,
you know?

187
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:35,659
Ah-ah, dad.
You're not gonna get off that easy.

188
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,745
Well, I think that this is, um...

189
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:43,797
We should probably table
this discussion for later.

190
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,628
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

191
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:48,943
Okay.

192
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:54,088
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback

193
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,258
in Grabber Lime

194
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,247
with a shaker hood.

195
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,245
'Stang.

196
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,809
I want to write that down
so I don't forget.

197
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:05,129
Darn it. No pencil!

198
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:33,229
What is
Ice Station Zebra Associates?

199
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:38,754
It's a loan-out.
It's fine.

200
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,985
Whose loan-out?

201
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,064
It's fine. Really.

202
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,572
I... have a guy.

203
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:50,514
Okay.

204
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,646
Does your guy know

205
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,010
the tax code and regulations
in New Mexico?

206
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,959
'Cause there's very specific paperwork
that has to be submitted quarterly.

207
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,692
Yes. My guy is a top...

208
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,928
- guy.
- Who is he?

209
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:07,986
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

210
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,805
This money has to be unimpeachable

211
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,637
when it reaches Hank and Marie.

212
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:17,680
And it is.

213
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,628
- It will be.
- But how do I know that?

214
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:23,101
Apparently, you can't
even tell me the man's name.

215
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,876
Jesus. Skyler,
do you really want to know?

216
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,118
Do you really want to know?

217
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,101
Really?

218
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,089
Hello. Welcome.

219
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:10,177
What a pleasure it is to have you.

220
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:12,327
I'm just gonna call you
Skyler, if that's okay.

221
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,497
It's a lovely name.
Reminds me

222
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,932
of a big beautiful sky.

223
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:19,316
Walt never told me
how lucky he was...

224
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:22,025
prior to recent unfortunate events.

225
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,488
Clearly, his taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers.

226
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,013
Only the very best

227
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,220
with just the right amount of dirty.

228
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,964
That's a joke.

229
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:34,384
That's a joke.

230
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,979
It's funny because you are
so clearly very classy.

231
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,564
Here. Please, sit down.

232
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,860
So Walt tells me that you have

233
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,832
some concerns I can alleviate.

234
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:48,435
Yes, I do. I have...

235
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:50,951
concerns.

236
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,359
If we're going to go down this road,

237
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:57,461
and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law.

238
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:00,066
I've heard about him.

239
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,751
He's an American hero.

240
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:06,002
At any rate,
I need some assurances

241
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:07,963
that we're gonna go
about this in a manner

242
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:10,673
that is extremely safe and cautious.

243
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,731
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

244
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,309
First step is something
we like to call

245
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,314
money laundering, all right?

246
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,069
Take your money,

247
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:22,457
represented by, say,
these jelly beans.

248
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,496
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,

249
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:27,523
so I actually know
what money laundering is.

250
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:29,855
Well...

251
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:33,929
And, as with most things,

252
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,640
the devil is in the details.

253
00:16:35,765 --> 00:16:37,115
So to begin with,

254
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,868
what are we saying is
the source of this money?

255
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,691
That's simple.

256
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:45,102
Walt here actually
came up with a great story about

257
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:46,524
gambling winnings.

258
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,991
Blackjack, right?
Some card counting?

259
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:51,327
Actually, that was Skyler's idea.

260
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,013
Well,

261
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,474
you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

262
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,720
Well, there you have it.
I'll generate

263
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:01,645
false currency transaction reports

264
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:02,849
out the wazoo.

265
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:05,530
As well as the necessary W-2Gs.

266
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:08,004
I know a couple casino managers

267
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,810
who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

268
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,240
It's a win-win for everyone.

269
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,876
Yeah, but you can't
sell that for very long.

270
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:17,456
Way ahead of you.

271
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:20,616
We declare just enough
so as not to arouse suspicion,

272
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,887
then Walt's one-time winnings
become seed money

273
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,582
for an investment.

274
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:27,467
Investment in what?

275
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,642
Drum roll please.
Wait for it.

276
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,083
Laser tag.

277
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:36,344
Laser tag.
7,000 square feet

278
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:39,624
of rollicking fun in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

279
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:42,517
Laser tag?

280
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,990
Yeah. There's guns
and glow lights and...

281
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,825
Kids wear the vests,
and they have to split into teams...

282
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,383
Actually, I know what it is.

283
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,278
It's just that in relation
to Walt, it's...

284
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,457
It doesn't make any sense.

285
00:17:57,379 --> 00:18:00,725
It makes more sense than you two.{\*being together.}
I'm still trying to figure it out.{\*how that happened.}

286
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,000
Do you even know Walt?
I mean...

287
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:07,117
how would he of all people
buy a laser tag business?

288
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:08,537
It doesn't add up.

289
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,687
It adds up perfectly.
Walt's a scientist.

290
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,414
Scientists love lasers.

291
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,376
Plus they got bumper boats, so...

292
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,013
Hey, everybody.

293
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,583
Walt suddenly decided
to invest in laser tag.

294
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,258
Just out of the blue.

295
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:25,081
Really? That's what we're
supposed to tell people,

296
00:18:25,206 --> 00:18:28,401
our family, our friends,
the government?

297
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:32,396
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved.

298
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,009
Because I've been doing this
for a lot of years,

299
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,089
successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

300
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,926
So thank you for stopping by.

301
00:19:00,734 --> 00:19:02,684
You want a beer or something?

302
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,420
Or something.

303
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,800
What do you mean?

304
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,716
Like beer.

305
00:19:11,826 --> 00:19:13,876
I'm clean out of anything else.

306
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,455
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

307
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:21,316
Yeah.

308
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,376
I've heard it over

309
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:25,899
and over

310
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:28,099
and over again.

311
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:33,448
You know, don't you think
it's ridiculous

312
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,109
that society says beer

313
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,231
is okay and a little hit
of something

314
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,506
sweet is wrong?

315
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,741
I mean...

316
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:47,773
What's the point of shutting
yourself off completely

317
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,029
from something that
lifts you off the ground?

318
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,996
I spend so much energy

319
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:01,183
fighting the urge not to use,

320
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:04,397
and I feel like crap because of it.

321
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:10,598
I know. It's just...

322
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:11,910
What?

323
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:17,084
I can't get caught using again.

324
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:23,609
See, the thing is...

325
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:27,840
not to get caught.

326
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:34,373
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

327
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,129
Just a little gas in the tank,

328
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,366
and suddenly...

329
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,222
everything is interesting.

330
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:50,752
Man, I wish I can make
that feeling last.

331
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,258
Like I said, I got nothing here.

332
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:04,243
What if I could get some?

333
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:14,195
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Hey, B!

334
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:17,433
Your Nana brought you home early.

335
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,677
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today.

336
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:25,392
I was.
Then I saw your car.

337
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:29,782
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

338
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:33,456
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

339
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:35,081
He's like a sponsor.

340
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,110
This is Grandma.

341
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,242
Jesse, this is Brock.

342
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,782
So, you...

343
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:00,897
You have a kid, huh?

344
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:02,655
What's up?

345
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:04,973
Brock, huh?

346
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,720
That's a cool name.

347
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Here.
Give it up.

348
00:22:22,385 --> 00:22:24,205
Brock is almost 6.

349
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:26,822
You okay with kids?

350
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,370
Yeah, he's cool.

351
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:35,314
Brock is gonna go play in his room
while the big people talk.

352
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,289
He's gonna go play
with his Legos and his cars.

353
00:22:38,536 --> 00:22:40,224
- Say "Bye, Jesse."
- Bye, Jesse.

354
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,866
Safe and cautious,
that's all I'm asking,

355
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:58,572
and that man is neither.

356
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:01,777
I'll admit, he comes across
like a circus clown.

357
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,146
But he actually knows
what he's doing.

358
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:08,904
Safe and cautious is you
not being involved in this at all.

359
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,076
Well, it's a little late on that.

360
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:14,813
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

361
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,170
This isn't just about
what happened before.

362
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:31,649
My involvement in this is ongoing.

363
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:34,701
Understand?

364
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,626
I can't just quit.

365
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:43,808
I have something of a contract.

366
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:46,977
It's all very safe and professional

367
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:49,257
and structured.

368
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:51,456
I can't simply quit.

369
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,234
Where are you going?

370
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,541
If you're gonna
launder money, Walt...

371
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,222
At least, do it right.

372
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,990
You worked here four years.

373
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,695
It's a business you understand.

374
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,013
It's a story people will believe.

375
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,617
Not laser tag. This.

376
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:54,577
This is what we buy.

377
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:57,163
You.

378
00:24:59,424 --> 00:25:00,974
This is what you buy.

379
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,953
Jesse, right?

380
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,946
- How goes it? Hanging in there?
- Please, just...

381
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:42,417
Dumb-ass.

382
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:45,629
Sorry, man. I was trying
to keep it on the DL.

383
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,383
You and that girl,
you do the deed yet?

384
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:51,859
Do what?

385
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:53,650
You know.

386
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:55,265
Sell to her.

387
00:25:57,774 --> 00:25:59,726
What are you two even doing here?

388
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:02,729
What do you mean?

389
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,692
You can't get your nut up to sell.

390
00:26:05,817 --> 00:26:07,358
What's the point of even coming?

391
00:26:07,527 --> 00:26:10,195
Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.

392
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,384
Deuce, yo.

393
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,614
I'm catching up.

394
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,002
Whatever.

395
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,453
Later.

396
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,516
Dude needs to come into the fold.

397
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:36,249
You know what?

398
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:38,167
I have magical powers.

399
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,066
You want to see?

400
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,231
Ready?

401
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,334
That's not real.

402
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:49,818
It is real.

403
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:53,530
You want to see something that's real?
Look at this. Watch this.

404
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:56,032
Ready?

405
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,840
You like that?

406
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,322
That's science and stuff.
Makes it do that.

407
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:09,767
Do it again.

408
00:27:09,892 --> 00:27:11,393
Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.

409
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:12,465
It's okay.

410
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,486
It's okay.
Want to see it again?

411
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,011
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

412
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:18,826
Firecrackers.

413
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,538
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

414
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:25,264
Who does tricks with firecrackers?

415
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:26,499
Tomás.

416
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:30,103
Tomás does tricks
with firecrackers, huh?

417
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:31,366
Who's Tomás?

418
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:32,569
He's my kid brother.

419
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,947
And we don't talk about him.

420
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,158
Come on.

421
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,826
Eat your food, Brock.

422
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:43,831
Can I have a chip?

423
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,329
I'm gonna steal your chip.

424
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:46,744
Hey, that's mine.

425
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,533
That's it?
That's what you want to buy?

426
00:27:51,658 --> 00:27:53,758
People will believe it at least.

427
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,838
I worked here for four years.

428
00:27:56,963 --> 00:27:59,137
Wax on, wax off.
Was that you?

429
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:02,631
Hey, how come you guys always get
with the air freshener, huh?

430
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:04,868
I explicitly say
I want no air freshener,

431
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:08,563
and every time I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

432
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:13,214
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

433
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,269
Makes a better story
than your laser tag.

434
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,616
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

435
00:28:20,477 --> 00:28:21,781
She has a point.

436
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:24,579
It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

437
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:28,318
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

438
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:30,194
Let me tell you something.

439
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,772
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

440
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:35,417
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner.

441
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:38,686
And it worked because I believed it.

442
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:41,179
It has nothing to do with the story.

443
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:45,323
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

444
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:46,893
There's no Danny here.

445
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,022
What in God's name is a Danny?

446
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,142
Danny runs the laser tag.

447
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,544
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

448
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,334
Where others saw a dirt lot,

449
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:00,471
he saw black lights, rubber aliens,

450
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:02,992
teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

451
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,953
It was like Bugsy Siegel
in the desert.

452
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:08,807
And when the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble,

453
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:12,763
he went searching for exactly the type
of situation that we're offering.

454
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:15,068
Danny will look the other way

455
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:16,849
to keep his dream afloat.

456
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,834
In other words, Danny
can be trusted completely.

457
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:24,439
That guy, the guy with the
eyebrows that won't quit...

458
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:25,764
is he a Danny?

459
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,420
You buy this place,

460
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:31,145
all you got is a big building
that squirts water.

461
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:33,675
You got no Danny here.

462
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,762
You want to stay for dinner?

463
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:51,244
Thanks.

464
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:54,011
What time is it?

465
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:57,333
Early still.

466
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,601
What?

467
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:09,625
I thought maybe,

468
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:11,943
if you're holding,

469
00:30:12,068 --> 00:30:13,568
we can do something.

470
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,337
What?

471
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,459
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about?

472
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:23,297
Maybe you had a line on some.

473
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:24,721
Wait.

474
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:27,396
What?

475
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:31,071
I thought you said
the kid is coming home.

476
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:33,507
Yeah, in a few hours.

477
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:36,753
And you seriously want to get high?

478
00:30:37,709 --> 00:30:40,075
I don't know what you're
getting so pissed about.

479
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,799
You're the one who brought it up.

480
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,742
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

481
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:48,514
What kind of mother are you?

482
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:49,643
What?

483
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:54,145
What kind of mom gets wasted
with a little kid to take care of?

484
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,267
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

485
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:04,013
You gonna come
in my house and judge me?

486
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:07,241
Like you got no responsibility,
so it's okay for you to get high.

487
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,025
What do you know about me?
I take care of my baby.

488
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,663
I'll do anything for him.

489
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:14,503
The day Brock was born, I swore...

490
00:31:15,717 --> 00:31:19,253
I won't let what happened
to Tomás happen to my son.

491
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:22,237
I'll die first.

492
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,879
Sorry.

493
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:35,287
Look, I'll get out
of here if you want.

494
00:31:36,516 --> 00:31:38,254
That's what you want to do, then go.

495
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:40,075
It's not what I want.

496
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:44,169
I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

497
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,490
We both were.

498
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,860
You're right.

499
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,183
I don't know what
you've been through.

500
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:07,917
You can tell me if you want.

501
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,879
This whole neighborhood
is run by gangs.

502
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:18,461
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

503
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:24,006
And they sort of took Tomás in.

504
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,864
No dad around.

505
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,360
8 years old,

506
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,744
they got Tomás slinging.

507
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:36,385
Part of some crew.

508
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,482
Then, when he was 10...

509
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,049
for some initiation or something...

510
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:49,552
they made him kill somebody.

511
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:55,788
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

512
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,887
But I saw him a week later.

513
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:07,383
He told me, yeah, he did it.

514
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,882
They gave Tomás a gun.

515
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:14,855
Gave him a choice.

516
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:17,624
Him or some dude.

517
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,170
So he did it.

518
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,990
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

519
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,276
Who did he say he killed?

520
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:32,261
Some dealer...

521
00:33:35,437 --> 00:33:37,266
from some outside crew.

522
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:39,936
Right around the corner from here,

523
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,611
over off the Central.

524
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,342
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

525
00:33:52,228 --> 00:33:53,528
Off the Central?

526
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:57,906
Like, over by the train tracks?

527
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:01,712
When was this?

528
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:05,112
A few months back.

529
00:34:10,038 --> 00:34:11,838
What else did he tell you?

530
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,566
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

531
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:22,322
Shot him dead.

532
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:28,848
Just because he was
working the wrong corner.

533
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,616
It won't happen again.

534
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,599
Not to my son.

535
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,084
Guess what.

536
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:02,602
People who say "Guess what"

537
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:05,067
and then actually
expect you to guess...

538
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:07,002
I hate those people.

539
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,067
Well, I just heard

540
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:13,301
about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank

541
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,157
who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

542
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:19,623
Isn't that fantastic?

543
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,124
Are they planning on rolling me
out the front door at least,

544
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:27,689
or they'll put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

545
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,350
Listen, I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

546
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,655
I'm not leaving here until I'm well.

547
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,035
Hank, this isn't about insurance.

548
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,238
I've talked to everybody,
and they all say

549
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:42,475
that you are healthy
enough to go home.

550
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,273
Oh, I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.

551
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,396
Hank, you get stronger every day.

552
00:35:46,721 --> 00:35:48,836
You don't need to be in a hospital.

553
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,473
In this condition, yeah, I do.

554
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:55,053
You'll be just as comfortable
at home as you are here.

555
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:58,557
- You'll have all the same equipment...
- All the same equipment?

556
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,453
The equipment that you have here,
that you need.

557
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:02,795
Short term.

558
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:06,332
You'll do your PT at home,
and it will be great,

559
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,515
because you'll be home.

560
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:11,238
Wait till you see the bedroom.

561
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:13,022
I had them move the plasma in.

562
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:15,298
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

563
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,645
You only had to get shot
to get it, right?

564
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,847
I got you a new bed.

565
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,222
A hospital bed?

566
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,268
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

567
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,023
You'll be home.

568
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,772
You get that out of my house.

569
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:34,946
You hear me, Marie?

570
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:36,509
Today.

571
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,432
I leave this hospital

572
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:43,942
when I walk out of here,
you understand?

573
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,236
And not before.

574
00:36:51,077 --> 00:36:52,516
What's a Danny?

575
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:55,136
Danny is an accomplice,

576
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:57,249
someone who's in on the scheme,

577
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,612
who knows about laundering,

578
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:02,514
who's paid to look the other way.

579
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:05,391
Now, while I agree with you

580
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
that laser tag is a hard sell,

581
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:09,331
without a Danny,

582
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,731
the car wash isn't really an option.

583
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,152
He can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

584
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:18,808
Easier said than done,

585
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:21,864
if we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

586
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,048
What about me?

587
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:41,621
What about you?

588
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:43,972
Me.

589
00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:47,434
I'll be the Danny.

590
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:51,062
No, Skyler.
That is not a good idea.

591
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:53,523
I'm perfectly capable
of managing a small business.

592
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,582
A legal business, not this.

593
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:56,985
Who else could we trust?

594
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:00,784
I'm in this.

595
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:04,242
And if I'm in it,
I'm going to do it right.

596
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:06,744
You are not in this.
You are not...

597
00:38:06,913 --> 00:38:09,247
- We're married. How am I not in this?
- We are not married.

598
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:11,082
We're divorced.

599
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:21,113
Right?

600
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:27,594
I never actually got around to...

601
00:38:28,314 --> 00:38:29,714
filing the papers.

602
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,410
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

603
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:41,762
So there's that.

604
00:39:11,642 --> 00:39:12,692
Respirator.

605
00:39:14,474 --> 00:39:15,274
Right.

606
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:51,696
I'll be there.

607
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:56,141
What was that?

608
00:39:58,579 --> 00:39:59,779
An invitation.

609
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:22,213
You're right on time.

610
00:40:22,382 --> 00:40:23,682
Please, come in.

611
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,870
I hope you like <i>paila marina.</i>

612
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,700
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

613
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:44,027
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's like my mother used to make it.

614
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:49,815
Come on.

615
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:51,992
You can help me cook.

616
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:56,876
This is a Chilean dish

617
00:40:57,473 --> 00:41:00,794
that I love,
but I never get to make it.

618
00:41:03,092 --> 00:41:04,631
The kids won't eat it.

619
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,969
You know how that is.

620
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:12,097
Sure.

621
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,820
Do you mind?

622
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:20,898
Would you slice the garlic?

623
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:24,727
Very thin.

624
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:35,327
Why did you invite me here?

625
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:39,297
We're working together.

626
00:41:39,737 --> 00:41:41,687
Why not break bread together?

627
00:41:43,965 --> 00:41:45,675
Now the garlic.

628
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,527
It always amazes me the way the senses
work in connection to memory.

629
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:11,021
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

630
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:14,524
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

631
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:17,370
Not very much at all.

632
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,929
But, in this precise combination,

633
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:23,676
the smell of this meal, instantly...

634
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,367
it brings me back to my childhood.

635
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:27,900
How is that possible?

636
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:31,551
Basically, it all takes place
in the hippocampus.

637
00:42:33,728 --> 00:42:35,728
Neural connections are formed.

638
00:42:37,392 --> 00:42:40,617
The senses make the neurons express

639
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:42,270
signals

640
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:46,549
that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before,

641
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:49,418
where memory is stored.

642
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,280
That's something called

643
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:54,753
relational memory.

644
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:00,855
Don't quote me on that.

645
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,440
I'm rusty on my biology.

646
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:06,330
That's very interesting.

647
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,260
I would like to help you,
if I could.

648
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,443
Help me how?

649
00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:21,919
When I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

650
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:25,105
More than I care to admit.

651
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:28,422
I wish I'd had someone to advise me.

652
00:43:29,363 --> 00:43:32,654
Because this life of ours,

653
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:35,043
it can overwhelm.

654
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:41,676
You are a wealthy man now.

655
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,940
And one must learn to be rich.

656
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:48,872
To be poor, anyone can manage.

657
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,349
What advice do you have for me?

658
00:43:58,022 --> 00:44:00,219
Never make the same mistake twice.

659
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:45,795
What's up?

660
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:49,814
You Tomás?

661
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,879
Heard you were the man.

662
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,589
Yeah? What you want?

663
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:58,164
Crystal.

664
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,326
You think you could hook me up?

665
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:04,940
- 300.
- For a teenth?

666
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:06,817
Shit, come on, yo.

667
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:08,811
300.

668
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,520
Hey, what's up?

669
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:05,890
Bounce.
