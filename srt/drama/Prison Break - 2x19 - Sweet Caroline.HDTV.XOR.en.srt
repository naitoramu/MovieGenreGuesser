1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:06,762
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:09,106
Let me get this straight.
The brothers come back to a city

3
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:11,927
that's 15 miles from the prison they
escaped from-- why would they do that?

4
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:14,180
Maybe it's because the president
is in Chicago to make a speech,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,906
- and they're up to something.
- Legally speaking, this tape is useless.

6
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:19,241
- So we blackmail her.
- In exchange for what?

7
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:21,633
A presidential pardon.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,018
Now, are we gonna keep crying about
money you've already got coming to you?

9
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,607
Or do you want to
make some more?

10
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:28,380
- I'm listening.
- Ever been to Mexico?

11
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,970
When's the meal coming around?
I'm starved.

12
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,788
Freshen me up when you
get a chance, darlin'.

13
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:34,994
Fernando!

14
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,001
Tia! Tia, ella es Maricruz.

15
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:39,371
I'll check this
bag for you, sir.

16
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,282
Oh, no. That's coming with me--
give it back.

17
00:00:42,028 --> 00:00:45,503
Sir, I know that bag is
way over the weight limit.

18
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,470
Sir, your bag will be safe.

19
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,963
They're watching you.
But from where?

20
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:50,891
There.

21
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,850
President Reynolds ruined your life;
she ruined my life.

22
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,303
You want to take
that bitch down?

23
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,881
You just found your inside man,
but it's got to be right now.

24
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,181
Have either of these
men checked in?

25
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,573
Yeah. Room 10-06.

26
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,590
Later today,
you'll get a package in your cell.

27
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:07,032
It's gonna be from me--
I need you to use it. Okay?

28
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:27,863
Open on four!

29
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:37,912
I need a hand in here!

30
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,561
I need a medic in B-4!

31
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,680
Let me die.

32
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:48,611
No.

33
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:50,563
Shh!

34
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,960
Let me die.

35
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:00,571
A large crowd is gathering
along Beaumont Avenue

36
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,071
here in downtown Chicago,

37
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:05,120
anticipating the arrival of
President Caroline Reynolds,

38
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:07,560
who continues her speaking
tour today with an appearance

39
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,581
at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

40
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,260
Inner Circle approaching the
south perimeter. Marker One.

41
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:17,691
Marker Two.

42
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,013
Marker Three.

43
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:27,250
Okay.

44
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,473
- I think you'd better go.
- You sure?

45
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:37,402
Yeah. Thank you for your help,
but, uh,

46
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:39,153
there's nothing more
you can do for us.

47
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,691
It doesn't feel right,
just leaving.

48
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,070
I don't think you want any part of this.
Thank you.

49
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:49,261
- It's ten minutes away, right?
- At least.

50
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:55,110
Listen, if this doesn't work,
we're gonna need a way out--

51
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:58,262
- for good.
- Well, that's on you.

52
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:03,662
Yeah. What about Derek?

53
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,431
- Derek Sweeney?
- Yeah.

54
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,670
- You think he'll be up for this?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:10,403
All right.

56
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:13,640
This is your neck of the woods.
You want to meet at the park?

57
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,112
Uh... how's Third and Racine?

58
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:23,003
Third and Racine? Uh...
3:15, the corner. I'll be there.

59
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:25,800
If anything happens...

60
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,903
...I love you both.

61
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,641
Shh!

62
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,131
Key!

63
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:13,770
Go! Go!

64
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,341
Sit down.

65
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,101
When were they here,
five minutes, ten minutes?

66
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,310
They were never here.

67
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:31,030
No, no, no, they were here. I know
they were here. Where did they go?

68
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,162
- I don't know.
- No, you do know.

69
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:37,692
He decided it was for the best,
and I couldn't take this anymore.

70
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,040
- It's over just like that, huh?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,431
It's over like the time
you flew to New Mexico

72
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,262
on dead woman's ID
to meet up with him?

73
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,190
Or it's over like the
time that you met up

74
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:48,260
and got back together at the
train station in Evansville?

75
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:51,682
Or maybe like the day, today, when you
checked into this hotel here two
hours ago?

76
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,231
Which one is it like,
like that?

77
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,341
No plans to meet,
no phone calls?

78
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,513
- I'm telling you the truth.
- He's not going to call you?!

79
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,562
Don't lie to me.
You don't want to do that.

80
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:35,440
Excuse me. Can you tell me what
the sign means over there?

81
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,441
I'm just wondering.
No hablo granjero.

82
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:10,713
Hey!

83
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,753
Hey, hombre! ¿Que haces?

84
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,440
I need a phone.

85
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,742
Listen to me, man,
it needs to be today.

86
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,803
Hey, look, my family is in trouble,
all right?

87
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:55,181
There's a man out there who's
trying to hurt my family.

88
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:57,541
Your family is fine.
There's nobody after your family.

89
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:01,021
No, look at me, man.
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

90
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:03,531
I know the rules.

91
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:08,591
I wouldn't be asking you
if it wasn't an emergency.

92
00:09:09,428 --> 00:09:13,230
Please, just let
me use that phone.

93
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:15,412
Please.

94
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:24,801
Agent Lang.

95
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,952
Yeah, yeah,
I need to speak to Mahone, please.

96
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:29,860
Can I have him return?

97
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:32,300
Listen, this is Benjamin
Miles Franklin,

98
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,311
and I need to speak
to Mahone right away.

99
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:39,800
-It's Franklin for Mahone.
- I'll take it.

100
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:46,100
Mr. Franklin? This is Agent Wheeler.
I don't believe we've met before.

101
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:50,950
- I need to speak to Mahone.
- Something I can help you with?

102
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,342
Listen...

103
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:57,342
I want to leave a
message for him.

104
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:59,072
You tell him...

105
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:03,073
you tell him that I'll do
what he wants me to do, okay?

106
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:06,552
I just need a little bit more time.
I'll do it.

107
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:10,171
Just don't hurt them.
You hear me?

108
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,992
Don't hurt them.

109
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:17,542
What's up?

110
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:20,212
Excuse me.

111
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:54,422
What the-- Are you crazy, man?
What the hell are you doing here, man?

112
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,491
Keep your voice down.
Keep it down.

113
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,721
How you been?

114
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:05,851
You all right?

115
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,263
- It's good to see you, man.
- You, too, brother. You, too.

116
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:11,031
Look, if some of the guys knew you were
here, they might not be too cool...

117
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:12,992
Well, I ain't hanging around;
I need a favor.

118
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:16,181
- You owe me.
- I do. You know I do.

119
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:21,300
Look, it's just... Look,
it's just your situation right now.

120
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:24,831
I mean, I just had a kid,
a baby boy, and I promised Marie...

121
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:26,752
I didn't come here
to cause trouble.

122
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,090
I'm short on friends;
I need to hook me up.

123
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,241
You're the only one who can do
it without the green up front.

124
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:33,931
I'm serious about this, man.

125
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,420
Here. I need it.

126
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:46,610
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

127
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:49,002
- By when?
- ASAP.

128
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:50,311
Tomorrow? The next day?

129
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:51,431
Now.

130
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,381
Now.

131
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:04,022
All right, Linc. Come with me.

132
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:36,511
We have the tape.

133
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:05,021
Didn't see him go down.
Any press?

134
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:07,552
We got him down pretty quick,
but you never know.

135
00:14:07,697 --> 00:14:10,001
- Somebody may have gotten a shot.
- Check around.

136
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,033
Confiscate cameras
if you need to.

137
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,181
Put out a statement before
rumors get started.

138
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,043
And get everyone
out of here. Now.

139
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:22,103
We're still waiting for the
response from Counter...

140
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:28,901
You and I both know that this situation
requires us to abandon protocol.

141
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:34,100
I don't know what you need to tell them,
but I need your men to leave.

142
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:39,740
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:47,940
Where's your brother?

144
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,190
- I need to see the president.
- Really?

145
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:52,858
And you think that's
a possibility?

146
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:54,964
She'll want to hear
what I have to say.

147
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,540
Oh, I highly doubt that.

148
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:06,812
The only person you
get to talk to...

149
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,821
...is me.

150
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,623
And the only way you're going
to live through the next hour

151
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:15,680
is if you tell me where
to find your brother.

152
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,302
Okay.

153
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:23,411
- He's in a safe place.
- Be more specific.

154
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:26,600
Specifically...

155
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:29,750
a place you will
never find him.

156
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:42,851
I had the honor...

157
00:15:44,656 --> 00:15:47,433
to attend this country's most
prestigious military academy...

158
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:55,493
whose mission it is "To ensure
the greatness of this country,

159
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:56,922
its future leadership,

160
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:59,360
encouraging patriotism,

161
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,381
building a strong
world foundation

162
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,251
and providing the
service of men,

163
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:06,442
committed to the
values of honor,

164
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:09,163
freedom and country."

165
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:13,342
But, first and foremost,

166
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:15,011
they taught you this.

167
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,521
How do you say
"cherries" again?

168
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:36,961
Cereza.

169
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,802
Looks like you have
to get more cerezas.

170
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:44,410
Baby, I just got you 100 pistachios,
with the right amount of salt, too.

171
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,092
Well, it's the combination.
I need both.

172
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,043
Why am I a sucker for you, huh?

173
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,691
What? What's she saying?

174
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,182
That looks like T-Bag.

175
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,630
- What?
- Shh.

176
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:22,191
She said he was trying to
steal luggage from the airport,

177
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,893
but he's got $5 million.
Why would he...?

178
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:38,383
Unless he doesn't have it.
Unless he lost it there.

179
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:40,482
- Stop it, Fernando.
- What?

180
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:43,251
Do you really believe that
that money is at the airport?

181
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,292
Hey, forget it.

182
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,922
Look at what we have together.

183
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,433
Do you really want
to risk that?

184
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:54,353
We have everything
that we need.

185
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:57,160
- Except your cerezas.
- Right.

186
00:17:58,598 --> 00:18:01,421
- I'll be right back.
- Fernando...

187
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:17,772
I'll be right back.

188
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:55,243
You got to know it's not real hard
for me to recognize a junkie.

189
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:58,613
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm saying

190
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,402
you don't look so good.

191
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:04,960
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.

192
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:10,193
You mind me asking
what you're taking?

193
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:13,882
- Here. You want one?
- No, that's okay.

194
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,883
Here. Save it for later.

195
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,221
Varatril.

196
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:31,112
That's a hardcore tranquilizer, man.
You take these every day?

197
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,443
20 milligrams.

198
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,142
You must feel like you're
walking underwater.

199
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,471
I do.
It's very quiet down here.

200
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:48,313
That's where you started, right?
Peace and quiet.

201
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,652
That's not why you do it anymore,
though, is it?

202
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,793
Now it's the headaches, right?

203
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:57,670
Ann you probably don't sleep.

204
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:01,880
And you know you're going
to destroy yourself, right?

205
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,943
I haven't ruled that
out as a possibility.

206
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:12,843
I hope we hear from
your boyfriend.

207
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,920
There's one difference
between me and agent Mahone.

208
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,310
He doesn't know value
of a pair of hands...

209
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,982
he just keeps beating and
beating around that bush.

210
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,660
But if you don't give up Burrows,
I don't care.

211
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,632
One down, one to go.

212
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:36,611
I need to talk to
Scofield. Alone.

213
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:06,900
Madam President...

214
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,851
could I...

215
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:12,100
have a word?

216
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:18,080
It wouldn't be prudent for me to
leave you alone with Mr. Scofield.

217
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,090
My men are right outside this door.
I have a right to privacy.

218
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,950
Your rights aren't
my first concern.

219
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:28,333
Do I need to remind you
who you are talking to?

220
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:32,750
Step outside,
and close the door behind you.

221
00:21:56,845 --> 00:22:00,230
The things you do
for your brother.

222
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,152
It's impressive.

223
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:05,062
I could say the same for you.

224
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,492
But I won't.

225
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:11,871
Bear in mind,
your opinion means little to me.

226
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:13,872
This tape.

227
00:22:15,106 --> 00:22:16,130
You have it with you?

228
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:23,542
No. But I can arrange
for you to hear it.

229
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:29,632
You don't make arrangements for me,
Mr. Scofield.

230
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,962
I have people for that.

231
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:36,022
I'm not exactly sure
what is on this tape,

232
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:40,101
but I doubt it's of
any interest to me.

233
00:22:40,246 --> 00:22:43,163
It's a recorded conversation
between you and your brother.

234
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:44,983
Well, out of millions
of conversations

235
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,803
that I had with my brother
during his lifetime...

236
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:49,592
I'll narrow it down for you.

237
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:54,880
It was recorded sometime
after his death.

238
00:22:55,808 --> 00:23:01,502
And this
particular conversation...

239
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:06,890
you might want to
keep in the family.

240
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,041
And where is it?

241
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:14,190
20 different copies in
20 different locations.

242
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:19,311
I can call my brother right now.
He can play it for you.

243
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:22,460
Not on the phone.
Have him bring it here.

244
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,212
These are the terms.

245
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:29,600
You can hear it over the phone,

246
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,652
or you can hear it on the news.

247
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,962
It's up to you.

248
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:43,942
- I know it's why I started.
- Started what?

249
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,221
Using. Same reason as you.

250
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,040
Why, because you had to stay
up all night during residency?

251
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,043
Because the bass player dumped you
in front of the whole sorority?

252
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,100
Yeah, you and I got
a lot in common.

253
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,990
I've seen people die, too.

254
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:03,362
I'm assuming you
didn't make them die.

255
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:06,160
You need help.

256
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:08,633
Not what I'm looking for.

257
00:24:14,648 --> 00:24:17,510
For your sake, I hope your
boyfriend calls back real soon.

258
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,262
¿Tia?

259
00:24:46,596 --> 00:24:47,573
Maricruz?

260
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,020
Where the hell is everybody?

261
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,110
Mami.

262
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,522
Hey... lookie here,
good ol' Sucre.

263
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,831
What did you do to them?

264
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,272
Where are they? Maricruz!

265
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,570
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
keep your cap on.

266
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,731
They're out picking apples
for the Snuffleupagus.

267
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,550
- If you ever...
- Calm down!

268
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:17,762
They're going to walk back
in here any minute...

269
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:19,702
which means trouble.

270
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:23,781
Now, unless you want to see
me try out the new T-20Z

271
00:25:23,975 --> 00:25:26,981
on your bella
muchacha, Mari-poon.

272
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,700
...I think you'd
better come with me.

273
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:36,683
Yeah?

274
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:41,842
- Lincoln Burrows?
- Caroline Reynolds.

275
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:48,610
I understand you have
something for me.

276
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:54,073
- You still there?
- Oh, I'm here.

277
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:56,071
It's good to
finally talk to you.

278
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:01,230
Wish I had the chance one of those
242 nights I spent on death row.

279
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:04,852
Please just play the tape.

280
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,492
It's awful, I know.

281
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:21,080
But the choice was clear. You needed
to be far away from all of this.

282
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:22,282
I am.

283
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,820
I'm the Isle of Terrence,
far off to sea.

284
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,160
Look, I'm still here for you.

285
00:26:27,347 --> 00:26:30,553
Now, listen to me,
don't dwell on the negative.

286
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,941
Some people deserve
to dwell, Caroline.

287
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,950
You know I'm only
a phone call away.

288
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,951
And 3,000 miles.

289
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,690
Do you...

290
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,111
Do you know how
cold it is here?

291
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,360
We talked about this, Terrence.

292
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,750
You knew that you would be lonely,
but it's only temporary.

293
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:54,331
His appeals process
has started already.

294
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:57,342
This is gonna fly by
quicker than your 20s.

295
00:26:57,525 --> 00:27:00,582
And soon the world will
forget all about him

296
00:27:01,006 --> 00:27:04,113
and they'll forget about you, too.
I promise.

297
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,460
But...

298
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,732
it's killing me

299
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,402
not being able to see you,
sweet Caroline.

300
00:27:12,636 --> 00:27:15,260
I want to see you, too.
But that can't happen right now.

301
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:20,011
This house is so big.
I just think of you...

302
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:23,803
lying in bed...

303
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,531
I know. Me, too.

304
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,400
Your warmth... your touch.

305
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:41,271
Was it quick when
he killed himself?

306
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,193
It was a lot quicker
than how my father died.

307
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:49,992
They shot him in the back.
He died in my arms.

308
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,853
I just want to know
what happened.

309
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:57,350
Your brother apologized.

310
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,270
He said he was sorry,

311
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:04,422
and then he blew his brains
out all over the wall.

312
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:07,822
It was quick.

313
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,681
And it was his decision.

314
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,693
And now it's time for
you to make yours.

315
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:24,962
Nah, nah, nah, man.
I can't do it. I can't do that.

316
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:29,333
Yes, you can.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

317
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:34,213
You don't get it, do you?
You can't stop this guy.

318
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:38,760
Not without your cooperation,
I can't, but if you talk to me,

319
00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:43,160
if you tell me what's going on,
I can take care of you, okay?

320
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:47,493
You've got to trust me, Mr.
Franklin. I can help you.

321
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:55,170
- C-Note, right?
- Yeah. Whatever, man.

322
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:05,482
All I need you to do is tell me
exactly what Agent Mahone told you.

323
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:09,941
If you give me Mahone,
I'll give you your life back.

324
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:13,302
God's been smiling down on me,
I can tell you that.

325
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:15,452
First, I caught up to
Haywire up in Algoma.

326
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:18,650
He did a swan dive off a grain elevator
before they could put him away,

327
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:20,142
but I still get the reward.

328
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:21,453
Wait, wait, wait. He's dead?

329
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:23,283
Yep, like a gnat
on a Peterbilt.

330
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,103
Hope you don't take
the same route, Sucre.

331
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:26,832
Oh, hell no,
I got plenty reasons to live.

332
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,403
I hope a few of them
are in Fox River.

333
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:31,341
Or maybe, if you play nice,
I'll throw your Maricruz a couple bills

334
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:32,933
after I turn you in.

335
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:34,733
How much are you
getting for this?

336
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:35,713
A hundred grand.

337
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:38,383
I bet you never thought your
ass'd be worth all that.

338
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,260
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

339
00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:45,432
What if I know where you can
get five million dollars?

340
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:48,821
You heard me.

341
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:51,513
Where is it?

342
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,290
I could take you there,

343
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:57,611
if you didt have to take me back
to the States and turn me back in.

344
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:00,082
Where is it?

345
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:04,411
T-Bag's in town.

346
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,860
I made my commitment
a long time ago.

347
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:13,391
I agreed to put my
country ahead of myself,

348
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,933
like a mother does for a child.

349
00:30:17,838 --> 00:30:24,661
And I thought that what I was doing
was noble and that I would be rewarded.

350
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:25,972
You were wrong.

351
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,693
Don't you see that I'm
a pawn in this, too?

352
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:34,893
The power that has taken over
this country is like a cancer,

353
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:37,290
and it will stop at nothing.

354
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:41,023
- It is out of my control.
- So is this.

355
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:47,792
- Tell me what you want from me.
- Uncuff me.

356
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,230
- I don't have the keys.
- You'll get them.

357
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,522
Second, I want you to arrange
for me to walk away, alone.

358
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:57,943
- No surveillance.
- Okay.

359
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:06,142
And finally, I want a presidential
pardon for me and my brother,

360
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:09,391
fully exonerating us
of all our crimes.

361
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:12,251
And I want it today.

362
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:21,983
I can't just hand out
pardons to anyone I choose.

363
00:31:22,176 --> 00:31:25,842
- There is a process, rules.
- This is no exception.

364
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:29,792
A document will be delivered for
your approval just like any pardon.

365
00:31:29,986 --> 00:31:33,180
You'll sign it and then file
it with the attorney general

366
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:35,152
who'll submit to the
presidential record.

367
00:31:35,336 --> 00:31:38,112
Fine. I will sign whatever
you need me to sign.

368
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,831
That's very kind,
but we both know that's not enough.

369
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:43,293
What do you want from me?

370
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:46,473
I will unlock you myself,
walk you out of here.

371
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:49,013
What, you want me to
drive you to the airport?

372
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:51,073
I guess I'm not as
trusting as I used to be,

373
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:54,173
especially with paperwork.
It's so easy to lose.

374
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,552
No, I want you to go out
there in front of everyone

375
00:31:57,736 --> 00:32:01,453
and announce our full
pardon on live TV.

376
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:06,863
You're insane.
That is not the way things are done.

377
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,683
This is not a vacuum--
people will ask questions.

378
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:12,692
Pardon! On stage. Now.

379
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:22,881
And how do I know that you won't
release the tape an hour later?

380
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:24,733
You don't.

381
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:28,203
You'll just have to
take my word for it.

382
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:33,521
- Well, I need more than that.
- Well, you're not going to get it.

383
00:32:37,637 --> 00:32:39,231
Caroline...

384
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:41,443
it's time.

385
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:43,861
Make your choice.

386
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,761
Adams, I need you to
uncuff the detainee

387
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:55,833
and bring him here
to be released.

388
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:59,662
What are you doing?

389
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:04,323
I am going to make an announcement
pardoning Mr. Scofield and his brother,

390
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:06,381
and he will walk away unharmed.

391
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,853
Are you out of your mind?

392
00:33:09,366 --> 00:33:12,943
He has brought some
indisputable evidence to light.

393
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:16,273
We could end this
all right now.

394
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:18,191
And you're gonna let them walk?

395
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:22,573
I am the commander in chief,
and you are a corporate lackey.

396
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:26,660
I am making the calls now;
you have no authority.

397
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:32,433
My men will see to it that Mr.
Scofield walks away

398
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:37,331
without the interference
of you and your pit bulls.

399
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,483
- You alone?
- Yeah.

400
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:17,350
- How'd you do?
- Three tickets, one cabin, one way.

401
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,662
Nice.

402
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:21,672
- I owe you.
- No, we're even.

403
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:22,970
These are few you.

404
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,941
- Nice.
- And this.

405
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:28,883
What's this?

406
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:30,893
Eddie, when he broke out,

407
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:33,193
bet me a hundred bucks
you'd be caught in a week.

408
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,593
I said, "No way.
Not the Linc I know."

409
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:37,490
Figured I'd split it with you.

410
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:43,233
- So this is it, huh?
- Yeah.

411
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:45,932
Good luck.

412
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,113
- You take care.
- You, too.

413
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,602
All right. You be safe.

414
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:18,700
Your neck of the woods.

415
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:21,371
- Yeah, how's Third and Racine?
- I'll be there.

416
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:31,713
I don't want to do this,
I really don't.

417
00:35:32,828 --> 00:35:34,610
What are you talking about?

418
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:36,633
But you can't say that I
didn't give you a choice,

419
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:39,303
but you, you know,
you never take the easy way, you...

420
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,793
And I noticed that
about you, you...

421
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,653
I didn't expect it
to be any different,

422
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:48,700
but I have a job to do,
a job that I'm being made to do.

423
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,531
Pick it up, Sara.

424
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:55,721
Sara, pick it up.

425
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:59,000
Pick up the phone! Wait, wait!

426
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,772
Don't move.

427
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:06,343
Just, uh... don't, don't move.

428
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:09,572
Okay, I need the phone.
Give me the phone.

429
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:13,121
Stay right where
you are, please.

430
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,561
You don't really
want to do this.

431
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:18,762
You don't know the first
thing about what I want.

432
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,471
- Get my message?
- Yeah.

433
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:44,821
- I got her.
- She's on her way out.

434
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:48,341
Follow her;
she'll take you right to Scofield.

435
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:13,142
Sir... we need to talk.

436
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,131
In just a few minutes,
the president

437
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:21,840
is going to announce a pardon
for Burrows and Scofield.

438
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:24,571
As you're well aware,
this is quite a departure.

439
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,603
She's always been
willing to play ball,

440
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,371
but I think we need to
take some sort of action.

441
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:31,863
Sir...

442
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,371
I hate to disturb you, but

443
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:42,612
I'm not sure you realize the
gravity of what she's about to do.

444
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:05,202
- Michael.
- Sara, it worked.

445
00:38:05,528 --> 00:38:06,933
The pardon?

446
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:10,261
She's announcing it any minute.

447
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:12,680
Oh, my God.

448
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:15,332
Oh... oh, my God.

449
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:18,713
Michael, that's amazing.
Just get here, okay?

450
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,980
I'm on, uh...

451
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:25,742
Highland. It's a warehouse.
It runs right down to the water.

452
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,900
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

453
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:07,922
We did it.

454
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:09,822
Yeah?

455
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,641
What happened to
your face, man?

456
00:39:15,296 --> 00:39:16,703
If you want to take the ride...

457
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:20,180
...you got to buy the ticket.

458
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:21,483
Yeah, right.

459
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:25,182
Well, uh, Derek hooked us up with
a cabin on one of those freighters.

460
00:39:25,325 --> 00:39:27,242
South America via
the Great Lakes.

461
00:39:27,438 --> 00:39:32,232
We're not going to need that,
but, uh, this is appreciated.

462
00:39:32,427 --> 00:39:34,111
One more time, bro.

463
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:35,932
We did it?

464
00:39:36,078 --> 00:39:37,001
It's done.

465
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:39,002
We're done.

466
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:45,122
I wish I could have seen
the look on her face.

467
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:47,871
No, you don't.

468
00:39:48,936 --> 00:39:50,482
Oh, yeah, I do.

469
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:56,413
Unbelievable.

470
00:39:56,787 --> 00:40:01,162
- She's going to do it.
- Unbelievable.

471
00:40:03,106 --> 00:40:06,773
The president is now taking the stage
here at the Grand Carlisle Hotel.

472
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:08,703
The two-hour delay
in her appearance

473
00:40:08,888 --> 00:40:13,450
due to an investigation characterized
by Press Secretary Ryan Berg

474
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:16,080
as "an overzealous fan."

475
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:25,013
- You are not going to do this.
- I'm afraid I am.

476
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,191
There are some developments
you need to be aware of.

477
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,623
I have made my decision.

478
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:31,492
And I would appreciate you
not second-guessing me.

479
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:36,571
I don't think you understand.
We know your secrets, too.

480
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,472
And we can reveal
them just as easily.

481
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:45,121
You need to ask yourself who you
fear more, Michael Scofield or us?

482
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:46,941
You got 30 seconds.

483
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:48,963
I won't keep you.

484
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,100
The world is waiting.

485
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:52,271
Ten seconds.

486
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:55,463
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

487
00:40:55,658 --> 00:41:05,700
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

488
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:10,963
Thank you for waiting so
patiently all afternoon.

489
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:18,283
If it were not for the support of this
great state, my home state
of Illinois...

490
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,482
Thank you.

491
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:24,832
I would not be here today.

492
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:27,552
Which is why I
have chosen today

493
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:31,511
to make this very
important announcement.

494
00:41:32,665 --> 00:41:36,142
A situation has
recently come to light,

495
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,582
and I feel that I
must take action.

496
00:41:39,728 --> 00:41:43,770
It is my job as president
of this great country

497
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:49,132
to make rational decisions
when I am given facts.

498
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:54,971
Decisions that are best not for me,
but for the people.

499
00:41:56,876 --> 00:42:01,841
And so,
after much consideration,

500
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:05,093
I regret to inform

501
00:42:05,327 --> 00:42:11,452
you that I have been diagnosed with
a highly malignant form of cancer.

502
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:17,552
And because of that reason,

503
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:22,832
I am no longer fit to serve
as your commander in chief.

504
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:28,260
In the best interest of this country,
effective immediately,

505
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:34,933
I am stepping down as
president of the United States.

506
00:42:41,585 --> 00:42:44,781
If she ain't the president,
the tape's useless.

507
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:46,983
She can't pardon anyone.

508
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:49,680
We got nothing.

509
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:57,070
There's only one
thing we can do.

510
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:01,213
We got to disappear...

511
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:03,582
forever.

512
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,583
