00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,832
Amado Carrillo Fuentes!

3
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,378
The Lord of the Skies!

4
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,714
How fucking elegant, motherfucker.

5
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,802
- Don't tease.
- God damn, fucker.

6
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,931
- Your little brother?
- Yes. Alvaro.

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,432
Come here, son.

8
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,727
- You also get a hug.
- Sir.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,107
How are you doing?

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,695
320 million kinds of okay.

11
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,615
Doesn't it smell like
the fucking U.S. Treasury in here?

12
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,785
- This half is yours.
- Yes?

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,455
- Don't forget it.
- All right. We came at a good time, then.

14
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,542
A Tuesday like any other, Pacho.
You know how it is.

15
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,752
Motherfucker.

16
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,438
- Let's go to the house.
- Let's go.

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,508
- All right. Son, do you like margaritas?
- Of course I do.

18
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,802
Great, because I have a Margarita for you.

19
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,346
She'll suck you dry.

20
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,019
Welcome to Mexico, motherfucker.

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,603
Let's go.

22
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,360
Take the money and destroy the plane.

23
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,214
First off, Senator Martin and I
would like to thank you

24
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,174
for having us down, Ambassador.

25
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,345
But, you gotta know what's going on
in Washington.

26
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,099
Folks are wondering
if we're gonna win this thing.

27
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,894
And as senior members
of the Appropriations Committee,

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,397
those questions are directed at us.

29
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,652
Now, everyone's proud of the work
you guys did to bring down Escobar.

30
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,489
And it's particularly an honor
to meet you, Agent Peña.

31
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,786
But cocaine continues to flow north,
and the American people wonder

32
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,081
if the Colombians share our enthusiasm
to take this threat head-on.

33
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,044
Our colleague, Senator Helms,
put forward some tough language on them.

34
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,882
But we wanted to come down here
and get the real from you all.

35
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,633
See firsthand what's at stake.

36
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:24,681
See how and... if we can give you
all the support you need.

37
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,936
Let's extend the senators every courtesy
while they're here.

38
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,230
Their mission is a priority.

39
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,775
They ask... you answer.

40
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,942
Thank you.

41
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,571
<i>Money makes the world go 'round.</i>

42
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:43,116
<i>Legal or illegal, good guys and bad guys,
we all chase money.</i>

43
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>For the DEA, it's about budget meetings
and kissing the right ass</i>

44
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,073
<i>to keep the funding flowing.</i>

45
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,083
<i>But if you're a trafficker,
getting the money is easy.</i>

46
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,127
<i>It's holding onto it that's hard.</i>

47

50
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,261
<i>In the early days,
cash was flown back to Colombia</i>

51
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>on the same planes
that carried coke into the States.</i>

52
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,227
<i>Then it was converted into pesos,
or, if you were Pablo Escobar,</i>

53
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,895
<i>stuck in a hole somewhere.</i>

54
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,191
<i>One trafficker died with so much cash
buried on his property, when it rained,</i>

55
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,736
<i>the river downstream became clogged
with bills that had washed free.</i>

56
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,406
<i>The biggest problem with illegal money
is the trail that it leaves.</i>

57
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,744
<i>Once upon a time, American banks
would take your money, no questions asked.</i>

58
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,706
<i>That changed when President Nixon
signed the Bank Secrecy Act,</i>

59
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,125
<i>requiring all U.S. banks
to report transactions</i>

60
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,836
<i>involving more than $10,000 in cash.</i>

61
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,882
<i>And from that law,
money laundering was born.</i>

62
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,761
<i>The first stage of money laundering
is called placement,</i>

63
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,513
<i>and Cali had it down to an art.</i>

64
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,266
<i>Bringing workers from the</i> comunas
<i>to the U.S.,</i>

65
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,393
<i>where their job was to buy money orders,</i>

66
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,771
<i>each just under ten grand,
so they wouldn't be reported.</i>

67
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,565
<i>No I.D. was required.</i>

68
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,318
<i>And the orders could even remain blank
until they were deposited or cashed.</i>

69
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,698
<i>Once they bought a bunch of money orders,
they packed them up and sent them south</i>

70
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,951
<i>to a land of sunshine and lax oversight.</i>

71
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>Switzerland on the Caribbean: Panama.</i>

72
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,625
<i>Since they didn't regulate wire transfers,
Panama was the perfect place</i>

73
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,461
<i>for the second stage of money laundering:
layering.</i>

74
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,297
<i>And here's where the master goes to work.</i>

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,926
<i>The behind the scenes MVP
of any drug cartel is the money launderer,</i>

76
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,847
<i>the guy that takes the dirty money
and scrubs it clean. Here's how:</i>

77
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,517
<i>The money orders were deposited
into local bank accounts,</i>

78
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,395
<i>and then bounced through shell companies
and limited partnerships,</i>

79
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>creating an untraceable web of phony
purchase orders and transaction reports,</i>

80
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,027
<i>wiping clean the money's criminal origins.</i>

81
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,697
<i>But no matter how well you hide it,
money always leaves a trail.</i>

82
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>And the best way to hurt the Cali cartel
was to find it.</i>

83

<i>♪ Dollar, dollar bill, y'all ♪</i>

84

<i>Cali.</i> Muy hermosa,<i> right?</i>

85
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,289
Fuck you, Chris.

86
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,709
The man asked me if I had a partner,
and your desk is across from mine.

87
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,336
You really fucked me, man.

88
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,380
You gonna ride a desk all the way
to Special Operations Unit?

89
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,257
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

90
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,010
Agents Feistl, Van Ness...?

91
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,095
- Feistl.
- Welcome to Cali.

92
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,847
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Captain Calderón.

93
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,515
We're happy to be here.

94
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,768
And what brings you to Cali?

95
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,521
We've got some addresses
we want to investigate.

96
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,024
Cartel-related?

97
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,402
Not necessarily.

98
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,614
What a surprise.
DEA agents that don't trust us.

99
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,033
How did that work out
for the last two guys?

100
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,913
Friend, in Cali, there are more
corrupt cops than there are churches.

101
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,082
You don't trust me? I understand.

102
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,086
But if you want to get anything done
in Cali, you need the police's help.

103
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,006
If not me, someone else.

104
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,050
Not my rule.

105
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,760
- I understand.
- Good.

106
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,765
The addresses are linked
to cartel financial operations.

107
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,854
We want to put eyes on them.
See if any of the dots start connecting...

108
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,065
You've come a long way to connect dots.

109
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,901
We work with what we've got.

110
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:09,364
Unless you can tell me where I can find
Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez.

111
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,286
If they didn't own half of the city,
I couldn't even be sure they exist.

112
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,332
The Rodríguez brothers are ghosts.

113
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,292
<i>It was true.</i>

114
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,962
<i>While the terms of surrender
were being finalized,</i>

115
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,589
<i>the brothers had gone underground
to avoid capture.</i>

116
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>They abandoned their swank estates,
secretly moving to new homes,</i>

117
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,227
<i>where they could continue
running their empire</i>

118
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,432
<i>without setting foot
in one of their legitimate businesses.</i>

119
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:40,854
<i>And all this while Chepe continued
to expand their New York operation.</i>

120
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,441
<i>But sometimes, even the best get unlucky.</i>

121
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,902
<i>A computer glitch in Monaco
led authorities to notice</i>

122
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,364
<i>that one limited partnership
had multiple accounts at the same bank.</i>

123
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,366
<i>When they looked closer,</i>

124
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,203
<i>they found it had ties to hundreds
of bullshit accounts across Europe.</i>

125
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>And they all led back to one bank...</i>

126
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,750
<i>right here in Bogotá.</i>

127
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,004
<i>Lucky for us, the president
had given the DEA our best weapon yet:</i>

128
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,547
<i>the Clinton list.</i>

129
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,050
<i>If we suspected a company
of working with traffickers,</i>

130
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,509
<i>their name went on the list.</i>

131
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,153
<i>And then they were banned
from doing business with U.S. companies</i>

132
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,598
<i>and U.S. companies were banned
from doing business with them.</i>

133
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,266
You get fucked both ways.

134
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,144
And you want to know
what the best part is?

135
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,480
We don't even have to prove it.

136
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,399
We just... put you on the list.

137
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,360
And the OFAC takes care of the rest.

138
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,907
How can I help you, Agent Peña?

139
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,869
<i>Armed with the threat
of the Clinton list,</i>

140
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,329
<i>we could get pretty much
any information we wanted,</i>

141
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,041
<i>and that's how we were able to give
Cali's number one money launderer a name:</i>

142
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,793
<i>Franklin Jurado.</i>

143
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,669
<i>Because it was illegal
for Colombian citizens</i>

144
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,755
<i>to have U.S. currency in their possession,</i>

145
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,091
<i>a money launderer became more
than just a connection</i>

146
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,927
<i>to the financial institutions
that washed their cash.</i>

147
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>For all intents and purposes,
he is their money.</i>

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,893
<i>Jurado was the perfect bridge between
the narcos and the world of high finance.</i>

149
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,230
<i>He spoke five languages
and traveled on multiple passports.</i>

150
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,775
<i>He married an American girl he met
while at business school in the States,</i>

151
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,236
<i>took her down south,
and got her in on his action.</i>

152
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,573
<i>That American passport was solid gold
in any Caribbean bank.</i>

153
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,370
<i>Jurado was smooth.
But now, we knew his name.</i>

154
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
These are cash transfers.

155
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,292
The accounts are controlled
by a man named Franklin Jurado.

156
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,047
- You know him?
- Of him.

157
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,217
He served as director at Interamericas.

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,886
- The Rodríguez brothers' bank.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,181
They later gave him a more important job.

160
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,517
Do you have an address for Jurado?

161
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,435
I can get it for you.

162
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,732
So what happened
since the last time I saw you?

163
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,485
Are you going to take these men on,
or what?

164
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,157
- I'm going to do my job.
- And your bosses?

165
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,660
Do they know what you're doing?

166
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,662
No comment.

167
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,623
<i>♪ Dance with me ♪</i>

168
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,295
<i>♪ In my world of fantasy ♪</i>

169
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,506
<i>♪ Won't you dance with me ♪</i>

170
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,678
<i>♪ Ritual fertility ♪</i>

171
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,814
I was thinking...

172
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,026
maybe I could come with you.

173
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh, come on, this could be our last chance
to travel like we used to.

174
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,285
- Remember that place in Milan?
- With the leaking roof?

175
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,330
On your birthday.
And that terrible risotto.

176
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,874
That balcony.

177
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,421
The brothers are pushing now, baby.
They are opening more accounts.

178
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
- It's dangerous.
- I don't care.

179
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,723
How high are you right now?

180
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,768
Hey, fuck you!

181
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,811
Give me your passport.

182
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,607
I can't stay in this apartment anymore,
Franklin.

183
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,902
I can't watch another movie with subtitles
by myself.

184
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,756
I don't want to listen to the cartel wives
talk about their husbands...

185
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,717
- With an English degree from Harvard...
- Please don't tell me I can teach.

186
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,326
Then what did you want me to say?

187
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
Fuck.

188
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,456
We'll do this another time.

189
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,004
The dining room is over here.

190
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,882
You have a room over here.

191
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,093
You have another one over here.

192
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,096
And here, you have the living room.

193
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,063
The dimmer is over here.

194
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
And you can adjust the light.

195
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,530
Well... you get the idea.

196
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:05,243
- No. I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

197
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,161
Does this seem normal to you?

198
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,746
You indicated to Mr. Rodríguez

199
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,708
you were uncertain about returning
to the North Valley.

200
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,378
And that's why he bought me a palace.
With dimmers.

201
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,840
Please tell Don Miguel thank you,

202
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,926
but I need to think
about his generous offer.

203
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,430
We have that dinner tonight.

204
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,266
With your friends?

205
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,977
With the investors.

206
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,689
They're not going to like
the six-month delay.

207
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,527
And I think it's best if we don't mention
the Rodríguez brothers by name.

208
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,533
I know you're embarrassed by what I do.

209
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,751
I know you did it for your family.

210
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,046
But if these people like everything
they hear tonight,

211
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,007
you'll have your own security firm
the second these six months are up.

212
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,927
- Ready!
- Good!

213
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,012
A choir!

214
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,058
All right, say bye to Dad.
We're leaving.

215
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,893
- Bye.
- Bye.

216
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,562
All right. Let's go, or we'll be late.

217
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,773
Will you make it on time?

218
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,525
If you're wearing the dress
with the flowers, yes.

219
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,448
Let's go, girls.

220
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,410
Today is a busy day for us, boys.

221
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,331
Bosses have meetings all day
at the National Hotel.

222
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,169
I need you to pre-sweep
each and every location on this schedule.

223
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,340
And I don't want a bunch of cars parked
like bullshit, blocking escape routes.

224
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,677
- He's looking at you, Montez.
- Of course I'm talking to you, you idiot.

225
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,057
Don Miguel's team on channel six.
Don Gilberto's, channel eight.

226
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,559
Jorge says that the DEA is visiting Cali.

227
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:58,648
Two agents from Bogotá. They're new.
They're working with the National Police.

228
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,485
But they don't have warrants.
They're tourists.

229
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,904
They need permission
to wipe their own asses.

230
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,868
Regardless, while they're in Cali,
we'll be watching them.

231
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,747
- That's your job, Enrique, my brother.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,374
That's all, gentlemen.

233
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,335
Communicate. Stay safe. Get to work.

234
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,676
I have to duck out early.
It's a work thing for Paola.

235
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,760
Of course.

236
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,096
Do you want to practice your English?

237
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,765
Starkman, the American lawyer,
arrives today.

238
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,809
Can you pick him up from the airport?

239
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,729
Aren't you worried about the tourists?

240
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,358
The second team's
never as good as the first.

241
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,874
Got a look at the directory.
That company moved out three months ago.

242
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,710
If they were ever there at all.

243
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,014
Quiet part of the city here.

244
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,142
Cartel keep Cali buttoned down?

245
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,478
Nobody talks.

246
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,064
All the multinationals
used to have offices here in Cali.

247
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,149
"Used to"?

248
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,236
Pulled out because of the city's ties
to the narcotics trade.

249
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,240
The Rodríguez brothers
are the only game in town now.

250
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,786
Fucking drug dealers
pretending to be stockbrokers.

251
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,874
Motherfuckers ruined this city.

252
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,671
Where are we headed next?

253
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,965
Please.

254
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,012
This way, Mr. Starkman.

255
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,891
How the hell are you supposed
to fly international if you can't smoke?

256
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,684
I guess you can always quit.

257
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,481
And let United Airlines
tell me how to live?

258
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,570
Remind me again... Kansas City?

259
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,782
- Leavenworth.
- What the fuck for?

260
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,493
My father was in the army.
There's a base there.

261
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:20,373
They sent him to train.
I was like... seven years old.

262
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,042
What? It's America.

263
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,502
That's for sure.

264
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,922
So am I meeting the brothers at the hotel?

265
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,005
Yes.

266
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,677
Serious stones on these guys.

267
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,347
Retiring, like they run Lehman Brothers.

268
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,100
It's a good break for you, though.

269
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,769
You'll get immunity
when the surrender goes through.

270
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,688
I don't sell cocaine.

271
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,439
I don't shoot anyone.

272
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,441
You're a member of the Cali cartel.

273
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,694
You ever hear of conspiracy,<i> amigo?</i>

274
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,824
Relax. I got this. Look, they're lucky
to have us both, Jorge.

275
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,577
You can't put a price on freedom.

276
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,667
Though Lord knows I try.

277
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,592
I assume you would prefer U.S. currency?

278
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,010
Of course.

279
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,511
Currency aside,

280
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,431
we aren't in the habit
of paying for things in advance.

281
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,475
What guarantee do we have
that you will provide what you promise?

282
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,102
Forgive my brother.

283
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,564
We are grateful for the support
you and your people have offered.

284
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,692
This afternoon, our associate,
Mr. Pallomari,

285
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,070
will prepare the contribution
and arrange delivery.

286
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,281
Very well.

287
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,744
The contribution should be divided
among seven men.

288
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,245
Their names are on the list.

289
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,960
All right, very well. Going forward,

290
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:51,881
I think it's best if Mr. Pallomari deals
with my colleague, Mr. Giraldo.

291
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,008
As you wish.

292
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,428
Have a great day, gentlemen.

293
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,023
Well, our surrender has been bought.
Now it must be paid for.

294
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,694
And they say we're the criminals.

295
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,614
Sons of bitches.

296
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:21,035
Small price to pay, brother,
for the rest of your life.

297
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,122
Gentlemen, I will prepare these payments
myself, as soon as I'm back in the office.

298
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,709
And I'll make sure
that all of this is in order.

299
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,879
Mr. Starkman is next, the lawyer.

300
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,008
If you ever make it to Miami
and you need a lawyer...

301
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,344
hit me up.

302
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,764
I wasn't planning on it,
but thank you, Mr. Starkman.

303
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,849
Yeah, nobody ever plans on it.

304
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,893
Mr. Starkman.

305
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,020
- Welcome to Cali.
- Yeah.

306
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,732
The Rodríguez brothers
are pleased to welcome you.

307
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,319
No offense,
but remind me again what you do?

308
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,739
I'm the chief accountant
to the Rodríguez brothers.

309
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:02,702
What happened to the other guy?
The good-looking one? Pacho?

310
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,495
Mr. Herrera?

311
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:08,165
Yeah, I bet he's the guy who's got
all the pussy in town on speed dial.

312
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah. Please, sir.

313
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,671
<i>- Feistl.</i>
- How's it going?

314
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,592
Well, slow so far,
but Calderón seems like good police.

315
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,677
<i>Yeah. Good.</i>

316
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,637
<i>That journalist come through?</i>

317
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,347
I'm on the money man right now.

318
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,308
- See where he takes me.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

319
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,601
Eyes open, Feistl.

320
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,146
- Everything by the book.
<i>- Will do.</i>

321
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,857
- Keep me posted.
- Baby, wait.

322
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,321
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
Come here.

324
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,814
The Arellano Felix brothers

325
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,733
are still wasting time with heroin.

326
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,361
Hey! What? You're not going to say hello?

327
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,906
- Hello.
- Are you in a bad mood or what?

328
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,798
Amado... this is the life.

329
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,633
You guys helped me.

330
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,719
I moved the last 100 tons
in less than 50 days.

331
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,305
You tell me if we're a great team or not.

332
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,349
That's why we're here.

333
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,893
Can you handle a bigger package?

334
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,564
I'm the Lord of the Skies, brother.
What do you think?

335
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,817
<i>Amado Carrillo Fuentes.</i>

336
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,152
<i>Leader of the Juárez cartel.</i>

337
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,113
<i>He was one of the most
enterprising traffickers in Mexico</i>

338
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>and one of the first to get into business
with his Colombian friends to the south.</i>

339
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,954
<i>While Escobar saw
the Mexican traffickers as a threat,</i>

340
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,705
<i>Cali saw them as a partner.</i>

341
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,210
<i>A partner that shared over 1,900 miles
of virtually undefended border</i>

342
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,213
<i>with Cali's biggest customer:
the United States.</i>

343
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,258
<i>And right about the time
the Caribbean corridor closed</i>

344
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,679
<i>along came NAFTA, when the U.S.-Mexico
border was open for business.</i>

345
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,347
<i>And Amado took full advantage,</i>

346
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,225
<i>agreeing to ferry Cali cocaine
into the States.</i>

347
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,811
<i>They called it "the Mexican trampoline,"</i>

348
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>bouncing cocaine into America,
and bouncing cash right back.</i>

349
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,192
I can move however much you give me.

350
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,529
I just have two questions: How much?

351
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,491
And for how much longer, Pacho?

352
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,160
Because I know about your deal.

353
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,413
I know you want to turn yourselves in.

354
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,417
There is a deal on the table, Amado.

355
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,795
But we have six months
to turn ourselves in. That's the truth.

356
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,300
Until then,
we will honor our commitment to you.

357
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,551
Right, and after?

358
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,470
What happens after that?

359
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,017
The business will adjust.

360
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,022
This I know. It will always adjust.
This will never end.

361
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,692
There will be other partners
and more drugs. But what about you?

362
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,236
What will happen to you?

363
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:30,534
You can't tell me you're going to retire,
as if this was any normal business.

364
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,828
You know this is a way of life.

365
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,956
It retires you when it's done with you.

366
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,462
Or are you going to start playing golf
like an old man?

367
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,810
We need to count on you maintaining
the same terms on this last shipment.

368
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,774
Done.

369
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,654
It'll be my gift to the Gentlemen of Cali.

370
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,408
All right? But...
you have to come with me to Juárez.

371
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,288
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

372
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,709
The future, Pacho.

373
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,587
The fucking future, that's all.

374
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,804
- Here's your passport.
- Thank you.

375
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,725
All right, and you board through Gate 15.

376
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,810
Okay.

377
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,023
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you.

378
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,401
Have a great day.

379
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,194
Next.

380
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,702
I'm going to Panama.

381
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,246
I need you to radio ahead
to the DEA office.

382
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,498
I'm afraid not. This plane can't take off.
New orders.

383
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,999
What are you talking about?

384
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,482
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not looking for that kind of trouble.

385
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,464
Oh, shit.

386
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,596
What the fuck is going on?

387
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,975
Orders are orders.
You heard the ambassador.

388
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,815
Our friends from the Senate here
want the down-low from a real-life hero.

389
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,359
Guess that's you.

390
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,696
You got somewhere better to be?

391
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,741
You wore the wrong shoes.

392
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,166
Fuck.

393
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,382
Is that the Río Negro?

394
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,271
What do we got here?

395
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,023
The captain likes this one.

396
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,525
You won't find their name on the lease,

397
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,528
but the Rodríguez brothers
own the top six floors.

398
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,239
Oh, fuck. For real?

399
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,658
I told you,
there are some honest cops in Cali.

400
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,620
Let me reach out to men I trust.

401
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:24,666
Quietly. Keep an eye on this place.
You go back to Bogotá and...

402
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,585
get a warrant.

403
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,048
Come on, guys,
the place isn't moving anywhere.

404
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,968
Get that paper
and we'll turn this place upside down.

405
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,053
Why wait?

406
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,139
Judge in Bogotá signed a warrant for us
before we left.

407
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,648
Which you never told me about.

408
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:53,403
This is the kind of bullshit
I don't like. Are you playing me or what?

409
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,782
Hey, man, it's like you said.
It's hard to know who to trust.

410
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,743
I wasn't even sure we were gonna need it.

411
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,205
There's no address on this warrant.

412
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,375
You said this place is connected,
so let's put in some work.

413
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,752
Do you know the kind of shit
I could land in?

414
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,628
Huh?

415
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,757
I don't have a DEA pension waiting for me.

416
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,219
Pensions aren't that great, to be honest.

417
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,601
Fuck.

418
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,980
Let's do it.

419
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:35,195
I need a tactical team
sent to 15th Street and 4th Avenue, copy?

420
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,573
<i>Copy that.
Requesting a tactical team</i>

421
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,700
<i>at 15th Street and 4th Avenue.</i>

422
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,535
You do realize, don't you,

423
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,080
after we surrender,
all of this shit will end.

424
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,877
No more sitting by the pool,
smoking your cigar,

425
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,713
telling everyone what to do.

426
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,632
Look, Miguel,
I'm tired of telling people what to do.

427
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,553
And no one has ever listened to you.

428
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,431
What's the difference?

429
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,899
But you know what?

430
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,988
Never, in human history, have two brothers
accomplished what we have.

431
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:24,494
We aren't the first people in history
to build an empire, Gilberto.

432
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,206
But we're the first to retire
leaving the empire intact.

433
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,754
If Mom were alive, she'd be proud.

434
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,716
Brothers are well, nephews are well,
sons are well.

435
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,976
<i>Boss, we just heard a call</i>

436
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:47,017
<i>that a tactical team left Jamundí station
heading to 4th Avenue.</i>

437
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,520
Enrique, where are you?

438
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,065
Watching our visitors from the DEA.

439
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,442
They've been checking addresses
all over town.

440
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,694
But right now, they're stopped,
just doing nothing.

441
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,071
Yes, but where are you?

442
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,324
At 15th Street and... 4th. On 4th Avenue.

443
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,911
Enrique, fuck!
There's a police convoy coming at you!

444
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,496
<i>Get Pallomari out of there now!</i>

445
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,730
Answer, you bastard, answer.

446
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,319
- Hello? What's up?
<i>- Listen, it's Salcedo.</i>

447
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,030
You're going to have unwelcome guests.
Leave now.

448
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,118
I don't have time for this.
I'm supervising an important project.

449
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,829
<i>That's exactly why I need you to get out.</i>

450
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,038
Just because you say so?

451
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,810
I know you're arranging an important
transaction for the bosses this afternoon.

452
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,877
Listen, this is none of your business.

453
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,380
<i>I'll bet your desk is covered
with American dollars.</i>

454
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,257
<i>Look, Guillermo, please.</i>

455
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,969
You've got papers. You've got names.
You've got things that shouldn't be seen.

456
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,262
- Jorge...
<i>- Get out of there!</i>

457
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,097
You do your job and I'll do mine.

458
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,435
This is my job! I'm telling you...
Son of a bitch!

459
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,338
Fuck your mother.

460
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,632
I need you to check the paper shredders

461
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,676
and the floppy disks
still in the computers.

462
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,889
Invoices. Bills of lading.
Anything on the computers.

463
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,993
- Warrant says paper only.
- Yeah? Warrants say a lot of things.

464
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:52,893
Let's go.

465
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
At least
someone's willing to get wet.

466
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,502
Don't worry, you'll be back
in Intelligence Group soon enough.

467
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,564
It's not...

468
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,859
This is a waste of our time, Chris.

469
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,528
And more importantly,
this is a waste of a warrant.

470
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,404
You know what?

471
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,868
Andrew Jackson here says all we find
in this fucking high rise

472
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,554
- is a nice view of the city.
- All right.

473
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,831
Well, I got... whoever this guy is
and he says otherwise.

474
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,255
Fucking shit!

475
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,786
Gentlemen, how may I help you?

476
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,567
Seventh floor. Mr. Pallomari's office.

477
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,861
I'll let them know you're here
so you can head up.

478
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,032
Oh, oh, oh...
People love surprises.

479
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,701
Gentlemen, you can't...

480
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,822
You. What the fuck
are you still doing here?

481
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,745
What the fuck am I doing? My job.
We told your associate the same thing.

482
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,505
Sorry, boss, I tried, but he won't listen.

483
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,412
- You go get the car.
- Please get out.

484
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,695
- I have to finish. Fuck your mother.
- The back stairs.

485
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,624
- Yes, sir.
- Finish what?

486
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,376
My job, Jorge.

487
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,173
No. Please, we have to get rid
of all of that now.

488
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,383
We aren't arguing.
You aren't touching anything.

489
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,343
I've got a method and a system.

490
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,737
- Method and a system?
- Yes, sir.

491
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,140
Yes? What you've got is ten years of jail
time sitting on your desk, you idiot.

492
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,766
- Get out.
- No.

493
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
Attention! Colombian National Police!

494
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,189
Where are the files?

495
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,357
Get to work. Let's go!

496
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,234
This is an office.

497
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,281
We're working. How can I help you?

498
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,659
We need access to your files, invoices,
and all of your correspondence.

499
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:16,619
Ah...

500
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,665
If that's the case,
I need to see a warrant.

501
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,627
Are you supposed to be in charge?

502
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,381
Well, yes, I'm in charge.

503
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,311
Come on.

504
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,910
Good morning.
I have to see every invoice you have.

505
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,667
Hey!

506
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,754
This says documents only.
Fuck your mother.

507
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,217
Could you repeat that, sir?
My Spanish is... is a bit rough.

508
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,885
You didn't get that?

509
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,137
- Only papers.
- Documents only.

510
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,533
- All right.
- Claudia.

511
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,934
Keep an eye on the things
they're taking. Now!

512
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,017
Yes, sir.

513
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,238
Leave it. Let it be.

514
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,615
Chivo, check everything
and make an inventory, all right?

515
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,335
Hey, I like presents.
What'd you get us?

516
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,670
That's private.

517
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,993
Ignacio, please show the gentleman
last year's documents.

518
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,047
This way, please.

519
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,812
Excuse me, sir.

520
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,723
I must insist.

521
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,586
Your phone's off the hook.

522
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,248
Do you have a bill of lading?
Yes? Let me see.

523
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,876
More? Everything.

524
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,294
- Just these?
- And copies below.

525
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,754
- These as well, no?
- Yes, sir.

526
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,924
- All right. '93. Yeah?
- Those are the most recent.

527
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:25,767
Grab that.

528
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,605
Looks like you owe me that 20.

529
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,773
Oh, yeah.

530
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,068
You were right.

531
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:12,439
This area saw the biggest spike
in trafficking after Escobar was killed.

532
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,817
Can't we just spray chemicals
on this place and be done with it?

533
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,696
Unfortunately, agricultural concerns
in the region won't allow it.

534
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,031
That's right.
Chiquita Bananas is down here.

535
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,909
I know those guys. Big contributors.

536
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,706
Okay. Here we are.

537
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,087
Jesus H. Christ.

538
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,675
Must've been one hell of a firefight, huh?

539
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,759
No doubt, sir.

540
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,471
- Gentlemen, this is Captain Mills.
- Captain.

541
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,056
- Our advisor on this mission down here.
- How you doing, sir?

542
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,226
He liaised with a team
of Colombian commandos on this raid here.

543
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,898
These guys FARC or traffickers?

544
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,024
Both.

545
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,112
Probably started out doing security
for the traffickers, or extorting them.

546
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,616
FARC wants to overthrow the government.

547
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,243
Cocaine finances their struggles.

548
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,870
Top of the line.

549
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,166
There's an arms race going on down here.

550
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,249
And this shit...

551
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,586
is jet fuel.

552
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,757
You guys ready for lunch?

553
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,344
Lunch?
Yeah. Sure. Why not?

554
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,684
Go. Go. Go.

555
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,614
This 24-hour party thing...

556
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,368
is tiring after a couple of days.

557
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,916
Can you imagine if it was your life?

558
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,047
What's on your mind?

559
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,511
Dad, and the last thing he said to me.

560
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,388
What? "Get the fuck out"?

561
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,431
No.

562
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,436
He said... that in this world...

563
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,692
there was no place for a man like me.

564
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,990
I made a place for myself.

565
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,785
I proved him wrong.

566
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,832
And now, I have to give it all up.

567
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,590
What kind of man would I be
if I gave it all up?

568
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,633
I don't know, brother.

569
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:51,222
But what I do know is that you have
a couple billion dollars...

570
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,226
and the rest of your life
to figure it out.

571
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,777
<i>What are they giving me?</i>

572
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,621
What do you mean,
"What are they giving you?"

573
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,406
They took my son, didn't they?

574
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,284
They have to give us something.

575
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:16,080
Have they offered you something?

576
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,499
An apartment.

577
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,626
<i>Accept it.</i>

578
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,669
<i>Afterwards, I'll sell it for cash.</i>

579
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,214
<i>We'll take their money now.
Later, we'll take vengeance.</i>

580
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:28,551
<i>- Do it, then get back up here.</i>
- Can you wake Pedro up?

581
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,263
- I want to speak with him.
<i>- Don't worry about Pedro. He's sleeping.</i>

582
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,273
I heard we cut it close today.

583
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,776
I thought they didn't have a warrant.

584
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,487
That's what I was told
by our friend on the force.

585
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,657
A few more seconds
and we'd have had real trouble.

586
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,619
Those new DEA guys
are sharper than they look.

587
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,705
Well, luckily, we have you.

588
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,125
Did they get anything?

589
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,585
Some files.

590
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,379
So nothing. Good.

591
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,339
I'll take care of the rest today.

592
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,802
That thing you've got tonight with Paola,
enjoy yourself. Go on.

593
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,566
We got names,
addresses. These files are legit.

594
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,528
How are you guys?

595
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,611
Captain.

596
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,865
We'll catalog and seal
the ones from today.

597
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,284
If you could help us with transport...

598
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,997
Okay... there must be a misunderstanding.

599
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,375
The files stay here.

600
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,670
We need to sort through these.

601
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,464
As you can see,
we know how to process evidence, Feistl.

602
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:53,386
- That wasn't the deal. This was our intel.
- It was a CNP operation.

603
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,013
We let you join, support.

604
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,848
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

605
00:41:58,808 --> 00:41:59,976
I'm not.

606
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,271
But anything we find
we'll be sure to share with you.

607
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,232
I was instructed
you should be back in Bogotá tonight.

608
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,359
You're going out on the last flight.

609
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,863
He burned us.

610
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,492
Who's that, Chris?

611
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,202
The last honest cop in Cali?

612
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,415
No, man. He clowned me, too.
I'm calling the boss.

613
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,094
Fuck!

614
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,642
Those things
ain't going 25 feet down here.

615
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,980
Thanks. Hey, you DOD?

616
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,026
So they say. But I still ID as a Marine.

617
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,612
I'm part
of the military assistance package.

618
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,031
- CIA?
- Oh, shit. Fuck, no.

619
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,075
Can I get a smoke?

620
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:03,914
Thanks.

621
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,251
Where you from?

622
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,004
The last place? Pendleton.

623
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,508
I was out there teaching Saudi soldiers
how to do jumping jacks.

624
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,635
That shit's a lot harder than it sounds.

625
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,724
- So is it really that bad down here?
- Yeah. It is.

626
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,770
You got paramilitary, FARC,
traffickers, us.

627
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,856
Some pretty hairy bullshit down here.

628
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,193
Right, but not hairy enough
for the truth to make its case.

629
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,240
Magazines on those bodies
are 7.62 millimeter.

630
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,952
They go in an AK-47, right?

631
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,582
Those guns, the fancy ones,
they chamber in a 5.56.

632
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,588
This whole thing is staged.

633
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,801
Those are run-of-the-mill<i> guerrillas.</i>
Peasants, not traffickers.

634
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,262
You know your guns.

635
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,975
I'm gonna head on down.

636
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,274
Not very original, Stechner.

637
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,735
Even for the CIA.

638
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:20,533
Yeah, well, sometimes you need
to make the truth a little more... plain.

639
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,373
Well, how's this for truth?

640
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:33,296
They go home and tell everyone
the war on drugs is a fucking stage show.

641
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,050
And all the money they put in
is pissed away.

642
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,971
Even the hero said it's fucked up.

643
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,392
What's that do to your plan?

644
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,313
I'm gonna level with you.

645
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,481
Sending a five-billion-dollar aid package

646
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:57,153
to a country that's on the verge
of becoming a narco-democracy,

647
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,696
that's a bad look in the Senate.

648
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,742
All due respect, Senator, you're looking
at a petri dish for the next Castro,

649
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,702
and this one's fed by narco dollars.

650
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,039
And not just here. Venezuela, Honduras.

651
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,167
Rich dictators
with anti-American hard-ons.

652
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,711
We turn our back on this place,
it all goes to hell.

653
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:24,096
Colombia is perfectly situated to help us
in both Central and South America.

654
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,934
The right American footprint here,
Black Hawks, small arms,

655
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,353
night vision, advisors like Mills...

656
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:35,149
we help secure a stable Colombia,

657
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,818
and it becomes a beacon for the region.

658
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,696
Well, if you want
the American people

659
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,616
to get behind sending
billions of dollars to Colombia...

660
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,453
we need
a no-fucking-around victory down here.

661
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,206
Look, gentlemen, the Colombian government

662
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:54,752
is months away from dismantling one
of the biggest drug cartels in history.

663
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,339
And they will do it without firing a shot.

664
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,968
No body count, no dirty hands.

665
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,804
I can't imagine the folks back home
won't like that.

666
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,139
Agent Peña.

667
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,268
What do you think?

668
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,523
Is it true? Is a big win coming?

669
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,195
Agent Stechner and I...

670
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,201
we have a long-standing difference
of opinion on just about everything.

671
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,331
But he and I can both agree...

672
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,960
a big win is coming.

673
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,769
Glad we're on the same page, Agent Peña.

674
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,857
So the whole surrender plan
is about fucking fundraising!

675
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,445
The Colombians get a check and you get
to play army men in the jungle?

676
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,823
I'm thinking about the next battle,
the one that really counts.

677
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,617
Which means you're willing
to lose this one!

678
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,120
The drug war?

679
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,124
Oh, come on, man! We lost it!

680
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,459
You were there!

681
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,840
Ever stop and think that anyone
that takes this as personally as you do

682
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,800
is doing it wrong?

683
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
- Fuck you!
- Yeah.

684
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,266
See ya!

685
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,583
Where are they now?

686
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,807
<i>I just put them on a plane to Bogotá.</i>

687
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,725
- And the files?
<i>- We've got them.</i>

688
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:15,726
Are you sure?

689
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,979
Look, they tricked me
with that fucking warrant, all right?

690
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:24,860
<i>And I couldn't warn you because we were
all together like a fucking family.</i>

691
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,197
These Americans know what they're doing.

692
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,616
<i>They aren't fucking idiots.</i>

693
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,697
I ever tell you I did a rotation in Chile?

694
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,210
No, Dan, you never told me
you did a rotation in fucking Chile.

695
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,380
The accountant.

696
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,759
- You clock his accent?
- No.

697
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,013
A little off. You know, he said something:
<i>"Concha su madre."</i>

698
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,808
Okay, what's that?
"Fuck your mother" or something?

699
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:56,891
Exactly.

700
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,104
But then he said another word:<i>"Cachai."</i>

701
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,357
It's a phrase that they typically
only use in Chile.

702
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,902
And if he's from Chile...

703
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,155
He can be extradited.

704
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,709
<i>Panama DEA said no warrant, no detention.</i>

705
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,670
- Fuck.
<i>- Plus, Jurado didn't stay in Panama.</i>

706
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,880
They know where he went?

707
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,506
No.

708
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,218
So Jurado could be anywhere. Fuck!

709
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:35,472
<i>Also, boss, Feistl and Van Ness
have been trying you. A lot.</i>

710
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,684
All right, well, put them through
when you get them. I'm on my way back.

711
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,561
<i>- And Stoddard?</i>
- Yeah, boss?

712
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,856
Jurado has a wife in Bogotá.
She's American.

713
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,858
Put a tap on her phone.

714
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,403
- I don't think I can do that.
<i>- Just do it.</i>

715
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:59,997
Well, the truth is, we're
very interested in your proposal, Jorge.

716
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,166
And in your potential for growth.

717
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,460
You've exceeded Paola's description,

718
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,253
which wasn't easy.

719
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,550
Of course, we were inconvenienced
by the six-month delay, which...

720
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,510
took us by surprise.

721
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,557
I take my commitments very seriously,
gentlemen.

722
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,061
And I couldn't leave without ensuring
my replacement met the standard

723
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,938
they've come to expect.

724
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,439
Go wait for him over there.

725
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,192
- Good evening. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

726
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,324
Well, I think that merits
another bottle of wine, no?

727
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,408
Yes.

728
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,162
Look at that son of a bitch.

729
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,041
Thinks his shit doesn't stink, or what?

730
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:53,425
Thank you.

731
00:50:53,634 --> 00:51:00,015
So, a security expert married to a rising
star in one of Cali's top law firms.

732
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,725
Have you worked together before?

733
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:05,645
My compliments.

734
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,316
David Rodríguez.

735
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:13,945
How are you?

736
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,162
Don't let the elegant suit fool you.

737
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,792
This guy's a real son of a bitch.

738
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:28,376
Seriously.

739
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,380
In fact, he's one of our best men.

740
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,631
You see?

741
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,303
Enjoy it.

742
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,555
Ma'am.

743
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,655
You... Where do you know him from?
Is he a friend of yours?

744
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,366
You know Cali is a very small city.

745
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,871
Even more so
when one is in the security business.

746
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,915
One must deal with all sorts of people.

747
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:15,090
Is that the paperwork
I'm supposed to deliver?

748
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,427
These documents are very sensitive.

749
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,514
And I don't feel comfortable
transferring possession to anyone else.

750
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,601
All right. Let's go, then.

751
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,485
Open the door, Córdova.

752
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,820
Go fuck yourself, Pallomari.

753
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,323
- Huh?
- In the front seat.

754
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,076
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Open the door. Fuck your mother.

755
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,328
In the front.
I'm not your fucking employee.

756
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,753
Making friends everywhere he goes.

757
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,505
No shit.

758
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,984
Look at this fucking neighborhood.

759
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,487
This guy's doing more than filing W-9s.

760
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,697
<i>Es el cabrón.</i>

761
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,950
The fucking man.

762
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,297
I haven't been able
to reach an agreement.

763
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,347
He's very stubborn.

764
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,143
<i>Listen to me, Pacho.
We have to seal the deal.</i>

765
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,061
<i>It's very important.</i>

766
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,399
Amado has to go to Juárez tomorrow.
I'll go with him and close the deal.

767
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,068
<i>All right. Keep me informed.</i>

768
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,862
<i>Good night.</i>

769
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,280
Good night, Gilberto.

770
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,172

It's been a long time
since anyone asked me on a date.

785
00:54:58,712 --> 00:54:59,922
Come in, please.

786
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,512
Take a seat.

787
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:11,642
Sir... your offer of this apartment
is very generous.

788
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,686
But?

789
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,191
But... I would like to know the terms.

790
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,403
The terms?

791
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,822
How often will you come here to visit me?

792
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,536
As often as you like.

793
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,579
Or never.

794
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,957
This is your home.

795
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,084
Is there a monthly stipend?

796
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,878
A stipend?

797
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:45,092
Mr. Rodríguez, I married Claudio Salazar
when I was 18 years old.

798
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,843
I knew nothing.

799
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,682
Now I need to get away from his family,
and I need my son back.

800
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,810
If you could help me with that...

801
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,313
I can.

802
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,359
Then I accept.

803
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,616
It's great to hear that.

804
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,506
Why don't you get some rest?

805
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,092
Eat something.

806
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,137
Tomorrow morning, I'll send for your son.

807
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,390
How does that sound?

808
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,268
Good.

809
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,644
Take a seat.

810
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,401
Fifty miles an hour,
you could jump into water and survive.

811
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,614
- You can't leave her on the bus.
- I guess you do. You leave her on the bus.

812
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,282
No.

813
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,119
- I would leave her.
- You would leave her?

814
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,413
Shh...

815
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,539
All right. Here we go.

816
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,509
Dan.

817
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,888
Is that who I think it is?

818
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,475
Gilberto fucking Rodríguez.

819
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,852
Fuck.

820
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,564
Oh, my fucking God. Okay.

821
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,027
- Peña.
<i>- Boss, it's Feistl.</i>

822
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,031
- Where the fuck have you been?
<i>- Sir, I got eyes on Gilberto Rodríguez.</i>

823
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,534
- You're looking at him right now?
<i>- Yes.</i>

824
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,870
<i>Just say the word
and we can take him down.</i>

825
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,372
<i>What's the move, boss?</i>

826
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,674
Sorry to interrupt.

827
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,131
You want to go after Gilberto Rodríguez?
