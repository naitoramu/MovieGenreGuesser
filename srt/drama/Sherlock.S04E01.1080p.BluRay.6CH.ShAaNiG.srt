1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,964
My brother is a murderer.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,249
No chance for you to be a hero
this time, Mr. Holmes.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,441
Oh, do your research.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,601
I'm not a hero.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,921
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,002
Merry Christmas!

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,804
<i>I am not given
to outbursts of brotherly compassion.</i>

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,008
You know what happened to the other one.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,084
- Miss me?
<i>- Did you miss me?</i>

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,889
<i>Did you miss me? Did you miss me?</i>

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,724
I've only been gone four minutes.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,962
Well, I certainly hope
you've learnt your lesson.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,003
What you're about to see is
classified beyond top secret.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,491
Is that quite clear?

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,005
Don't minute any of this.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,810
Once beyond these walls,
you must never speak of it.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,850
A D-notice has been slapped
on the entire incident.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,850
Only those within this room, codenames
Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love,

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,649
will ever know the whole truth.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,163
As far as everyone else is concerned,

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,240
going to the Prime Minister and way beyond,

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,929
Charles Augustus... Are you tweeting?

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,049
- No.
- Well, that's what it looks like.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,610
Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting?

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,330
- Give me that.
- What? No.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,767
- What are you doing? Get off. What?
- Give it here.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,729
"Back on terra firma..."
- No, don't read them out.

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,962
- "Free as a bird."
- God, you're such a spoilsport.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,405
Will you take this matter seriously,
Sherlock?

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,444
I am taking it seriously. What makes you
think I'm not taking it seriously?

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,928
"Hashtag, oh what a beautiful morning."

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,446
Look, not so long ago I was on
a mission that meant certain death,

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,410
my death, and now I'm back
in a nice, warm office,

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,687
with my big brother and...
Are those ginger nuts?

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,808
- Oh God.
- Love ginger nuts.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,850
Our doctor said you were clean.

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,924
I am, utterly.

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,690
No need for stimulants now, remember?

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,086
I have work to do.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,400
You're high as a kite.

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,811
Natural high. I assure you.

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,127
Totally natural. I'm just...

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,168
<i>♪ Glad to be alive! ♪</i>

44
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,004
What shall we do next? What's your name?

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,845
- Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian?

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,730
- Pardon?
- It's a lovely day.

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,881
Go for a stroll, make a paper airplane,
have an ice lolly?

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,040
- Ice lolly, I suppose.
- Ice lolly it is.

49
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,001
What's your favorite?

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,206
Oh, really, I shouldn't...

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,485
- Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies?

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,088
- Mr. Holmes.
- Yes?

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,880
We do need to get on.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,126
Yes, of course.

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,885
<i>Do your research.</i>

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,367
<i>I'm not a hero,</i>

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,488
<i>I'm a high-functioning sociopath.</i>

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,206
<i>- Sociopath.</i>

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,247
I see.
<i>- Sociopath.</i>

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,651
Who is supposed to have shot him then?

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,769
Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy
trigger finger, that's who.

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,164
That's not what happened at all.

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,646
It is now.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,168
Remarkable. How did you do it?

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,841
We have some very talented people
working here.

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,451
If James Moriarty can hack
every TV screen in the land,

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,809
rest assured, we have the tech to doctor
a bit of security footage.

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,327
That is now the official version,

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,767
the version anyone we want to will see.

70
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,850
No need to go to the trouble

71
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,644
of getting some sort of official pardon.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,927
You're off the hook, Mr. Holmes.

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,930
You're home and dry.

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,207
Okay, cheers.

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,971
Obviously, there's unfinished business.

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,167
Moriarty.

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,130
I told you, Moriarty's dead.

78
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,044
You say he filmed
that video message before he died?

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,930
- Yes.
- You also say

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,727
you know what he's going to do next.

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,927
What does that mean?

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,889
Perhaps that's all there is to it.

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,689
Perhaps he was
just trying to frighten you.

84
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,691
No, no, he would never be
that disappointing.

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,649
He's planned something,
something long term.

86
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,450
Something that would take effect

87
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,205
if he never
made it off that rooftop alive.

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,408
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that.

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,451
Posthumous game.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,890
We brought you back to deal with this.

91
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,689
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,407
Wait?

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,646
Of course, wait.
I'm the target. Targets wait.

94
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,487
Look...

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,568
Whatever's coming,
whatever he's lined up,

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,091
I'll know when it begins.

97
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,605
I always know when the game is on.

98
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,609
- You know why?
- Why?

99
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,531
Because I love it.

100
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,123
<i>"There was once a merchant</i>

101
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,885
<i>"in the famous market at Baghdad.</i>

102
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,521
<i>"One day he saw a stranger
looking at him in surprise.</i>

that the stranger was Death.</i>

<i>"Pale and trembling,
the merchant fled the marketplace</i>

105
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,045
<i>"and made his way many, many miles</i>

106

<i>"to the city of Samarra.</i>

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,402
<i>"For there he was sure Death

<i>"the grim figure of Death.</i>

111

<i>"'when you saw me this morning
in Baghdad?'</i>

115

<i>"'in Samarra."</i>

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,248
If this gets any better,
I'm gonna get two knives.

119
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,481
It pays to advertise.

120
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,641
So, what about Moriarty then?

121
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,846
Oh, I have a plan.

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,609
I'm going to monitor the underworld,
every quiver of the web

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,882
will tell me when the spider
makes his move.

124
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,363
So basically, your plan is just to sit
there solving crimes like you always do.

125
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,771
Awesome, isn't it?

126
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,569
He drowned, Mr. Holmes.
That's what we thought.

127
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,688
- But when they opened up his lungs...
- Yes?

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,803
- Sand.
- Superficial.

129
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,088
Come back, it's the wrong thumb.

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,088
- Sherlock.
- It's never twins.

131
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,087
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.

132
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,207
<i>Wilson?
Lymph nodes?</i>

133
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,327
Sherlock...

134
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,731
Yes, you may have nothing
but a limbless torso,

135
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,046
but there'll still be traces of ink left

136
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,485
in the lymph nodes under the armpits.

137
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,483
If your mystery corpse had tattoos,
the signs will be there.

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,130
<i>Bloody hell. Is that a guess?</i>

139
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,406
I never guess.

140
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,642
- Sherlock...
<i>- So, he's the killer.</i>

141
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,927
<i>The canary trainer?</i>

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,809
- Of course he's the killer.
<i>- Didn't see that coming.</i>

143
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,927
Naturally.

144
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,608
Sherlock, you can't go on
spinning plates like this.

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,489
That's it, the place was spinning.

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,367
The heart medication you are taking
is known to cause bouts of amnesia.

147
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,408
Yes, I think so.

148
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,889
- Why?
- Because the fingerprints

149
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,564
on your brother's neck were your own.

150
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,847
A jellyfish.
I know.

151
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,251
You can't arrest a jellyfish.

152
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,209
- You could try.
- We did try.

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,120
- Oh, God.
- Mary?

154
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,407
Fifty-nine missed calls.

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,561
We're in a lot of trouble.

156
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,962
Ow! Oh, my God!

157
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,166
Oh, my God!

158
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,726
Relax. It's got two syllables...

159
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,768
I'm a nurse, darling.
I think I know what to do.

160
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,887
All right, then. Come on.

161
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,166
- Re...
- Lax.

162
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,926
Oh, just drive. Please go.
Just drive. God, drive.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,321
- Sherlock? Mary.

164
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,323
That's it, Mary. Re...

165
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,289
Don't you start.

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
- Lax.

167
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,808
John? John?

168
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,804
I think you have to pull over.

169
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,770
- Mary, Mary.
- Pull over!

170
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,081
- Oh, my God.

171
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
Has that come out?

172
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
- They never come out when I take them.
- Let's have a look.

173
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,250
Oh, she's so beautiful.

174
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,489
- Have another go.

175
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,443
- What about a name?
- Catherine.

176
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,005
- Oh, yeah, we've gone off that.
- Have we?

177
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,161
- Yeah.
- Oh.

178
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,607
- Well, you know what I think.
- It's not a girl's name.

179
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,242
Molly, Mrs. H.
We would love you to be godparents.

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,005
- Oh!
- If you...

181
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,287
- Really?
- That's so lovely.

182
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,767
And, uh...

183
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,808
- You too, Sherlock.
- You too, what?

184
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,689
Godfather.
We'd like you to be godfather.

185
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,047
God is a ludicrous fiction
dreamt up by inadequates

186
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,169
who abnegate all responsibility
to an invisible magic friend.

187
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,969
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it?

188
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,246
- I'll get back to you.
- All right.

189
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,608
Father, we ask you to send
your blessings on this water,

190
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,969
and sanctify it for our use this day,

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,371
in Christ's name.

192
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,047
Now, what name have you
given your daughter?

193
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,242
- Rosamund Mary.
- Rosamund?

194
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,370
Means "rose of the world."

195
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,561
Rosie, for short.

196
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,450
Didn't you get John's text?

197
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,564
No, I delete his texts.

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,688
- I delete any text that begins, "Hi."

199
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,331
No idea why people think
you're incapable of human emotion.

200
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,209
- Sorry.

201
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,327
Phone.

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,882
- And now, godparents.

203
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,804
Are you ready to help
the parents of this child

204
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,288
in their duties as Christian parents?

205
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,526
We are.

206
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,243
<i>Sorry, I didn't catch that.</i>

207
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,804
<i>Please repeat the question.</i>

208
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,923
As ever, Watson,
you see but do not observe.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,321
To you, the world remains
an impenetrable mystery,

210
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,643
whereas to me it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy.

211
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,085
That is your choice.

212
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,970
You fail to connect actions
to their consequences.

213
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,804
Now, for the last time.

214
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,211
If you want to keep the rattle,

215
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,603
do not throw the rattle.

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,091
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,205
- I'd better finish this, hadn't I?

218
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,801
- Hi.
- Afternoon.

219
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,962
He says you've got a good one, Greg.

220
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,087
Oh, yeah.

221
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,441
<i>It was David Welsborough's
50th birthday.</i>

222
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,571
I'm 50?

223
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,370
Where does it go? I know for a fact
I was only 21 this time last week.

224
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,807
Yeah, well, that's impossible,
that's before you...

225
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,484
- Met me.
- Oh, no, no.

226
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,927
There never was such a time.

227
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,887
She's looking at me
disapprovingly again.

228
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,321
No.

229
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,688
- She's just jealous.
- No. Well.

230
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,841
I think we both are.

231
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,967
- Oh.

232
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,530
No, no, don't. Come on, you promised.

233
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,409
- No.

234
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,411
Oh no, it's a Skype call.

235
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,643
Oh, then it must be Charlie.

236
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,088
At least he's phoning, I suppose.

237
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,167
- Oh, look, hello!
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

238
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,966
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

239
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,001
<i>Sorry to miss the party,
but travel broadens the mind, right?</i>

240
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,169
No. Picture's frozen.

241
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,847
<i>Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.</i>

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,649
Why is it rubbish, where are you?

243
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,688
How is he? Is he eating?
Ask him if he's eating.

244
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,131
David. Emma.

245
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,807
No, no, hang on a sec.
I'll find somewhere quieter.

246
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,370
So, Charlie, where are you?

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,804
Are you there?

248
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,370
<i>Sorry, I'm here.</i>

249
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,528
<i>- I'm just a bit...</i>
- You all right?

250
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,761
<i>It's nothing.</i>

251
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,001
<i>Probably just the altitude.</i>

252
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,241
Altitude?

253
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,930
<i>I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?</i>

254
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,047
Oh, never mind mountains.

255
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,929
Your mother wants to know
if you're eating properly.

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,321
<i>- Look, Dad, could you do me a favor?</i>
- What?

257
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,890
<i>Could you just check something
on my car?</i>

258
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,008
Your car?
<i>- To settle a bet.</i>

259
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,771
<i>The guys here don't believe I've got
a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.</i>

260
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,080
<i>Could you take a photo and send it?</i>

261
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,844
- Ah, yes, I can do that.

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,240
All done. You got it?

263
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,087
Charlie...

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,731
A week later...

265
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,527
Yeah?

266
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,724
Something really weird happens.

267
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,845
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed.
The cops are chasing him.

268
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,208
And he turns into the drive of the
Welsborough house to try and get away.

269
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,282
- Unfortunately...

270
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,687
The drunk guy survived.
They managed to pull him out,

271
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,367
but when they put the fire out
and examined the parked car...

272
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,921
Whose body?

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,968
Charlie Welsborough, the son.

274
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,528
- What?
- The son who was in Tibet.

275
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,490
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party the car is empty.

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,846
Then a week later...

277
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,205
The dead boy is found at the wheel.

278
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,406
Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,726
You got a lab report?

280
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,846
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's
the son of a cabinet minister,

281
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,048
so I'm under a lot of pressure
to get results.

282
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,407
Who cares about that?
Tell me about the seats.

283
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,923
- The seats?
- Yes, the car seats.

284
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,880
Made of vinyl.

285
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,247
Two different types of vinyl present.

286
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,167
Was it his own car?

287
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,402
Yeah, not flash.
He was a student.

288
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,766
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why?

289
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,251
Vinyl's cheaper than leather.

290
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,727
Yeah, right.

291
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,285
- There's something else.
- Yes?

292
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,887
According to this, Charlie Welsborough
had already been dead for a week.

293
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,007
What?

294
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,282
The body in the car, dead for a week.

295
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,802
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday?

296
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,927
You want help?

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,240
- Yes please.
- One condition.

298
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,771
- Okay.
- Take all the credit.

299
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,284
It gets boring if I just solve them all.

300
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,482
Yeah, you say that,
and then John blogs about it,

301
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,971
and you get all the credit anyway.

302
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,486
- Yeah, he's got a point.
- Which makes me look like some kind of

303
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,643
prima donna who insists on getting
credit for something he didn't do.

304
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,370
Well, I think you've hit a sore spot,
Sherlock.

305
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,602
Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.

306
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,490
- Definitely a sore spot.
- So, you take all the glory, thank you.

307
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,684
- Okay.
- Thanks all the same.

308
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,686
Just solve the bloody thing will you.
It's driving me nuts.

309
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,410
Anything you say, Giles.

310
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,767
Just kidding.

311
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,524
It's obvious though,
isn't it, what happened?

312
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,090
John, you amaze me.
You know what happened?

313
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,447
Not a clue, it's just you normally
say that at this point.

314
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,687
Hmm-mmm.

315
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,926
Well, then, let's help you
solve your little problem, Greg.

316
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,409
- You hear that?
- I know.

317
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,406
So how's it going then, fatherhood?

318
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,721
Oh, good, great. Yeah, amazing.

319
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,530
- Getting any sleep?
- Christ, no.

320
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,251
You at the beck and call of
a screaming, demanding baby,

321
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,448
woken up all hours
to obey his every whim?

322
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,640
Must feel very different.

323
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,403
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yes, well, you know how it is.

324
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,084
All you do is clean up their mess.

325
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,162
- Pat them on the head...
- You two having a little joke?

326
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,924
Never a word of thanks.

327
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,490
- Can't even tell people's faces apart.
- This is a joke, isn't it?

328
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,131
Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't
you clever? You're so, so clever."

329
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,281
Is it about me?

330
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,407
I think he needs winding.

331
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,284
You know,
I think that really might be it.

332
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,441
No, don't get it.

333
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,169
Charlie's family are
pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect.

334
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,083
- So go easy on them, yeah?
- You know me.

335
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,491
<i>-  Hey, hello.</i>
- Yeah.

336
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,131
Got 'em, don't worry. Pampers,
the cream you can't get from Boots.

337
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,208
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now?

338
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,770
- At the dead boy's house?
- Yeah.

339
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,282
<i>What does he think, any theories?</i>

340
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,044
Uh, I texted you the details.

341
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,690
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.

342
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,561
How do you know about that?

343
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,605
<i>Oh, you'd be amazed
at what a receptionist picks up.</i>

344
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,450
They know everything.

345
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,486
<i>- Solved it, then?</i>
- I'm working on it.

346
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,722
<i>Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.</i>

347
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,290
- Pig.
- Keep trying.

348
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,086
<i>So, what about it then?</i>

349
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,845
<i>What, an empty car that suddenly
has a week-old corpse in it.</i>

350
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,606
<i>And what are you gonna call this one?</i>

351
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,365
- Oh, "The Ghost Driver."
- Don't give it a title.

352
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,244
- People like the titles.
- I hate the titles.

353
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,606
Give the people what they want.

354
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,170
No, never do that. People are stupid.

355
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,083
Uh, some people.

356
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,125
<i>All people are stupid.</i>

357
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,287
<i>Most people.</i>

358
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,805
Bizarre enough, though,
isn't it, to be him?

359
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,247
I mean it's right up your <i>strasse.</i>

360
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,204
Mr. and Mrs. Welsborough.

361
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,487
I really am most terribly sorry
to hear about your daughter.

362
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,607
- Son.
- Son.

363
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,047
Mr. and Mrs. Welsborough,
this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

364
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,407
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.

365
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,882
If anyone can throw any light into
this darkness, surely it will be you.

366
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,201
Well, I believe that I

367
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,530
can.

368
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,650
Well, Charlie was our whole world,
Mr. Holmes. I...

369
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,727
Sherlock?

370
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,763
- Mr. Holmes?
- Sorry, you were saying?

371
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,766
Well, Charlie was our whole world,
Mr. Holmes. I...

372
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,800
I don't think we'll get over this.

373
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,291
No. Shouldn't think so.

374
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,090
So, sorry,
will you excuse me a moment? I just...

375
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,240
I'll just, erm...

376
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,727
- Now, what's wrong?
- Not sure. I just...

377
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,482
"By the pricking of my thumbs."

378
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,971
- Seriously, you?
- Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.

379
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,442
They represent data processed too fast
for the conscious mind to comprehend.

380
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,760
What is this?

381
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,602
Uh, it's a sort of shrine,
I suppose, really.

382
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,411
Bit of a fan of Mrs. T, big hero of mine
when I was getting started.

383
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,720
Right. Yes.

384
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,049
- Who?
- What?

385
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,129
- Who, who is this?
- Are you serious?

386
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,326
Sherlock.

387
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,209
It's Margaret Thatcher.

388
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,931
The first female
Prime Minister of this country.

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,047
Right.

390
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,611
- Prime Minister?
- Hmm.

391
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,210
- Leader of the government.
- Right.

392
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,601
Female?

393
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,570
For God's sake,
you know perfectly well who she is.

394
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,130
Why are you playing for time?

395
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,168
It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.

396
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,724
Everything else is perfectly ordered.

397
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,127
Managed.

398
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,364
This whole thing's verging on OCD.

399
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,487
My respects.

400
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,291
This figurine is routinely
repositioned after the cleaner's been,

401
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,805
and this picture's
straightened every day.

402
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,405
Yet this ugly gap remains.

403
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,323
Something's missing from here,
but only recently.

404
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,084
- Yes, a plaster bust.
- Plaster bust.

405
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,208
Oh, for God's sake, it got broken.

406
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,964
What the hell has this
got to do with Charlie?

407
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,970
- Rug.
- What?

408
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,487
Well, how could it get broken?
The only place for it to fall is floor.

409
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,050
And there is a big, thick rug.

410
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,885
- Does it matter?
- Mrs. Welsborough, my apologies.

411
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,291
It is worth letting him do this.

412
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,566
Is your friend quite mad?

413
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,409
No, he's an arsehole,
but it's an easy mistake.

414
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,130
Look, no, we had a break-in.

415
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,929
Some little bastard smashed it to bits.

416
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,809
We found the remains
out there in the porch.

417
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,041
The porch where we came in?

418
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,201
How anybody could
hate her so much,

419
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,726
they'd go to the trouble
of smashing her likeness.

420
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,326
I'm no expert, but possibly her face.

421
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,127
Why didn't he smash all the others?

422
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,527
Perfect opportunity. And look at
that one, she's smiling in that one.

423
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,443
Oh, Inspector,
this is clearly a waste of time.

424
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,921
- If there's nothing...
- I know what happened to your son.

425
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,601
You do?

426
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,043
It's quite simple.
Superficial, to be blunt.

427
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,441
But first, tell me,
the night of the break-in.

428
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,682
- This room was in darkness?
- Well, yes.

429
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,444
And the porch where it
was smashed, I noticed

430
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,885
the motion sensor was damaged.

431
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,201
- So, I assume it's permanently lit?
- How did you notice that?

432
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,601
I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.

433
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,125
So, you're saying, he smashed it

434
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,366
- where he could see it.
- Exactly.

435
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,521
- Why?
- Don't know.

436
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,721
Wouldn't it be fun if I knew?

437
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,450
Mr. Holmes, please.

438
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,290
It was your 50th birthday,
Mr. Welsborough.

439
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,407
Of course you were disappointed

440
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,289
that your son hadn't made it back
from his gap year.

441
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,130
After all, he was in Tibet.

442
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,401
- Yes.
- No.

443
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,561
No?

444
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,331
<i>The first part
of your conversation was,</i>

445
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,562
<i>in fact, pre-recorded video.</i>

446
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,971
<i>Easily arranged.</i>

447
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,401
It's a Skype call.

448
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,448
The trick was meant to be a surprise.

449
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,846
- Trick?
- Obviously.

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,968
Could you take a photo and send it?

451
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,488
There were two types of vinyl
in the burnt out remains of the car.

452
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,604
One, the actual passenger seat,
the other, a good copy.

453
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,681
Well, good enough.

454
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,810
<i>Effectively a costume.</i>

455
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,244
You're joking.

456
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,967
I'm not.

457
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,683
All he wanted was for you
to get close enough to the car

458
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,370
so he could spring the surprise.

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,445
Oh, my God!

460
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,760
Surprise!

461
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,524
That's when it happened.

462
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,964
<i>I can't be certain, of course,
but I think Charlie</i>

463
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,042
<i>must have suffered
some sort of a seizure.</i>

464
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,886
<i>You said he'd felt unwell.</i>

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,604
- You all right?
<i>- It's nothing.</i>

466
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,211
<i>Probably just the altitude.</i>

467
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,883
<i>He died there and then.</i>

468
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,328
<i>No one had any cause to go near his car,</i>

469
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,364
<i>so there he remained
in the driver's seat, hidden until...</i>

470
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,322
<i>When the two cars
were examined,</i>

471
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,966
<i>the fake seat had
melted in the fire, revealing Charlie,</i>

472
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,567
<i>who'd been sitting there,
quite dead, for a week.</i>

473
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,881
Oh, God.

474
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,881
Poor kid.

475
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,081
Really, I'm so sorry.

476
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,811
Mr. Welsborough, Mrs. Welsborough.

477
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,931
This is where it was smashed.

478
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,490
- That was amazing.
- What?

479
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,846
The car, the kid.

480
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,843
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it?

481
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,002
What's so important about
a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher?

482
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,844
Can't stand it. Never can.

483
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,081
There's a loose thread in the world.

484
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,531
Doesn't mean you have to pull on it.

485
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,602
What kind of a life would that be?
Besides...

486
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,527
- I have the strangest feeling.
- Miss me?

487
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,288
That's mine. You two take a bus.

488
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,447
Why?

489
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,000
I need to concentrate
and I don't want to hit you.

490
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,003
- The Mall, please.

491
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,204
- I met her once.
- Thatcher?

492
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,770
Rather arrogant, I thought.

493
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,127
- You thought that?
- I know.

494
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,611
Why am I looking at this?

495
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,442
That's her, John and Mary's baby.

496
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,370
Oh, I see, yes.

497
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,127
Looks very...

498
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,245
Fully-functioning.

499
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,806
Is that really the best you can do?

500
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,127
Sorry, I've never been
very good with them.

501
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,247
Babies?

502
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,646
Humans.

503
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,926
Moriarty.

504
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,964
Did he have any connection
with Thatcher?

505
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,127
Any interest in her?

506
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,049
Why on earth would he?

507
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,963
I don't know, you tell me.

508
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,963
In the last year of his life,

509
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,165
James Moriarty was involved with
four political assassinations,

510
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,164
over 70 assorted robberies
and terrorist attacks,

511
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,329
including a chemical weapons factory
in North Korea,

512
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,169
and had latterly shown some interest in

513
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,720
tracking down
the Black Pearl of the Borgias.

514
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,848
Which is still missing, by the way,

515
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,321
in case you feel like applying yourself
to something practical.

516
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,488
It's a pearl, get another one.

517
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,291
Something important about this.

518
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,164
I'm sure, maybe it's Moriarty.

519
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,690
Maybe it's not.

520
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,090
But something's coming.

521
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,371
Are you having a premonition,
brother mine?

522
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,688
The world is woven
from billions of lives,

523
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,609
every strand crossing every other.

524
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,445
What we call premonition
is just movement of the web.

525
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,490
If you could attenuate
to every strand of quivering data,

526
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,202
the future would be entirely calculable.

527
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,163
As inevitable as mathematics.

528
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,124
<i>Appointment In Samarra.</i>

529
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,886
I'm sorry?

530
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,968
The merchant who can't outrun Death.

531
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,202
You always hated that story as a child.

532
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,562
Less keen on predestination back then.

533
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,166
I'm not sure I like it now.

534
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,561
You wrote your own version,
as I remember.

535
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,404
<i>Appointment In Sumatra.</i>

536
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,406
The merchant goes to a different city,
and is perfectly fine.

537
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,811
Good night, Mycroft.

538
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,803
Then he becomes a pirate,
for some reason.

539
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
Keep me informed.

540
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,481
- Of what?
- Absolutely no idea.

541
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,005
<i>Ammo!</i>

542
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,202
<i>- Ammo!</i>

543
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,206
Oh, hi, Stella.

544
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,248
- Greg.
- You, erm...?

545
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,363
Yeah, he's just got a client, so...

546
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,851
Right, right, right.

547
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,883
Er, so you see a lot of each other,
do you?

548
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,681
It's nothing.

549
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,086
I mean, it's nothing serious.

550
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,201
No, no.

551
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,442
I just pop around
every now and again for a chat.

552
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,641
Yeah, of course.

553
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,444
I mean, he loves a really tricky case.

554
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,125
Yeah, he does.

555
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,361
So, what are you here for?

556
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,124
Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl
trail leads back to London, so...

557
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,961
Borgia Pearl,
are they still after that, are they?

558
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,321
Yeah.

559
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,485
So, how did you two first meet?

560
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,963
Oh, it was a case about...

561
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,244
Ten years ago,
nobody could figure it out.

562
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,971
There was an old lady
found dead in a sauna.

563
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,167
Oh, yeah?

564
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,810
- How did she die?
- Hypothermia.

565
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,926
- What?
- I know.

566
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,002
But then I met Sherlock.
It was so simple the way...

567
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,003
Would you please keep it down?

568
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,926
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

569
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,082
Now, you haven't always been
in life insurance, have you?

570
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,571
You started out in manual labor.

571
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,080
Oh, don't bother being astonished.

572
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,242
Your right hand's almost
an entire size bigger than your left.

573
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,685
Hard manual work does that.

574
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
Oh, I was a carpenter, like my dad.

575
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,330
Are you trying to give up
smoking unsuccessfully?

576
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,323
And you once had a Japanese girlfriend
that meant a lot to you,

577
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,686
but now you feel indifferent about.

578
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,287
How the hell...

579
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,286
Yes.

580
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,081
E-cigarettes.

581
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,288
Not just that,
ten individual e-cigarettes.

582
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,522
If you just want to smoke indoors,
you would have invested

583
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,688
in one of those irritating
electronic pipe things.

584
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,529
But you're convinced you
can give up, so...

585
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,681
You don't want to buy a pipe,

586
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,444
because that means
you're not serious about quitting.

587
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,204
So instead,
you buy individual cigarettes,

588
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,045
always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John?

589
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,647
John.
- Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.

590
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,440
- What is that?
- That is me.

591
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,204
Well, it's a me substitute.

592
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,202
Don't be so hard on yourself, you know
I value your little contributions.

593
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,369
Yeah? It's been there
since 9:00 this morning.

594
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,646
Has it? Where were you?

595
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,484
Helping Mrs. H with her Sudoku.

596
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,721
- What about my girlfriend?
- What?

597
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,887
You said I had an ex.

598
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,567
You've got a Japanese tattoo in the
crook of your elbow in the name Akako.

599
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,165
It's obvious
you've tried to have it removed.

600
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,809
But surely that means
I want to forget her,

601
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,961
not that I'm indifferent.

602
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,166
If she'd really hurt your feelings,

603
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,480
you would have had the word obliterated.

604
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,801
But the first attempt wasn't successful
and you haven't tried again.

605
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,645
So it seems you can live with this
slightly blurred memory of Akako.

606
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,165
Hence, the indifference.

607
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,649
I thought you'd done something clever.

608
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,406
Oh, no. No, but now you've explained it.
It's dead simple, innit?

609
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
I've withheld this information
from you until now, Mr. Kingsley,

610
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,044
but I think it's time
you knew the truth.

611
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,524
What do you mean?

612
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,444
Have you ever wondered if your wife was
a little bit out of your league?

613
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,608
- Well...
- You thought she was having an affair.

614
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,682
I'm afraid it's far worse than that.
Your wife is a spy.

615
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,250
- What?
- That's right.

616
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,170
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.

617
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,931
Swedish by birth, and probably
the most dangerous spy in the world.

618
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,287
She's been operating deep under cover
for the past four years now

619
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,521
as your wife, for one reason only -

620
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,524
to get near the American Embassy,
which is across the road from your flat.

621
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,682
Tomorrow the US President
will be at the embassy

622
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,285
as part of an official state visit.

623
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,964
As the President greets
members of staff,

624
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,691
Greta Bengsdotter,
disguised as a 22-stone cleaner,

625
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,684
will inject the President in the back of
the neck with a dangerous new drug,

626
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,531
hidden inside a secret compartment
inside her padded armpit.

627
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,807
This drug will then render
the President entirely susceptible

628
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,967
to the will of that new master.

629
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,969
- None other than James Moriarty.
- What?

630
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,969
Moriarty will then use
the President as a pawn

631
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,281
to destabilize the
United Nations General Assembly,

632
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,721
which is due to vote
on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty,

633
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,565
tipping the balance in favor
of a first-strike policy against Russia.

634
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,483
This chain of events will then
prove unstoppable,

635
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,728
thus precipitating World War Three.

636
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,404
Are you serious?

637
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,801
No, of course not. His wife left him
because his breath stinks

638
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,041
and he likes to wear her lingerie.

639
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,241
I don't.

640
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,970
- Just the bras.
- Get out.

641
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,327
So.

642
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,481
What's this all about, then?

643
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,160
- Having fun.
- Fun?

644
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,321
- While I can.
- Mmm-hmm.

645
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,240
- Sherlock.
- Borgia Pearl. Boring. Go.

646
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,401
- But...
- Go.

647
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,161
Oh, this had better be good.

648
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,770
Oh, I think you'll like it.

649
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,606
That is the bust, isn't it,
the one that was broken?

650
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,648
No, it's another one. Different owner.

651
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,966
Different part of town.

652
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,011
You were right.
This is a thing. Something is going on.

653
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,525
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be pleased.

654
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,529
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.

655
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,162
This is my game face.

656
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,805
The game is on.

657
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,041
Another two have been smashed
since the Welsborough one.

658
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,969
One belonging to Mr. Mohandes Hassan...

659
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,121
Identical busts.

660
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,602
Yeah, and this one to a Dr. Barnicot
in Holborn. Three in total.

661
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,284
God knows who'd want to do
something like this.

662
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,203
Yeah, but some people have
that complex, don't they?

663
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,486
An idee fixe.

664
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,121
They obsess over
one thing and they can't let it go.

665
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,281
No, no, good.

666
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,964
There were other images of Margaret.

667
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,043
- Margaret?
- You know who she is.

668
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,282
Thatcher, present at the first break-in.

669
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,283
Why would a monomaniac
fixate on just one?

670
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,526
- Ooh.
- What?

671
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,047
Blood.

672
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,563
Quite a bit of it, too.

673
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,129
Was there any injury at the crime scene?

674
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,241
Nah.

675
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,410
Then our suspect must have cut
themselves breaking the bust.

676
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,885
- Come on.
- Holborn?

677
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,644
- Lambeth.
- Lambeth? Why?

678
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,643
- To see Toby.
- Ah, right.

679
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,245
- Who?
- You'll see.

680
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,731
- Right, you coming?
- No, he's got a lunch date

681
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,724
with a brunette forensic officer
that he doesn't want to be late for.

682
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,927
Who told you?

683
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,161
The right sleeve of your jacket

684
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,571
plus the formaldehyde mixed
with your cologne,

685
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,007
and your complete inability
to stop looking at your watch.

686
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,491
Have a good time.

687
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,846
I will.

688
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,684
Trust me, though,
she's not right for you.

689
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,569
- What?
- She's not the one.

690
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,447
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.

691
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,921
How do you work all that out?

692
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,088
She's got three children in Rio
that he doesn't know about.

693
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,929
- Are you just making this up?
- Possibly.

694
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,601
Who's Toby?

695
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,688
There's a kid I know,
hacker, brilliant hacker.

696
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,761
One of the world's best.

697
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,927
<i>Got himself into serious trouble</i>

698
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,684
<i>with the Americans
a couple of years ago.</i>

699
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,683
<i>He hacked into
the Pentagon security system</i>

700
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,888
<i>and I managed to get him off the charge.</i>

701
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,245
Therefore, he owes me a favor.

702
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,522
So, how does that help us?
What?

703
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,523
- Toby the hacker.
- Toby is not the hacker.

704
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,681
What?

705
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,442
- All right, Craig.
- All right, Sherlock.

706
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,285
Craig's got a dog.

707
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,806
So I see.
Good boy.

708
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,927
Hiya!

709
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,969
Mary? What are you...

710
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,566
We, we agreed. We would never bring
Rosie out on a case.

711
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,642
Exactly, so...

712
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,721
- Don't wait up.

713
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,881
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.

714
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,200
But Mary, what are you doing here?

715
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,725
- She's better at this than you.
- Better?

716
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,801
So I texted her.

717
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,570
Hang on. Mary's better than me?

718
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,246
Well, she is a retired super-agent
with a terrifying skill-set.

719
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,321
Of course she's better.

720
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,491
- Okay.
- Nothing personal.

721
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,642
Well, so I'm supposed
to just go home now, am I?

722
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,728
Oh, what do you think, Sherlock?
Shall we take him with us?

723
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,325
- John or the dog?
- Ha-ha, that's funny.

724
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,649
- John. He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.

725
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,649
- Hmm.
- Is it too early for a divorce?

726
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,250
- Aw!
- Barnicot's house, then.

727
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,845
Anyone up for a trudge?

728
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,803
- Keep up. He's fast.

729
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,490
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.

730
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,321
He's really not moving.

731
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,006
Slow but sure, John,
not dissimilar to yourself.

732
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,803
You just like this dog, don't you?

733
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,002
- Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.

734
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,205
- Fascinating.
- Oh!

735
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,645
Well, what do you make of it?

736
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,881
That we're looking for something.

737
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,880
Yes, but it wasn't a burglar.

738
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,571
They came specifically
for that Thatcher bust. Why?

739
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,401
Clever.

740
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,648
Well, if you were wounded
and you knew you were leaving a trail,

741
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,922
- where would you go?
- Like hiding a tree in a forest.

742
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,365
Or blood in a butcher's.

743
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,406
Never mind, Toby.
Better luck next time, hmm?

744
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,521
This is it, though.
This is the one. I can feel it.

745
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,090
Not Moriarty?

746
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,448
Has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.

747
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,205
It's designed to beguile me,
tease me and lure me in.

748
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,165
Blast.

749
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,282
A noose for me to put my neck into.

750
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,568
You should have seen
the state of the front lawn.

751
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,526
It was like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

752
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,041
Was Rosie's head spinning round?

753
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,124
Mmm, no. Just the projectile vomiting.

754
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,571
- Nice.
- Mmm.

755
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,124
Now, you think we'd have
noticed when she was born.

756
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,486
Noticed what?

757
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,888
The little 666 on her forehead.

758
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,167
Mmm. That's <i>The Omen.</i>

759
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,641
- So?
- You said it was like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

760
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,801
They're two different things.

761
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,087
She can't be the Devil
and the Antichrist.

762
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,923
- Yeah, can't she?

763
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,646
Oh, coming, darling.

764
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,324
- Mummy's coming.

765
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,281
Oh, what are you doing?

766
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,851
What are you doing?

767
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,605
You heard of that thing in Germany?

768
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,603
You're going to have
to be more specific, Craig.

769
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,523
Uh, Ostalgie.

770
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,007
People who miss the old days
under the Communists.

771
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,682
- People are weird, aren't they?
- Mmm.

772
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,849
According to this, there's quite
a market for Cold War memorabilia.

773
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,687
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.

774
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,370
Time's a great leveller, innit?

775
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,211
Thatcher's like, I don't know,
Napoleon now.

776
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,766
Yes, fascinating and relevant.
Where exactly did they come from?

777
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,441
Well, I've got into records
of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.

778
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,126
- Seems they're from Georgia.
- Where exactly?

779
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,281
Tbilisi.

780
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,805
Batch of six.

781
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,882
One to Welsborough, one to Hassan,

782
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,129
one to Dr. Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker,

783
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,568
one to a Mr. Jack Sandeford of Reading.

784
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,971
- Lestrade, another one?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

785
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,041
Harker or Sandeford?

786
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,805
Harker. And it's murder this time.

787
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,530
Mmm. That perks things up a bit.

788
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,804
Defensive wounds on her face
and hands, throat cut, sharp blade.

789
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,729
The same thing
inside the house, the bust.

790
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,006
Two of them this time.

791
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,482
Interesting. That batch of statues
was made in Tbilisi several years ago.

792
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,925
Limited edition of six.

793
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,008
And now someone's wandering
about destroying them all.

794
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,241
Makes no sense. What's the point?

795
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,687
Well, they're not destroying them.
That's not what's happening.

796
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,000
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is what's happening,

797
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,081
but it's not the point.

798
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,850
I've been slow. Far too slow.

799
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,002
Well, I'm still being slow over here,
so if you wouldn't mind.

800
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,684
Slow but lucky, very lucky.

801
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,369
Since they smashed both busts,
our luck might just hold.

802
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,727
Jack Sandeford of Reading
is where I'm going next.

803
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,570
Congratulations, by the way.

804
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,929
- Sorry?
- Well, you're about to solve a big one.

805
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,841
Yeah, until John publishes his blog.

806
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,048
Yeah. Till then, basically.

807
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,401
That's enough now, love.

808
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,884
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.

809
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,445
And you need to get to bed.

810
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,721
Come on.

811
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,002
It would be much simpler to take out
your grievances at the polling station.

812
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,166
You were on the run.

813
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,523
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.

814
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,885
You find yourself in a workshop,

815
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,526
plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying.
It's clever.

816
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,047
Very clever. But now you've met me.

817
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,010
And you're not so clever, are you?

818
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,445
Who are you?

819
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,925
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

820
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,089
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.

821
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,321
You're out of time.

822
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,488
Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.

823
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,601
Who?

824
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,808
I know it's him. It must be him.

825
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,325
You think you understand?

826
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,125
You understand nothing.

827
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,487
Well, before the police
come in and spoil things,

828
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,204
why don't we just enjoy the moment?

829
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,891
Let me present Interpol's
number one case.

830
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,522
Too tough for them, too boring for me.

831
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,682
The Black Pearl of the Borgias.

832
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,681
It's not possible.

833
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,001
How could she...

834
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,810
Everything about
who I was is on there.

835
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,331
The problems of your past

836
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,481
are your business.

837
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,249
The problems of your future

838
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,080
are my privilege.

839
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,561
I don't understand.

840
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,529
- She, she destroyed it.
- She?

841
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,047
You know her.

842
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,526
You do, don't you?

843
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,201
You know the bitch.

844
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,247
She betrayed me.

845
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,045
- Betrayed us all.
- Mary.

846
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,050
This is about Mary.

847
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,368
Is that what she's calling herself now?

848
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,488
<i>Armed police. You're surrounded.</i>

849
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,721
Give it to me.

850
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,565
Give it to me!

851
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,251
<i>I'm going in. I want to see
your hands above your head.</i>

852
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,091
Nobody shoots at me.
If anyone shoots, I kill this man.

853
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,690
<i>Lay down your weapons.</i>

854
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,401
<i>Do it now!</i>

855
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,045
I'm leaving this place.

856
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,724
If no one follows me, no one dies.

857
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,926
<i>Lay down your weapons.</i>

858
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,401
You're a policemen.

859
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,965
I'm a professional.

860
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,724
Tell her she's a dead woman.

861
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,764
She's a dead woman walking.

862
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,605
She's my friend,

863
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,244
and she's under my protection.

864
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,767
Who are you?

865
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,090
I'm the man

866
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,651
who's going to kill your friend.

867
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,965
Who's Sherlock Holmes?

868
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,764
Not a policeman.

869
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,002
What do you think?
Mate in two?

870
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,849
Don't antagonize them, darling.

871
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,362
Well, what else is there to do?
Chess palls after three months.

872
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,130
Everything palls.

873
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,369
They'll send someone soon.

874
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,008
"They"? Who are "they"?

875
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,771
Seems to me we put an
awful lot of faith in "they."

876
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,169
Well, I've got something
"they" would dearly love

877
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,169
if only we could get out of here.

878
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,847
- I've got Ammo.
- Ammo?

879
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,527
Madam Ambassador.

880
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,766
What took you so long?

881
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,047
- Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now!

882
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,321
To your left.

883
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,047
What now. What do we do?

884
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,247
We die.

885
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,285
Well?

886
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,448
He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.

887
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,403
- I very much doubt it.
- Why?

888
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,761
Because I think he used
to work with Mary.

889
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,804
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

890
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,043
Ammo. Ammo. Ammo.

891
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,046
Passed out again.

892
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,288
It's no fun when they pass out.

893
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,771
We'll come back later.

894
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,524
What would he do if he knew, huh?

895
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,365
About the English woman.

896
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,883
What would you do to a traitor?

897
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,729
Maybe we'll tell him one day.

898
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,007
If he lives that long.

899
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,931
I am an idiot.

900
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,048
I know nothing.

901
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,043
Well, I've been
telling you that for ages.

902
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,282
That was quite a text you sent me.

903
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,366
What's going on, Sherlock?

904
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,885
I was so convinced it was Moriarty,

905
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,406
I couldn't see what was right
under my nose.

906
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,604
Expected a pearl.

907
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,167
- Oh, my God. That's a...
- Yes, it's an AGRA memory stick.

908
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,090
Like you gave John,
except this one belongs to someone else.

909
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,970
- Who?
- I don't know.

910
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,322
We, we all had one,
but the others were...

911
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,169
Well, haven't you even looked at it yet?

912
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,282
I glanced at it,
but I prefer to hear it from you.

913
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,447
Why?

914
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,682
Because I'll know the truth
when I hear it.

915
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,965
There were four of us.

916
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,971
- Agents.
- Not just agents.

917
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,645
Polite term.

918
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,642
Alex, Gabriel, me and Ajay.

919
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,242
There was absolute trust between us.

920
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,402
The memory sticks guaranteed it.

921
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,641
We all had one.

922
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,883
Each containing aliases,
our background, everything.

923
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,810
We could never be betrayed
because we had everything we needed

924
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,166
to destroy the other.

925
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,001
- Who employed you?
- Anyone who paid well.

926
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,961
Oh, we were at the top
of our game for years,

927
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,121
and then it all ended.

928
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,401
There was a coup in Georgia.

929
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,488
The British Embassy in Tbilisi
was taken over,

930
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,722
lots of hostages,
we got the call to go in,

931
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,322
get them out, there was a change of plan,
a last-minute adjustment.

932
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,606
- Who from?
- I don't know.

933
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,728
Just another voice on the phone.

934
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,685
And a codeword.

935
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,205
- Ammo.
- Ammo?

936
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,046
Like ammunition.

937
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,921
We went in,
but then something went wrong.

938
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,890
Something went really wrong.

939
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,046
That was six years ago.

940
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,886
Feels like forever.

941
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,284
I was the only one that made it out.

942
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,767
No.

943
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,723
- What?
- I met someone tonight.

944
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,524
The same someone who's looking
for the sixth Thatcher.

945
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,730
Oh, my God. That's Ajay. That's him.

946
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,531
- What, he's alive?
- Yeah, very much so.

947
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,722
I don't believe it. This is amazing.

948
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,847
I thought I was the only one,

949
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,046
I thought I was the only one
who got out.

950
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,610
Where is he? I need to see him now!

951
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,361
Before you gave it to John,
did you keep your memory stick safe?

952
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,562
Yeah, of course. It was our insurance.

953
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,521
Above all, they mustn't fall
into enemy hands.

954
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,841
So Ajay survived as well,

955
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,924
and now he's looking
for the memory stick he managed to hide,

956
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,771
with all of AGRA's
old aliases on it, but why?

957
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,565
I don't know.

958
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,961
Tbilisi was six years ago,
where's he been?

959
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,646
Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this,
but he wants you dead.

960
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,810
Sorry, no, no,
'cause we, we were family.

961
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,006
Families fall out.

962
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,449
The memory stick
is the easiest way to track you down.

963
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,001
You're the only other survivor,
it must be you that he wants,

964
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,646
and he's already killed
looking for the Thatcher bust.

965
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,762
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived.

966
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,251
That's all that matters.

967
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,771
I heard it from his own mouth.

968
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,088
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking."

969
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,971
Why would he want to kill me?

970
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,610
- He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no. No, that's insane.

971
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,284
Well, it's what he believes.

972
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,480
I suppose I was always afraid
this might happen.

973
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,530
That something in my past
would come back to haunt me one day.

974
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,041
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.

975
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,209
God, I just wanted a bit of peace,
and I really thought I had it.

976
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,321
No, Mary.

977
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,321
You do.

978
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,889
I made a vow, remember?

979
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,850
To look after the three of you.

980
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,168
Sherlock, the dragon slayer.

981
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,842
Stay close to me and I will
keep you safe from him, I promise you.

982
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,921
There's something
I think you should read.

983
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,041
What is it?

984
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,565
I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.

985
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,927
What are you...

986
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,730
- Mary... Oh, no.
- There you go.

987
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,205
It's all right.

988
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,209
It's for the best, believe me.

989
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,406
You just look after him
till I get back. I'm sorry.

990
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,241
I'm so sorry.

991
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,726
Agra?

992
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,564
A city on the banks of the river Yamuna,

993
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,166
in the northern state
of Uttar Pradesh, India.

994
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,170
It is 378 kilometers
west of the state capital, Lucknow...

995
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,611
What are you, Wikipedia?

996
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,009
- Yes.
- AGRA's an acronym.

997
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,724
Oh, good. I love an acronym.

998
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,442
All the best secret societies have them.

999
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,210
Team of agents, the best.

1000
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,726
- But you know all of that.
- Of course, I do. Go on.

1001
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,243
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary,
also one of the team.

1002
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,689
Indeed. Well, that's news to me.

1003
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,881
Is it?

1004
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,524
He's already killed looking
for that memory stick,

1005
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,045
AGRA always worked
for the highest bidder,

1006
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,645
I thought that might include you.

1007
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,643
- Me?
- Oh, I mean the British Government

1008
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,967
or whatever government
you're currently propping up.

1009
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,730
AGRA were very reliable.

1010
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,406
Then came the Tbilisi incident.

1011
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,643
They were sent in to free the hostages,

1012
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,449
but it all went horribly wrong.

1013
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,406
And that was that.
We stopped using freelancers.

1014
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,721
- Your initiative?
- My initiative.

1015
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,883
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.

1016
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,722
I don't like loose ends.

1017
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,006
Not on my watch.

1018
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,246
There was something else.

1019
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,327
A detail.

1020
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,325
A codeword.

1021
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,082
- Ammo?
- It's all I've got.

1022
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,566
Little enough.

1023
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,489
Could you do
some digging as a favor?

1024
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,810
You don't have many favors left.

1025
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,805
Then I'm calling them all in.

1026
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,683
And if you can find who's after her
and neutralize them, what then?

1027
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,928
You think you can go on
saving her forever?

1028
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,525
Of course.

1029
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,170
Is that sentiment talking?

1030
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,691
No. It's me.

1031
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,763
Difficult to tell
the difference these days.

1032
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,969
Told you, I made a promise. A vow.

1033
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,202
All right, I'll see what I can do.

1034
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,442
But remember this, brother mine.

1035
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,363
Agents like Mary
tend not to reach retirement age.

1036
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,290
They get retired

1037
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,283
in a pretty permanent sort of way.

1038
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,525
Not on my watch.

1039
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,327
<i>My darling,</i>

1040
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,886
<i>I need to tell you this because
you mustn't hate me for going away.</i>

1041
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,566
 Pardon me.
I can hear a squeaking.

1042
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,210
Can you hear a squeaking?

1043
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,805
No.

1044
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,327
Only I watched a documentary
on the Discovery Channel,

1045
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,323
<i>Why Planes Fail,</i> did you see it?

1046
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,640
- Can't say I did.
- Oh, truly terrifying.

1047
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,562
Swore I would never fly again,
yet here I am.

1048
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,809
- Everything okay, madam?
- No.

1049
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,406
No, it's not.
But then what's the use in complaining?

1050
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,925
I hear a squeaking.

1051
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,651
Probably the wing will come off, is all.

1052
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,405
Everything's fine,
I promise you. Just relax.

1053
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,847
Oh, okay, relax.

1054
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,763
She said relax.

1055
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,490
Did you have a nice time in London?

1056
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,250
It was okay, I guess.

1057
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,084
But did somebody hide the sun?

1058
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,851
Did you lose it in the war?

1059
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,607
<i>I gave myself permission
to have an ordinary life.</i>

1060
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,010
<i>I'm not running, I promise you that.</i>

1061
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,367
<i>I just need to do this in my own way.</i>

1062
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,045
Oh, God.

1063
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,283
I, I don't feel so good. Oh, my God.

1064
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,882
- Everything okay, madam?
- I think I'm dying.

1065
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,121
I don't feel so good.

1066
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,810
- You're all right.

1067
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,042
Oh, you're sweet.

1068
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,442
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.

1069
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,204
<i>But don't want you
and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm.</i>

1070
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,725
<i>I'm sorry, my love.</i>

1071
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,450
<i>I know you'll try to find me,
but there is no point.</i>

1072
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,731
<i>Every move is random
and not even Sherlock Holmes</i>

1073
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,167
<i>can anticipate the roll of a dice.</i>

1074
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,849
<i>I need to move the target far, far away</i>

1075
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,527
<i>from you and Rosie,
and then I'll come back, my darling.</i>

1076
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,491
<i>I swear, I will.</i>

1077
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,524
You haven't got a chance.
Not a chance.

1078
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,762
I've got you where I want you.

1079
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,963
Give in, give in. I will destroy you.

1080
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,364
You're completely at my mercy.

1081
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,282
Mr. Baker.
Well, that completes the set.

1082
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,731
No, it is not.

1083
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,961
Well, who else am I missing?

1084
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,287
Master Bun. It's not a set without him.

1085
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,283
How many more times, Mr. Sherlock?

1086
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,727
Hmm. Maybe it's because
I'm not familiar with the concept.

1087
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,801
Oh, hi, Mary.

1088
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,566
What concept?

1089
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,244
Happy families. Nice trip?

1090
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,886
- How the f...
- Please, Mary, there is a child present.

1091
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,481
- How did you get in here?
- Karim let me in.

1092
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,767
Hello.

1093
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,801
Karim, would you be so kind
as to fetch us some tea?

1094
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,809
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1095
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,166
Nice to meet you, Mrs..

1096
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,005
No, I, I mean, how did you find me?

1097
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,001
- I'm Sherlock Holmes.
- Really though, how?

1098
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,407
Every movement I made
was entirely random.

1099
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,848
Every new personality,
just on the roll of a dice.

1100
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,002
Mary, no human action
is ever truly random.

1101
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,082
An advanced grasp
of the mathematics of probability

1102
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,686
mapped on to a thorough
apprehension of human psychology

1103
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,762
and the known dispositions
of any given individual

1104
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,524
can reduce the number
of variables considerably.

1105
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,523
I myself know of at least 58 techniques

1106
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,087
to refine the seemingly infinite array
of randomly generated possibilities

1107
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,441
down to the smallest number
of feasible variables.

1108
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,123
But they're really difficult,
so instead I just

1109
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,123
stuck a tracer on the inside
of the memory stick.

1110
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,691
Oh, you bastard.

1111
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,121
- You bastard.
- I know, but your face.

1112
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,202
"The mathematics of probability."

1113
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,327
You believed that.

1114
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,970
"Feasible variables."

1115
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,963
Yes, I started to run out about then.

1116
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,804
In the memory stick.

1117
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,370
Yeah, that was my idea.

1118
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,961
- AGRA.
- Yes.

1119
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,042
Mmm-hmm. You said it was your initials.

1120
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,083
- In a way, that was true.
- In a way?

1121
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,841
So many lies.

1122
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,001
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,406
- I don't just mean you.
- What?

1124
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,485
Alex, Gabriel, Ajay...

1125
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,085
You're R.

1126
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,601
Rosamund?

1127
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,241
Rosamund Mary.

1128
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,446
I always liked Mary.

1129
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,761
Yeah, me too.

1130
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,603
I used to.

1131
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,090
I didn't know what else to do.

1132
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,924
You could have stayed.
You could have talked to me.

1133
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,241
That's what couples are supposed to do.

1134
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,250
Work things through.

1135
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,441
Yes.

1136
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
Yes, of course.

1137
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,125
Mary, I may not be a very good man.

1138
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,804
But I think I'm a bit better
than you give me credit for.

1139
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,410
- Most of the time.
- All the time.

1140
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,440
You're always a good man, John.
I've never doubted that.

1141
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,369
You never judge. You never complain.

1142
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,885
I don't deserve you, I...

1143
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,488
All I ever wanted to do
was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.

1144
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,811
I will keep you safe.

1145
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,280
But it has to be in London.

1146
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,489
It's my city, I know the turf.

1147
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,085
Come home and everything
will be all right, I promise you.

1148
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,569
- Get down!

1149
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,604
- Hello again.
- Ajay.

1150
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,330
Oh, you remember me. I'm touched.

1151
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,323
Look, I thought you were dead.
Believe me, I did.

1152
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,084
I've been looking forward to this
for longer than you can imagine.

1153
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,007
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.

1154
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,764
I thought I was the only one
who got out.

1155
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,005
How did you find us?

1156
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,283
By following you, Sherlock Holmes.

1157
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,124
I mean, you're clever.

1158
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,521
You found her, but I found you, sir.

1159
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,364
Perhaps not so clever.

1160
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,847
And now here we are. At last.

1161
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,609
Touché.

1162
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,126
Listen, whatever you think you know,

1163
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,202
we can talk about this,
we can work it out.

1164
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,691
She thought I was dead.

1165
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,644
I might as well have been.

1166
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,890
It was always just the four of us.
Always, remember?

1167
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,481
- Oh, yeah.
- So why do you wanna kill me?

1168
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,369
Do you know how long
they kept me prisoner?

1169
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,720
What they did to me?

1170
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,724
- They tortured Alex to death.

1171
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,651
I can still hear the sound
of his back breaking.

1172
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,643
But you, you, where were you?

1173
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,802
That day, at the embassy, I escaped.

1174
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,881
Ha!

1175
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,163
But I lost sight of you, too,
so you explain, where were you?

1176
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,891
Oh, I got out. For a while.

1177
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,690
Long enough to hide my memory stick.

1178
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,845
I didn't want that
to fall into their hands.

1179
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,763
I was loyal, you see.

1180
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,725
Loyal to my friends.

1181
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,082
They took me, tortured me.

1182
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,611
Not for information.

1183
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,241
Not for anything except fun.

1184
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,684
They thought I'd give in. Die.

1185
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,524
But I didn't, I lived.

1186
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,765
And eventually, they forgot about me
rotting in a cell somewhere.

1187
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,283
Six years they kept me there.

1188
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,243
Till one day, I saw my chance.

1189
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,329
Oh, and I made them pay.

1190
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,767
You know, all the time I was there,

1191
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,251
I just kept picking up things.

1192
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,162
Little whispers, laughter, gossip.

1193
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,886
How the clever agents had been betrayed.

1194
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,484
Brought down by you!

1195
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,529
- Me?

1196
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,047
You know I'll kill you, too.
You know I will, Ajay.

1197
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,251
What, you think I care if I die?

1198
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,450
I've dreamed of killing you.

1199
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,963
Every night for six years.

1200
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,206
Squeezing the life

1201
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,167
out of your treacherous, lying throat.

1202
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,480
I swear to you, Ajay.

1203
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,848
What did you hear, Ajay?

1204
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,964
When you were a prisoner,
what exactly did you hear?

1205
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,487
What did I hear?

1206
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,287
Ammo.

1207
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,524
Every day, as they tore into me,

1208
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,242
Ammo. Ammo.

1209
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,406
Ammo. Ammo.

1210
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,524
We were betrayed!

1211
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,647
And they said it was her.

1212
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,888
- And you betrayed us.
- They said her name?

1213
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,610
Yeah, they said it was
the English woman.

1214
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,731
- No! No!

1215
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,243
<i>The English woman.
That's all he heard.</i>

1216
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,289
<i>Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.</i>

1217
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,124
Couldn't this wait until you're back?

1218
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,326
No, it's not over.

1219
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,765
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed.

1220
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,571
The hostage-takers knew
AGRA were coming.

1221
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,483
There was only a voice on the phone.

1222
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,364
<i>Remember, and a codeword.</i>

1223
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,010
Ammo, yes, you said.

1224
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,045
How's your Latin, brother dear?

1225
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,366
My Latin?

1226
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,847
Amo, amas, amat.

1227
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,725
I love, you love, he loves, what...

1228
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,566
Not Ammo as in ammunition,
but <i>Amo</i> meaning...

1229
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,004
You'd better be right, Sherlock.

1230
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,131
- Bloody thing.

1231
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,847
What's going on?

1232
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,804
I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood,

1233
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,441
your security protocols have
been temporarily rescinded.

1234
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,567
What?

1235
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,765
<i>So many lies.</i>

1236
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,446
<i>I don't just mean you.</i>

1237
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,448
- Hello.
- Ah, hello.

1238
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,488
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.

1239
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,891
It's not really me, though, I think.

1240
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,121
- No?
- No, no.

1241
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,480
It's too floral for me.

1242
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,245
I'm more of a knackered
with weary old eyes kind of a guy.

1243
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,481
Well, I think they're nice.

1244
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,960
- Nice eyes. What, what...
- Thank you.

1245
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,647
I don't normally do this, but, um...

1246
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,529
- But you're gonna.
- Yeah.

1247
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,250
- What's this?

1248
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,526
This is me.

1249
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,446
Uh, thank you.

1250
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,964
- Cheers.
- Yeah, right.

1251
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

1252
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,404
Now, you think we'd have
noticed when she was born.

1253
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,811
Noticed what?

1254
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,247
The little 666 on her forehead.

1255
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,922
Mmm. That's <i>The Omen.</i>

1256
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,647
- So?
- You said it was like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

1257
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,801
They're two different things.

1258
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,769
She can't be the Devil
and the Antichrist.

1259
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,883
- Yeah, can't she?

1260
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,440
Oh, coming, darling.

1261
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,204
- I'm coming.

1262
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,524
Why are you crying? Shh, shh.

1263
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,366
I know.

1264
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,363
Oh, you're not going to
stop crying, are you?

1265
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,641
I know, shall we go and see Daddy?

1266
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,449
Let's go see Daddy.

1267
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,642
Daddy's here. It's okay, Rosie's coming.

1268
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,370
- I'll take her.
- Yeah?

1269
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,010
Yeah, I might as well get up anyway.

1270
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,764
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.

1271
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,530
Daddy.

1272
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,011
- Come here, Rosie.
- Yeah.

1273
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,241
Come here, darling, it's all right.

1274
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:48,082
- Yeah, thank you.

1275
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,530
This is absolutely ridiculous,
and you know it.

1276
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,204
How many more times?

1277
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,247
Six years ago, you held the brief
for foreign operations. Codename, Love.

1278
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,687
And you're basing all this
on a codename?

1279
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,602
On a whispered voice on the telephone?

1280
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,641
Come on, Mycroft.

1281
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,324
You were the conduit for AGRA.

1282
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,810
Every assignment, every detail
they got from you.

1283
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,684
It was my job.

1284
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,330
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.

1285
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,731
- AGRA went in.
- Yes.

1286
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,968
- And they were betrayed.
- Not by me.

1287
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,162
Mycroft, we've known
each other a long time.

1288
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,041
I promise you,
I haven't the foggiest idea

1289
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,485
what all this is about.

1290
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,489
You wound up AGRA
and all the other freelancers.

1291
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,251
I haven't done any of the things

1292
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,210
you're accusing me of. Not one.

1293
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,127
Not one.

1294
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,364
Do you think
she'll like bedtime stories?

1295
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,647
- I'd like to do those.
- Yeah?

1296
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,564
Yeah, I just make a series of
gurgling noises at the moment.

1297
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,722
- Although she does seem to enjoy them.

1298
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,885
Well, I'll have to give that a go.

1299
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,806
Got a lot to catch up on.

1300
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,766
<i>You think you understand.</i>

1301
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,046
<i>You understand nothing.</i>

1302
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,329
<i>Codenames Antarctica,
Langdale, Porlock and Love.</i>

1303
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,721
<i>You'd be amazed
what a receptionist picks up.</i>

1304
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,245
<i>They know everything.</i>

1305
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,651
<i>They said it was
the English woman!</i>

1306
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,364
<i>Don't minute any of this.</i>

1307
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,804
<i>They know everything.</i>

1308
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,331
You don't make it easy, do you?

1309
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,447
What do you mean?

1310
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:06,083
I mean...
Being so perfect.

1311
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,167
Mary.

1312
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,250
I need to tell you...

1313
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,401
- Hang on.

1314
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,361
Can you tell me later?

1315
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,850
- Yeah, yeah.
- Great.

1316
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,685
Oh, no, we can't just go.

1317
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,842
- Rosie. Uh, you go.
- No!

1318
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,729
I'll come as soon as I've found someone.

1319
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,211
- Mrs. Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.

1320
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,441
- Molly.
- Uh, yeah, I'll try.

1321
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,010
Well we should both stay
and wait for her.

1322
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,206
No, you know that's not gonna happen.

1323
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,607
If there's more to this case,
you're the one who needs to see it.

1324
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,727
Yeah, okay, you win.

1325
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,205
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1326
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,726
<i>The aquarium will be closing
in five minutes.</i>

1327
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,328
<i>Please make your way to the exit.</i>

1328
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,447
<i>Thank you.</i>

1329
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,644
Your office said I'd find you here.

1330
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:18,048
This was always
my favorite spot for agents to meet.

1331
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,606
We're like them.

1332
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,769
Ghostly, living in the shadows.

1333
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,001
Predatory.

1334
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,244
Well, it depends which side you're on.

1335
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,647
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.

1336
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,690
Nice location for the final act.

1337
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,325
Couldn't have chosen it better myself.

1338
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,846
But then I never could resist
a touch of the dramatic.

1339
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,570
I just come here to look at the fish.

1340
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,449
I knew this would happen one day.

1341
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,046
It's like that old story.

1342
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,281
I really am a very busy man.

1343
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,646
Would you mind cutting to the chase?

1344
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,211
You're very sure of yourself,
aren't you?

1345
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,044
With good reason.

1346
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,043
There was once a merchant

1347
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,282
in a famous market in Baghdad.

1348
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:02,042
I really have never liked this story.

1349
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,925
I'm just like the merchant in the story.

1350
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,287
I thought I could outrun the inevitable.

1351
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,886
I've always been looking
over my shoulder.

1352
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,606
Always expecting to see
the grim figure of...

1353
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:13,920
- Death.
- Hello, Mary.

1354
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,570
John?
- Hey. On his way.

1355
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,205
Let me introduce Ammo.

1356
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,766
You were Ammo?

1357
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,008
You were the person
on the phone that time?

1358
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,560
Using AGRA as her private
assassination unit.

1359
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,410
Why did you betray us?

1360
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,046
- Why does anyone do anything?
- Let me guess.

1361
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,246
Selling secrets?

1362
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,766
Well, it would be churlish to refuse.

1363
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,330
<i>Worked very well for a few years.</i>

1364
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,562
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall
on the back of it.

1365
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,244
But...

1366
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,687
The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.

1367
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,285
I thought I'd had it.

1368
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,848
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.

1369
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,371
I couldn't believe my luck.

1370
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,161
That bought me a little time.

1371
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,447
But then you found out
your boss had sent AGRA in.

1372
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,681
Very handy.

1373
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,570
They were always such reliable killers.

1374
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,449
What you didn't know, Mary,
was that this one

1375
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,966
also tipped off the hostage-takers.

1376
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,208
Lady Smallwood gave the order,

1377
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,886
but I sent another one
to the terrorists.

1378
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,130
With a nice little clue
about her codename,

1379
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,202
should anyone have an inquiring mind.

1380
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,970
Seemed to do the trick.

1381
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,202
And you thought your troubles were over.

1382
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,680
I was tired.

1383
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,201
Tired of the mess of it all.

1384
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,529
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.

1385
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,091
The hostages were killed. AGRA too.

1386
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,726
Or so I thought.

1387
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,445
My secret was safe.

1388
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,764
But, apparently not.

1389
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,330
Just a little peace.

1390
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,490
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it?

1391
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,524
A family? Home?

1392
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,045
Really, I understand.

1393
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,930
So, just let me get out of here, right?

1394
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,371
Let me just walk away.

1395
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,363
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.

1396
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,686
- What do you say?
- After what you did?

1397
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:13,841
Mary, no!

1398
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,521
Okay.

1399
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,130
London Aquarium. Yes, now.

1400
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,964
<i>I was never a field agent.</i>

1401
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,250
I always thought I'd be rather good.

1402
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,321
Well, you handled
the operation in Tbilisi very well.

1403
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,241
- Thanks.
- For a secretary.

1404
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,841
What?

1405
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,729
Can't have been easy
all those years sitting in the back,

1406
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,768
keeping your mouth shut,
when you knew you were cleverer

1407
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,126
than most of the people in the room.

1408
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,407
I didn't do this out of jealousy.

1409
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,087
No?

1410
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,930
Same old drudge, day in, day out.

1411
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,203
Never getting out there,
where all the excitement was.

1412
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,204
Just back to your little flat
on Wigmore Street.

1413
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,722
- They've taken up the pavement

1414
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,006
outside the post office there.

1415
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,287
The local clay on your shoes
is very distinctive.

1416
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,761
- Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know?

1417
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,285
Well, on your salary,
it would have to be modest,

1418
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,328
and you spent all the money
on that cottage, didn't you?

1419
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,323
And what are you? Widowed or divorced?

1420
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,083
Wedding ring's at least 30 years old,

1421
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,446
and you've moved it to another finger.

1422
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:16,971
That means you're
sentimentally attached to it.

1423
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,246
But you're not still married.

1424
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,004
I favor widowed,
given the number of cats

1425
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,411
- you share your life with.
- Sherlock?

1426
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,050
Two Burmese and a tortoiseshell,

1427
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,884
judging by the cat hairs
on your cardigan.

1428
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,962
A divorcee's more likely
to look for a new partner.

1429
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,611
A widow to fill the void
left by her dead husband.

1430
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,126
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.

1431
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,565
And there's clearly
no one new in your life

1432
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,927
otherwise you wouldn't be spending
your Friday nights in an aquarium.

1433
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,724
That probably accounts
for the drink problem too.

1434
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,006
The slight tremor in your hand.

1435
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,242
The red wine stain
ghosting your top lip.

1436
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,970
So, yes.

1437
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,407
I'd say jealousy
was your motive, after all.

1438
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,320
To prove how good you are.

1439
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,242
To make up for
the inadequacies of your little life.

1440
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,728
Well, Mrs. Norbury,

1441
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,529
I must admit, this is unexpected.

1442
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,723
Vivian Norbury.

1443
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,364
You outsmarted them all.

1444
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,448
All except Sherlock Holmes.

1445
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,046
There's no way out.

1446
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,171
So it would seem.

1447
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,043
You see right through me, Mr. Holmes.

1448
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,281
It's what I do.

1449
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,482
Maybe I can still surprise you.

1450
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,404
Now come on. Be sensible.

1451
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,129
No, I don't think so.

1452
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,129
- Surprise.

1453
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,361
Everything's fine. It's gonna be okay.

1454
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,522
- Get an ambulance.

1455
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,647
It's all right.
It's all right.

1456
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,165
- Mary!
- John.

1457
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,008
Oh... Mary?

1458
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,445
Mary? Stay with me. Stay with me.

1459
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,045
- Don't worry.
- Come on, Doctor.

1460
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,009
- You can do better than that.
- Come on, Mary.

1461
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,525
Mary?

1462
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,004
- John, I think this is it.
- No, no, no, no.

1463
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,889
It's not. It's...

1464
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,610
You've made me so happy.

1465
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,122
You gave me everything
I could ever, ever...

1466
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,326
- Shh, shh.
- Wanted.

1467
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,687
- Mary, Mary? Shh, shh.

1468
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,603
- Look after Rosie.
- Shh.

1469
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,045
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1470
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,326
- Yes, I promise.

1471
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,090
- Promise.
- I promise. I promise.

1472
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,446
Shh.

1473
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,641
Hey, Sherlock.

1474
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,161
Yes.

1475
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:35,523
I so like you.

1476
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,486
Did I ever say?

1477
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,725
Yes, yes, you did.

1478
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,447
I'm sorry for shooting you that time.

1479
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:46,646
I'm really sorry.

1480
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,521
It's all right.

1481
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,922
- I think we're even now, okay?
- Okay.

1482
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,771
I think we're even.

1483
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,365
- Definitely even.
- Mary...

1484
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,568
Ah!

1485
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,886
You were my whole world.

1486
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,530
Being Mary Watson...

1487
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,924
...was the only life...

1488
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,967
...worth living.

1489
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,161
Thank you.

1490
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,086
Mary?

1491
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,245
Don't you dare.

1492
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,486
You made a vow.

1493
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,411
You swore it.

1494
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,406
<i>You've been having dreams.</i>

1495
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,846
<i>A recurring dream?</i>

1496
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,121
Do you wanna talk about it?

1497
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,801
This is a two-way relationship,
you know.

1498
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,802
The whole world has come
crashing down around you.

1499
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,122
Everything is hopeless.

1500
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,850
Irretrievable.

1501
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,810
I know that's what you must feel.

1502
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,290
But I can only help you

1503
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,801
if you completely
open yourself up to me.

1504
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,564
That's not really my style.

1505
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,411
I need to know what to do.

1506
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,446
Do?

1507
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,851
About John.

1508
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,284
Put me through to Sherrinford, please.

1509
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,645
Yes, I'll wait.

1510
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,849
Nothing will ever be
the same again, will it?

1511
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,122
- I'm afraid it won't.

1512
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,886
We'll have to rally around,
I expect, do our bit.

1513
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,486
Look after little Rosie.

1514
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,324
I'm just going to, erm...

1515
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,566
Look through these things.
There might be a case.

1516
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:17,247
A case?
Oh, you're not up to it, are you?

1517
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,290
Work is the best antidote
to sorrow, Mrs. Hudson.

1518
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,761
Yes, yes, I expect you're right.

1519
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,731
I'll make some tea, shall I?

1520
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,683
- Mrs. Hudson?
- Yes, Sherlock?

1521
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,291
If you ever think I'm becoming
a bit full of myself,

1522
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,046
- cocky or overconfident...
- Yes?

1523
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,401
Will you just say
the word "Norbury" to me?

1524
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,409
- Would you?
- Norbury.

1525
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,001
Just that.

1526
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,081
I'd be very grateful.

1527
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,921
What's this?

1528
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,850
Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.

1529
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,125
- God, is that...
- Must be.

1530
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,929
Oh.

1531
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,451
I knew it wouldn't end like this.

1532
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,370
I knew Moriarty made plans.

1533
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,209
Thought that would get your attention.

1534
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,882
So this is in case...

1535
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,210
In case the day comes.

1536
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,444
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm probably dead.</i>

1537
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,125
<i>I hope I can have an ordinary life.</i>

1538
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,402
<i>But who knows?
Nothing is certain, nothing is written.</i>

1539
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,128
My old life...

1540
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,125
It was full of consequences.

1541
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,810
The danger was the fun part.

1542
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,524
But you can't outrun that forever.

1543
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,080
You need to remember that, so...

1544
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,086
I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.

1545
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,683
<i>Might be the hardest case
of your career.</i>

1546
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:10,365
When I'm gone, if I'm gone...

1547
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,448
I need you to do something for me.

1548
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,121
Hi.

1549
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,123
I just wondered how things
were going, you know.

1550
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,290
And if there was anything I could do?

1551
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,122
It's, uh... It's from John.

1552
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,041
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.

1553
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,326
I'm sorry, Sherlock. He says...

1554
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,244
John said if you were to come round,

1555
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,800
asking after him, offering to help...

1556
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,161
Yes?

1557
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,249
He said...

1558
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:05,529
That he'd rather have anyone but you.

1559
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,365
Anyone.

1560
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,406
<i>I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.</i>

1561
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,206
<i>When I'm gone, if I'm gone...</i>

1562
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,090
<i>I need you to do something for me.</i>

1563
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,084
Save John Watson.

1564
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,567
Save him, Sherlock.

1565
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,886
Save him.

1566
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,046
<i>When does the path
we walk on lock around our feet?</i>

1567
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,284
<i>When does the road become a river
with only one destination?</i>

1568
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:20,169
<i>Death waits for us all in Samarra.</i>

1569
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,971
<i>But can Samarra be avoided?</i>

1570
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,044
Go to hell, Sherlock.
