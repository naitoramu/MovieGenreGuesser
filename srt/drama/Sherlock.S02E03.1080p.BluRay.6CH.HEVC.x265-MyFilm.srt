00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,144
But drawn on with an index finger.

156
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,388
Your finger. journalist

157
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,990
Unlikely you get your hands dirty
at the press.

158
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,260
You put that there to test me.

159
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,145
- Wow! I'm liking you.
- You mean I'd make a great feature.

160
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,222
"Sherlock Holmes,
the man beneath the hat."

161
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,907
Kitty. Riley.

162
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,465
- Pleased to meet you.
- No.

163
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,226
I'm just saving you
the trouble of asking.

164
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,541
No, I won't give you an interview.
No, I don't want the money.

165
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,310
You and John Watson. just platonic?

166
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,065
Can I put you down for a no there
as well?

167
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,666
There's all sorts of gossip
in the press about you.

168
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,300
Sooner or later, you're going to need
someone on your side.

169
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,584
Someone to set the record straight.

170
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,188
You think you're the girl
for that job, do you?

171
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,429
I'm smart. And you can trust me.

172
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,621
Totally.

173
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,261
Smart? Okay. Investigative journalist.

174
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,271
Good. Well, look at me
and tell me what you see.

175
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,949
If you're that skilful,
you don't need an interview,

176
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,103
you can just read what you need.

177
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,347
No? Okay, my turn.

178
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,223
I look at you and I see someone who's
still waiting for their first big scoop

179
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,540
so that their editor will notice them.

180
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,590
You're wearing an expensive skirt
that has been re-hemmed twice.

181
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,866
The only posh skirt you've got.

182
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,908
And your nails, you can't afford
to do them that often.

183
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,946
I see someone who's hungry.
I don't see smart.

184
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,704
And I definitely don't see trustworthy,

185
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,989
but I'll give you a quote, if you like.
Three little words.

186
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,820
You repel me.

<font color="#404040">BARRISTER:</font> A consulting criminal.

Can you expand on that answer?

189
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,507
James Moriarty is for hire.

190
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,503
- A tradesman?
- Yes.

191
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,344
<font color="#404040">BARRISTER:</font> But not the sort
who'd fix your heating?

192
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,906
No, the sort who'd plant
a bomb or stage an assassination,

193
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,869
but I'm sure he'd make a pretty
decent job of your boiler.

194
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,587
Would you describe him as...

195
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,707
- Leading.
- What?

196
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,941
Can't do that.
You're leading the witness.

197
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,226
He'll object and the judge will uphold.

198
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,506
Mr. Holmes!

199
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,469
Ask me how. How would I describe him?

200
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,066
What opinion have I formed of him?
Did they not teach you this?

201
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,064
<font color="#404040">JUDGE:</font> Mr. Holmes,

this man, his character?

203

First mistake,

204
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,704
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

205
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,110
He's a spider.

206
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,743
A spider at the centre of a web.

207
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,949
A criminal web with a thousand threads

208
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,070
and he knows precisely how each
and every single one of them dances.

210
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,070
No, no, don't... Don't do that.
That's really not a good question.

211
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,701
- Mr. Holmes!
- <font color="#404040">SHERLOCK:</font> How long have I known him?

212
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,464
Not really your best line of enquiry.

213
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,065
We met twice, five minutes in total.

214
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,063
I pulled a gun. He tried to blow me up.

215
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,989
I felt we had a special something

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,229
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously
claiming this man is an expert?

217
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,589
After knowing the accused
for just five minutes?

218
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,708
Two minutes would have made me
an expert. Five was ample.

219
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,147
Mr. Holmes, that's a matter for the jury.

220
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,701
Oh, really?

221
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,709
One librarian, two teachers,

222
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,147
two high-pressure jobs,
probably the City.

223
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,271
Foreman's a medical secretary,

224
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,705
trained abroad,
judging by her short hair.

225
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,020
- Mr. Holmes...
- Seven are married

226
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,864
and two are having an affair
with each other, it would seem.

227
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,351
Oh, and they've just had
tea and biscuits.

228
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,660
Would you like to know
who ate the wafer?

229
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,665
Mr. Holmes!

230
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,784
You've been called here to answer
Miss Sorrel's questions,

231
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,786
not to give us a display
of your intellectual prowess.

232
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,182
Keep your answers brief
and to the point.

233
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,622
Anything else will be treated
as contempt.

234
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,225
Do you think you could survive
for just a few minutes

235
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,790
without showing off?

236
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,061
What did I say?
I said, "Don't get clever."

237
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,582
I can't just turn it on and off
like a tap.

238
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,791
- Well?
- Well what?

239
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,466
You were there for the whole thing.
Up in the gallery, start to finish.

240
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,747
Like you said it would be.
Sat on his backside, never even stirred.

241
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,788
Moriarty's not mounting any defence.

242
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,790
Bank of England, Tower of London,
Pentonville.

243
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,666
Three of the most secure places
in the country

244
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,666
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,
no one knows how or why.

245
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,987
- All we know is...
- He ended up in custody.

246
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,346
Don't do that.

247
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,940
- Do what?
- The look.

248
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,505
- Look?
- You're doing the look again.

249
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,105
Well, I can't see it, can I?

250
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,184
- It's my face.
- Yes, and it's doing a thing.

251
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,342
You're doing a "we both know
what's really going on here" face.

252
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,751
- Well, we do.
- No, I don't.

253
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,663
Which is why I find the face
so annoying.

254
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,311
If Moriarty wanted the jewels,
he'd have them.

255
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,428
If he wanted those prisoners freed,
they'd be out on the streets.

256
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,229
The only reason he's still in a prison
cell right now

257
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,029
is because he chose to be there.

258
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,706
Somehow, this is part of his scheme.

259
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,547
<font color="#404040">JUDGE:</font> Mr. Crayhill,
can we have your first witness?

260
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,949
Your honour, we're not calling
any witnesses.

261
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,589
I don't follow.
You've entered a plea of "not guilty".

262
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,785
Nevertheless,
my client is offering no evidence.

263
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,302
The defence rests.

264
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,149
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

265
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,507
...James Moriarty stands accused...
- ...James Moriarty stands accused

266
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,060
of multiple counts
of attempted burglary.

267
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,906
Crimes which, if he's found guilty,

268
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,740
will elicit
a very long custodial sentence

269
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,188
and yet his legal team has...

270
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,787
...chosen to offer
no evidence whatsoever

271
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,066
to support their plea.

272
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,064
I find myself in the unusual position

273
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,828
of recommending a verdict
wholeheartedly.

274
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,623
You must find him guilty.

275
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,100
Guilty.

276
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,989

Coming back.

278
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,744
That was six minutes.

279
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,582
Surprised it took them that long,
to be honest.

280
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,628
There was a queue for the loo.

281
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,024
Have you reached a verdict

he heard his son at the piano

Now, quickly, tell me!

460
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,786
All the doors and windows
were properly bolted.

461
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,143
No one, not even me,
went into their room last night.

462
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,665
You have to believe me!

463
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,310
I do.
I just wanted you to speak quickly.

464
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,667
Miss MacKenzie will need to
breathe into a bag now.

Absolutely no sign of a break-in.

470
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,147
The intruder must have been
hidden inside someplace.

471
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,741
Show me where the brother slept.

472

Boy sleeps there every night

473
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,346
gazing at the only light source,
outside in the corridor.

474
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,901
He'd recognise every shape,
every outline.

Okay! SO?

So someone approaches the door
who he doesn't recognise.

478
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,023
An intruder. Maybe he can even
see the outline of a weapon.

479
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,305
What would he do

The girl was pulled beside him,
dragged sideways.

He had his left arm

How did he get past the CCTV?
If all the doors were locked.

506
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,271
He walked in when they weren't locked.

507
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,144
A stranger can't just
walk into a school like that.

chauffeurs, staff.

<i>He was waiting for them.</i>

- It's Moriarty.

Of course it's Moriarty.

521

We went out three times. I ended it.

522
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,261
Yes, and then he stole the Crown jewels,
broke into the Bank of England

523
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,671
and organised a prison break
at Pentonville.

The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

All the chemical traces on his shoe
have been preserved.

529
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,625
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.

530
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,429
If we're lucky, we can see everything
that he's been up to.

When he was dying,
he was always cheerful, he was lovely.

Except when he thought no one could see.

546
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,186
- I saw him once. He looked sad.
- Molly...

547
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,469
You look sad.
When you think he can't see you.

550
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,746
looking sad when you think
no one can see you.

551
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,428
- You can see me.
- I don't count.

you can have me.
No, I just mean... I mean...

If there's anything you need.
It's fine.

556
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,308
But what could I need from you?

557
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,903
Nothing. I don't know.

558
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,980
But you could probably say
thank you, actually.

559
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,986
Thank you.

560

- There's another one.
- What?

566
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,991
On our doorstep. Found it today.

Yes, and look at that.

Look at that. Exactly the same seal.

- Bread crumbs.
- Uh-huh. It was there when I got back.

570
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,068
A little trace of bread crumbs,
hardback copy of fairy tales.

Two children led into the forest

The sort that likes to boast.
The sort that thinks it's all a game.

He sat in our flat and he said
these exact words to me.

All fairly tales need
a good old-fashioned villain.

The fifth substance.

579
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,748
It's part of the tale.
The witch's house.

580
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,581
The glycerol molecule.

- PGPR.
- What's that?

We need to find a place in the city

where all five of these things
intersect.

Chalk, asphalt, brick dust,
vegetation...

908
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,385
Darling, they didn't have
any ground coffee,

909
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,507
so I just got normal.

910
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,665
You said that
they wouldn't find me here.

911
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,266
- You said that I'd be safe here.
- You are safe, Richard.

912
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,422
I'm a witness. He wouldn't harm you
in front of witnesses.

913
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,423
So, that's your source?

914
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,503
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

915
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:17,744
Of course he's Richard Brook, there is
no Moriarty, there never has been.

916
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,107
- What are you talking about?
- Look him up.

917
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,629
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes
hired to be Moriarty.

918
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,745
Doctor Watson, I...

919
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,627
I know you're a good man. Don't...
Don't... Don't hurt me.

920
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,387
No, you're Moriarty! He's Moriarty!

921
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,622
We've met, remember?
You were going to blow me up!

922
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,107
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

923
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,982
He paid me. I needed the work.

924
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,030
- I'm an actor, I was out of work...
- Sherlock, you'd better explain,

925
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,990
- 'cause I am not getting this.
- <font color="#404040">KITTY:</font> I'll be doing the explaining.

926
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,347
In print. It's all here.

927
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,185
Conclusive proof.

928
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,663
You invented James Moriarty,
your nemesis.

929
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,981
- Invented him?
- Mmm-hmm.

930
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,903
Invented all the crimes, actually.

931
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,108
And to cap it all,
you made up a master villain.

932
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,990
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Ask him, he's right here!

933
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,061
Just ask him!

934
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,341
- Tell him, Richard.
- No, for god's sake,

935
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,026
- this man was on trial.
- Yes, and you paid him.

936
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,625
Paid him to take the rap.

937
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,907
Promised you'd rig the jury

938
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,506
Not exactly a West End role,
but I'll bet the money was good.

939
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,262
But not so good
he didn't want to sell his story.

940
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,230
I am sorry. I am, I am sorry.

941
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,588
So, this is the story
that you're going to publish?

942
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,824
The big conclusion of it all,
Moriarty is an actor?

943
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,709
He knows I am. I have proof.

944
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,623
I have proof, show him.
Can you show them something?

945
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,350
Yeah, show me something.

Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

958
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,191
I look at you now and I can read you.

959
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,707
And you repel me.

960
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,748
Can he do that?
Completely change his identity?

961
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:41,347
- Make you the criminal?
- He's got my whole life story.

962
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,661
That's what you do. You sell a big lie.

963
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,742
You wrap it up in a truth
to make it palatable.

964
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:47,231
It's your word against his.

965
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,430
He's been sowing doubt into
people's minds for the last 24 hours.

966
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,862
There's only one thing he needs to do
to complete his game and that's to...

967
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,860
Sherlock?

968
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,226
There's something I need to do.

969
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,506
- What, can I help?
- No, on my own.

970
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,982
You're wrong, you know.

971
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,710
You do count.

972
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,023
You've always counted
and I've always trusted you.

973
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,384
But you were right.

974
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,945
I'm not okay.

975
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,744
Tell me what's wrong.

976
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,391
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

977
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,465
- What do you need?
- If I wasn't everything

978
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,030
that you think I am,

979
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,307
everything that I think I am,

980
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,431
would you still want to help me?

981
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,229
What do you need?

982
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,701
You.

983
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,462
She has really done her homework,
Miss Riley.

984
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,670
There's things that only someone
close to Sherlock could know.

985
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,221
Ah.

986
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,667
Have you seen
your brother's address book lately?

987
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,468
There's two names, yours and mine.

988
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,464
And Moriarty didn't get this stuff
from me.

989
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,940
- John...
- So, how does it work, then?

990
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,825
Your relationship?
You go out for a coffee

991
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,141
now and then, eh? You and Jim?

992
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,984
Your own brother and you blabbed
about his entire life

993
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,149
to this maniac?

994
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,582
- I never intend... I never dreamt...
- This, see, this...

995
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,869
is what you were trying to tell me,
isn't it?

996
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,863
Watch his back,
'cause I've made a mistake.

997
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,431
How did you meet him?

998
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,387
People like him, we...

999
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,546
know about them, we watch them.

1000
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,870
But James Moriarty

1001
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,061
the most dangerous criminal mind
the world has ever seen,

1002
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:34,546
and in his pocket's the ultimate weapon,
a key code.

1003
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:39,267
A few lines of computer code
that can unlock any door.

1004
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,822
And you abducted him?

1005
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,667
To try and find the key code.

1006
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,828
- Interrogated him for weeks.
- And?

1007
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,943
<font color="#404040">MYCROFT:</font><i> He wouldn't play along.</i>

1009
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,431
The only thing that made him open up...

1010
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,428
<i>I could get him to talk. just a little.</i>

1011
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,749
But...

1012
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,147
in return, you had to offer him
Sherlock's life story.

1013
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,148
So there's one big lie,

1014
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,384
Sherlock's a fraud.

1015
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,703
But people will swallow it
because the rest of it is true.

1016
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,430
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed,
right?

1017
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:38,671
And you have given him
the perfect ammunition.

1018
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,627
- <font color="#DF01D7">(CLEARING THROAT)</font>

1019
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,501
I'm sorry.

1020
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,510
<font color="#DF01D7">(SCOFFS)</font> Oh, please.

1021
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,230
Tell him, would you?

1022
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,825
Got your message.

1023
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,868
The computer code is key to this.
If we find it, we can use it,

1024
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,544
beat Moriarty at his own game.

1025
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,667
- What do you mean, use it?
- He's used it

1026
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,071
to create a false identity.

1027
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,021
So we can use it to break into
the records and destroy Richard Brook.

1028
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,745
And bring back Jim Moriarty again.

1029
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,387
Somewhere in 221 b, somewhere,
on the day of the verdict,

1030
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,191
- he left it hidden.
- Uh-huh.

1031
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,749
- What did he touch?
- An apple, nothing else.

01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,023
You and me, Sherlock.

1059
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,586
And our problem, the final problem,

1060
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,508
stayin' alive.

1061
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,303
So boring, isn't it?

1062
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:58,861
<font color="#DF01D7">(MUSIC STOPS)</font>

1063
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:00,985
It's just...

1064
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,701
staying...

1065
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,746
All my life, I've been searching
for a distraction

1066
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,711
and you were the best distraction
and now I don't even have you.

1067
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,630
Because I've beaten you.

1068
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,989
And you know what?
In the end, it was easy.

1069
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,026
It was easy.

1070
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,865
Now I've got to go back
to playing with the ordinary people.

1071
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,149
And it turns out you're ordinary,
just like all of them.

1072
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,786
Oh, well.

1073
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,750
Did you almost start to wonder
if I was real?

1074
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,264
Did I nearly get you?

1075
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,548
Richard Brook.

1076
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,501
Nobody seems to get the joke.

1077
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,705
- But you do.
- Of course.

1078
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,941
Attaboy.

1079
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,500
Rich Brook in German is Reichenbach.

1080
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:48,945
The case that made my name.

1081
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,261
Just trying to have some fun.

1082
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,668
Good, you got that, too.

1083
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,021
Beats like digits.

1084
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,783
<i>Every beat is a one,
every rest is a zero.</i>

1085
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:11,431
Binary code. That's why all those
assassins tried to save my life.

1086
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,229
It was hidden on me,
hidden inside my head.

1087
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,509
A few simple lines of computer code
that can break into any system.

1088
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,984
Told all my clients.

1089
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:24,068
- Last one to Sherlock is a sissy.
- Yes, but now that it's up here,

1090
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:26,791
I can use it to alter all the records.

1091
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,588
I can kill Rich Brook
and bring back Jim Moriarty.

1092
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,826
No, no, no, no, no, this is too easy.

1093
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,905
This is too easy.
There is no key, doofus!

1094
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:48,742
Those digits are meaningless.
They're utterly meaningless.

1095
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,549
You don't really think
a couple of lines of computer code

1096
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,304
are going to crash the world
around our ears?

1097
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:56,906
I'm disappointed.
I'm disappointed in you.

1098
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:59,506
- Ordinary Sherlock.
- But the rhythm...

1099
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,027
Partita No 7.
Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

1100
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,910
- Then how did you...
- Now, how did I break into the bank,

1101
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:08,790
to the Tower, to the prison?
Daylight robbery.

1102
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,151
<i>All it takes
is some willing participants.</i>

<font color="#DF01D7">(ALARM RINGING)</font>

1104
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,949
I knew you'd fall for it.
That's your weakness.

1105
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,269
You always want everything to be clever.
Now, shall we finish the game?

1106
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,623
One final act.
Glad you chose a tall building.

1107
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,709
Nice way to do it.

1108
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,384
Do it? Do... Do what?

1109
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,145
Yes, of course.

1110
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,671
My suicide.

1111
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,101
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.

1112
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,831
I read it in the paper,
so it must be true.

1113
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,709
I love newspapers.

1114
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,341
Fairy tales.

1115
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,942
And pretty grim ones, too.

1116
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,467
Oh, God, John, you made me jump.

1117
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,581
Is everything okay now with the police?
Has, um, Sherlock sorted it all out?

1118
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:14,109
Oh, my God.

1119
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,341
Taxi!

1120
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,266
Taxi!

1121
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,422
No, no, no, no, police!

1122
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,184
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot.

1123
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,060
I can still prove that you created
an entirely false identity.

1124
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,189
Oh, just kill yourself,
it's a lot less effort.

1125
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,101
Go on.

1126
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,421
For me.

Okay.

Let me give you
a little extra incentive.

1132
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,788
Your friends will die if you don't.

1133
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,583
John?
- Not just John. Everyone

1134
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,743
- Mrs. Hudson?
- Everyone.

1135
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,909
- Lestrade?
- Three bullets, three gunmen,

1136
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,423
three victims.
There's no stopping them now.

1137
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,467
Unless my people see you jump.

1138
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,384
You can have me arrested.
You can torture me.

1139
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,823
You can do anything you like with me.

1140
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,665
But nothing's going to prevent them
from pulling the trigger.

1141
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:38,187
Your only three friends in the world
will die. Unless...

1142
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,469
Unless I kill myself,
complete your story.

1143
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,467
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

1144
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,822
And I die in disgrace.

1145
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,467
Of course, that's the point of this.

1146

I told you how this ends.

1150
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,269
Your death is the only thing
that's going to call off the killers.

1151
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,821
I'm certainly not going to do it.

1152
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:17,510
Would you give me one moment, please?

1153
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,665
One moment of privacy.
