1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,350
Until further notice...

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:07,150
- no fraternising with the foreigners.
- My son will walk with any woman in this city.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,260
It'll be hard for your son to walk
anywhere with a bullet in each knee.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,000
- You said you wanted peace at home.
- Now we go on the offensive.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,250
You are a woman of substance and class.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,950
I've painted many women.
There'll be no charge.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,950
The name I heard was Section D.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,950
MPs. Army officers.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,950
All we're trying to do is save
the country from revolution.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,950
This is for the killing of the spy.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,950
And a down payment on future services.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,950
Does your wife know that the sapphire

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,950
she's wearing has been cursed?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,950
Nothing on Earth would make me wear it.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,540
For Angel!

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,540
He's back.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,950
Was he out there all night?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,950
Every night since the funeral.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,950
He comes back in the morning to
see Charles and feed the horses.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,950
And when it gets dark he goes off again.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,950
He used to sleep out when he was a kid.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,870
Curly'd find him in the pasture...

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,800
How's the baby?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
He asks for his mum at night.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,950
Tommy made a list. He
wants to see you two first.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,470
What about John and Arthur?

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How are the books?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,950
Unaffected.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,670
Up slightly.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,950
There's also been a three-fold
increase in donations

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,950
to the Shelby Foundation charity.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,950
The council have suggested
naming the new school

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,470
the Grace Shelby Institute.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,950
Tell the council the name
Grace Shelby Institute

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,070
is acceptable to us.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,700
This is a list of the
other things I want doing.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,600
That's all.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
- Tommy...
- That's all, Pol.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,470
And well done, both of you.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,950
Right, let's go.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,540
Erm, we've already seen him.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He wanted to see people
in a particular order.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,950
I can normally read him,
but he's difficult to read.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,940
So, be careful...

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,950
- I thought it was a fucking
family meeting. - Yeah.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,950
All of us together, I thought.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,950
John, he's grieving.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,950
To see everyone together
would be too much.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, well. Come on, John.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,950
Arthur, we need him back.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,950
Sabini and Solomons have already
sent condolences and flowers.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,950
So, it won't be long before they
come trotting up the A1 like wolves.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,470
Go on. There's a timetable.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,950
Only good news.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,950
There is only good news, Polly.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,950
(Here we fucking go...)

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There. There he is.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,950
All right, Tom?

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,950
All right, boys?

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,540
We, erm...

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,950
We didn't get a chance to
see you after the funeral.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, you disappeared on us, but, erm...

72
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,950
Well, me and John, we
just wanted to say...

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,740
- Arthur. Shut up.
- All right.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,950
All right. Now, talk to me.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,950
We got to Angel at the hospital.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Where he laid, cut his throat. He's dead.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,950
We cleared out the rest of the Italians

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,950
out of the south of the city...

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,950
They mostly went to the Black Country,

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,950
but we told Betty Kitchen
to keep 'em moving.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,950
- And Betty sends her condolences...
- What about the old man?

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,950
We interrogated his boys.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,950
Yeah, he went to Liverpool.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,950
- He's waiting for an immigrant
ship to New York. - When?

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
First ship sails Saturday.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,950
All right.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,950
I have contacts, people
in Cunard at Liverpool.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,950
They'll have passenger lists.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,950
They can get you into
the point of departure.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,950
You pick him up and bring him to me.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,950
Who's he got travelling with him?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,950
His wife.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,950
What?

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,950
His wife.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,870
So, shoot her and bring him to me.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,950
Tommy? Mrs Changretta was
a teacher at our school.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She's a good woman, Tom. A good woman.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, if she's a good woman, then
she'll go to Heaven, eh, Arthur?

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,950
Just do what's on the list.
Nothing else. Then burn it.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And don't speak on the phones. The
fucking secret service is listening.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,950
And I want the old man alive.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,270
I want to do it myself.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Right, that is it. You can go.

104
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,950
Come, John.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,950
Tommy, if you ain't going to be here,

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,950
you're going to have to tell us something.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,950
Ask Polly.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,950
Not Michael?

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,950
What?

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,950
Not Michael, no?

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,950
No, not Michael, no.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,950
Cos Michael deals with
legitimate business.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,950
You saw him before us.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,950
John, not now.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,950
Wait, what did you say?

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,950
You saw Michael before us.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,200
For fuck's sake, John.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because legitimate business,
John, is the priority.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,950
- Legitimate business...
- Since when?

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Since my fucking wife
took a bullet meant for me.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,950
Oh, yeah. OK. It's all secret
service. Secret fucking service.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,950
Blah-blah-blah. But you
don't tell us shit.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,950
We are a couple of fucking
toy soldiers. Do this, John.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do that, John. Kill your
fucking teacher, John.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Is this how it is going to be?

126
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,950
All right, listen to me.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,950
There's going to be a little war,

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,950
in a little place that
no-one gives a fuck about

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,950
and the side that is going to
lose needs a little bit of help.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,950
And they're willing to pay.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,950
When that business is done,
legitimate business is the priority.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, do what's on the list and fuck off.

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,950
And when are you coming back? Hmm?

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,940
I'm back, Arthur.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,950
The thing is, we all
naturally came in here.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,950
Where the servants eat.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,950
It's nothing to do with politics, Ada.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,950
It's fucking freezing in the big room.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,950
John, mind your language in front of Karl.

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,950
Ada, we're in the servants' quarters,

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,950
because it's where the
fucking booze is kept.

142
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,950
Arthur, find better words.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,950
Hey, Pol, does swearing in Gypsy count?

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,950
There is no reason for us

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,950
to be speaking Rocka
or Shelta in any case.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,950
Hey, I'm just saying there is no need.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,950
When she's drunk, my wife
can't speak fucking English.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,340
- John!
- Fucking right.

149
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,950
You dealt with it?

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,950
Incentives, no threats.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,950
Implied consequences
without specific reference

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,950
to physical harm...

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,950
That's why young Michael is the boss.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,950
He knows better words, right, Pol?

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,950
Since when was I your boss, Arthur?

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,950
First the boss' meeting, then
the workers' meeting, eh?

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,950
When did either of you
two do a day's work?

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,950
In the old days, Finn,

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,950
family meetings used to be all of us...

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,870
- .. together.
- Arthur, shut up.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now, me and John...

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,670
.. we're just fucking binmen...

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
.. whose duty it is to obey.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,140
Hm?

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Mrs Changretta.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Arthur.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,950
Shut up.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,950
Finn. Go and get his cigars.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,950
So, what are we going to do all night, eh?

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,950
Climb fucking trees?

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,950
John, stop swearing in front of the kids.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,950
Yeah, and who said
you're staying the night?

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,950
I know what we can do.

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,950
We get the guns out, John.

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We go outside and we shoot
some fucking pheasants.

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,950
That's what the bosses do, innit?

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Fuck off, Arthur...

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,740
The fuck did you just say to me?

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I didn't ask for separate
meetings today, all right?

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,950
What the fuck did you just say?

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
Cos I just didn't hear you right.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,950
I didn't ask for separate
meetings today. All right?

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,950
Fucking pheasant.

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,950
- Karl, you can't say things like that.
- Now look what you've done.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,950
All right, brothers, it's just
the fucking whiskey talking.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,950
I don't ask to be protected, all right?

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,950
Right, shut up, the pair of you.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,470
Sit down.

189
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,950
Sit down.

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,950
Look around you.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,950
Look at this house.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,950
Look where we are.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,950
Look how far we've come.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,950
I think it is time we all started acting

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,100
in a way more appropriate to our station.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We're none of us binmen
any more, Arthur...

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,540
Tommy needs us all together.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,540
I'd like to propose a toast.

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a family united that
shall never be defeated.

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Tommy's gone, I swear to God, he
is in a wagon with Johnny Dogs!

202
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,950
Shit!

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,340
This is what he does now.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,950
Tommy! Wait!

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,950
- Arthur!
- Tommy!

206
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,950
Arthur, let him go.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,940
Walk on. Walk on.

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,950
Tommy? Walk on.

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,950
They're coming out on the drive.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,950
- Are you not going to tell them?
- Tell them what?

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,950
That we're going to Wales.

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,740
I left a note.

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,950
- Did you tell them why
we're going to Wales? - No.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,950
At some point, are you going to
tell me why we're going to Wales?

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,950
Yeah, when we get there.

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,950
Walk on.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,950
Should've brought at
least one woman, Tommy.

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,950
Johnny, it's a woman we're going to see.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,950
- There, boy. Walk on.
- Right.

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,470
Walk on.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,950
He says he'll be back in
Birmingham in three days.

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
Let him go.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,950
The important thing is
if he says he'll be back,

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,950
he'll be back.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,950
Come on, let's go light
a fire in the big room.

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,950
Let's go drink whiskey.

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
With water.

229
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,950
Go see to the horses, Johnny.

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Right, Tom.

231
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So, we'll go out through Meriden
and into the Black Mountains.

232
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,950
Yeah.

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Here, give me some. Good boy.

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,670
Here you go.

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Now, remember last night
when you asked after Mama?

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,950
She's gone, Charlie,
and there's a few things

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,950
we need to get this straight.

238
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's her photographs,
there's her clothes.

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We will keep things the
way they are in the room.

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Just... keep things the way they are.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There you go.

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There, here you go.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,470
I'm not much good, Charlie.

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,100
And they'll find that out soon enough.

245
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But she's not going to be coming
back, so it's just you and me.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,950
But she'll be with us in our hearts.

247
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,950
Cos we love her.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,950
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

249
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,950
- This fucking horse of yours won't
come to me. - All right. - Huh? Come on.

250
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,950
All right! I'll be there. All right.

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,950
That was her favourite horse, Charlie.

252
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,950
And he's been all over the
place since she's gone.

253
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,950
- Tom?
- Yeah, you watch him.

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I will, yeah. Huh?

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,950
Right.

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Now, cock it with your thumb.

257
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,950
There you go.

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,950
Now, she's been cocked.

259
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,950
She's alive in your hand.

260
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,950
It's like waking up a girl
when you cock that trigger.

261
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,950
Oh, yeah.

262
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She rolls over all sleepy-eyed and
she goes, "Michael... Michael..."

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,950
"What you going to make me do, Michael?"

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,670
You boys are fucking crazy men.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,950
Yeah. But you feel it though, right?

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,950
You feel it.

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,950
Yeah. You can feel the power.

268
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,950
Now...

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
squeeze it.

270
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,950
Ah, fuck...

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,950
Fucking useless.

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,950
Piss off, John.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,950
Michael, why does a pen pusher
who sits on his arse all day

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
want to fire a gun? Hm? Eh?

275
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Cock it again.

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,950
Cock it again!

277
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,600
- Cock it again.
- Round two.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,950
Oh.

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,950
Look at that fucking face, John Boy.

280
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,950
Look at that face.

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,870
Now he feels it.

282
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,950
But you won't feel nothing

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
until you point that thing at a man.

284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So, do it.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,340
There you go, young boss.

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,950
There you go. Now you feel it.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,950
Now you feel what we feel.

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,270
This is what it's like.

289
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,950
Michael, that is a Webley.

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,950
It jumps on the hammer.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,670
How does it feel, Michael, huh?

292
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,950
Better than having a
pen in your hand, innit?

293
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,950
More like having your
cock in your hand. Yeah.

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,950
Yeah, it is.

295
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,950
Yeah.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
One squeeze...

297
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,670
.. I'm gone.

298
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,950
I'm fucking meat.

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,950
Michael, you fucking watch that
Webley don't jump you know that.

300
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,950
When you've pulled that fucking trigger

301
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and the body of the man you've shot
wraps itself around your ankles.

302
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,740
They pile up.

303
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,950
It gets to the point where
you can't walk in a room

304
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
without bringing a load of them with you.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,870
What's going on?

306
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,950
What's going on?

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Polly, we're just educating the boss
here on our side of the business.

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Michael, get in the house...

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,950

- No. Why would it be?

321
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,950
- I read the papers.

And if Tommy wants to keep this secret,

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,950
tell him there was a woman in
a fur coat walking through here

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,950
in broad daylight like
the Queen Of fucking Sheba

328
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,950
asking about armoured cars.

329
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,950
During a period of grieving
some things were allowed to slip.

330
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,950
We know the woman. We're dealing with it.

331
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,950
Now, take a look at this list.

332
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,950
These are all the men
who work the night shift

333
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,950
who are members of the South
Birmingham Communist Party.

334
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,950
You've got six weeks.

335
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,740
Sack them all.

336
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,950
Are you fucking mad?

337
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,950
He is.

338
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,950
Yeah.

339
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,950
Every factory in the city
will come out on strike...

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,950
So?

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,940
You find reasons.

342
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,870
You set them up.

343
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,950
You sack them.

344
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,950
Look at the list again.

345
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Are there any communists on your
shift who aren't on the list?

346
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,140
No.

347
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,950
Please, don't fucking lie to us.

348
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,950
Who's missing?

349
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,740
I don't know.

350
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,870
Emmanuel Hunter.

351
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,140
Hm?

352
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,470
Convener.

353
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,950
Deputy treasurer of the
Sparkhill Communist Party.

354
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,950
Lathe operator to you.

355
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,950
I didn't know he was a communist.

356
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,950
We left that name off the list on purpose

357
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,670
to see if you could be trusted.

358
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,950
And you can't be trusted.

359
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,950
Look, I'm just a working man.

360
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,670
We're going to be watching you.

361
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,950
- Watching your fucking house.
- I've got kids.

362
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,140
Mm.

363
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,740
Edna and John.

364
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,140
Just get them sacked.

365
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,950
As they appear on the list.

366
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,950
Two a week.

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
The last one before the clocks go forward.

368
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,200
Is that a yes or a no?

369
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,070
- Yes.
- Thank you.

370
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Good. Good.

371
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,950
Do you think he'll return?

372
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,340
Tommy?

373
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,340
He will always come back.

374
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,950
- You speak differently when you talk...
- Yeah, I prefer to talk

375
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,950
about other things.

376
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,950
Let me see.

377
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,950
What books do you like?

378
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,950
Riding? Flower arranging? Embroidery?

379
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You'd be surprised at the things I know.

380
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,950
But you'd also be surprised
at the things I don't know.

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,950
What can you possibly not know?

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,070
I wasn't educated...

383
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,950
.. at all.

384
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
What is there to learn after all?

385
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,470
Goodness.

386
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm sorry. You must need a rest.

387
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Do you tell your friends
you're painting a gangster?

388
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,950
Is that the fun in all of this?

389
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,940
In truth, I don't have any friends.

390
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,740
I knew everyone through my wife.

391
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
When she died...

392
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Well...

393
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Look, Polly, my motivation
for doing this is twofold.

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,950
Firstly, you have a face
full of contradictions

395
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,950
and it's a challenge to capture
them in one expression.

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,270
That's the sales pitch.

397
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,950
The second motivation is that

398
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,950
I am planning to seduce you eventually

399
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,950
and please, God, sleep with you.

400
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,950
How will that please God?

401
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,540
Please me.

402
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,470
And stop.

403
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,950
And he didn't say what he wants?

404
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,950
When he was drunk he said, "Absolution."

405
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,340
Other than that, nothing.

406
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,950
Thank you for your time, Madam Boswell.

407
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,670
I heard someone shot your wife.

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,950
If you're looking for soldiers,
our men are all up at Appleby.

409
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I have no need of soldiers.
That's not why I came here.

410
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,950
What do you think?

411
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,950
You're selling?

412
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Giving.

413
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,540
- Why?
- Would you take it?

414
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,670
I'd take it.

415
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,950
- Would you wear it?
- Why would I not?

416
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That's my question.

417
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
My wife was wearing it
the night she was shot.

418
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,950
And...

419
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,950
I lie awake at night.

420
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
At four in the fucking morning
and I blame myself for her death.

421
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,600
I pushed some people too far.

422
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You want me to tell you
this jewel is cursed.

423
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,400
And then her death won't
all be your fault.

424
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,950
If I believed in priests,

425
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,950
I would confess and ask for forgiveness.

426
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But all I have is you, Madame Boswell.

427
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,740
I have a son.

428
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,950
I have a business.

429
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,340
I need to get some sleep.

430
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It is cursed.

431
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I feel its curse burning through my hand.

432
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,340
Bless you, Tommy Shelby.

433
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,950
You'll have good fortune from now on.

434
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,950
- The business is done?
- It's done.

435
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,950
Are you not going to give me one
fucking clue what that was about?

436
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,950
All religion is a foolish
answer to a foolish question.

437
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,950
What does that mean?

438
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,950
We will go and get Charlie from the camp.

439
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,950
He'll have learned
enough bad habits by now.

440
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,950
Then you can drop us at the train station.

441
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,950
And, Johnny boy, if I were you,
tonight I'd come back here tonight.

442
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Because later on...

443
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
.. there's going to be one
hell of a big fucking party.

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,950
Check the day and date on your ticket.

445
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,950
If you can't read, find someone who can.

446
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,950
Tickets for sailings other
than today's will be destroyed.

447
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,950
He has people all over the docks.

448
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,950
If it's going to happen,
it will happen now.

449
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,950
We'll be all right.

450
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,950
Why don't these Irish fill
in their papers in advance?

451
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,950
Think about Mott Street.

452
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The cafe. The smell of the coffee.

453
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Police! Help! Police!

454
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,950
Officer, there are some
men. They mean us harm.

455
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We are in danger here. Can
you escort us to the dock?

456
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,950
Please.

457
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Come with me...

458
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,100
Excuse me, brother, have you got a light?

459
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,950
Thank you, Officer, that will be all.

460
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,950
John Shelby.

461
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,950
Is that the lad I used to teach?

462
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,800
John Shelby, I smacked your arse.

463
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,600
Let him go.

464
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,950
Please... Please, let her go.

465
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,950
Arthur, how many times
I looked the other way

466
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,950
because of your sweet smile.

467
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I said let him go, he's coming with us.

468
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Not until I know my wife is safe.

469
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,950
She's safe.

470
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,950
We're not going to harm her.

471
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,950
Just get a move on.

472
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Look, we are disobeying Tommy's
orders just by talking to you.

473
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,950
Don't push it.

474
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,950
Please, come with us. Let him go.

475
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,950
Let him go, too. Say it's done.

476
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,950
Say he's in the harbour.

477
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,950
He can do you no harm from New York.

478
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,950
I can't do that, Mrs Changretta.

479
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,950
- I can't do that, sorry.
- OK. It's OK. Audrey, listen.

480
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,200
- No!
- Listen to me!

481
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,950
Go to the cafe in Mott Street.

482
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,950
Benito will take care of you.

483
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,950
Let him go, too! He's an old man!

484
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,950
I gave you sweets and cakes.

485
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,950
Mrs Changretta, there are rules.

486
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Your husband knows the rules.

487
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,400
- Come on, old man.
- No!

488
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,340

You said you spent the night taking stock.

653
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,800
Well, so did I.

654
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
This working at night will have to stop.

655
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:34,950
We're going to have a baby?

656
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,200
Yes.

657
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, it's great news.

658
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Right then, let's have a cup of tea.

659
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,470
Come on.

660
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,600
Come on. Let's have that tea.

661
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:19,950
Arthur, for fuck's sake. What is it?

662
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
No. We wait for Tommy.

663
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,950
I've got a stolen statue back
there with its dick hanging out

664
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,950
waiting to be melted down.

665
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,950
Tell us. Tell Tommy later...

666
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,950
Yeah. Look he's not here.
He's not here, I'm going.

667
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,950
- Hold your horses.
- Right, Curly. Come on.

668
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,950
- There he is.
- All right, what is it?

669
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,950
He's fucking given us all this shit.

670
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,600
- Come on. Come on.
- Right!

671
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,950
Arthur, you've got wire on the
fucking cork. Give it here.

672
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,950
Bastard!

673
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Right, gentlemen.

674
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,470
Linda...

675
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,950
.. is up the Swannee, I am
going to become a fucking dad.

676
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,470
Fuck off!

677
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,470
Yes, Guy.

678
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,800
Arthur, I knew you had it in you.

679
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:14,950
I knew he had it in him.

680
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,950
September, she reckons. Her
tits feel different already.

681
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,950
That's not the only thing that's
going to be different, Brother.

682
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,950
You're fucked now, man.

683
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,950
Fucked. Absolutely fucked.

684
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,940
No. Nothing's going to change, John.

685
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,870
Goodbye, Arthur.

686
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,950
I've a meeting I have to go to.

687
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah. Yeah. Course you do.

688
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah. You, erm...

689
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,270
You go to your meeting.

690
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,950
Congratulations.

691
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,940
I'm going to be a dad. Proud of you.

692
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,740
Your Highness, Mr Thomas Shelby.

693
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,950
Welcome, Mr Shelby, I
believe you've met everyone

694
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,950
apart from my wife.

695
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,740
Grand Duchess Izabella Petrovna.

696
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,070
Please, take a seat.

697
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,950
Before we begin, Mr Shelby,
we must offer you our sincere

698
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,870
condolences on your recent loss...

699
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,600
.. which some of us witnessed.

700
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,940
- Did you drive, Mr Shelby?
- Yes.

701
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,950
- They say you are an expert on cars.
- Yes, I am.

702
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,950
- I am curious. What was your
father's profession? - Well, he, erm...

703
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,950
He told fortunes and stole horses.

704
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,950
Often he would tell a man
that his horse would be stolen

705
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and they would marvel at
his powers when it was.

706
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,940
Before we eat, should we say grace?

707
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,950
For what we are about to receive

708
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,950
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

709
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,950
- Amen. - I'm not here to
eat, I'm here to do business.

710
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,950
What I have to say can be
said before the main course.

711
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,950
Then I will leave you all to your evening.

712
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,950
Grand Duchess, I must apologise for
the bad manners of my compatriot.

713
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,950
This is a report on the
mission's progress so far.

714
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I've made only one copy for security.

715
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,950
Who should I give it to?

716
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,950
My husband is in charge of this operation.

717
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,950
But since there will
no doubt be vodka later,

718
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,800
perhaps you should give
it to me for safekeeping.

719
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Speak, Mr Shelby, while we eat.

720
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,950
Five factory foremen on our
payroll have begun a campaign

721
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,950
of victimisation against communist
workers in five factories

722
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,950
across Birmingham.

723
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,950
Anger amongst the workers will
grow, but we will control it.

724
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,950
On the night of June 21st, a
general strike will be called

725
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,950
across the city.

726
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,950
Protests will develop into riots.

727
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,950
And all police who are not already
under our control will be busy.

728
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,950
- The city will be paralysed.
- So, how will you move the train?

729
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,950
We have two locomotive drivers
who have been allocated to drive

730
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,950
the midnight-goods train to London.

731
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,950
The armoured vehicles will
be waiting on flat beds.

732
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,950
- And the ammunition?
- The ammunition...

733
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I have to say that this
soup is exceptional.

734
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,950
Absolutely delicious.

735
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,950
Ammunition, incendiaries, will
already have been packed up

736
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,950
and crated for transport to Istanbul.

737
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,950
And how long to London?

738
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,950
The train won't reach London.

739
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,950
All the goods will be
unloaded at a coal yard

740
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,950
in St Albans and put onto
Shelby-Company trucks.

741
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,950
From there, they will go
directly to the Poplar Docks.

742
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,950
Your Highness, if you're
having difficulty understanding

743
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,950
his accent then I can go through
the plan with you at a later date.

744
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,950
If there is no ship waiting for my men,

745
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,950
all goods will be dumped into
the sea before first light.

746
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,950
And what happens when they discover
the armoured cars are missing?

747
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,950
During the rioting the Lanchester
Factory will be firebombed.

748
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,950
A scrap-metal dealer of my acquaintance

749
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,950
will declare that all the armoured
vehicles are in the wreckage

750
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,950
and should be written off as salvage.

751
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,950
No-one will know that they
are in your possession.

752
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We formulated this plan
when we met at Birmingham.

753
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm certain that nothing
has been overlooked.

754
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,950
This, erm...

755
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,950
is the amount of extra expense

756
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,950
I believe I will incur

757
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,140
for trucks and fuels.

758
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,800
I trust you will respond in kind.

759
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,340
But of course, Mr Shelby.

760
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,950
Before I go, I would like it known that

761
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I am unable to swallow food in
the same room as this priest.

762
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Enjoy your evening.

763
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,950
Tatiana? See Mr Shelby to his car.

764
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,200
Yes.

765
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,740
Walk with me.

766
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,950
The priest is passing
information about the robbery

767
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,950
to a Lloyd's underwriter called Monkland.

768
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,950
He, in turn, is passing
information to the Soviet Embassy.

769
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
If you want him dead, I
will kill him. No charge.

770
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Why would the priest pass
information to our enemies?

771
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,950
I'm being paid to act and
to observe, like a soldier.

772
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,950
The complexities are your business.

773
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Go and speak to Izabella.
I trust her to decide.

774
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,950
You are able to continue
your business dealings

775
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,340
even after what happened.

776
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,540
Perhaps you didn't love her.

777
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,600
She's here.

778
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,600
By my side.

779
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And she says, "Don't trust these people."

780
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Now, get me permission to kill the priest.
