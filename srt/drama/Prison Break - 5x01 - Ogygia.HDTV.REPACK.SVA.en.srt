1
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:03,803
- I didn't kill that man, Michael.
- The evidence says you did.

2
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:06,118
- I was set up.
- Swear to me.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,386
I swear to you, Michael.

4
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:10,723
Put down your weapon!

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,157
I find it incumbent that

6
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,726
you see the inside of a prison cell,

7
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,120
Mr. Scofield.

8
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:17,262
I'm looking for someone...
Guy named Lincoln Burrows.

9
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,341
Why you want to see
Burrows so bad anyhow?

10
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,499
'Cause he's my brother.

11
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,102
- I'm getting you out of here.
- That's impossible.

12
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,237
Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

13
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,173
You one mixed-up cracker,

14
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:29,208
you know that?

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,442
Are we in business?

16
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:33,012
Now... it's all about timing.

17
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:35,749
Scofield. You just
as pretty as advertised.

18
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:37,149
When do we get started?

19
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,385
- I need your help.
- You're asking me to break the law.

20
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:40,986
I'm asking you to make a mistake.

21
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:42,788
Forget to lock up.

22
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,357
Come on.

23
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,229
We did it, Mike.

24
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:53,699
However this plays out...

25
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,301
I have no regrets.

26
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:56,718
Michael!

27
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,080
Well, if you're watching
this, that means you're safe.

28
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,942
I wish I could be there with you,

29
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,211
but as you know now, I
wouldn't have had much time.

30
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:07,846
I made my choice.

31
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,315
I don't regret it.

32
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,317
We're free now.

33
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,446
We're free.

34
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,048
_

35
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:20,492
Freedom has a price.

36
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:28,233
I died seven years ago.

37
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,869
Left behind a brother...

38
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,572
a wife...

39
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:35,074
a son.

40
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:39,778
But the dead talk...

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,147
if you listen.

42
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:46,485
They're there with you...

43
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:48,887
reaching out...

44
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:51,924
trying to tell you something.

45
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:54,693
Because not all deaths are the same.

46
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,030
Some are real.

47
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:00,199
Some are a story.

48
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:03,915
Question is...

49
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:06,205
do you believe the story?

50
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,993
Was the man who died

51
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:12,311
who you thought he was?

52
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:15,080
The dead talk...

53
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:17,016
if you listen.

54
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,295
_

55
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:28,327
Still tight as...

56
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,295
scales on a snake.

57
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,098
Must have friends in
high places, Bagwell.

58
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,402
How a cesspool like you gets his
walking papers I'll never know.

59
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:41,440
This cesspool has been a model citizen.

60
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,290
Model citizen.

61
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:49,014
$71.31.

62
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:51,584
Laptop.

63
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,452
Pack of gum, three pieces.

64
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,287
How about you keep that?

65
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,289
Whatever you bring in, you bring out.

66
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,826
And one last piece of correspondence.

67
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:05,214
Something really wrong with
the world when I'm receiving

68
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,166
dozens of letters a
week for guys like you.

69
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:10,469
Nothing compared to the e-mails.

70
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,638
What is it with you
killers that put the satin

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,239
on women's panties anyhow?

72
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:30,155
Lackaday!

73
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,524
_

74
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,179
Burrows!

75
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,381
How about you step out and pay us

76
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,617
the hundred grand you owe us?

77
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,904
Take that as a no.

78
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,289
Lincoln Burrows...

79
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,858
says no.

80
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:08,994
Big tough guy...

81
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:11,196
who made it out of the neighborhood.

82
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:13,899
And look at you now...
Back to your roots,

83
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:15,667
the way you've always been.

84
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:19,338
A small-time crook who
can't pay his debts.

85
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,240
We're gonna find you, you know,

86
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:23,369
and we're gonna open you up.

87
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,892
Lincolny-linc.

88
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:42,795
All huffin' and puffin'.

89
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,773
Don't you look at me like I'm trash.

90
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:48,343
My house is in order. I'm
clear with the government,

91
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,211
the D.O.C. and my God.

92
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,180
Doesn't appear to be the same with you.

93
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:54,082
Look at you, all backslid.

94
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,551
You're supposed to be going
up in the world as you age,

95
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,386
or did you not get the memo?

96
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:01,356
You don't get off my deck,
I'm gonna crack your skull.

97
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,857
I wouldn't do that.

98
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,826
Seems fate has deigned

99
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:07,462
to join us at the hip once again,

100
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:10,398
despite our mutual contempt.

101
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,038
Have a look-see.

102
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:30,752
Where'd you get this?

103
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:32,988
Received it on release
earlier this week.

104
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,556
No return address.

105
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,226
If you're playing me, I'll kill you.

106
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,395
Take a look at that postmark on that.

107
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,665
I may be a sophisti-cat,

108
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,467
but not so sophisticated

109
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:47,635
as to forge something like that.

110
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,172
Besides...

111
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:54,609
what angle could I
possibly have in coming here

112
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:56,511
and telling you that it
looks like your brother

113
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:59,080
might just be alive?

114
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:34,720
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

115
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,259
It's impossible.

116
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:41,503
That's what I thought.

117
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,104
Why'd he send it to you?

118
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,106
Again, what I thought.

119
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:48,443
And then I gave the
words another look-see.

120
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,412
Maybe that's the answer.

121
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,783
"By your hand

122
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:56,785
you shall know the
glories of your Progeny

123
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:59,220
and our world will be

124
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:02,090
made right forevermore."

125
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,292
Hell if I know what that means.

126
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:06,728
But just like that
envelope's addressed to me,

127
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,106
those words are addressed
to me. Got to be!

128
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:09,898
Get out.

129
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,633
I'm trying to work with you here.

130
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,875
Is there any possible way
your brother could've survived?

131
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:18,106
My brother's dead.

132
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,508
Th-Then who sent this? And why?

133
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,578
Get out.

134
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:29,751
Least let me take my
rightful correspondence.

135
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,511
Oh, I made a copy, Burrows.

136
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:38,581
I knew you'd be the same
obstinate son of a beyotch

137
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,651
you always been, but I'd
hoped you'd seen the light.

138
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:42,764
But you are what you is
and you is what you are.

139
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:47,469
Still, I'm telling you...

140
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,438
fate has got us joined
at the hip somehow.

141
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:13,631
Where you in from?

142
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:14,662
Chicago.

143
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,498
Love Chicago.

144
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,634
- There you go.
- Thanks, man.

145
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,449
I didn't think

146
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,418
I was ever gonna see you again.

147
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,821
You didn't come to the wedding.

148
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:15,190
I mean, I figured I... I get it...

149
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:18,126
He hates me for marrying someone
other than his brother, but...

150
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:21,963
I haven't been in a good place, Sara.

151
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:25,338
My brain, it's... it's been a mess.

152
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,835
That's why I didn't show up.

153
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:30,405
And... I didn't want my
nephew to see me like that.

154
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:35,276
But now it's impossible to stay away.

155
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,279
Someone's got a sick sense of humor.

156
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:41,490
I know you want it to be true.

157
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,226
Losing a brother...

158
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,596
The massive hole that
leaves in your life.

159
00:09:45,598 --> 00:09:48,532
Like the same massive
hole losing a husband is.

160
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,072
Maybe.

161
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,640
Lincoln Burrows?

162
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:57,708
Jacob.

163
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,010
I haven't seen you in what,

164
00:09:59,012 --> 00:09:59,926
three, four years?

165
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,178
- Yeah.
- Uncle Lincoln!

166
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,381
Hey-hey! Buddy!

167
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:04,849
Oh...

168
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:06,517
so good to see you.

169
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,186
Did you bring me any sunken treasures?

170
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:11,822
Sunken treasures?

171
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,792
Oh. The dive shop.

172
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,793
- Panama.
- Yeah, I've been telling him stories

173
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:18,662
about being down there before
we came back to the States.

174
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:20,131
You've become kind of like

175
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:22,690
a mythological hero to
him. Let me get some beers.

176
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,236
- I want to know what you been up to. Okay.
- Sure, man. Yeah.

177
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:26,670
Come here.

178
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,506
I want you to go wash up, okay?

179
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,039
And then you can catch
up with your uncle.

180
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,847
He hasn't just mythologized you.

181
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,649
He mythologizes Michael, too.

182
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:41,552
It's like someone thinking
he was born to a god,

183
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,988
a god he's never met...

184
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,457
and who isn't here.

185
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:50,361
And who never will be again.

186
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:53,898
I can be pragmatic.

187
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,267
Michael was sick.

188
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,669
He was terminally sick,

189
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,172
and he died.

190
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:10,974
Sara...

191
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:13,084
how do you explain that?

192
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,090
It's Photoshop, Linc,

193
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,058
or something.

194
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,761
You got to consider the source.

195
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,297
This came from T-Bag.

196
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,334
I know you want it to be true.

197
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,234
I want it to be true.

198
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:42,947
How about a date tonight, model citizen?

199
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:47,051
A little well-earned love

200
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:49,086
after a long time at sea.

201
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,422
Jeh... boop.

202
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:53,491
Miss Dorothy.

203
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:55,960
E-mailing her undying love

204
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:59,263
from Aurora, Illinois.

205
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,595
I-eesh.

206
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,401
How about this one?

207
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:07,872
"Love Cannon Alonzo in Champaign."

208
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:10,808
Ooh. Hop on that just on the name alone.

209
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,449
- _
- What the hell?

210
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,020
Prosthetic research?

211
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:31,219
Smart girl, your Sara.

212
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:32,620
She's right.

213
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:35,523
I'm just desperate to see your face.

214
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:39,927
My life's been a mess
ever since you left.

215
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,430
Fallen back into my old ways.

216
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:45,400
Something you wouldn't tolerate.

217
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:47,802
But I got good in me, Michael.

218
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:50,104
I got good in me.

219
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:54,675
It'd just be nice if

220
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:58,079
you were here to... help me find it.

221
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,085
So... yeah.

222
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,609
"Ogygia."

223
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,455
Telling me where you are.

224
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,318
There's only one way to find out.

225
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:14,489
Theodore Bagwell.

226
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:17,992
And you're Dr. Whitcombe,

227
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:20,795
the man who invited me
to this mystery meeting

228
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:25,600
at 9:30 at night when the
rest of the building's closed.

229
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:27,602
I know what you've done.

230
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:30,571
That's why I don't want to be
seen associating with your sort.

231
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:32,740
Just want to know why I'm here, and...

232
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:35,176
if this has anything to do
with that special envelope

233
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,477
I received in the prison.

234
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:38,779
I know nothing about an envelope.

235
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:41,449
I can only tell you my work.

236
00:14:41,451 --> 00:14:44,051
Targeted muscle reinnervation.

237
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:47,088
Using the brain to manipulate prosthesis

238
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,956
as it were a natural limb.

239
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,892
But as with any cutting-edge work,

240
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:53,694
funding is not easy to find, and yet,

241
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:55,563
incredibly, I got the grant

242
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:58,143
in the form of a
considerable anonymous grant

243
00:14:58,145 --> 00:14:59,200
on one condition...

244
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:02,837
The first recipient of my procedure...

245
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,639
is you.

246
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,410
I can equip you

247
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:11,812
with a fully articulate prosthetic,

248
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:14,448
operationally indistinguishable
from a real hand.

249
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:19,020
All of this because
of an anonymous donor?

250
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:21,389
Someone seems to have
plans for both of us.

251
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,392
I've reserved an
operational lab for Monday

252
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:27,061
if you decide you are interested.

253
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:28,996
It's your hand, ultimately.

254
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,943
By your hand,

255
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:46,881
you shall know glories of your progeny.

256
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,483
What's that?

257
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:53,578
Nothing, Doc.

258
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:43,604
Come on, Michael.

259
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,539
You must have left me something.

260
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,307
Come on!

261
00:16:51,113 --> 00:16:52,913
Come on.

262
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,325
What's going on?

263
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,617
Oh, my God, what happened?

264
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,519
I'm not sure. I'm gonna call

265
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,856
the police.

266
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,007
Hello?

267
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,600
I dug up Michael's
grave. He's not in it.

268
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:03,759
He... What?

269
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,579
Sara, someone just tried to kill me.

270
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:06,847
They've been watching.
They've been watching,

271
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,728
- probably for...
- Who tried to kill you?

272
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,183
It started at the airport. I...

273
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,552
There was a... a red sedan.

274
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:13,854
It started following me.

275
00:19:13,856 --> 00:19:15,889
Then they... they... they swapped

276
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:17,257
down to a...

277
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,192
What was it? A pickup.

278
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:23,797
What color was the pickup?

279
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,249
Black.

280
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:26,767
Why?

281
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,068
Sara?

282
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,302
Jacob?

283
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,038
- Yeah.
- Behind one of

284
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,607
the pictures on the brick wall,
there's a hole, and there's

285
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,509
- a gun in it. I need you to get it.
- What?!

286
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:37,826
Right now! Right now!
Someone's coming for us!

287
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:41,201
A gun? What do you mean, a gun?

288
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:44,123
Mike?

289
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:46,565
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

290
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:47,721
I have an armed intruder in the house.

291
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:48,855
I need you to send people right away.

292
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,891
I don't have time. Please, come.

293
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:54,428
- Mike?
- Sara?

294
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,863
What's going on, Sara?

295
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,068
Hey.

296
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:02,102
- Mom?
- Come here.

297
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:12,827
Sara? Sara!

298
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:32,199
It's just me. There's
no one else in the house.

299
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,701
- What do you want?
- Get in the tub.

300
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:38,805
Who's here, Mom? What do they want?

301
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,577
I don't know, baby.

302
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,688
Okay, listen to me, if anyone comes

303
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,923
through that door, you don't move, okay?

304
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,559
I will put this through them,
and you will not be harmed.

305
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:02,729
You understand? Good boy.

306
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:34,194
Jacob?

307
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,663
Mom.

308
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:38,165
Go get every towel you can find.

309
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,633
Right now, right now.

310
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,815
Please, Jacob.

311
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:43,536
Okay. I think it got an artery.

312
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,372
Stay with me. I want you
to look at me, all right?

313
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:47,549
Don't close your eyes and
don't go to sleep, all right?

314
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:49,442
I'm gonna need you to stay with me.

315
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,043
I need an ambulance!

316
00:21:59,512 --> 00:22:02,012
- How is he?
- The shot almost completely

317
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:04,314
severed his femoral artery so
they're trying to stabilize him.

318
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:05,816
And him?

319
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:07,151
He's seven.

320
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,491
How you doing, Mikey?

321
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,026
Something's happening, isn't it?

322
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,394
First, you come

323
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,464
and that person came in our house.

324
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:24,568
It has something to do with
my real father, doesn't it?

325
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,036
Why do you say that?

326
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:28,872
Because I can see it in her face.

327
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,790
I'm gonna need to talk to your uncle.

328
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:37,414
I'm gonna be right over there

329
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,217
where you can see me. Okay?

330
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,323
What's going on?

331
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,991
We've awoken something.

332
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,893
Something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

333
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:51,328
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.

334
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,597
Or is he dead? Where is the body?

335
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,200
Then why did he leave?

336
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:59,770
If he's been out there
for all of these years,

337
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:02,139
why did he abandon his own son?

338
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,074
You know I'm right.

339
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,243
It wouldn't be like this if
something wasn't happening.

340
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:08,345
- It wouldn't, but...
- Let's fight back.

341
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,846
I don't know who we're fighting.

342
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:11,248
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

343
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,991
To Yemen? I have a son, Lincoln.

344
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,686
My husband's in the ER. Right?
Look, leaving them is exactly

345
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:18,628
the wrong thing for me to do right now.

346
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,621
Ma'am. He's ready to see you.

347
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:22,593
One second.

348
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,674
I'll do it.

349
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,676
I'll go to Yemen.

350
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:32,011
You don't know a damn thing about Yemen.

351
00:23:32,013 --> 00:23:34,113
I'll find someone who does.

352
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,584
See ya, Mikey.

353
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:45,191
_

354
00:23:56,404 --> 00:23:58,571
I envy you.

355
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:00,673
You changed your life around.

356
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:04,477
A man gets tired of
living a profligate life.

357
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:07,825
So I took up jihad. Real jihad,

358
00:24:07,828 --> 00:24:11,184
not that madness that
you see on the news.

359
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:12,924
War within.

360
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:17,590
The spiritual struggle
to clean up your act.

361
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:19,692
Finding and serving God.

362
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:24,697
That's good, man.

363
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,799
The world needs it, Linc.

364
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,601
I mean we're, uh, we're small here

365
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:31,137
but we do what we can

366
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,373
to help the peace efforts
in the Middle East.

367
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:37,043
Working on anti-radicalization
campaigns here at home.

368
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:40,046
Like I said, the struggle.

369
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:42,782
That's why I'm here.

370
00:24:42,784 --> 00:24:44,984
If I needed to get to Yemen,

371
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,686
that something you could help me with?

372
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,426
I thought he was dead.

373
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:56,797
So did everyone.

374
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:58,565
But Ogygia?

375
00:24:58,567 --> 00:24:59,999
I mean, that's for heavy hitters,

376
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,234
political prisoners.

377
00:25:01,236 --> 00:25:03,736
In Yemen, it doesn't come any worse.

378
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:06,406
I mean, do you know what it
would take to stage a death?

379
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:09,208
Not to mention keeping
a man who is not dead

380
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,144
under the radar for seven years.

381
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:13,479
Some very powerful players.

382
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:18,351
Sayed, what do you make
of this mosque right here?

383
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:25,265
Aksa Mosque. It's one of
the main ones in Sana'a.

384
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:27,001
- It's very distinct.
- Ah.

385
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,797
Sightlines seem pretty consistent

386
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,232
with what it would probably be
from the prison to the mosque.

387
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:36,536
Now, you ask me, that photo's legit.

388
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,440
Then that's the
building my brother's in.

389
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:43,476
Easiest way to find out is
to call the prison and ask.

390
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:46,846
Mafi Michael Scofield.

391
00:25:46,848 --> 00:25:48,781
Shukran.

392
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:53,688
There's no Michael Scofield.

393
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:55,321
Punch up an image from the Internet.

394
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:56,889
Michael Scofield.

395
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:58,124
Send it to the prison.

396
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,993
Maybe he's under a different name.

397
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,060
Listen, Linc,

398
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:03,295
I got to say something, man.

399
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:04,831
Man, you got to slow your roll.

400
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,132
Yemen is in a civil war.

401
00:26:06,134 --> 00:26:07,967
They're really close to collapse.

402
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:11,070
It's no place for a white
man with an American passport,

403
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,973
no command of Arabic, to
just show up on a whim.

404
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:16,690
And yet, apparently, my brother did.

405
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:19,011
Got a picture. Your
brother's intake photo

406
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:21,481
from the Fox River Penitentiary.

407
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:27,353
Here's his DMV photo

408
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:30,022
and here's a photo from
his old workplace Web site.

409
00:26:30,025 --> 00:26:31,591
It's not him.

410
00:26:31,594 --> 00:26:33,727
None of them are.

411
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:38,965
Someone's erasing him from history.

412
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:45,368
- Lincoln, where are you going?
- Hotel, to grab my stuff,

413
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,969
- then the airport.
- Hey, listen.

414
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,571
You're not going to Yemen.

415
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,173
- Stop me.
- You won't make it three days.

416
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,109
We need to go through
the proper channels.

417
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,510
The proper channels?

418
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,846
Someone's erasing his existence.

419
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,881
Who does that? Who has that ability?

420
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,282
I'm telling you, Michael's caught

421
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,684
in the middle of something big.

422
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,452
What if he's not caught in the middle?

423
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,287
What are you saying?

424
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:07,323
Michael has never been anyone's sucker.

425
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,259
He's always been in control. Always.

426
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,994
You saying he faked his own death?

427
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,763
I'm saying you need to look

428
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,131
at all of the possibilities

429
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,066
before you walk into a war zone.

430
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,047
I wasn't sure you'd come.

431
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,584
Sometimes a man has
to surrender to fate.

432
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:39,121
See what it has in store for him.

433
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,994
We'll need to put you under.

434
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,697
No, no, no. I don't do
general anesthetic, compadre.

435
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,166
It's mandatory for a
procedure like this.

436
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,534
You'll forgive me

437
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,536
if I have a problem lying unconscious

438
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,238
before a man with sharp
items at his disposal.

439
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
It cannot be done without
a general anesthetic.

440
00:27:58,242 --> 00:27:59,942
Oh, I've done it before, friend.

441
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,310
And look what it got you.

442
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,515
You do anything untoward to
me while I'm under and I'll...

443
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,284
You are the last man I'd run afoul of.

444
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,786
- Okay?
- Mm.

445
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:14,824
Oh, fate, you mysterious bitch.

446
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,593
Why you doing this to me?

447
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,235
Hi. Dry cleaning. Nice jacket.

448
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,636
Thank you, sir.

449
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:29,071
Have a good day.

450
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:55,132
What the hell was that for?

451
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:58,100
Sucre, what the hell are you doing here?

452
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:01,036
C-Note told me what's going on.

453
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:02,838
He tell you to talk me out of it?

454
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,275
No. I'm coming with you.

455
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,507
You're not coming.

456
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,378
Michael's my best friend. If he's alive,

457
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,813
if he's in trouble, I want to help.

458
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,148
Don't you have a job or something?

459
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,383
Yeah, on a tramp. Not great work,

460
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,818
but hey, I'm an ex-con, right?

461
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,186
Tramp?

462
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,521
Yeah, I've been riding her for a while.

463
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,855
What are you, a pimp?

464
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,757
What? No. No, no, no.

465
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,826
A tramp is a freelance cargo ship.

466
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,141
We go to Hong Kong, Spain, Buenos Aires,

467
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,445
basically wherever the boss tells us.

468
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:28,879
Corrupt son of a bitch.

469
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:30,132
Well, I suggest you
get back on that tramp,

470
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,516
- 'cause you're not coming.
- I'm telling you,

471
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:34,062
- I can help!
- Listen to me, this is the Middle East.

472
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,172
Lots has changed. I'm an
international hitter now.

473
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,506
A raconteur.

474
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,508
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

475
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,377
Don't speak to me like I don't
know French, I know French.

476
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,578
And I'm brown, that's something.

477
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,679
I'll fit in better over there

478
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,548
than you will, snowflake.

479
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,183
I decided I was wrong when I said

480
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,084
you would be dead inside of three days.

481
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:52,755
You go over there, you'll
be dead inside of one.

482
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,057
But with me, we have
people at the mosque

483
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,525
that have worked over there,

484
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:57,927
people with legal connections

485
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,562
that can get us inside of that prison.

486
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,631
Hold on. You're not
saying he gets to go.

487
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,133
He's not any browner than I am.

488
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,435
_

489
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,469
Huh?

490
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,171
No?

491
00:30:09,173 --> 00:30:11,207
I managed to pick up a little Arabic

492
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,108
while I was serving in Iraq.

493
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,244
This is the final boarding
call for Flight 39

494
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,746
to JFK, connecting to Yemen.
This is the final boarding...

495
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,448
Listen, man.

496
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,330
There's gonna be a time
when I'm gonna need you.

497
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:28,958
You better find him.

498
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,826
And you better call me when you do.

499
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,695
I will.

500
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,801
You really got contacts?

501
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,737
Contacts with contacts.

502
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,776
Could just follow 'em into the bathroom,

503
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:50,512
ragdoll him in one of stalls
and be done with it.

504
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:53,015
Then we'd have a body to deal with.

505
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,750
And we want him utterly

506
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:58,687
and irrevocably gone from this world.

507
00:30:58,688 --> 00:31:02,357
Where no amount of digging
will bring him back.

508
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:09,793
_

509
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:16,872
We're the only ones
coming into the place.

510
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,674
Yeah, the country's falling apart.

511
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,019
Everyone wants out.

512
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:21,377
Who's that contact again?

513
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,611
A woman named Sheba.

514
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:23,589
Our handler.

515
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,347
She helps us track
Americans that come in

516
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:26,648
to fight the jihad fight.

517
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:35,223
Welcome to the civil war.

518
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,527
Mr. Franklin,

519
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,329
Ms. Sheba sent me to collect you.

520
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,463
As-salaam alaikum.

521
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:42,665
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

522
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,434
Uh, this way, gentlemen. Follow me.

523
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:54,784
_

524
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,916
Yemen very dangerous.

525
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:03,786
You never know who's
enemies, who's friends.

526
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:07,389
Everyone scratching each other's backs.

527
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,491
ISIL is starting to attack the city.

528
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:12,661
They have been building up
out in the desert for months.

529
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,381
If they... take the city,

530
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:16,318
they will kill all the secularists,

531
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:18,120
install Sharia law.

532
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:19,655
Huh. You know.

533
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:21,490
You don't seem worried.

534
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:25,595
I scratch backs, too, my friend.

535
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,606
No, no, no, no. This isn't right.

536
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,274
Hey, wait a minute,

537
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:39,609
this-this isn't the address.

538
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:41,644
- I get cigarettes.
- No, no, you don't.

539
00:32:41,646 --> 00:32:43,479
You take us straight to
the address right now!

540
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:44,513
I-I get cigarettes.

541
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:47,149
Linc, this is a setup.

542
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:48,584
Grab your bag now.

543
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:14,469
_

544
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,438
_

545
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:52,440
Greetings from the U.S.
prison system, bitches.

546
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:58,480
What is it?

547
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,004
Someone set us up.

548
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:03,385
Come quickly.

549
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:05,286
Or we'll all be dead!

550
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:07,122
Go, go. She's one of us.

551
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:09,375
Come on, grab your
bag. Come on, let's go!

552
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:10,633
How did you find us?

553
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:12,095
A contact at the airport saw you

554
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:14,097
get into the wrong taxi.

555
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,032
You're lucky I found you.

556
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:19,168
This is very radicalized neighborhood.

557
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,143
Whoever set you up couldn't
have set you up in a worse way.

558
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:29,846
Throw your phones out the window.

559
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,348
I don't want anyone tracking us.

560
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:36,226
Do it!

561
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,357
Sheba, this is Lincoln.

562
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,060
Lincoln... Sheba.

563
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:11,254
You've been made whole, Mr. Bagwell.

564
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:14,023
You're free to go.

565
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:20,363
Not till you tell me
what you've put in me.

566
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:22,732
You feel an unease, do you?

567
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:26,202
I'd venture that's what's
always been in you since birth.

568
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:29,355
Your soul. I just put
the hardware into you.

569
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:31,658
You're the thing that runs it.

570
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:35,044
- Who's behind...
- Nobody!

571
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:36,646
Nobody's behind this.

572
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,649
What does that mean?

573
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:42,018
I got a single word. That's it.

574
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,254
Just... my benefactors ID'd
themselves by a single word.

575
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:46,789
Outis.

576
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:48,991
I looked it up.

577
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:52,128
It's Greek for "nobody."

578
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,335
That's who your
benefactor is, Mr. Bagwell.

579
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,405
Nobody.

580
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:33,460
_

581
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,741
Okay.

582
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:39,976
Who's this?

583
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:43,413
Omar has connections in Ogygia Prison.

584
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:45,047
He says he can arrange a visit.

585
00:36:45,049 --> 00:36:46,282
That mean Michael's in there?

586
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:47,550
There's apparently an American

587
00:36:47,552 --> 00:36:48,518
in there matching

588
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,685
your brother's description.

589
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,320
There's just one thing.

590
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:55,491
Arranging such a visit
is hard. Very difficult.

591
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:57,460
- Comes at a price.
- Money's not a problem.

592
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:59,061
Not money.

593
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,743
Your passport.

594
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:02,445
My passport?

595
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:03,399
What, did...

596
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:06,202
- you want to hold it?
- No. Straight trade.

597
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:08,037
Visit for your passport.

598
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,040
Uh, U.S. passport is like gold here.

599
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:13,743
A few changes, and it can
be a ticket to freedom.

600
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:15,411
Don't do it, Linc.

601
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:16,813
Mm-mm.

602
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,285
I know it is not ideal, but...

603
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:25,188
ideals as of right now
are history in Yemen.

604
00:37:26,175 --> 00:37:28,776
You cannot get out of the country

605
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,560
without a passport.

606
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:32,495
Don't do it.

607
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:41,471
Inshallah...

608
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:43,511
you will see your brother soon.

609
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:54,750
I told myself I'd never
step foot in another prison.

610
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:57,487
As long as we walk out of it.

611
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,333
_

612
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,701
There's no Michael Scofield.

613
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:48,237
It was a scam to get my passport.

614
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,373
Omar is one of my
most trusted operators.

615
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,174
Listen, lady. Trust doesn't seem to mean

616
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:53,442
a whole lot in this country.

617
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:54,610
Give me a second, okay?

618
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,512
I'll figure out a way
to work this thing out.

619
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,147
An image.

620
00:38:58,149 --> 00:38:59,638
Right? The one that they sent to you?

621
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:01,140
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Do you have it?

622
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:05,621
Look.

623
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:07,127
There.

624
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,092
Kaniel Outis.

625
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:12,995
Yes, Kaniel Outis. Is he here?

626
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:23,506
He says, yes, the man
in the picture is here

627
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:25,775
and we can see him, but only
'cause we're dealing with Sheba.

628
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:27,076
Why did you say that name?

629
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:28,811
Because of my brother's jacket.

630
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,147
Thought you were on the
right side of God on this.

631
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:33,115
Sheba. No, hey, hey. Sheba...

632
00:39:36,955 --> 00:39:38,888
Hey. Kaniel Outis

633
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,423
is a big-time terrorist.

634
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:41,924
They got him in here for murder.

635
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:43,225
He's been working with ISIL

636
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:44,660
trying to take down the government.

637
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:46,262
Come on, C.

638
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,464
You know that's not Michael.

639
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:50,866
Well, whoever he is...

640
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,170
...we're about to meet him.

641
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,640
What was my father like?

642
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,777
My real father.

643
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,417
Michael Scofield...

644
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,221
...was like a storm.

645
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:14,890
Grab the camera.

646
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,659
I want to prove he's alive.

647
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:23,065
He was beautiful

648
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:26,402
and frightening

649
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,638
and mysterious.

650
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:32,375
And he would show up in your life

651
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:34,443
out of the clear blue sky

652
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:39,248
and then he would
disappear just as quickly.

653
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,024
But storms, they can come back.

654
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:43,579
Can't they?

655
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,555
Mm-hmm.

656
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:53,462
Question is, if they come back,

657
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:56,799
is it the same storm,

658
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,201
or has something changed?

659
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:05,541
Michael.

660
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,097
New tats.

661
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,853
What do you mean, new?

662
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:19,722
We're gonna get you out of here.

663
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:24,427
My name isn't Michael.

664
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:26,650
And I don't know who you are.

665
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,038
Sorry.

666
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,806

667
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,608
Michael.

668
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,426
Michael.

669
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,128
Michael, talk to me. Michael...

670
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,730
Mike.

671
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:02,732
Mike! What are you doing, damn it?!
