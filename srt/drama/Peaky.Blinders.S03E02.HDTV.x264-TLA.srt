00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,050
- Thomas Michael Shelby
- Today is my wedding day

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,950
[Go on,] take the photograph!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,550
- 'The Russians have made contact.
- On your wedding night?'

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,950
Whoever it is up there,
he gave the wrong name.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,950
Can you do it? Can you kill?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,950
You know why he didn't come,
don't you? My bloody man.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,950
'There was a fire at his restaurant.'

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,950
No fraternising with the foreigners.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,950
He's a cavalry officer.
In March we'll be engaged.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,950
'But you want to try things first.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,350
'Ruben Oliver. Portrait artist.'

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,650
You have my card.

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,950
What was in your heart was beautiful.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,950
Just get this business done and
get away from things like this.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,950
Promise me.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I promise I will make us safe.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,540
Your brothers came to my house.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They said the Peaky Blinders
had business with me.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
You're not afraid of me?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,950
So, what is it you want
from a simple working man?

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,270
Fear.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,470
Poor Mr Nutley drank too much.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,950
He went for a piss on the train tracks

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,950
that run behind the factory.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,540
Train came.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,950
They found his body in
Saltley broken into bits.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I know what you do. Tell me what you want.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,950
There.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,950
The lot, complete warehouse.
Bays four, five and six.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,950
You have the keys?

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,070
Yes, I have the keys.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,940
What's in bay four?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,950
Completed type 40s and type 21s
waiting for the paint shop.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,950
Bay five?

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,950
Paint shop and parts.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,950
Uh-uh.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,950
So, it's bay six.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
What is?

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Give me the keys to bay six.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,950
It's just old stock in storage.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Give me the keys to bay six.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
For your trouble.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,270
Give it to your charity...

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm only doing this for
the safety of my family.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,950
So, will it be just boys in
your charitable institution

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or girls, as well?

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Both.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,950
You must divide them.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,950
You know how the little creatures can get.

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,950
Where are your people? You
said they'd be here by five.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,950
They're a law unto themselves.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,950
You can never quite grasp who they are.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,140
Like gripping wet soap.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,070
I've done my research.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,950
Perhaps you know them as
the, er... Economic League.

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,950
Only once did I get a letter from
them headed the Vigilance Committee.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,950
Which tips the hand a little.

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,950
Nope.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,670
The name I've heard is Section D.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,950
That's what Special Branch calls them.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Businessmen, MPs, army officers.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, it will be fun to bring
such men to a Gypsy scrapyard.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,950
You asked for privacy.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Since the election, the Government
has decided that we are the enemy.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When all we're trying to do is
save the country from revolution.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,470
Are you political, Mr Shelby?

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,950
Because these odd fellows believe
that the time is coming soon

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,670
when everyone must choose a side.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,950
Are your people coming,
or are they not coming?

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,950
Mr Shelby, you will learn that
these men are far too grand

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,470
for the clock to govern them.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,950
You'll get used to meeting in
the small hours of the morning.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,940
They're like monks.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,950
So, when is your charitable
institute opening?

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,940
When I fucking say.

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,950
Well, I'll stop by from time to time.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hear confession from the little creatures.

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,950
You will meet Mr Patrick Jarvis, MP.

89
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,950
He'll probably want to become a trustee.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,950
It's just his thing, to drop by in
the evenings after a few drinks.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,950
We'll make it a formal arrangement

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
as part of the... bigger deal between us.

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
I will have an office there.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
My God. Some devil gets
into you, doesn't it, boy?

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,950
Mr Shelby, if I want to play the squire

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,950
in your place of false
charity then I will.

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,950
Ambition for respectability
doesn't make you a saint.

98
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Am I wrong?

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Oh, Lord. That's six, is it?

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,950
Well, I will wish you a good day.

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,950
The fuck are you going?

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,950
Did I not make it clear?

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,950
They said if they weren't
here by morning prayers

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,950
then the meeting has been cancelled.

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Perhaps Mr Jarvis has been held
up at the House of Commons.

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,950
Perhaps Admiral Hall's been
held up at the House of Lords.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,950
Am I impressing you?

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,950
Or perhaps they've decided they
don't care for doing business

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,950
with Gypsies in scrap-metal yards.

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,950
Which would be a poorer outcome for you.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You give them a message from me, priest.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,950
You tell them I've been to the factories

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and the armoured vehicles
are in good condition.

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,470
How many?

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,950
27.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,200
And the foreman is ours.

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,950
This is someone you will meet,

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,950
today, at the Ritz.

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,950
I have meetings today.

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,950
You have one meeting.

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This one. In London.

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,740
So you'd best catch the milk train.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,950
Cold.

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,950
My apologies, sir.

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,950
And how many times I
asked you to tell them

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,950
about sending us the servants' crockery?

127
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,950
I have no control over the
choice of service, sir.

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,950
Hmm. And what about the yesterday
egg? And last year's fish?

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,950
And last century's tea
leaves in a cracked pot?

130
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,950
Sir, I have a list of
today's social engagements

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,950
- if you'd like to hear them.
- Oh, are we in a rush today?

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,950
I have duties at the main house, sir.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Luncheon at the Ritz with
Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich.

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,950
Cancelled.

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,950
What reason?

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,270
He says he's unwell, sir.

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,950
You're due to have tea at three
with Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,540
and Lady Mary Lewington, sir...

139
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,950
Mm. Good.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,950
I miss out on the bore
and meet the beauty.

141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,950
However, in the absence of the Duke,

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the Prince and the Lady
too have cancelled,

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,870
Other than that your day is your own.

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,950
You do have one business appointment

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,950
to discuss automobiles.

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
With a Mr Thomas Shelby, sir.

147
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You asked for a meeting out in the open.

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,870
Fresh air and the fine aroma of shit.

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,950
"Neutral ground," you said.

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,950
This is hardly neutral ground.

151
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,950
Well, it's what you've got.

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,950
So, por favivo, sit down.

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,950
- Where is Thomas?
- He got called away.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,950
- He said he'd be here.
- Yeah, he's busy.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I just told you he got
called away. What do you want?

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,950
There has been a peace
between the Peaky Blinders

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,950
and the Changretta family
for two years now...

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,950
Do you want some tea or not?

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,950
Here, Finn, pour the Italians
some English tea. Go on.

160
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,270
We don't want fucking tea!

161
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,950
We want an explanation.

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,950
Well, I'll have fucking tea.

163
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,950
Explanation for what?

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,950
The Little Venice restaurant
in Forge Street was burnt down.

165
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,950
No, no, couldn't have been
us. We was at a wedding.

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,950
You burnt it down to stop my
son being at that same wedding.

167
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,140
Yeah, he wasn't missed.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,950
You are such big boys now.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,950
Where once you borrowed clothes
from us to look like men.

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
How's the tea, Arthur? Is it...?

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,470
It's cold.

172
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,950
Please tell Tommy that we pay
him whatever he asks us to pay.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,950
Please tell Tommy that we pay
him whatever he asks us to pay.

174
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,950
We stay out of the city
and off the tracks.

175
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,950
But you tell him from me

176
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,950
that my son will walk with
any woman in this city.

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,950
Any woman he chooses.

178
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,950
Even if that woman works for
the Emperor, Thomas Shelby.

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
My son is in love...

180
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,950
Sorry.

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,950
Do excuse me.

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,470
Carry on.

183
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,950
And if he wishes,

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,950
he will walk with the woman he loves.

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,140
OK.

186
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,950
Y'know...

187
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,950
It'd be hard for your son to walk anywhere

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
with a bullet in each knee, wouldn't it?

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,470
Too much.

190
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,470
You said too much, my friend.

191
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Sabini says, "Suck and
swallow." But no. Too much.

192
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I spit.

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, fucking... Bit strong.

194
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,950
Fucking hell.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,950
Isiah. Put two extra men
on our pubs in Nechells.

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,950
What you talking about, Arthur?

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,950
We're not scared of
fucking eyeties any more.

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't tell Tommy about the chair
and clean this fucking shit up.

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,950
We're not scared of fucking wops!

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,950
All right, John.

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,340
Arthur!

202
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,540
Hello, Ada.

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,950
Tommy Shelby in a library.

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,950
I'm here to borrow a book
about the Russian Revolution.

205
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
Shh!

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,950
Have you got a new wharf
at Maida Vale now?

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,950
I've got a new wharf everywhere now.

208
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,950
I sometimes see our trucks driving past.

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
"Our" trucks?

210
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,670
Shelby trucks.

211
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,950
Why the interest?

212
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,950
I just want to broaden my mind.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,950
Well, this is a list of
the bastards who ran away.

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,950
And this is written from the point
of view of the people's struggle.

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,340
Uh-huh.

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,950
There was a Russian at your wedding.

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He wouldn't tell me how
come he got invited.

218
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,950
Well, sometimes exiled Russian aristocrats

219
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,950
get invited to social occasions
to add a bit of class.

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,950
Is that why he was there?

221
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,950
Why do you want to know?

222
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,950
He was nice. Maybe I'd
like to see him again.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,950
Would that be possible?

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,950
No. That would not be possible.

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,400
What business do you have
with Russians, Tommy?

226
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,950
Can I rip this page out?

227
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,950
No, you cannot rip that page
out. Property of the people.

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,950
Tommy, when Arthur took the Russian
away he had his killing pistol

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,950
under his jacket. And then
Johnny lit a fire in the woods.

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You want all the details
because you're bored, Ada.

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,950
You used to chase rats
with a revolver, Ada.

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,950
Shh! For fuck's sake.

233
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I might just have a job for you after all.

234
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,950
Did we run Kempton yesterday, or not?

235
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,950
Danny Lee got drunk.

236
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,950
Instead of injecting the
horses with the cocaine,

237
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,950
he decided to share it with his cousins.

238
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,950
Jesus Christ.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,950
He's your brother-in-law.

240
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,950
Tell Esme to speak to him about it.

241
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,140
Look. Before I start...

242
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
.. I don't want you to
do anything about this.

243
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,540
About what?

244
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,950
Vicente Changretta's son.

245
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,950
The one Lizzie was stepping out with.

246
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,950
What, Angel?

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,950
He's no bigger than two
pence worth of change.

248
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,950
He heard you threatened him
directly to shoot him in the knees.

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,950
And now he's going around Nechells

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,950
telling everyone he's going to kill you.

251
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,950
This is Lizzie's fault to start with,

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,950
Tommy's for leaving it up to you.

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,950
What are you talking about?

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,950
We run London.

255
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,950
We run the North, run the
whole fucking country.

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,950
What do we care about some
fucking Nechells Green eyeties?

257
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,950
We don't need to be getting involved
in all these little piss pots.

258
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,950
What does Arthur say?

259
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,950
That's why I'm here...

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,950
and not him.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,950
If he said it, there'd be a fight.

262
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,950
He says...

263
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,470
apologise.

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,950
He fucking said what?

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,950
We own the city.

266
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,950
But we don't need to rub
everybody's noses in it.

267
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,950
If the old man decides to make a stand,

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
- he might get Sabini feeling
sentimental... - Sabini's done.

269
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,950
They're all done.

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And they all pay up.

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But we don't... want... rebellions.

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,950
What does, erm... What does Tommy say?

273
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,950
Tommy's busy. He left me in charge.

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
What... What do you say?

275
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,950
Compromise.

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,140
Mm.

277
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,950
I've asked Lizzie to do it for you.

278
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,950
She's going to meet him,
break up with him for good.

279
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,950
Apologise for any inconvenience.
Say it was all her fault.

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,950
Fuck's sake!

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,950
You know what all this is?

282
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,950
This is Arthur's fucking missus.

283
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,950
Turn the other fucking cheek.

284
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,950
We'll be handing out Bibles
in the fucking Bull Ring

285
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,950
- with her cousins...
- John, you don't have to do anything.

286
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,950
- Ah, it's done.
- Lizzie will do it for you.

287
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,950
Then it'll all calm down
and nobody will lose face.

288
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,950
I'll take his fucking
face, how about that?

289
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,070
John, do nothing. Oh!

290
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,950
I believe you have a reservation

291
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,200
for a private room in
the name of Mr Romanov.

292
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,950
You work for Mr Romanov?

293
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,950
- Yes. - For his
household or his office?

294
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,950
Is there a problem?

295
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,950
I'm afraid without the presence
of the Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich

296
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,950
or Lady Lewington we shall have
to ask for payment in advance.

297
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,950
Can I ask why?

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,950
Already Mr Romanov has four
outstanding bills with us.

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,950
One for accommodation
and three for dining.

300
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,950
And two banquets which we wrote off.

301
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,950
We've been asked to be understanding
of our Russian friends

302
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,950
by His Majesty, but it
has been some time now.

303
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,270
And...

304
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,950
- May I ask your name, sir?
- Shelby. Thomas Shelby.

305
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,950
And in the future I'll be
dining here quite a bit.

306
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,950
- Then I shall put you on our
special list. - You do that.

307
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,950
Here is a menu.

308
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,950
I recommend the teal and the pork.

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,950
Although your guest, I'm
sure, will order the caviar.

310
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,950
Myself, my wife and my
niece travelled by train,

311
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,950
then coach, then on foot through
the Villa Ai-Todor in Crimea.

312
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,950
On that journey I lost a toe.

313
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,950
I don't know. I woke up one
morning and it was gone.

314
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,950
All of a sudden I saw a
dog and it was eating it.

315
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,950
They said the British
had taken pity on us.

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,950
And we were taken aboard HMS Marlborough.

317
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,950
I immediately kissed the steel
deck. My lips froze to it.

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And then of course, I thanked
God and your King for saving us.

319
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,950
Though since then he has done
nothing but humiliate me...

320
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,950
Who? God or the King?

321
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,270
Sometimes both, Mr Shelby.

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Mm. So, you met my niece already.

323
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Tatiana.

324
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,670
Are you in love with her yet? Hm?

325
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,950
You would be wise not to
love Russian woman, you know.

326
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,950
Better not speak of Russian women.

327
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,950
That's the worst thing about being here.

328
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,950
Russian women, they know how to hold it

329
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,950
and most important they know
exactly when to let it go.

330
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Your cock, I mean.

331
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
English women, they do not
know so much, you know?

332
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,270
Did he die well, the spy?

333
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,140
He begged for his life.

334
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,740
I heard you had your brother do it.

335
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So, you trust your family. Like me.

336
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like us, Mr Shelby.

337
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's talk about trust, then, shall we?

338
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,950
You are not a direct
relation to the Romanovs.

339
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,870
You are Georgian.

340
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,950
And the palace where you
live in Hampton Court

341
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,950
is in fact a grace-and-favour house

342
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,950
donated to you rent-free
by the British Crown.

343
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,950
The maitre d' here tells me
that you are in some debt.

344
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,950
Both here and other places, I imagine.

345
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
See, I've been given ten...
but I've been promised 40.

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,950
Already I've had to have a man killed.

347
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,870
That sort of work does not come cheap.

348
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,870
Do you understand?

349
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,870
Let me tell you something, Mr Shelby.

350
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,950
Before we boarded the ship,

351
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,950
my niece sewed 16 diamonds
into her velvet dress.

352
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,950
And also she had two sapphires
in her intimate places.

353
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
My wife managed two
sapphires and five diamonds.

354
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is already for the
killing of the spy.

355
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,800
And down payment on future services.

356
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,950
Now tell me, where do you keep
these things? In a... bank?

357
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,950
How could we plead poverty
around London society

358
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,400
if we used banks, Mr Shelby?

359
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,950
Well, you should know
Hatton Gardens is not safe.

360
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,870
That is why we have our own treasury.

361
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Very well. I shall have my
people check its veracity...

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,950
Before the revolution began,
we were soft and weak.

363
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
We made compromise.

364
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But let me tell you.

365
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,950
We will never be soft and weak again.

366
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,870
Do you understand?

367
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Good day, Mr Shelby.

368
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,200
This way, Mr Changretta.

369
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,140
Just there, sir. There.

370
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,950
I hear you want to kill me.

371
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Get fucking up! Stay away from Lizzie.

372
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
By order of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

373
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,950
Going to introduce me, Michael?

374
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This is Charlotte Murray.
Her father makes cars.

375
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I really enjoyed your wedding, Mr Shelby.

376
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,950
Polly said you should call
her. There's been some trouble.

377
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,670
What trouble?

378
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm guessing the stuff she
doesn't like to tell me about.

379
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,870
Nice to meet you.

380
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
All right, Finn, thanks
for coming. Fuck off.

381
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,940
Finn, you can stay.

382
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,270
Sit down, John. Sit down.

383
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,540
John, you cut Angel Changretta.

384
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,950
Even though Arthur told you to apologise.

385
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,950
Mm-hm.

386
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,950
- Polly told you to compromise.
- Mm-hm.

387
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You chose not to listen to Mr
Apologise or Mrs Compromise.

388
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,950
And now I've got an Italian
walking around my back yard

389
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
saying he's going to kill my brother.

390
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So, what do we do, John? Do we
apologise, or do we compromise?

391
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,300
Oh, it was just something
John said as a joke.

392
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,950
Yeah, but he's your
brother as well, Arthur.

393
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,950
Yeah.

394
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,950
And I didn't want to start
a war over something

395
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,470
John said without meaning it.

396
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So, should he apologise in
Italian... or in English?

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,950
Or should we ask them which
fucking language they'd prefer?

398
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,670
I'm not clear.

399
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,950
You said while this business was going
on in London you wanted peace at home.

400
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,950
And the only way to guarantee peace

401
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,950
is by making the prospect
of war seem hopeless.

402
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,950
If you apologise once, you do
it again and again and again.

403
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,950
Like taking bricks out of the
wall of your fucking house.

404
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,950
- Do you want to bring the
house down, Arthur? - Ah...

405
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,950
If you're soft on rebellion, it'll grow.

406
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,950
Bloody "soft on rebellion".

407
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,950
You did the right thing, John.

408
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,950
Now we go on the offensive.

409
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,950
We take two of the Changretta pubs.
We take 'em tonight. That's it.

410
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,950
Oh, right. For Christ's sake, why?

411
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,950
- Hey?! - Why? - Why?
Because we fucking can.

412
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,950
Because we fucking can,
and if we can, we do.

413
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And if we lift our heel off their
necks now, they'll just come at us.

414
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Remember, these are the bastards
that wanted Danny Whizz-Bang dead.

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,950
You're getting soft, brother.

416
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,950
Soft and weak.

417
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,540
Save the Bible for Sundays, eh?

418
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,950
Finn, I need to get to Hockley, then home.

419
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,070
It's been a long day.

420
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,950
You take the Wrexham,
you take the Five Bells.

421
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,950
You get them signed over
to us in the morning.

422
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You make sure the coppers stay away.

423
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,950
Don't use the fucking phones, all right?

424
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,270
There's someone listening.

425
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,470
Well done.

426
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,950
Not hungry, Mrs Shelby?

427
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,950
Hungry? Oh, no. Sorry, Mary.

428
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,070
You'll ruin your eyes.

429
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,270
Tommy.

430
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,950
Hello.

431
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,270
Hello.

432
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,470
Sit down.

433
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,140
- Guess.
- Guess what?

434
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,950
- He said yes.
- Who?

435
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,950
The leader of Birmingham City Council

436
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,950
is going to attend the dinner.

437
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,950
- Everyone has said
yes. - Ah.. - Everyone.

438
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,950
I keep having to change the catering.

439
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,950
And my writing hand is almost falling off.

440
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,950
What are you writing for?
I bought you a typewriter.

441
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,950
You don't write letters of a
social occasion on a typewriter.

442
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh. Forgive me.

443
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,950
I have the drawings of
what they plan to do

444
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,950
with the grounds of the house.

445
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,950
- There'll be an area for the
children to play. Look. - Mm-hm.

446
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,950
And the Birmingham Charity
Commission have agreed to set aside

447
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,950
the three rotten floorboards upstairs

448
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and grant us a licence within the month.

449
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,950
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, I am. I am.

450
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,800
Do you think I am becoming obsessed?

451
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Yes.

452
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,950
Should I ask you how your
day was, like a good wife?

453
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,140
No.

454
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,950
I'm guessing that means your day
was not as successful as mine.

455
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Well, depends on how you measure success.

456
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
See, personally,

457
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,950
I measure it in sapphires.

458
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,950
Oh...

459
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
- Sapphires?
- Mmm.

460
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,800
Close your eyes.

461
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,870
(Close your eyes.)

462
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,470
All right, you can open them.

463
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Where the hell did you get that?

464
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,740
It's beautiful.

465
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You can wear it to the foundation dinner.

466
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,950
Don't you think it is a bit
much for a charity dinner?

467
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Grace, this is fucking Birmingham.

468
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Good taste is for people
who can't afford sapphires.

469
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, Mr Shelby!

470
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,540
Did you wind the clock, Arthur?

471
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We should go to bed.

472
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,950
I need to...

473
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,870
I need to go out.

474
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,340
Some business I need to do.

475
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,470
Business?

476
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,950
But you only just got in.

477
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,950
I won't be long.

478
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,950
It's ten o'clock.

479
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,140
It's pouring with rain.

480
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,800
I'll go. I'll go and I'll come back.

481
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Arthur.

482
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Working in the dark is
for the devil. We said.

483
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,950
Start to do your work in the light.

484
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You have your own light. Inside your head.

485
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's just paperwork.

486
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I need you to clear your
men out of Nechells tonight.

487
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,950
- I thought you boys were a bit grand
this sort of thing these days. - Moss.

488
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Mind you, I think Tom enjoys the sport.

489
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,950
Something like that.

490
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,540
- Goodnight, Arthur.
- 'Night.

491
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,340
Arthur, what are you doing?

492
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,340
Arthur?

493
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,950
We're going to the Garrison.

494
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
No. I'm going home, John.

495
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,270
Go fuck yourself, Arthur.

496
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,740
Yeah. Fuck off!

497
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
Come here, Charlie. Charlie.

498
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,950
This big man and his brother are
going to make us a lot of money.

499
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,950
Or lose us a lot of money.

500
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Who cares when they're
such beautiful beasts, eh?

501
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,950
You've got a house, John.

502
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,540
Oh, fuck...

503
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,950
Full of kids.

504
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,950
Well, you've got a maid
to look after the kids.

505
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,870
Yeah, she listens.

506
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,950
Have you even done the odds for tomorrow?

507
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,950
Something urgent came up.

508
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,950
They get worse when they're pregnant, Tom.

509
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,950
John.

510
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,950
Esme, I need you to leave
now. Go out the back door.

511
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,070
And lock it after you.

512
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,950
When I left the office...

513
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,950
There's two truckfuls of
coppers out there, John.

514
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,950
Where the fuck is Arthur?

515
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,950
He goes home to the Madonna Of
Moseley on the stroke of five.

516
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,950
You need to talk to him, Tom.

517
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,950
Esme, please go now. Please.

518
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,950
This is very fucking unusual.

519
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,950
So, call Moss.

520
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,950
They're from out of town.

521
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,950
London, by the looks of their boots.

522
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,950
Since when are we scared of coppers, Tom?

523
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,070
Since things changed.

524
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,950
Scotland Yard!

525
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,670
Flying Squad.

526
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,950
- John, it's the Yard. It's the Yard.
- Put it down. Put it down.

527
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,950
Down on your knees.

528
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,950
Hands on your heads! Down on your knees!

529
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,950
Let her fucking go!
She's fucking pregnant.

530
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,950
- Leave her alone!
- What the fuck is happening, Tom?

531
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,950
Let's go!

532
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,950
Put me down!

533
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,950
Tell Polly it's Russian business, John.

534
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,950
All right.

535
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,600
Peaky fucking Blinders, my arse.

536
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,950
Is he afraid?

537
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,140
No.

538
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
Sit.

539
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,470
I'm talking to you, Mr Shelby.

540
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,950
So, the Oddfellows want you to know that

541
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,950
any deviation from your
instructions will have consequences.

542
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,140
What's your dog's name?

543
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,950
You visited your sister.

544
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,270
Eh? What's your name, boy?

545
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,950
Your sister is a potential
security breach.

546
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,950
She has connections
with Bolsheviks in London

547
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,950
who have connections
with the Soviet Embassy.

548
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,940
I think I'll just call your dog, "Boy".

549
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,470
You love your Boy, don't you?

550
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Understand this.

551
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,950
You have the local police in your pocket.

552
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,070
We have Scotland Yard.

553
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,950
They do what we tell them
just as surely as this dog.

554
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,070
Let him off the leash.

555
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,950
Are you hearing me, Mr Shelby?

556
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,870
I can charm dogs.

557
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,870
Gypsy witchcraft.

558
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And those I can't charm I
can kill with my own hands.

559
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,950
You learn it when you
have a dog on a boat.

560
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,950
They go fucking mad in tunnels.

561
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,600
I feel like I'm in a tunnel now.

562
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You know that feeling when
you have to kill or be killed.

563
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,950
Let the dog off the leash and
give the order you give in Gaelic.

564
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,950
Like I'm told you do when
someone displeases you,

565
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,950
when someone reports you.

566
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Visit your sister again and she
will die crossing the road.

567
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Maraigh.

568
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Come on, you say it.

569
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,400
If you wanted me dead,
I'd be dead, wouldn't I?

570
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,470
It's true.

571
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,950
It's true, we do need you alive.

572
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,950
But when you go home today, Mr Shelby,

573
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,950
be sure to check under
your little boy's pillow.

574
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,270
The tooth fairy has been.

575
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,070
We can reach anyone...

576
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,600
.. anywhere.

577
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,950
Is everything all right?

578
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,950
Yes.

579
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,950
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

580
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,950
Yeah.

581
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You promised, Tommy.

582
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,600
I trust you.

583
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,950
I trust you, Tommy.

584
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,200
Yes.

585
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,950
He's fine. He's fine.

586
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Grace... Grace.

587
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Come on. Yeah.

588
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,950
You're not one of those
impressionists, are you?

589
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,950
They are all terribly
political, aren't they?

590
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,950
- And you're not?
- Goodness, no.

591
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,950
The people I work for just
want me to paint what's there.

592
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,950
To me, politics is deliberately
making things better for some people

593
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,200
by deliberately making
them worse for others.

594
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,670
Well, I thought I might wear this.

595
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,950
Oh, God. It's too much. I'll
try something more simple.

596
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,470
No. Don't.

597
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,950
Suddenly I feel incompetent.

598
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,950
I want the portrait to hang in the office,

599
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,950
so I want it to look formal.

600
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's not formal. It's beautiful.

601
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,950
It's made in Paris.

602
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,950
It was stolen in Birmingham.

603
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,950
My mother stole it from a
house she was cleaning, 1901...

604
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,950
No, no. It's yours. It belongs on you.

605
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,950
A woman of substance and class.

606
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,950
Believe me, I've painted many women

607
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,200
who don't belong in
their expensive dresses.

608
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,950
There'll be no charge.

609
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,950
Your normal rate. I insist.

610
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Mm. There's a first.

611
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,950
So, when shall we start?

612
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,950
I've already started.

613
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,950
Come to my studio this evening.

614
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,950
I'm busy this evening.

615
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,950
Polly, invite him.

616
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,950
Invite me to what?

617
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,950
Ada, this is a professional transaction.

618
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,950
Invite me to what?

619
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,950
Shelby Foundation dinner.
Polly is going alone.

620
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,270
- You're invited.
- Ada!

621
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,740
I'll come to your studio on Sunday.

622
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,200
And then we shall begin.

623
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
A woman of substance... and class.

624
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,270
Tommy?

625
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,950
This is the leader of
Birmingham City Council.

626
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,950
- Hello, Tommy. - All right,
Danny? - How's business?

627
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,950
All right. Holding up,
holding up. How are you?

628
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,950
You know each other?

629
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,950
I have interests in
steelworks in Cradley Heath.

630
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,950
Tommy helps me get my
products to the carmakers.

631
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,950
Congratulations, Mrs
Shelby, on your wedding.

632
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,950
Thank you. I'm surprised
you weren't invited.

633
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,470
Now, how would that look, eh?

634
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,950
Ah, now the party has really started.

635
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,950
Who are they?

636
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,950
Father John Hughes from St
Mary's Boys Reformatory.

637
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,950
And with him is Patrick Jarvis MP.

638
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,950
They are part of an organisation
called the Economic League.

639
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,950
Did you invite them, Grace?

640
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,950
The names sound familiar.

641
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,950
They were recommended by the Lord Mayor.

642
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,950
Oh. On your "best people
of the city" list, eh?

643
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,950
- Do you know them?
- I'll introduce you, Tommy.

644
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
No, it's all right, Danny.
I'll introduce myself.

645
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,950
We appear to have taken you by surprise.

646
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,800
I have adjusted.

647
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,950
Since the socialists
got into Downing Street,

648
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,950
we are all being followed.

649
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,950
We have to meet in places
where we'd meet anyway.

650
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,950
You should have stopped by Small Heath.

651
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,950
I could have given you a
more traditional welcome.

652
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,950
- They want to know about ammunition.
- And chains for the wheels.

653
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,950
When the White Guard make
their run for Tbilisi,

654
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,950
it'll be over rough terrain.

655
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,950
The chains are suitable
for snow or wet ground.

656
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,950
They're already stored on the vehicles.

657
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,950
There's a batch of weapons
set aside at the BSA

658
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,950
which is bound for the Turkish Army.

659
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,950
And how will you get it all
aboard the London train?

660
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,950
There will be a strike
that night across the city.

661
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,950
You will have to stop
the train twice. How?

662
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Two drivers will join the
strike at different points.

663
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,950
Rather fun getting the communist unions

664
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,950
to help get weapons to the Whites.

665
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yes, rather fun, eh?

666
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,950
I'm thinking ahead, thinking
of every possibility,

667
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
remembering everything that is happening.

668
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,950
The Russians want to inspect the vehicles.

669
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,950
I'll take photographs.

670
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,950
Mm-mm.

671
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,950
The Duke has sent his niece. She's here.

672
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,950
Tomorrow, you will take her
to the factory and show her.

673
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,950
- No.
- Mm.

674
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,950
The union convenors are
watching the factories.

675
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,670
Not possible.

676
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,950
Anything is possible, Mr Shelby.

677
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,950
You will take her.

678
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,950
You will pick her up
from this hotel at ten.

679
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,950
Now, look.

680
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,950
A priest with an empty glass.

681
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,400
Let's get back to the party.

682
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,950
You know, gentlemen, there is hell...

683
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,870
and there is another place below hell.

684
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I will remember everything...
and forget nothing.

685
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,950
Tommy...

686
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,670
This is Duchess Tatiana Petrovna.

687
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,950
Come on, Tommy, aren't you
impressed to meet a real duchess?

688
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,950
Well, I understand they charge a fee.

689
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,950
Mr Shelby, you are very direct.

690
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,950
Too direct.

691
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,950
But it's true. I attend these
things for the champagne.

692
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,950
And for the chance to be
treated like a duchess again.

693
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You should have kissed my hand, Mr Shelby.

694
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Forgive me.

695
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,950
She was asking about my sapphire.

696
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,950
I thought I'd recognised it.

697
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,950
She says it was Russian.

698
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,950
My husband has business in Russia.
Perhaps you know about it, Tatiana.

699
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,950
Well, tonight's not a
night for business, eh?

700
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,950
Is that why you were in the
concert hall for ten minutes?

701
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,950
I think people are ready
for dinner now, Grace.

702
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,950
No, no, I am not done
pumping people for money.

703
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,950
What is "pump for money"?
It's what I do every day.

704
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,950
You, er...? You know each other, do you?

705
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,950
You see, I am in charge of
compiling the list of guests,

706
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,950
but it's my husband who
seems to know all of them.

707
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,950
I hear he's very well connected.

708
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,950
And where does a duchess hear that?

709
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,950
In certain circles.

710
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,950
All right, enough, Ada.

711
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,950
Grace, there's a lady dowager
wants to speak to you

712
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,950
about coffee mornings.

713
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,950
She mentioned a £2,000 cash donation.

714
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,950
Tatiana, you and I will speak later.

715
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,870
I would like that.

716
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,950
Going to the factory
tomorrow is a mistake.

717
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,270
Nevertheless, we will go.

718
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,950
Also, my uncle ordered me to
seduce you, to give us an advantage.

719
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,950
But with a beautiful wife like
that, it will be difficult, no?

720
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,950
Tomorrow is a mistake.

721
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,950
Have you not heard? We have
no morals, we Russians.

722
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,950
And no fucking sense.

723
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,950
And no options.

724
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,950
I would fuck you for the cause.

725
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,950
What do you think of that?

726
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,950
I think you should not
drink vodka with champagne.

727
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,950
Does your wife know that
the sapphire she's wearing

728
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,340
has been cursed by a gypsy?

729
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:26,950
What did you say?

730
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Nothing on earth would make me wear it.

731
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,500
Grace... Grace, come here.
Look, I can explain...

732
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,950
Ladies and gentlemen,

733
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,950
- For once, you shouldn't have to explain...
- The loyality toast: to His Majesty the King.

734
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,950
The King.

735
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,950
Dinner is served.

736
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,950
You look beautiful. You look beautiful.

737
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,950
- You need to take this off.
- Why?

738
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,950
Because you think it
would look better on her?

739
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,950
Grace, look at me. Fuck
these people. Fuck 'em.

740
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,950
I need you to be all right.

741
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,870
I need you, Grace.

742
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,540
I need you.

743
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,140
Damn you, Tommy Shelby.

744
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,470
- Shall we go inside?
- Yeah.

745
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
For Angel!

746
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Get a fucking ambulance now!

747
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:11,950
It were awful.

748
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,950
I mean...

749
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,950
she were well within her rights.

750
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,950
I was asking meself,

751
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,870
"What would I do?"

752
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But then she goes too
far. Why? What happens?

753
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,950
She gets up...

754
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,950
and she's got this look in her eye.

755
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,950
It...

756
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,950
No.

757
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,950
I'm not going to spoil it for you.

758
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But I tell you, I haven't
been able to sleep since.
