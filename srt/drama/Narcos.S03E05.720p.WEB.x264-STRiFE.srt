2
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,524
<i>According to our intelligence,</i>

3
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,612
Gilberto Rodríguez was
a stabilizing influence on the cartel.

4
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,783
His arrest may lead
to an increased violence

5
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,995
against civilians and police.

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,413
No doubt...

7
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,457
<i>the cartel leaders...</i>

8
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>are now in hiding,</i>

9
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>and their security apparatus
is operating in a state of high alert.</i>

10
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,678
So... the only thing we can be certain of

11
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>is that any further operation
against the cartel</i>

12
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:43,145
<i>will be both very difficult
and extremely dangerous.</i>

13
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:48,817
We appreciate the volatility
of the situation, General.

14
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,653
Well, in that case,
I will turn things over to the man

15
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,072
who's responsible for this situation.

16
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,660
Maybe he can walk us through
his path to victory.

17
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,246
So Agent Peña, what comes next?

18
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,956
The floor is yours.

19
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,032
Don Gilberto.

20
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,077
Leave it there.

21
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,161
Okay.

22
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,957
Enjoy your meal.

23
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,102
Hello?

24
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,315
<i>Hi, brother, it's me. How are you doing?</i>

25
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,444
Better if I knew how this happened.

26
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,488
<i>Gilberto, someone betrayed us.</i>

27
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,241
<i>Where the fuck were those pigs we pay?</i>

28
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,119
It was an American operation.
It was the DEA.

29
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,664
Our friends knew nothing about it.

30
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,543
Unless our friends
have been lying to us all along.

31
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,632
Maybe they need a reminder
what all that money was for.

32
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,841
<i>Relax, Miguel.</i>

33
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,511
My situation will be rectified soon.

34
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,806
<i>The truth is that things
are getting more complicated</i>

35
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,226
and our friends in the North Valley
need reassurance.

36
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,395
You need to set a meeting with Henao.

37
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,648
<i>Compliment him.</i>

38
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,652
- On what?
- Doesn't matter. Offer him something.

39
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,447
<i>He likes tequila. Have a bottle ready.</i>

40
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,452
Tell him... this is just a small setback.

41
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,957
<i>In the meantime,
business goes on as usual.</i>

42
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,835
Increase your personal security.

43
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,963
<i>The Americans will come after you next.</i>

44
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>Your freedom is our best leverage,
brother.</i>

45
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,927
Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.

46
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,098
What if there's a leak?

47
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,811
There may be.

48
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,480
Find out.

49
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,066
<i>I need to go, brother. I love you.</i>

50
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,693
I love you too, brother.

51
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,452
- <i>What do you got for me?</i>
- Dog shit. Minus the dog and the shit.

52
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,540
Well, we knew it wasn't gonna be easy.
You gotta get creative.

53
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,627
All due respect, we're being told that
we can't leave the base without an escort,

54
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,589
and now,
in a truly shocking turn of events,

55
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,466
we're being told there isn't
enough manpower to assign us one.

56
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,051
<i>We're fucking grounded.</i>

57
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,140
Look, I'll see what I can do
with the lockdown. I gotta go.

58
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,183
I'm meeting with the new
Minister of Defense.

59
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,435
And Feistl...

60
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,562
you asked for this.

61
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,189
<i>Don't forget that, 'cause I know I won't.</i>

62
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,530
<i>Colombia had recently elected
a new president,</i>

63
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,783
<i>a man named Ernesto Samper.</i>

64
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,120
<i>Escobar's hitters had tried
to assassinate him in an earlier election.</i>

65
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,497
<i>So he was no friend of the narcos.</i>

66
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,627
<i>And while he knew his country
was tired of violence,</i>

67
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,048
<i>he and his new staff, including
Defense Minister Fernando Botero,</i>

68
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,758
<i>were already in a tough spot.</i>

69
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,344
<i>Politically, the surrender deal was ugly.</i>

70
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,639
<i>But they were willing to live with it.</i>

71
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,224
<i>Gilberto's arrest made that
harder than planned,</i>

72
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,352
<i>and they weren't shy about saying it.</i>

73
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,689
I wanted to offer my congratulations

74
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,733
on the arrest of Gilberto Rodríguez.

75
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,984
Thank you, sir.

76
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,862
Colonel Martínez deserves the credit.

77
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,906
Unfortunately,
he isn't here to receive it.

78
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,742
He should be.

79
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,079
I imagine he knew there might be
consequences for his actions.

80
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,373
A surrender deal was on the table,

81
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,377
which would've brought all four leaders
of the Cali cartel to justice.

82
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,712
And now, that's been complicated,

83
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,465
and we are faced with the unknown.

84
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,384
Understood.

85
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,680
Though I'm not sure murderers negotiating
their own punishment qualifies as justice.

86
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,894
The deal preceded my tenure.

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,898
But between the two of us,
I share your reservations.

88
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,235
But no one wants a return
to the days of Pablo Escobar

89
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,237
and the bloodshed of Los Pepes.

90
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,698
No, of course not.

91
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,117
I won't ask if the rumors

92
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,703
about your involvement
with the vigilantes are true,

93
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,287
but I do have a question.

94
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,543
If it turns out that we are indeed
on the same side...

95
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,670
can I trust you?

96
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,800
You can trust that my only agenda
is to take down the Cali cartel.

97
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,679
Let me know if I can do anything.

98
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,017
Sir, my team in Cali
are operating under...

99
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,603
severe restrictions.

100
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,814
They need their independence.

101
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,567
I'll make a call.

102
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,527
Thank you, sir.

103
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,698
Peña.

104
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,452
Justice can be hard to find.

105
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,788
And a man as powerful
as Gilberto Rodríguez

106
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,207
won't stay in custody for long.

107
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,671
If you want to keep him behind bars,
you need someone to testify.

108
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,090
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

109
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,887
I'm working on a high-level target.

110
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,725
I suggest you work fast,
because without it,

111
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,143
nothing else will matter.

112
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,733
<i>We went through the machine, sir.</i>

113
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,693
We've got nothing.

114
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,865
So what am I supposed to do with that?
What does this mean?

115
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,038
If somebody sold us out,
we'd know about it.

116
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,375
Like you knew about the raid?

117
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,507
Look, gentlemen...

118
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:57,222
I want to know why my brother
is sitting in a fucking cell.

119
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:02,393
And if any one of us is involved in this,
I want to know by the end of the day.

120
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,356
Of course. Consider it done, sir.

121
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,704
Miguel's paranoid.

122
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:28,461
Maybe they used one of their spy planes
and spotted Gilberto from space.

123
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,755
You're not taking this seriously.

124
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,218
Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.
He thinks there's a leak.

125
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,304
And the system would tell us
about the leak.

126
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,349
This is about the surrender, right?

127
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,102
You're worried your retirement plans
are ruined now.

128
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,894
Listen to me.

129
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,858
People love drama, brother. You know that.

130
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,776
This isn't drama. He wants names.

131
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,404
And there's no reason to think
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.

132
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,406
We designed the system.

133
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,961
Mr. Córdova.

134
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,675
So? Anything good?

135
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,054
Just a bunch of shit-talking.
Gossip. Typical.

136
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,391
And what about internally?
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?

137
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,351
No, not really.

138
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,563
Truth is, I have no idea
who would rat these guys out.

139
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,775
I want to hear everything you've flagged
all the same. Quickly.

140
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,278
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.

141
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,248
<i>These guys were supposed
to have this under control.</i>

142
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,626
<i>But it's clear they don't.</i>

143
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,881
<i>I thought those guys
were supposed to surrender.</i>

144
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,674
<i>Does this mean it's not happening?</i>

145
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,638
<i>Somebody tipped off the Americans,
stabbed us in the back.</i>

146
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,603
<i>Where was his fucking
security team? What do they pay them for?</i>

147
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,816
<i>They better do something quick,</i>

148
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,486
<i>or else it's going to be
every man for himself.</i>

149
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,787
You have many powerful allies,
Don Gilberto.

150
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,331
Your situation pains them deeply.

151
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,043
We're confident this will soon be
behind us. The surrender will proceed.

152
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,213
But we need to wait.
It's a matter of time.

153
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,215
Wait for what?

154
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,593
For the government to do something
they already agreed to? Fuck.

155
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,470
What did Medina say?

156
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,518
Currently, we don't have
an official position from Santiago Medina.

157
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,978
Why not?

158
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,985
Because we're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting.

159
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,072
Are you fucking kidding me?

160
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,907
You didn't talk to him yet?

161
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:06,160
You're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting?

162
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,788
I don't wait on him!

163
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,707
He waits on me!

164
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,875
You go to his office and fix this mess!

165
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,587
And remind him who the fuck
Gilberto Rodríguez is!

166
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,134
For fuck's sake! Open this damn thing!

167
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,014
Nicolás, your father needs to understand
his arrest changes things.

168
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,598
It's political now.

169
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:31,101
Dad?

170
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,981
Sometimes you have to put on
a little show.

171
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,150
Helps bring the best out of people.

172
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,444
I need to talk to Medina.

173
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,362
I don't want you anywhere near this.

174
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,615
Dad, the circle is too big.

175
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,620
Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.
He won't trust the lawyers.

176
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,914
But he will trust you?

177
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,751
Yes, I'm your son.

178
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,005
That's right. And you'll obey my wishes.

179
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,183
<i>It's cold here all the time.</i>

180
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,644
<i>I wake up and the bed is freezing, empty.</i>

181
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,230
<i>I know,</i> bonita.<i> I'll be home soon.</i>

182
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,983
<i>I just wish I could be there with you.</i>

183
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,279
<i>I told you, Chris, it wouldn't
look right. It's not a good time.</i>

184
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,448
Any word on the location?

185
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,200
Nothing yet.

186
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,371
<i>I don't know, Franklin.
Maybe now is the perfect fucking time.</i>

187
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,915
<i>You really think they're gonna stop
with Gilberto?</i>

188
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,251
<i>And how long before the DEA
comes looking for you? For us?</i>

189
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,837
<i>Listen, I need you
to be strong, okay, babe?</i>

190
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,174
<i>Nobody knows about us.
Nobody's looking for me, I promise.</i>

191
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,301
<i>I'll call later. I love you.</i>

192
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,928
<i>No, wait, Franklin...</i>

193
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,472
She's panicking.

194
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,602
Where are you going?

195
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,729
To give things a push.
We're running out of time.

196
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,981
Okay, can we talk
about this wire tap, though?

197
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,859
I mean, the legality of it?

198
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,032
Stoddard...

199
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,123
I want you to think about
where you see your career in five years.

200
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,169
Does having that conversation help
or hurt your chances of getting there?

201
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,662
You want something to drink?

202
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,748
I never refuse.

203
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,595
That's a great shirt, no?

204
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,183
That pocket...

205
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,311
on the left.

206
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,316
Where the heart is.

207
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:37,038
Hey, this situation with Gilberto,

208
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,789
what a disgrace, huh?

209
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,879
After all your family's done
for this city. For this country.

210
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,551
Just the gringos meddling
where they shouldn't.

211
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,555
But our friends in Bogotá
are working to...

212
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,184
rectify the situation.

213
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,397
Business proceeds as usual, right?

214
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,611
And how does this clerical error
affect the timeline of the surrender?

215
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,240
As I said...

216
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,284
this was just a mistake.

217
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,161
Nothing more.

218
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,541
Glad to hear that.

219
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,854
I see a lot of new faces.

220
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,798
Did you notice that?

221
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,636
The woman, the Salazar girl?

222
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,346
The fear.

223
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,099
Miguel was scared.

224
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,356
These guys are in big trouble.

225
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,659
Little early for number three, no?

226
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,579
The fuck else am I supposed to do
around here?

227
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,164
You didn't have to come.

228
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,875
Who else was gonna watch your back?

229
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,758
You gonna tell me
what went down in Juárez?

230
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,301
I told you...

231
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,928
we talked.

232
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,017
The Mexican made you an offer.

233
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,686
Didn't he?

234
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,192
Yes.

235
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:14,987
Pretty good one, too.

236
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,660
He says we're getting out
at the wrong time.

237
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,914
Maybe he's right.

238
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,752
Gilberto's in jail.

239
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,964
Maybe this is fate.

240
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,361
How'd you come up with this place?

241
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,985
Buddy in the Defense Department.

242
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,197
The place was leased out
to debrief a witness against Noriega.

243
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,491
That was like three years ago.

244
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,835
Danny, you never cease to amaze me.

245
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,544
Not bad, right?

246
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,589
Well, the fucking A/C's still running.

247
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,341
Yeah, your tax dollars at work.

248
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,309
So? What's our first move?

249
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,189
Circle back. See if we can pick up a trail
on that accountant.

250
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,280
World's deadliest fanny pack,
back in action.

251
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,906
Better fucking believe it.

252
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,646
No, the bill, please.

253
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,315
Compliments of the gentleman.

254
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,367
- Thank you, but I don't...
- Oh, uh...

255
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,055
Did I come over too fast?

256
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,333
It's tricky business
starting a conversation.

257
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,376
Not a lot of margin for error.

258
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
You're an American.

259
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,757
Yeah. Javi. From Texas.

260
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,553
- You?
- I'm from Boston originally.

261
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,013
Strangers in a strange land.

262
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,309
Well, I hope you don't mind. I was...

263
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,271
I saw you sitting over here and you...

264
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,526
reminded me of someone, someone from home.

265
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,111
Ah! Sentimental.

266
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,405
Just a lonely patriot.

267
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,617
Anyway, I thought we could talk.

268
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,496
- Okay.
- No, I mean it. Just...

269
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,749
Just talk.

270
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,002
- I heard people still do that sometimes.
- Oh, yeah.

271
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,213
You know,
I think I saw it in a movie once.

272
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,342
Look, you seem like a nice guy,

273
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,679
but I get the feeling
that just talking isn't your forte.

274
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,141
- And... I'm married, so...
- Happily?

275
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,270
Wow. Look at you now.

276
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,730
What? I mean, come on.

277
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,734
Your husband lets you brave the dangers
of happy hour by yourself?

278
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,946
He's traveling for work.

279
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,991
Oh, can I guess? He's...

280
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,493
an astronaut.

281
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,832
- Brain surgeon.
- Yeah, uh-huh, a little bit of both.

282
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,458
- Uh-huh.
- Banking.

283
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,668
Oh, fuck.

284
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,336
I thought I couldn't like him any less.

285
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,714
I mean...

286
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,300
Okay, well, this has been fun.

287
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,221
So, what exotic destination
could pull him away from...

288
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,683
from all this?

289
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,482
Say hi to Texas for me.

290
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,152
Christina.

291
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,116
I didn't tell you my name.

292
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,701
You didn't have to.

293
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,163
Okay.

294
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,542
You got me. How do you know my name?

295
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,963
Same way I know that your husband...
isn't in banking.

296
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,924
My name's Javier Peña. I work for the DEA.

297
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,928
You want to sit back down,
have a conversation?

298
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,977
I'm not interested.
Enjoy your drink, Eliot Ness.

299
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,566
Fuck.

300
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,028
The bill.

301
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,367
And they don't appear
on the next flights either?

302
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,912
No.

303
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,705
Jorge.

304
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,002
Motherfucking gringos
never got on a plane back to Bogotá.

305
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:26,173
- Our friend with the badge lied to us.
- Or he made a mistake.

306
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,550
There are no mistakes.

307
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,644
Hey. Here he comes.

308
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,355
There he is,
the fucking bastard.

309
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,526
I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

310
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,320
That's what you're worried about?

311
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,825
How about earning the money we pay you
to keep our bosses out of jail?

312
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,786
- You couldn't give a fuck about that.
- The fuck you want from me?

313
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,289
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotá.

314
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,874
By the time we knew what they were...

315
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,503
Martínez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

316
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,338
you useless piece of shit.

317
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,718
You know what else is odd?

318
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,513
It looks like the DEA never left Cali.

319
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,515
And you were the one who confirmed.

320
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:23,313
You. Only you confirmed those two fucking
gringos took the plane to Bogotá.

321
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,278
Do you know where you are?

322
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:33,782
You want to hang me out to dry
with your boss? Do you know where you are?

323
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,788
I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

324
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,291
They followed someone there.

325
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,047
I know it wasn't me.

326
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,027
Fucking Calderón.

327
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,988
What he said made sense.

328
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,492
The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

329
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,746
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

330
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,166
They must have come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

331
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,382
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

332
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,558
It could just as easily have been me
driving him.

333
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,313
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

334
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,399
You think Miguel will let this slide?

335
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,153
Not a fucking chance.

336
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,657
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

337
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,367
and then we're both fucked.

338
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,746
The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

339
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,083
We have to get on the same page here.

340
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,797
Calderón told us those fuckers from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?

341
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,215
He burned us.

342
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,885
He is the one responsible
for what happened.

343
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,179
He's a dirty cop...

344
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,308
who takes money from a drug cartel.

345
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,649
But you and me, we are brothers.

346
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,080
Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

347
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,298
I didn't realize you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

348
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,636
No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

349
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,180
Of course.

350
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,434
Well, then...

351
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:12,774
tell your father there is still a path
to what he wants most.

352
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,279
No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

353
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,036
The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's
been difficult to carry out our old deal.

354
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,788
"Old deal"?

355
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,627
Nicolás...

356
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,341
Politics is about appearances.

357
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:42,346
For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms of a man

358
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,847
who's already in prison.

359
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,309
That just looks bad.

360
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,273
But different terms...

361
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,442
new terms...

362
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,862
What do you say?

363
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,333
So what did you find out?

364
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,047
The DEA team Calderón was escorting
never left Cali.

365
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,549
He reported that they had.

366
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,264
What do you think, Jorge?

367
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,432
It was a mistake.

368
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,477
Born of incompetence.

369
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,689
The DEA got lucky...

370
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,066
and Calderón took the bait.

371
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,737
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

372
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,575
Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

373
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,079
How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderón?

374
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,082
It's unlikely.

375
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:58,630
It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

376
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,681
From here on out, keep an eye on Calderón.

377
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,852
Limit what we tell him.

378
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,771
No more lapses in security.

379
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:16,398
Yes, sir.

380
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,481
Let's go.

381
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,789
Thank you, Jorge.

382
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,919
It's either him or us.

383
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,757
What if they kill him?

384
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,218
They wouldn't kill a cop.

385
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,891
But they can question him.
And then what? What?

386
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,730
By the time they get to it,
this shit will all be over.

387
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,091
Hello?

388
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:29,513
<i>Good afternoon. Someone is here
for you, Mrs. Jurado. Mr. Eliot Ness.</i>

389
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,895
Thanks for seeing me.

390
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,107
Didn't want you waving a badge
around our lobby.

391
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,570
Are you gonna arrest me?

392
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,076
You want to sit?

393
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,163
If what I wanted counted for anything,

394
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,790
you wouldn't be in my living room now.

395
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,213
May not see it this way yet, but I...
I am here to help you.

396
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,093
Oh, I'm sure my well-being
is your top priority.

397
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,971
It's why you were
buying me martinis at the bar.

398
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,020
Gilberto Rodríguez is in jail.

399
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,748
It won't be long before he has company.

400
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,987
There's a very small window
for people like you and your husband

401
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,488
to still be of any use to us.

402
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,948
Hmm.

403
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,741
You're running out of time.

404
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,204
So if Franklin really does care about you,
then he'll do what's right.

405
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,835
I mean, I don't know if the two of you
are thinking about starting a family...

406
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,547
Okay, look, for the record, you don't know
a fucking thing about my husband or me.

407
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,968
Okay. You're right.

408
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,639
But I do know
that there is no future for you...

409
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,435
in any version of how this plays out
if he doesn't help us.

410
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,446
I didn't plan on living like this.
It was...

411
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,073
It was a mistake...

412
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,285
not stopping it sooner.

413
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,456
You ever done anything like that?

414
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,500
I have.

415
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,753
Okay.

416
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,800
So...

417
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,844
what, that's it?

418
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,599
That's it.

419
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,111
Think it over. But don't take too long.

420
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,259
Don't you even want to know what he said?

421
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,346
How dare you disregard my wishes.

422
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,299
Nobody was going to get in a room
with Medina, I did...

423
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,146
I don't want you involved.
I won't even discuss it.

424
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,691
The old deal is dead.

425
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,825
But we can make a new one,
with certain adjustments.

426
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,372
Motherfuckers.

427
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,127
Adjustments how?

428
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,131
There has to be some jail time.

429
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,885
For you, Uncle Miguel, Pacho, and Chepe.

430
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,469
Three years.

431
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,515
Three years? No chance.

432
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:07,022
You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

433
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,650
and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

434
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,237
That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

435
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,780
Dad, stop being so stubborn!

436
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,297
You don't get to surrender.

437
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,424
You are in jail.

438
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,217
You are a narcotrafficker.

439
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:41,431
No politician is going to stand up
and say, "Let him go,"

440
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,267
no matter how much money
you've put in his pocket.

441
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,897
But son, it's three years...

442
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,906
It's not the old deal,
but it's a good one.

443
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,242
The best we're going to get.

444
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,247
But there's one loose end.

445
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,919
Medina is worried about his exposure.

446
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,175
More specifically, the accountant...
Pallomari.

447
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,386
He knows too much.

448
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,558
Hola, bonita.

449
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,311
Baby, I thought you said
that you were gonna call.

450
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,980
<i>I know. I had a late meeting.</i>

451
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,732
Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

452
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,025
Can you leave it there?

453
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,612
<i>Danki masha danki.</i> Right?

454
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,865
<i>Thank you. Sorry. Room service.</i>

455
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,787
How many of those little cakes
have you eaten so far?

456
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,664
I can see our island from my room.

457
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,250
<i>I miss you,</i> bonita.

458
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,967
Franklin... what are we gonna do?

459
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,639
Christina, you can't just walk away
from these people.

460
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,015
<i>I know you keep saying that,</i>

461
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:11,187
but maybe... maybe we have
more options than we think.

462
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,815
What do you mean, "more options"?

463
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,652
<i>You know things.
You know things about the organization.</i>

464
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,588
<i>- How things...
- Want me to be a rat?</i>

465
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,252
<i>You been talking to someone?
I told you...</i>

466
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:26,119
<i>No, Franklin, we need to talk.
We really need to talk about the future.</i>

467
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,747
<i>We can't do this
on the phone, okay? I'll call later.</i>

468
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,830
Rewind.

469
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:33,834
Okay.

470
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,838
<i>I had a late meeting.</i>

471
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,007
<i>Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.</i>

472
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,425
<i>Can you leave it there?</i>

473
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,094
Danki masha danki.<i> Right?</i>

474
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,598
<i>Thank you. Sorry. Room service.</i>

475
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,021
I think I might know where he is.

476
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,783
They probably set up shop
somewhere else after the raid.

477
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,543
<i>Salcedo.</i>

478
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,129
The Americans are back
on the accountant's office,

479
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,923
<i>hoping he shows.</i>

480
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,801
Knowing that idiot, he might.

481
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,639
If that's all they've got,
then they don't have much.

482
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,642
<i>Stay on them.</i>

483
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,062
<i>Find out where they sleep at night.</i>

484
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,104
All right.

485
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,651
Hey, boss. You doing okay?

486
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,778
<i>You sound tired.</i>

487
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:44,739
Yeah. I'm fine.

488
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,325
Keep me posted.

489
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,586
- How was the science test?
- Good.

490
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,838
Daddy!

491
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,714
Daddy!

492
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,260
My princess. Hello, my princesses.
How are you all?

493
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,303
Hello. What are you doing here?

494
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:08,680
Hi, my love.

495
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,099
Was it your turn or mine
to pick up the girls?

496
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,936
Yours. I was in the neighborhood.
Just wanted to see how my girls are doing.

497
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,022
- Daddy, today we have piano lessons.
- I know, my love.

498
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,316
My little virtuosos.

499
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,485
And you? Everything okay?

500
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,111
I'm fine.

501
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,949
I just felt like I needed to see my girls.
That's why I came.

502
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,828
Excuse me.

503
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,042
Looks like I have to go.

504
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,045
Would you excuse me? Okay?

505
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,632
- Girls... I love you.
- Bye.

506
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,467
Bye, be good.

507
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,262
Salcedo.

508
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,266
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- What can I do for you, David?

509
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,936
<i>My dad called a meeting. Top personnel.</i>

510
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,607
What do you mean, a meeting?
We just had one.

511
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,650
<i>Well, we're having another one.</i>

512
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:06,237
<i>2611 Avenida 14. Out by Jamundí.
See you there.</i>

513
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,380
<i>It's Carlo Córdova, leave a message.</i>

514
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,049
Carlo, I just talked to David.

515
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,676
Are you on your way to the meeting?
Call me.

516
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,391
Stoddard. Get this.

517
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:39,187
According to the language guy at SLS,
"Dasha masha danki"...

518
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,607
means "Thank you very much" in Papiamento.

519
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,316
Okay.

520
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:46,903
Curaçao.

521
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,406
Curaçao... I guess there's
a lot of banks there.

522
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,701
Yeah, there's a lot
of fucking banks there. Here it is.

523
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,538
Baoase Luxury Resort.
Has an island villa you can rent.

524
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,707
Okay. What do we do then?

525
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,710
Call the Dutch Caribbean police
in Willemstad.

526
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,379
Ask them if they can confirm

527
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,131
anyone staying
under one of Franklin Jurado's aliases.

528
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,803
We got him, didn't we?

529
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:13,845
Not yet.

530
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,723
But he's there.

531
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,642
- Call them.
- Yeah.

532
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,114
<i>It's Carlo Córdova, leave a message.</i>

533
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,714
I'm sitting there,
enjoying my dick getting sucked,

534
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,634
when all of the sudden she stops.

535
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,387
I open my eyes and I ask her, "What's up?"

536
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,557
She's all quiet, looking at me like this.

537
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,142
Not a word.

538
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,354
I'm like, "What the fuck?"
I turn to see Toque.

539
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:32,485
Fuck, he has a gun pointed at him.
Like this.

540
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,404
And the other girl,
the one with the gun, says to me:

541
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:41,702
"Give me the money,
or she bites your dick off."

542
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,001
- So what did you do?
- I gave her the fucking money!

543
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,504
I even tipped her, Pacho.

544
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,214
You don't mess around with that.

545
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,466
- You want some ice?
- Sure.

546
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,888
I'm having a great time.

547
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,349
I'm heading to Juárez tomorrow.

548
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,770
Got some business with my partners.

549
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,107
What am I going to tell them, Pacho?

550
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:16,195
I want to give them an answer.
Some good news.

551
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,830
My turn to tell you a story, Amado.

552
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:30,835
About the time my father
found me in my room with a boy.

553
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,297
Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.

554
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,510
My father told me I wasn't a man,
that I'd never be one.

555
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,470
It was the last time he spoke to me.

556
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,848
What a fucking bastard.

557
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,728
For a long time, I thought he was right.

558
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,480
Even after I started working
for Gilberto and Miguel.

559
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:56,736
Up until the day some motherfucker
told them I was a faggot.

560
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,947
And that it was a mistake
to let me be part of the business.

561
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,660
You know what they did?

562
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,540
They made me a partner.

563
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,588
Gilberto, Miguel, and Chepe,
they are my family.

564
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,508
I can't just leave them
when they need me the most.

565
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,222
What can I say?

566
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,479
I admire your loyalty.
You're one of a kind.

567
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,650
There you go.

568
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,992
You better get inside.
Don't want to be late.

569
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,307
Has your dad arrived?

570
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,227
No, not yet.

571
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,812
Let's go.

572
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,233

584
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,271
Let me go, asshole!

585
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,778
Let me go, motherfucker!

586
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,364
You don't have the balls!

587
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,158
Let me go!

588
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,332
Ah!

589
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:02,754
Up!

590
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,469
You motherfucker.

591
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,971
What the fuck did you tell them,
motherfucker?

592
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,225
Gilberto getting caught wasn't on me.

593
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,269
You feel so safe, motherfucker.

594
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,730
When it's your turn...

595
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,585
He was a tiger.

596
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,464
Let's go.

597
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,954
What the fuck is this?

598
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,332
Tell him what you did.

599
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,669
Tell him. Tell him where we caught you.

600
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,966
While you were visiting
your wife and children,

601
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,803
this fucking rat
was on his way to the airport.

602
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,973
With his wife, bags packed.

603
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,311
About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

604
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,397
You had your bitch follow me?

605
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,236
- What did you say?
- Me? And my children?

606
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,281
You should be thankful, motherfucker.

607
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,203
It's why you're standing there...
instead of sitting next to him.

608
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,791
You're making a big mistake, David.

609
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,877
I don't give a fuck what you think.

610
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,880
He's a loyal man. He always has been.

611
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,051
- He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
- He's a good man and loyal.

612
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,054
- Good? Why was he running?
- What are you doing?

613
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,597
- This is a good man...
- He's a fucking snitch!

614
00:50:58,681 --> 00:50:59,681
Jorge!

615
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,945
Look at me.

616
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,281
Sophia is inside.

617
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,200
She's inside that room.

618
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,205
Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

619
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,929
She has nothing to do with this, brother.

620
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,751
These fucking bastards are crazy.
They want to...

621
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,044
David, no!

622
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,427
Your friend was right, Jorge.

623
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,304
Go check on Sophia.

624
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,676
My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

625
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,222
Because mistakes were made.

626
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:29,229
Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

627
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,736
These are the consequences.

628
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,868
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

629
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,837
Jorge, when he tried to run,

630
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,800
he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

631
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,638
Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

632
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:14,900
Now... I trust you can take over
Córdova's responsibilities.

633
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,531
As our new head of security, Jorge.

634
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,241
What do you think?

635
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,876
I'm glad I can count on you.

636
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,818
My little girl, you're going to eat
a little bit of salad, okay?

637
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,280
Vera is going to teach you.
Look how much she ate.

638
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,492
Just a bit, sweetie.
Please, just eat a little bit.

639
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:50,496
- Hi. I thought you'd be home later.
- Daddy's here!

640
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,626
Give me a minute.

641
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,880
- Peña.
<i>- It's me, Christina Jurado.</i>

642
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,049
I'm glad you called.

643
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,592
<i>Are you okay?</i>

644
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,594
Please don't lie to me.

645
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,847
If I do this, if I get my husband to...

646
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:54,351
You can protect us? We can go home?

647
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,270
<i>You have my word.</i>

648
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:02,943
I talked to him.

649
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,113
You did? That's good.

650
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,032
<i>He's gonna... cooperate.</i>

651
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,742
He said that?

652
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:15,914
Oh, no, not yet, but he will.
I just... I need a little time.

653
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,420
That's fine.
You take all the time you need.

654
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:27,884
<i>Attention passengers:
Now boarding flight 1935 to Curaçao.</i>

655
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,022
Is that the landline?

656
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,779
<i>Hello?</i>

657
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,823
The cartel knows where you are.

658
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:09,838
<i>Who is this?</i>

659
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,383
<i>I think we can help each other out.</i>
