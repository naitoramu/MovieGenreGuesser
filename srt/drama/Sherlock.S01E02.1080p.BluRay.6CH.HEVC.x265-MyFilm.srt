- And?
- Van Coon was left-handed.

212
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,839
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

213
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,079
Left-handed?

I'm amazed you didn't notice. All you
have to do is look around this flat.

215
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,439
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

216
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,119
coffee mug handle pointing to the left.

217
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,519
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

218
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,879
on the left of the phone. Picked up with
his right, took messages with his left.

219
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,679
- D'you want me to go on?
- No, I think you've covered it.

220
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
I might as well,
I'm almost at the bottom of the list.

221
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,159
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side of the blade

222
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,839
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

223
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,079
that a left-handed man would shoot himself
in the right side of his head.

224
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,239
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

225

- But the gun?
- He was waiting for the killer.

- He'd been threatened.
- What?

He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

- And the bullet?
- Went through the open window.

Wait until you get the ballistics report.

234
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,239
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired
from his gun, I guarantee it.

235
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,519
But if his door was locked from
the inside, how did the killer get in?

236

Good, you're finally asking
the rightquestions.

237
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,719
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

238

which of course can never be done.

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,399
Doors locked from the inside.

Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

307
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,599
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

308
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,039
just another city suicide?

the ballistics report, I suppose?

310
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,639
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

311
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,039
- No.
- No. So this investigation might move

312
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,719
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

313
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,359
I've just handed you a murder inquiry.

314
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,559
Five minutes in his flat.

315
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,679
Four floors up.

316
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,439
That's why they think they're safe.

317
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,599
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.

318
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,479
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

319
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,439
- I don't understand.
- Dealing with a killer who can climb.

320
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,639
- What are you doing?
- Clings to the walls like an insect.

321
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,759
- <font color="#DF01D7">(CLUNK!)</font>
- That's how he got in.

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,799
- What?!

323
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,839
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

324
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,759
dropped in through this skylight.

325
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,919
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

326
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,199
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

327
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,679
- jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon.
- Oh, hold on <font color="#DF01D7">(!)</font>

328
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,199
That's how he got into the bank - ran
along the window ledge onto the terrace.

329
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,679
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

330
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,759
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

331
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,199
Sherlock?

332
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,999
So, the killer goes to the bank,

333
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,119
leaves a threatening cipher at the bank.

334
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,879
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

335
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,919
Hours later, he dies.

336
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,799
The killer finds Lukis at the library,
he writes the cipher

337
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,439
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

338
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,679
Late that night, he dies too.

339
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,399
Why did they die, Sherlock?

340
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,439
Only the cipher can tell us.

341
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,599
The world's run on codes and ciphers,
John.

342
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
From the million-pound security system
at the bank to the PIN machine

343
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,479
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

344
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,039
Yes, OK, but...

345
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,799
But it's all computer generated -

346
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,319
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

347
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,119
This is different.

348

It's an ancient device.

349
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,599
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

350

Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

So he got a Tube back to the office.

428
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,879
Why would he get a taxi into town
and then the Tube back?

429
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,119
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

434
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,559
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

That was a number as well.

About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

- Lost 5 million.
- Made it back in a week.

477
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,999
That's how he made such easy money.

478
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,719
He was a smuggler. Mm.

479

Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

482

Both of them smuggled stuff about.

483

The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

But why did they die?

485
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,639
It doesn't make sense. If they both
turn up at the shop and deliver the goods,

486
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,279
why would someone threaten them

487
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,039
and kill them after the event,

488
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,599
after they'd finished the job?

489
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,679
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

490
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,639
- How do you mean?
- Stole something.

491
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,159
Something from the hoard.

492
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,199
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

493
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,639
so threatens them both. Right.

then the clay can start to crumble.

610
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,799
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

611
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,639
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

612
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,399
Now, there are two.

613
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,119
<font color="#DF01D7">(GRATING)</font>

614
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,559
Fancy a biscuit with that?

615
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,479
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

616
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,999
Hello.

617
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,799
You saw the cipher.

618
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,359
Then you know he is coming for me.

619
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,959
You've been clever to avoid him so far.

620
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,199
I had to finish.

621
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,119
To finish this work.

622
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,159
It's only a matter of time.

623
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,759
I know he will find me.

624
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,719
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

625
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,719
When I was a girl, we met in China.

626
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,119
I recognised his...

627
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,559
- signature.
- The cipher?

628
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,719
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

629
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,319
- Zhi Zhu?
- The spider.

630
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,879
You know this mark?

631
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,959
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

632
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,679
- Huh?
- Ancient crime syndicate, based in China.

633
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,639
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

634
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,919
Everyone who hauls for them.

635
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,879
Hauls?

636
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,399
You mean you were a smuggler?

637
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,399
I was 1 5.

638
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,999
My parents were dead.

639
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,039
I had no livelihood.

640
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,679
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

641
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,759
except to work for the bosses.

642
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,519
Who are they?

643
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,599
They are called the Black Lotus.

644
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,919
By the time I was 1 6,

645
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,119
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

646
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,079
across the border into Hong Kong.

647
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,959
I managed to leave that life behind me.

648
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,719
I came to England.

649
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,639
They gave me a job, here.

650
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,439
Everything was good. New life.

651
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,239
And he came looking for you.

652
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,759
Yes.

653
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,999
I hoped, after five years...

654
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,119
maybe they would have forgotten me.

655
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,039
But they never really let you leave.

656
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,559
A small community like ours...

657
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,159
...they are never very far away.

658
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,159
He came to my flat.

659
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:26,799
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

660
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,679
And you've no idea what it was?

661
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,999
I refused to help.

662
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,359
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

663
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,079
Oh, yes.

664
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,759
He's my brother.

665
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,919
Two orphans.

666
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,799
We had no choice.

667
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,119
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like beggars.

668
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,279
My brother has become their puppet.

669
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,919
In the power of the one they call Shan.

670
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,719
The Black Lotus general.

671
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,399
I turned my brother away.

672
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,079
He said I had betrayed him.

673
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,999
Next day, I came to work

674
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,439
and the cipher was waiting.

675
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,679
Can you decipher these?

676
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,999
- These are numbers.
- Yes, I know.

677
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,399
Here, the line across the man's eyes,
it's the Chinese number one.

678
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,159
And this one is 1 5.
But what's the code?

679
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,679
All the smugglers know it.

680
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,359

That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

708
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,039
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

709
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,639
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

710
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,879
right under your nose.

711
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,319
Can you prove that?

712
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,919
- What are you thinking? Pork or pasta?
- Oh, it's you.

713
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,919
I suppose it's never going to trouble
Egon Ronay, is it?

714
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,439
I'd stick with the pasta.

715
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,759
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

716
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,079
What are you having?

717
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,599
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

718
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,439
So you're working here tonight?

719
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,279
- Need to examine some bodies.
- Some?

720
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,079
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

721
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,679
They're on my list.

722
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,519
Could you wheel them out again for me?

723
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,799
Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

724
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,519
- You changed your hair.
- What?

725
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,119
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

726
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,719
Yes, well...

727
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,999
It's good.

728
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,399
It...suits you better this way.

729
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,079
We're just interested in the feet.

730
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,879
- The feet?
- Yes.

731
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,719
Do you mind if we have a look at them?

732
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,079
Now, Van Coon.

733
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,319
- Oh!
- So...

734
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,639
So either these two men just happened
to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour,

735
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,159
- or I'm telling the truth.
- What do you want?

736
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,639
I want every book from Lukis's apartment
and Van Coon's.

737
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,919
Their books?

738
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,839
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

739
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,279
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

740
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,799
Soo Lin said the name.

741
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,479
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

742
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,159
We're still no closer to finding him.

743
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,479
Wrong!
We've got almost all we need to know.

744
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,559
She gave us most of the missing pieces.

745
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,079
Why did he need to visit his sister?

746
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,719
- Why did he need herexpertise?
- She worked at the museum.

747
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,959
- Exactly.
- An expert in antiquities.

748
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,439
- Of course, I see.
- Valuable antiquities, John.

749
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,319
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

750
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,559
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

751
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,039
The Black Lotus is selling them.

00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,159
The vendor doesn't give his name.

756
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,679
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

757
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,199
One in Lukis's suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

758
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,679
Antiquities...

759
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,519
sold at auction.

760
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,839
Look, here's another one.

761
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,559
Arrived from China a month ago,

762
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,999
Chinese ceramic statue sold for £400,000.

763
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,359
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

764
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,719
All of them from an anonymous source.

765
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,719
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them into Britain.

766
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,079
Every single auction coincides with
Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.

767
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,279
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

768
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,839

We'll just slip off.
No need to mention us in your report.

- Mr Holmes...
- I have high hopes for you, Inspector.

1086
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,559
A glittering career.

1087
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,559
I go where you point me.

1088
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,119

1093
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:47,559
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

1094
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,439
- What, a jade pin?
- Worth £9 million.

1095
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,759
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

1096
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,319
Hang on. A hairpin worth £9 million?

1097
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,559
- Apparently.
- Why so much?

1098
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,799
Depends who owned it.

1099
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,679
Two operatives based in London.

1100
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,559
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

1101
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,879
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

1102
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:15,439
- Worth £9 million.
- Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1103
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,359
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

1104
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,039
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

1105
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,199
- Even the killer didn't know that.
- Because of the soap.

Oh, hello.

01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,839
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1110
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,239
- How do you know that?
- You weren't just his PA, were you?

1111
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,839
Someone's been gossiping.

1112
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,639
- No.
- Then I don't understand why...

1113
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,639
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1114
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,079
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1115
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,959
- Sorry...?

1116
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,039
I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type
of chap to buy himself hand soap,

1117
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,199
not unless he had a lady coming over.

1118
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,839
And it's the same brand
as that hand cream there on your desk.

1119
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,399
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1120
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,999
It was over in a flash, it couldn't last.
He was my boss.

1121
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:16,679
What happened? Why did you end it?

1122
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,679
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1123
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,479
Took me for granted.

1124
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,759
Stood me up once too often.

1125
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,559
We'd plan to go away for the weekend
and then he'd just leave.

1126
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,279
Fly off to China at a moment's notice.

1127
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,599
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1128
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,279
Can I just have a look at it?

1129
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,199
He really climbed up onto the balcony?

1130
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,399
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1131
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,199
Thanks.

1132
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:59,679
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1133
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,599
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1134
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,159
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1135
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,559
Didn't know its value, just thought
it would suit you.

1136
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,519
Oh? What's it worth?

1137
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,759
£9 million.

1138
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:17,959
Oh, my God.

1139
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,559
Oh, my God!

1140
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,679
Nine million?!

1141
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,279
Over 1 ,000 years old

1142
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,439
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1143
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,519
He didn't know its value.
Didn't know why they were chasing him.

1144
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,759
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1145
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,119
- You mind, don't you?
- What?

1146
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,039
That she escaped. General Shan.

1147
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,999
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1148
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,839
Must be a vast network, John.

1149
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,599
Thousands of operatives.

1150
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,119
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1151
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,239
You cracked the code though, Sherlock.

1152
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,119
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them, now he knows it.

1153
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,479
No. No, I crack this code,

1154
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,639
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1155
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,719
Without you...

1156
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:49,719
without your assistance,

1157
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,999
we would not have found
passage into London.

1158
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,439
You have my thanks.

1159
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,319
We did not anticipate...

1160
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,879
We did not know this man would come.

1161
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,359
This Sherlock Holmes.

1162
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,479
And now your safety is compromised.

1163
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,919
I will not reveal your identity.
