1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,930
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,090
If you're successful with obtaining scylla,

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,190
You'll not only avoid jail time, but you could take great pride

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,850
In knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,310
To its own democracy.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,910
If you're killed while doing so,

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,990
A proper funeral will be provided.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,470
Gretchen has the rest of the pages.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,920
We can't go any further until she gives them back.

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,420
Why are we doing this again?

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,760
It's an insurance policy.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,320
You put a gun on me again,

13
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,520
And these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,950
Mike!

15
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,570
Michael, what's wrong? Talk to me! Michael?

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,670
I want syclla out of los angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,290
Brad, get out of there!

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,570
Push it! Don't do this!

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,410
Brad, no!

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,140
If anything should happen,

21
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,110
Call my mom in chicago.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,830
Nothing's going to happen.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,900
Where's brad's body now?

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,100
We got it on its way to the morgue,

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,910
And it's in the cooler

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,300
At homeland security where nobody can find it.

27
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,480
That ain't part of the deal.

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,600
You said if anything happened to us,

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,440
That we'd be returned to next of kin. No.

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,720
That's not exactly what I said.

31
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,650
No, that is exactly what you said.

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,540
No, it isn't exactly what I said, okay?

33
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,700
And he needs to stay a john doe until I say otherwise.

34
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,590
Okay? I'm dealing

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,520
With enough stuff already, and I've had my ass chewed out...

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,830
He's got...

37
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,560
He's got a mother, you know.

38
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,890
If you want scylla, and I assume you still do,

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,370
Brad bellick's body goes home to his mother.

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,030
All right, all right.

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,740
All right, I'm gonna take care of the body.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,090
But you guys

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,560
Need to get out of mourning.

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,630
Okay, we need to get back to work.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,190
You need to pack brad's stuff up,

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,400
And we need to get back to work.

47
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,630
And Fernando,

48
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,150
My friend, let me tell you something.

49
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,510
If you ever put your hands on me again,

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,160
I promise you, okay,

51
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,520
There's gonna be two bodies in the fridge.

52
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,360
But I need results.

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,380
Yeah, well, I need to see those missing pages.

54
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,810
So, what's it gonna be?

55
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,730
I heard you were dead.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,140
Who told you that?

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,670
A little bird.

58
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,800
That's awfully generous of you.

59
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,370
It's all a matter of timing.

60
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,740
The company is moving scylla to a bunker in pennsylvania.

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,060
When? Tomorrow.

62
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,580
You want to make sure to mention that

63
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,360
On the phone right away, as soon as...

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,940
You know, for an ex-employee,

65
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,620
You sure seem to know an awful lot about current company business.

66
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,810
Don't get paranoid.

67
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,130
I'm keeping one ear to the ground for your benefit,

68
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,250
Which is a really good reason to work with me and not against me.

69
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,800
All right, you know what? We got our pages.

70
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,900
Let's go.

71
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,030
That's enzen from transpo.

72
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,100
He's responsible for the power transfer.

73
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,920
And you know powell.

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,380
He's supervising

75
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,010
The security override.

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,560
It's a big job.

77
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,290
Perhaps we should call in david baker.

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,160
Just to be safe.

79
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,030
That won't be necessary.

80
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,460
We can do this all in-house, huh?

81
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,610
And scylla will be gone by morning.

82
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,460
I promised brad I would call his mom if anything happened.

83
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,250
I'll do it if you want.

84
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,950
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

85
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,590
Look at this.

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,400
He kept a badge from the police benefit.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
When he was a co in Fox River,

88
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,190
He-he failed the test to get into the academy

89
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,640
Five times.

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,510
These are right, right?

91
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,820
Thisis a map of the company's basement, right?

92
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,110
I don't know. It looks too simple.

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,710
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this.

94
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,250
These symbols-- they're...

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,940
They don't make any sense, and the letters, uh...

96
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,650
There's just something wrong.

97
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,440
This letter c--

98
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,050
It usually designates some kind of heating vent.

99
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,470
The m designates a meter.

100
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,200
This is some sort of condensing unit.

101
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,480
This is a plumbing part. It's called a p-trap.

102
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,620
They're all completely dissimilar items.

103
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,330
Logical design dictates they'd never

104
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,720
Be installed that randomly.

105
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,020
It just, um...

106
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,910
It doesn't make sense.

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,720
"c," "m," "e."

108
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,500
"c,"

109
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,350
"m," "e."

110
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,480
C, m, e.

111
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,120
C... M... E.

112
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,520
That's "see me."

113
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,680
These letters don't make any sense

114
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:25,920
If you think of them as symbols,

115
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,450
But they do if you think of them literally.

116
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,570
"do you see me?" he's asking

117
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,740
If you see him.

118
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,730
Where?

119
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,940
Here.

120
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,110
David baker?

121
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,910
Yeah, but who besides you two, would come up

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,340
With something like that, huh?

123
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,740
I mean, what's the point?

124
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,580
I don't know,

125
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,830
But we're never going to figure this blueprint out

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,710
If we can't find the person who drew it.

127
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,150
We need david baker.

128
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,560
Hello, darling.

129
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,740
Good morning.

130
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,740
Here is your coffee-- one sugar, two creams.

131
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,450
And those fingerprints you ordered.

132
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Gretchen's?

133
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,270
Yes. Gretchen louise morgan.

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,350
How did you pull off a thing like that?

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,470
I have a friend who works with the chips.

136
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,160
But don't get too excited. There's not much there.

137
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,640
Gretchen louise morgan.

138
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,190
3-29-77, johnstown, west virginia.

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,120
Her sister lives in riverside.

140
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,160
Daddy deceased.

141
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,370
Award-winning equestrian.

142
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,390
Iraqi war vet.

143
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,490
I'll be damned. Clean-cut chick.

144
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,210
At least on paper.

145
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,970
But I don't see any evidence

146
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,260
That she's related to chinese organized crime.

147
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,980
No husband in beijing?

148
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,890
No prior arrest for extortion?

149
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,780
Nope.

150
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,240
No mention of any of our friends? Hmm. I checked.

151
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,130
No Scofield, no burrows, no Whistler.

152
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,840
Whistler?

153
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,500
How do you know that name?

154
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,690
James Whistler?

155
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,550
I heard Scofield mention him one day.

156
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,660
What day?

157
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,580
The day that I met him.

158
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,260
In what context?

159
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,700
I-i don't remember.

160
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,920
Why? What's the big deal?

161
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,040
Who is he?

162
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,920
Nobody.

163
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,290
That will be all for now.

164
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,970
Here's another one-- david allen baker.

165
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,190
He's an advisor to the city planning commission.

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,740
Won an award for designing low-income housing.

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,540
Wife is named elaine, and there's

168
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,870
The address.

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,520
I'll print a map.

170
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,140
All right, we still

171
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,550
Need that sixth card, all right?

172
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,750
Really?

173
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,160
All right.

174
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,840
We've got at least 30 more yards to go

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,680
Past the water main before we get to the company building.

176
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,070
Michael, michael, see that?

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,840
That looks like it could be

178
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,480
Some sort of obstruction in the tunnel.

179
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,620
Whatever it is, whatever it takes,

180
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,810
We got to get through that in the next few hours.

181
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,050
I want you guys to go down there and get started.

182
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,730
Sara and I will go and look for, uh... For david baker.

183
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,840
And bellick gets back to his mom.

184
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,730
Yeah, and when we get scylla,

185
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,220
We're walking away from this crap.

186
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,350
Absolutely.

187
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,870
Sara...

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,100
Michael?

189
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,340
Michael.

190
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm okay.

191
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,010
You got him.

192
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,220
Where you gonna take him?

193
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,270
Hospital.

194
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,860
Come on, guys, let's not freak out, all right?

195
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,370
Calm down. This is my decision,

196
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,930
And not yours, and we're going to the hospital.

197
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,120
Well, what's wrong with him?

198
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,210
David baker.

199
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,730
I'll go. I'll find him.

200
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,030
Listen, don't forget to use your fake id at the hospital, though.

201
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,580
Shut the door. Okay.

202
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,540
Mr. White?

203
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,960
If you'd allow me to be nosy,

204
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,700
How long has Trishanne been part of the organization?

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,430
Temp agency sent her over

206
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,270
About a week before you got here.

207
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,360
If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look

208
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,030
At her application.

209
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,030
I always make a point of checking out the background

210
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,830
Of anyone who deals with my personal affairs.

211
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,850
I understand.

212
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,590
I'll talk to hr. Thank you.

213
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,880
Hey, uh, cole, you know what?

214
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,200
Um, today around noon,

215
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,820
I really need you

216
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,720
To step in for Andrew Blauner.

217
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,190
Host an intro.

218
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,070
New franchises from idaho.

219
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,780
We got to knock 'em out.

220
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,840
I'd like to see some of that Cole Pfeiffer magic.

221
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,030
Abracadabra.

222
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,110
Excuse me, sir?

223
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,750
Are you a salesman?

224
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,010
Yes, indeedy I am.

225
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,460
What can I do for you?

226
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,370
Well, I can see that you're busy,

227
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,500
But I didn't want you to be the last to know.

228
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,860
Scylla is moving.

229
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,620
Come back?

230
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,900
Don't worry. We're gonna stick to our original plan.

231
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,980
What exactly is the plan?

232
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,790
We wait.

233
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,420
Wait? Yes.

234
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,420
Okay, have you ever heard of noodling?

235
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,750
I don't believe so.

236
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,160
Well, then, what kind of hillbilly are you, really?

237
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,740
I'll explain it to you.

238
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,450
Noodling...

239
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,630
Is when a foolhardy bastard swims

240
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,100
To the bottom of a muddy riverbed

241
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,660
And he sticks his hand down into the deepest,

242
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,760
Darkest hole.

243
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,710
He's looking for a prize catfish.

244
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,120
Now, sometimes the catfish does live there,

245
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,310
And the noodler pulls it out

246
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,430
With his bare hand and he drags it ashore,

247
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,470
But sometimes, he reaches in that hole

248
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,100
And he finds a snapping turtle.

249
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,180
Bites his hand clean off.

250
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,260
Scofield's a noodler.

251
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,790
Yes, and if he reaches

252
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,530
Into the company hole and he finds scylla,

253
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,560
We take it and we sell it to feng.

254
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,030
If he gets a turtle, well...

255
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,860
Not our hand.

256
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,970
The contractors are here.

257
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,560
What the hell are you doing here?

258
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,420
I'm a client.

259
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,110
You're a client, huh?

260
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,310
Just keep it down; keep it down.

261
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,940
It's all part of the ruse.

262
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,480
We need some help. I'm already

263
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,870
Providing my services, white-collar style, all right?

264
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,420
Where's, where's pretty and the fatman?

265
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,630
Bellick's dead.

266
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,770
If you joke about it, I'll rip your tongue out.

267
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
Let's go, linc.

268
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,490
Sorry to bother you,

269
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,850
But I'm an internist and I brought my husband in.

270
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,080
He's in and out of consciousness

271
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,810
And he's got some symptoms that concern me.

272
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,720
I'd be really grateful if we could see a neurologist.

273
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,370
Does he have insurance?

274
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,890
I don't have the card,

275
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,850
But, um,

276
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,200
I have his i.D.

277
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,420
No, just fill this out.

278
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,880
Okay, thank you.

279
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,040
Mr. Freling?

280
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,590
Mr. Freling.

281
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,070
Yes, that's... That's me.

282
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,770
Is it always low?

283
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,630
A little.

284
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,410
Has anyone in your family ever suffered

285
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,220
From epilepsy, stroke, tias, any neurological disorder?

286
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,110
My mom.

287
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,270
Okay.

288
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,500
Jimmy, take this gentleman back to bay four.

289
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,940
Why are we relocating?

290
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,200
The scylla's security is the foundation

291
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,810
Of this entire organization.

292
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,830
I realize that,

293
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,370
But have you thought about the ramifications?

294
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,750
If we lose critical access,

295
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,270
It could compromise our timeline on stage two.

296
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,150
The plates and the facility are ready

297
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
To print as much currency as we need

298
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,550
At any time.

299
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,080
When will scylla be installed in pennsylvania?

300
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,290
Lisa, what's our timeline?

301
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,100
Actually, there's been a bit of a problem.

302
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,200
Dismantling the security

303
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,150
Surrounding scylla is a bit tricky.

304
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,700
It may take longer than we thought.

305
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,040
How much longer?

306
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,440
I can make this happen right now.

307
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,750
Yes,general.

308
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,970
Go get david baker.

309
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,210
Yes, sir.

310
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,830
Yes?

311
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,520
Uh, hello, I'm, uh, I'm looking for a mr. David baker.

312
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,380
He's not taking any new projects

313
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,600
Right now.

314
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,930
Actually, I had some... Some questions about something

315
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,820
That he worked on a few years ago.

316
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,830
Are you familiar with a project called scylla?

317
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,950
I'm working!

318
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,210
This man would like to talk to you about scylla.

319
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,660
You're company?

320
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,900
Yes, sir.

321
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,030
I'm in logistics, and I'd like to ask you some questions

322
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,870
About your original design.

323
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,500
It's been a long time since I thought about that.

324
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,100
Be lucky to remember anything.

325
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,030
Looks like you're pretty busy.

326
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,670
Do you mind if I take a look?

327
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,410
You know, bellick saved my life.

328
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,560
What?

329
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,520
Back when we were in prison in panama.

330
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,870
T-bag went crazy, he, he went nuts.

331
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,300
What happened?

332
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,260
He lit

333
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,200
Sona on fire, told everyone to run.

334
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,660
They can't shoot us all, he said.

335
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,880
It was a stampede, bro, i...

336
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,460
I was down getting trampled.

337
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,490
I, I couldn't get up,

338
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,350
I couldn't breathe, I thought I was going to die...

339
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,550
But then something pulled me back to my feet.

340
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,550
It was bellick.

341
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,460
He saved my life.

342
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,800
That wall's got to come down?!

343
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,590
Unless you got a better idea.

344
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,270
Okay.

345
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,800
What was that?

346
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,760
I don't know. I think I stepped on something.

347
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,450
What's going on, linc?

348
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,130
I don't know, man.

349
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,810
It's some kind of explosive.

350
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,040
Explosive? Then shouldn't I be dead?

351
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,580
If you move will be.

352
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,330
They're underground, 

353
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,140
They gonna not be able to reach you. 

354
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,070
And you know what, they'll be fine without you.

355
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,850
Right.

356
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,120
You ever heard of Fox River?

357
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,100
Maybe we could talk about it over dinner.

358
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,970
I got a gift card to the red lobster

359
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,630
Over off the interstate.

360
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,660
I never thought the guys would be so sad for brad bellick.

361
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,460
A lot of things have changed since Fox River.

362
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,090
You know you can't control this.

363
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,740
It's funny, I was just about to tell you the same thing.

364
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,330
Whatever it is, we can manage it.

365
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,280
We just need to know what we're dealing with.

366
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,760
What if I don't want to know?

367
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,810
Kevin freling?

368
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,980
Should only take a few minutes.

369
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,480
You ready?

370
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,770
I'm ready.

371
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,000
My goal is to build one city that entirely self-sustains,

372
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,490
Depending on no outside resources.

373
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,600
A community living entirely in harmony.

374
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,920
How close is it to becoming a reality?

375
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,090
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

376
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,510
People look at something

377
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,440
Like this and they think it's impossible.

378
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,920
In reality, I could make it happen tomorrow.

379
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,710
Like what they built in dubai.

380
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Exactly-- grand ideas

381
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,370
Brought into reality.

382
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,210
This won't just serve the rich.

383
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,280
How long have you been working for them?

384
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,320
Too long.

385
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,090
I came in in '94.

386
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,390
I was never good at collecting a paycheck.

387
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,910
Always freelance.

388
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,920
Partially retired all the time.

389
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,280
I like to finish a job and then move on.

390
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,400
Put it in the past.

391
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,980
Do you always leave your name behind,

392
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,800
Instead of the correct specifications?

393
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,920
Only on the scylla project.

394
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,210
Well, we're considering modifications and...

395
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
I was hoping that you...

396
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,040
Could help me figure out

397
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,600
What should really appear on those blueprints.

398
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,050
As of right now, they don't mean much.

399
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,920
Didn't you read the legend?

400
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,430
Sure.

401
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,510
But we still had a lot of trouble.

402
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,010
You're not company.

403
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,190
What should I do?

404
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,640
Stay calm. Calm?! You just said

405
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,760
I'm standing on a bomb!

406
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,040
We'll work it out.

407
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,330
You think gretchen set us up?

408
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,230
"the lessons

409
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,660
Taught by our founder, mister..."

410
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,500
"...Harvey hall."

411
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,530
"pathway to personal freedom."

412
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,670
Do people actually buy this nonsense?

413
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,080
Let go of me. You're coming with me or through that glass.

414
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,490
Choose.

415
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,010
Place of business.

416
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,770
Gate allows us to find the pathway

417
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,330
To personal freedom.

418
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,930
Define our boundaries.

419
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,930
See past them.

420
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,590
Let me tell you a story about the founder

421
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,080
Of this great program.

422
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,590
You know, I'm gonna tell you a better story

423
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,960
About captivity than the regular old spiel.

424
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,560
Years back,

425
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,240
I was providing volunteer leadership

426
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,090
In a local penitentiary.

427
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,660
I worked with the head guard,

428
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,640
A big, burly, bowlegged brat.

429
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,170
Mean as the devil.

430
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,660
All the prisoners were afraid of him, even the murderers.

431
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,560
And one day, brad said to me,

432
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,660
"cole, I want you to get out of here.

433
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,130
"i want you to get out of here right now,

434
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,350
'cause I can tell you're a man who loves freedom."

435
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,210
And I said, "well, what about you, brad?

436
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,390
What about you?"

437
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,990
He said, "oh, yeah, I'm... I'm...

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,250
I'm gonna be free someday when I retire."

439
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,470
I recently got the news that he had passed away.

440
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,150
And where was he?

441
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,270
Still in that prison.

442
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,560
Still in the captivity of negativity.

443
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,680
Sorry, folks.

444
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,080
Old brad.

445
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,950
As my papa used to say,

446
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,210
"stand by, your glasses steady,

447
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,650
"and drink to your comrade's eyes.

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,120
"here's a toast to the dead already,

449
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,100
And hurrah for the next to die."

450
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,620
I needed to make sure

451
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,460
That I would have access to your test results,

452
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,070
So I told the triage nurse

453
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,230
That I was your wife.

454
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,590
Has a nice ring.

455
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,230
Are you kevin freling?

456
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,320
Yes, I am.

457
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,530
I'm dr. Malden.

458
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm a neurologist. And you're...

459
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,370
Cameron eberline. I'm a... An internist.

460
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,410
Do you have the results?

461
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,040
It's gonna take a little while.

462
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,460
Uh, looking at the family history,

463
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,010
I'd like to admit you here.

464
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,550
We're working on a room.

465
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,600
Just for now,

466
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,770
Until we get the test results back.

467
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,480
I don't think that'll be necessary, but thank you.

468
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,590
It would be best if you could rest

469
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,150
Where you could be monitored.

470
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,220
After that, we'll determine

471
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,910
What the best course of action is.

472
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:23,990
Agreed?

473
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,400
I think we have to go. I'm sorry.

474
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,350
Hold on, hold on-- how long... How long will it take

475
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,740
To get the results? Couple of hours.

476
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,520
But we'll get you in a room before then.

477
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,550
Just wait here. Thank you.

478
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,160
Come on.

479
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,200
You know what happens?

480
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,400
They take over your life.

481
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,770
You don't own it anymore.

482
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,950
That is not what happened to me.

483
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,300
Then, somehow you stayed out of trouble.

484
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,530
You did what they told you to do.

485
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,720
Maybe that's why you stuck around, huh?

486
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,640
Right here in los angeles.

487
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,990
In my case, they had something on me,

488
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
And they used it and they never let me go.

489
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,070
They've killed hundreds, thousands of people

490
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,260
In the pursuit of power, you know that.

491
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,840
We lost a good man yesterday trying to stop them.

492
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,910
They hurt a lot of people, david.

493
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,490
David.

494
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,120
Look...

495
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,820
I stay out of the politics.

496
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,620
It was a job.

497
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,960
I specialized in security engineering.

498
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,620
The scylla project was a choice assignment, so I took it.

499
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,490
They told you what it was, didn't they?

500
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,020
They told you what it was, and now

501
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,220
You wish that you never helped them, but you're trapped.

502
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,630
You're trapped like I was.

503
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,890
You talk like it's all in the present.

504
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,120
It is!

505
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,100
I know you want to move on.

506
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,890
Look at what you're doing.

507
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,730
Are you trying to make up for something?

508
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,760
Forget the charitable city of the future,

509
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,280
And worry about the world that you live in right now, david.

510
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,570
What they did-- what they're doing--

511
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,090
Is not my fault.

512
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,950
You put your name in there for a reason.

513
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,480
You wanted someone to find you,

514
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,740
And if you tell me what I need to know,

515
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,770
I can do something for both of us.

516
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,840
Where is your husband?

517
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,730
He went to run some errands-- he should be right back.

518
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,730
That's his car in the driveway, isn't it?

519
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,500
Just a moment. I'll call him on his cell.

520
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,240
Excuse me

521
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,560
You knew about this, didn't you?

522
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,280
First of all, I have no idea

523
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,440
Why the company would want

524
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,670
To put an explosive device

525
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,560
Of any kind under their own building.

526
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,410
We're under the courtyard. And you know what,

527
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,760
I honestly had no idea

528
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,410
That any of this was even here.

529
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,960
That being said...

530
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,750
These look a lot like jz33 anti-personnel blast mines.

531
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,340
Back in fallujah,

532
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,800
The muj used to bury them outside their firm base.

533
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,540
Get rid of them.

534
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,370
I'm no expert, but I have an idea.

535
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,530
What's beeping?

536
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,990
It beeps!

537
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,710
Wow, you must've stepped on this just right.

538
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,510
Your weight is evenly distributed

539
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,880
Across the pressure plate,

540
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,190
And you haven't engaged the firing pin.

541
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,650
You can't move an inch.

542
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,570
We know.

543
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,890
What's your idea?

544
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,780
Well, my idea is that he moves an inch.

545
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,150
That way, I can get to the hole,

546
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,370
And I can dismantle the firing pin.

547
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,280
Right now, he's standing on it, and I can't do anything.

548
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,700
No, no, no, linc, llama tu hermano.

549
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,160
What? Call your brother, please.

550
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,440
You-- you stay here.

551
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,630
Fine.

552
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,160
It's my brother.

553
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,320
Michael...

554
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,400
Let's go.

555
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,260
Sara...

556
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,880
You're not leaving, are you?

557
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,920
You have our number.

558
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,090
And who are you again?

559
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,820
He prefers to wait at home.

560
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,290
I'm monitoring him. He's leaving ama

561
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,000
In a potentially fragile condition.

562
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,650
Look, I'm not stupid.

563
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,780
I know who you are,

564
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,110
And I'm not gonna turn you in.

565
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,740
My concern is for what's going on

566
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,940
With your health.

567
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,200
They aren't here for you,

568
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,520
And I'm telling you, in your condition...

569
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,770
Thank you, doctor; I appreciate your help.

570
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,980
Please do call us.

571
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,090
Can I help you?

572
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,200
I messed up.

573
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,830
What do you mean?

574
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,000
Today, I was working with bagwell.

575
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,560
He's been compliant as hell.

576
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,600
I thought that I would make him happy.

577
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,990
He wanted to talk about Gretchen Morgan. Right, and what happened?

578
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,900
And I slipped up.

579
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,270
I mentioned Whistler.

580
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,580
This one is tough, I'm telling you.

581
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,670
Bagwell, Gretchen Morgan-- they're thugs.

582
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,940
I have been face down with a gun

583
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,080
To the back of my head more than once.

584
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:13,960
All right.

585
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,080
Look, I don't want you to do something

586
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,450
That you don't want to do.

587
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,500
You're a good agent-- we could reassign...

588
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,510
No, no, that is not it.

589
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,160
Look, I can handle this.

590
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,310
I'm just...

591
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,560
I'm just kicking myself.

592
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,280
I could find something else for you to do, okay?

593
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,300
This thing has gotten way out of hand.

594
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,690
Dallow is on my back, and the company is moving scylla...

595
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,850
No.

596
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,010
I'm fine.

597
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,160
Are you sure?

598
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,210
I really think we can do this, don.

599
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,420
We can bring the company down.

600
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,920
Ego is the only reason I coded my name into those blueprints.

601
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,840
I don't feel guilty about anything.

602
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,830
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.

603
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,980
Hello?

604
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,720
Alex, we...

605
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,380
What?

606
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,030
Got a problem.

607
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,630
There's a damn minefield down there.

608
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,300
Hello, I can't hear you.

609
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,690
Sucre's in trouble.

610
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,940
He's standing on a mine.

611
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,600
We need to deactivate it.

612
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,360
Linc, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

613
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,420
They're here, david.

614
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,980
What do they want from me? They're moving scylla,

615
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,500
Protecting it-- everything you did for them,

616
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,220
They want you to do it again.

617
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,580
You think you can stop them?

618
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,090
I know all about you.

619
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,710
I've known about you for six months--

620
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,180
Ever since somebody stole those plans

621
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,290
From the company.

622
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,030
It will never work.

623
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,470
You won't get past the first wall.

624
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,510
What about the first wall?

625
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,560
What's gonna stop me, huh? The minefield?

626
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,380
Please... Don't tell 'em.

627
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,650
We've got him. Sweep the area.

628
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,590
There's a dirt road at the bottom of the hill.

629
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,020
It will take you out.

630
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,330
Your husband... Just go.

631
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,320
He won't help you; that will.

632
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,570
Lincoln, go call him again.

633
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,410
Linc, go call him.

634
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,950
Linc, go call him!

635
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,660
What will michael know about this?

636
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,080
I mean, it's not exactly within his realm of expertise.

637
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,240
We're wasting time.

638
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,320
I gave you a semiprofessional assessment.

639
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,540
What's wrong?

640
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,170
You don't trust me, Fernando?

641
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,050
Why should he?

642
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,820
Because we all want scylla.

643
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,090
And I'm not gonna let a giant pack

644
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,980
Of firecrackers stand in our way.

645
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,220
Or would you like me to call

646
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,440
The bomb squad?

647
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,040
Look, I am offering to do you a massive favor here.

648
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,930
If that thing blows while I'm pulling the pin,

649
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,600
He loses a leg-- I lose a face!

650
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,250
Now, don't worry, Fernando.

651
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,540
I'm known for my steady hand.

652
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,370
Take a deep breath, okay?

653
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,850
Keep your weight even.

654
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,210
And I need you to shift slowly,

655
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,560
Very slowly--

656
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,180
One inch to your left, so I can get to the pin.

657
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,370
Oh, no, I can't... I can't, I can't do it.

658
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,790
Are you all right?

659
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,640
Have you, uh, heard anything?

660
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,230
They have to deactivate.

661
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,290
I got a key.

662
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,930
A legend to the blueprint.

663
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,090
Baker gave you this? No.

664
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,190
His wife gave it to me. They came for baker.

665
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,140
All right, well, this makes more sense.

666
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,400
These, uh, these symbols

667
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,480
Aren't for p-traps, they're...

668
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,660
They're microphones.

669
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,530
And the letter "v" isn't for vacuum,

670
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,360
That's a generator.

671
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,180
This is a line of jz33 land mines

672
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,610
Buried 80 millimeters underground,

673
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,270
About seven feet from the outer wall--

674
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,360
That's must be what linc was talking about.

675
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,160
It says, "manual override only.

676
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,730
"all conventional attempts to dismantle the jz33

677
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,710
Will activate the scylla alarms."

678
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,640
This isn't just a land mine.

679
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,380
This is, uh... This is an alarm.

680
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,980
We can't sit here all night.

681
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,840
Okay?

682
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,810
You ready?

683
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,590
Hey, it's linc. You know what to do.

684
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,630
What are you doing?

685
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,670
Linc!

686
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,480
Sucre!

687
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,130
Stop!

688
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,980
Stop!

689
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,850
Don't move.

690
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,870
Don't move.

691
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
Don't move.

692
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,350
You can't dismantle the land mine

693
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,470
Without setting off the alarm. So I either

694
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,270
Set off the alarm

695
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,280
Or blow up and die. No.

696
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,030
There's a manual override.

697
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,490
It'll cut the power long enough for you

698
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,550
To step off without removing the pin.

699
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,060
How do you know for sure?

700
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,900
I found david baker.

701
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,660
Sucre. Step off.

702
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,670
You can do it. You only have

703
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,210
20 seconds. Come on.

704
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,640
I can't... Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

705
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,880
Michael and I figured it out.

706
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,590
Step off right now.

707
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,660
No, no, you guys all go. I'll--

708
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,650
We all don't have to die. I'll do it alone.

709
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,160
Nobody's gonna die today!

710
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,550
Step off!

711
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,300
Step off!

712
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,570
What's behind this wall?

713
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,740
Scylla.

714
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,180
When do you find out?

715
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,950
The doctor is supposed to call, uh... Any minute.

716
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,420
Look, um...

717
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,160
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.

718
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,180
Don't worry about it.

719
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,710
You know, what gretchen did for sucre

720
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,470
Made me realize we could use her.

721
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,910
I asked for the sixth key.

722
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,180
What'd she say?

723
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,530
She's on it.

724
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,660
You all right?

725
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,410
All right.

726
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,640
We're about to go to the airfield.

727
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,310
We're gonna ship brad's body off to his mother.

728
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,780
Got his things here.

729
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,070
Where is he?

730
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,160
Over here.

731
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,740
His mother will appreciate that.

732
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,020
Mrs. Bellick.

733
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,650
This is Fernando Sucre.

734
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,430
Great job today.

735
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,440
I'm sorry to hear about your friend.

736
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,700
But that's, um, admirable work,

737
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,800
Volunteering with a bunch of criminals like that.

738
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,320
We're all the same, really.

739
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,320
Here's the application you requested

740
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,730
For the desk girl.

741
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,210
You have a good night, cole.

742
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,180
You, too. Thanks.

743
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,200
Hello?

744
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,940
Hello?

745
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
Okay.

746
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,100
We will.

747
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,220
Thank you.

748
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,320
As we've all learned the hard way,

749
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,950
There's an electronic alarm barrier

750
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:29,010
Around the perimeter of the foundation.

751
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,720
Unfortunately,

752
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,880
That is scylla's most primitive line of defense.

753
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,310
The wall itself

754
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,560
Is fortified with steel fiber.

755
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,590
The good news is, on the inside here,

756
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,670
There are no cameras.

757
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,740
The company doesn't want any

758
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,790
Visual evidence that scylla exists.

759
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,700
The bad news is that there are both

760
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,320
Weight and microphonic sensors here and here

761
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,410
That will alert company security

762
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,990
To the presence of any breathing human being

763
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,410
That weighs more than two pounds.

764
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,880
As far as I can tell,

765
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,340
The first challenge is getting around that wall.

766
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,730
And then we can worry about crossing the floor.

767
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,260
Without touching it.

768
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,650
In silence.

769
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,150
It's complicated.

770
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,810
But, uh, I'm already working on something.

771
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,470
Brad didn't die in vain.

772
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,230
We can make this work.

773
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,280
That was the neurologist.

774
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,900
You have a hypothalamus hamaratoma.

775
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,280
It's really rare.

776
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,990
You were probably born with it.

777
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,170
Um, things have changed-- it's been growing,

778
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,820
Which is why you've been experiencing your symptoms.

779
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,070
And the doctor feels that you need surgery.

780
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,710
Two days.

781
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,080
That's, uh, that's what I need.

782
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,530
No. Tomorrow.

783
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,230
Otherwise you could die, and there's no alternative.
