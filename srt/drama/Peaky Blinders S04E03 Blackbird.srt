This business directly affects Arthur,
but he's not here,

214
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,020
so we'll take a vote without him.

215

What business?

216
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,015
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

217
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,657
An informant told us

218
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,654
that six years ago, Luca Changretta
came from New York to Birmingham

219
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,652
to be best man at his cousin's wedding.

220
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,300
POLLY: We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn on Broadgate

221
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,609
for the photographs.

222
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,419
The photographer kept the negatives.

223
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,856
I persuaded him to give us copies.

224
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,172
And to enlarge this one.

225
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,932
That is Luca Changretta.

226
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,536
TOMMY: I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

227
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,494
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

228
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,573
which means the chances are
they are the men who come to kill us.

229
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,730
We need to get both these photographs
into pubs and on street corners.

230
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,619
Then we put it about
that there's a reward for information.

231
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,611
We also propose that we give a copy
of this photograph to Mr Aberama Gold.

232
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,972
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur that pulls the trigger.

233
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,494
Tradition will just fuck us up.

234
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,770
We should wait for Arthur.

235
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,613
Arthur's not here, Ada.

236
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,737
We need Luca Changretta dead. That's it.

let someone know.
We thought you were dead.

No there's not, there's 13.

I just killed two of them.

Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

341
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,497
I did it.

342

All right, calm down
and tell me about the men you killed.

my fucking job anyway.

Because this was all my fault.

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,214
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

362
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,416
Through the back fucking door

that was supposed to be
locked and bolted.

00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,409

Somebody with keys.

Yeah. Why don't you sit down
and work it out for yourself.

Is that what I am, eh?

What are you doing?

Now fire it into the fireplace.

Please.

397
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,497
- All right.
- Fire it.

398
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,214
Get rid of it.

399
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,653
Then we'll go to bed.

We'll do anything you like.

401
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,616
Just fire the gun, Arthur.

402
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,980
Fire it.

You go tell Polly...

405
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,169
there are rules between a man and woman.

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,493
There are rules.

That I have to do this.

408
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,018
I have to do it.

00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,332

Was what fear or hatred?

Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

419
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,897
Was it fear of the Italians

420
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,769
or hatred of us

421
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,931
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

422
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,417
I didn't unlock any door.

423

You mean you don't know?

431
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,372
I run a factory
full of black leg non-union labour.

432
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,058
I live in a street
full of men laid off or on strike.

433
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,976
Look at the photograph, Mr Devlin,
and tell me who are the men

434
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,813
- that contacted you.
- No.

435

- No, you listen to me.

and burnt on my shift.

439
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,619
And you ask me why I'm getting on
the midnight train to Glasgow.

440
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,172
Who else has the keys to that door?

441
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,455
They hang on a hook inside my office.

442
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,777
Today I left the office unlocked.

443
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,738
- Why?
- Because I forgot.

444
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,495
Because I left in a hurry.

445
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,175
Because there were men
trying to set fire to the factory.

446
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,572
Mr Shelby, may I tell you something?

447
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,212
You have a lot of enemies.

448
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,732
Communists. Italians.

449
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,737
Before the factory came out on strike,

450
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,054
I heard word that two Italians attended
a communist party meeting in Stechford.

451
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,933
They hardly spoke English.

452
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,451
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory,

453
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,975
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

454
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,214
Mr Shelby, my train leaves at 12:00.

455
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,737
It's just gone 11:00.
I can still make it.

456
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,137
Please. For my kids.

457
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,740
I need you here.

458
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,211
Isiah, get three of our men
with police badges

462
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,933
For the curtains.

Before you, I was
an ordinary working man.

- Do I not get a drink?
- No.

in this photograph before?

What?

You're a member

I did some research on you.

It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

KittyJurossi.

501
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,539
You were in love with Kitty's sister.
Greta Jurossi. Before the war.

502
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,293
Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

503
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,412
Her parents were Italian.

504
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,616
They didn't approve of a Watery Lane
Gypsy, but you won them over.

With your charm. Sweetness.

Very, very thorough research.

507
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,057
Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption.

508
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,935
And Kitty said you were at her bedside
for three months.

509
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,852
Every day, holding her hand.

510
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,457
And after she died you went away to war.

511
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,374
Kitty said that the sweet boy who left
never came back.

512
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,294
No one came back.

Here's the funniest thing.

514
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,289
She said in those days
you believed in things.

515
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,015
In justice. Fairness.

516
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,256
Once you saw a man beating his horse
and you fought him.

517

He was twice your size but you beat him.

518

And then you beat him with his own whip.

Kitty always liked to tell tall tales.

520

She's a party member now.

521
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,377
She swears
before you enlisted in the army

522
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,736
you joined the Communist party yourself.

I've also done my research.

Your sweetheart was at Passchendaele.

he was listed among the shell shocked.

This afternoon two men came into
my factory and tried to kill my brother.

535
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,819
I believe a Stechford Communist party
member let him in.

I was wondering if you might be able
to help me in my investigations.

Kitty said next time I see you,
before we start fighting,

I should send you her love
from the good old days

Two former workhouses.

00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,137
I want you to be
in charge of the project.

All right, come on, let's go.

Why?

660
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,533
Because I promised someone
I'd change the world.

661
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,372
You do realise, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

662
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,059
Yeah, I know.

663
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,975

- How was your day?
- Yeah, it was okay.

667
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,734
Good man. Well done.

668
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,700
No trouble?

669
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,817
No. No trouble.

670
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,414
And she looked after you?

671
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,932
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

672
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,534
Not when they don't even want to do it,

except for the money.

674

Everything's for the money, Finn.

675
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,255
Yeah, I know. But...

676
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,899
She said, "Be a man."

677
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,330
And were you a man?

678
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,456
Yeah.

679
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,650
But then I apologised to her.
Because she looked so tired.

680
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,573

She was right.

684
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,496
You need to be a fucking man.

685

686
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,333
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

687
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,016
I don't go round apologising.
Do I?

688
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,376
No.

689

691

- Yeah.
- So...

692
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,854
Be a fucking man.

693
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,013

Yes.

The boy in the hospital

In return for what?

710
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,535
Tommy Shelby.

711
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,254
And, uh, why should I trust you?

712
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,213
Because you know our history.

713
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,499
You know what happened between us.

714
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,696
You are an unlikely Cassius.

You know, my mother...

00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,693
My mother knew your mother.

718
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,331
She taught her how to read.

719
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,218
Did she tell you
that John and Arthur spared her life?

720
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,814
When Tommy wanted her dead.

721
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,494
Yeah.

722
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,772
And now she's given me
the information about you people.

723

So Tommy Shelby was right.

His, uh, ruthlessness

725
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,018
was justified.

726
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,299
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

727
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,492
John was a good boy.

728

Arthur tries.

729
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,178
Tommy's different.

730
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,738
You take Tommy.
Spare the rest.

my mother used to say this about you.

"That Polly Gray,
