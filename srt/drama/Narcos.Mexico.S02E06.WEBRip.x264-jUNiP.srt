1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,186
General Zaragoza!

2
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,648
The French are retreating!

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,692
Send the cavalry!

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,950
After them! Fire the artillery!

5
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,207
Bring the prisoner forward.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,626
You go that way. I'll go this way.

7
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,107
Stop right there!
Get up and start walking!

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,443
- Get up and walk!
- Just a second.

9
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,361
Enough! Walk!

10
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,036
Downstairs!

11
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,670
On your knees.

12
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,548
You're a spy for the enemy.

13
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,217
Say your line.

14
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,594
Long live France!

15
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,849
The hero killed her with one shot!

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,067
Will they be angry?
It's Mama's favorite rug.

17
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,320
If they ask questions,
I'll do the talking.

18
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,665
The gentleman will see you now.

19
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,598
I wanted to congratulate you
on your brother's nomination.

20
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,892
He's going to make a fine president.

21
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,186
We're very proud.

22
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,398
It's time for...

23
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,359
a younger generation
in Los Pinos, right?

24
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,027
Exactly.

25
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,031
From what I've read, your
brother seems like a smart man.

26
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,158
He's brilliant.

27
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,161
Whereas I'm simply clever.

28
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,416
Come on, clever usually pays better.

29
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,878
You're in the hotel industry, correct?

30
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,426
Yes, but I have other
businesses as well.

31
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,930
Import, export...

32
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,933
You've done well for yourself.

33
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,184
Can't complain.

34
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,313
I've worked hard.

35
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,733
Yes. Hard work.
Always the cornerstone.

36
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,070
Bet you come across a lot of pretty
girls in the hotel business.

37
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,866
You have tennis courts
at your properties?

38
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,204
Yeah, one or two of them.

39
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,582
Why?

40
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,337
I've always enjoyed the sight
of a woman in a tennis skirt,

41
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,672
with those white shoes they wear.

42
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,679
I'd like to invite you...

43
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,058
to spend some time at my hotel

44
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,352
and be my guest of honor.
What do you think?

45
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,648
We could arrange a tennis
match for you, I'm sure.

46
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,359
I don't care much for Guadalajara.

47
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,071
Prefer the beach.

48
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,656
I have properties all over.

49
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,617
Whatever you'd like.

50
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,872
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about...

51
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,416
all the things I can offer you.

52
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,878
I'd... I'd like the
opportunity to help...

53
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,048
you and your brother, obviously.

54
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,841
You donate to the party?

55
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,302
Of course, every chance I get.

56
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,347
Then you've already helped immeasurably.

57
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,058
My brother's going to do great
things for this country.

58
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,856
I came to propose a relationship.

59
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,819
A more direct one.

60
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,324
I can be an asset...

61
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,244
to you and your brother.

62
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,788
Not only professionally, but...

63
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,542
personally, a friendship.

64
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,877
I'm someone who believes in that.

65
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,880
Who doesn't need a friend, right?

66
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,386
A discrete friend.

67
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,222
And more importantly...

68
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,392
a generous one.

69
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,440
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but we're not in need of all that.

70
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,529
I can't be certain what the future
holds for the hotel business...

71
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,533
but I can tell you one thing
about my brother and I.

72
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,118
We value family...

73
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,203
and loyalty.

74
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,040
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra has
been a loyal friend to our family

75
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,959
since my brother and I were boys.

76
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,004
I'm aware of that.

77
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,923
I've heard that story before.

78
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:48,926
And I'm...

79
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,888
I'm not going to lie.

80
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,599
I've had disagreements with Don Juan.

81
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,311
Well, I hope your issues
can be resolved amicably.

82
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,368
Because if anything were
to happen to Señor Guerra,

83
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,398
my brother and I would be...

84
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,359
very upset.

85
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,363
Juan is quite a character.

86
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,869
What I can tell you is that...

87
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,663
my brother's going to be
everybody's president.

88
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,920
We look forward to your vote.

89
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,516
What kind of fucking politician
doesn't want money?

90
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,760
You're sure he speaks for his brother?

91
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,790
Always.

92
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,729
They're a team, hammer and nail.

93
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,316
- I've heard things. He's a player.
- A player?

94
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,944
A player would take the money.

95
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,113
- Why the fuck doesn't he want my money?
- No idea.

96
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,865
Find out what's going on.

97
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,994
I want every fucking detail.

98
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,038
And Guerra?

99
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,292
Can't touch him.

100
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,965
But the old goat can take another
shot at you any time he likes.

101
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,509
I know.

102
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,471
I'm going to Sinaloa.

103
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,474
Safer than Guadalajara.

104
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,642
Motherfuckers.

105
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,940
Got more on that situation
between Tijuana and Sinaloa.

106
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,151
Now what? They're still at it?

107
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,320
We told them no more bullshit violence.

108
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,033
But I'm not sure the boys
were really listening.

109
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,208
Game over.

110
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,478
After Chapo's thing,

111
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,587
'Mon went after Cochi's
favorite mariachi.

112
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,922
Hey, asshole. Get down.

113
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,717
Please, mister, I'm begging you.

114
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,595
Grab his good hand.
You know Cielito Lindo, man?

115
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,597
No! Don't do it!

116
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,432
And Cochiloco...

117
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,934
he didn't appreciate that.

118
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,115
Hey, hose that shit off.

119
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,036
Call Benjamín and Palma.

120
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,245
It stops now.

121
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,749
Settle on a number for the taxes
they ducked, that ends it.

122
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,439
Let me know as soon as you find
out something on the brothers.

123
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,628
Let's go, Clavel.

124
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,561
You think that shit works?

125
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,607
Couldn't tell you.

126
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,736
I went to bat for you.

127
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,114
Keeping your team down
here, it wasn't easy.

128
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,161
Well, this new angle we got,
it feels promising.

129
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,248
This new informant...

130
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,208
you trust him?

131
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,628
Not exactly.

132
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,820
But he hasn't steered us wrong yet.

133
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,801
The cash keeps Félix on the
right side of the government

134
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,302
and the plaza bosses.

135
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,970
This CI?

136
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,681
He can help put all that into play.

137
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,740
If we can weaken Félix

138
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:27,019
without having to go
back and cut in State,

139
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,231
then I can live with there being
things I don't know about.

140
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,775
As long as no one else
knows about them either.

141
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,448
So this CI, some kind of trafficker?

142
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,701
Law enforcement.

143
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,288
Félix was in Panama last month.

144
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,375
Meeting with members of the Cali cartel.

145
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,752
What was on the agenda?

146
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,558
Not sure, but it ended

147
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,631
with Félix committing
to move more weight.

148
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,883
Lots more.

149
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,344
Why now?

150
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,848
El Padrino's feeling the pressure.

151
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,393
Does this tie into the reports about
the tension between his plazas?

152
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,812
We think they could be related.
Sure.

153
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,484
There's been talk of major construction
somewhere outside Juárez.

154
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,528
Construction of what?

155
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,821
Runways.

156
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,592
That's the one thing we're
still trying to figure out.

157
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,996
Who the hell's gonna run transpo
between Colombia and Mexico now?

158
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,082
The new Matta-Ballesteros.

159
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,421
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

160
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,007
Used to be some kind of pilot,
among other things.

161
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,718
Now Félix has him buying
up passenger planes.

162
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,012
Federation's building
their own air fleet.

163
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,263
Running it out of Juárez.

164
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,974
Yeah, if we can pin down
Félix's distribution hub,

165
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,727
then we can unlock his
entire route network.

166
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,979
Track shipments as
they cross the border,

167
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,439
pick them off one by one.

168
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,608
That's right. Bleed the motherfucker.

169
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,611
Starve him of his cash until
the government cuts him off.

170
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,321
You know, hangs him out to dry.

171
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,198
Well...

172
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,576
Amado just bought a one-way
ticket to Belmopan, Belize.

173
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,369
What the fuck for?

174
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,039
That's where Aero Tropical
is based. It's an airline.

175
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,042
Or it used to be. They have
just declared bankruptcy.

176
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,523
They're liquidating their entire
fleet at an auction next week.

177
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,674
I want regular updates.

178
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,680
I got a couple things that
I need your help tracking down.

179
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,310
What the hell is all this?

180
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,480
Just some equipment we
need to work a new lead.

181
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,081
Be sure to use your knees, bro.

182
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,798
Grab my bag.

183
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,791
Hey, boss.

184
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,586
Good to be back home in Sinaloa?

185
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,558
When are you coming home?

186
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:57,354
I'm not sure. Have some
business I need to handle here.

187
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,273
Is everything okay?

188
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,943
Yeah. I just need to
figure some things out.

189
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,072
Hang on, I can put the
baby on the phone.

190
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,450
No, no, no. Maybe later.

191
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,368
I'm a little busy right now.

192
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,954
I'll call you later.

193
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,946
I didn't expect to see you again.

194
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,060
But here I am.

195
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,065
And with such lovely company.

196
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:46,028
Thought it was a good idea for
all of us to meet. We need more.

197
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,616
At least 700 kilos this time.

198
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,161
Business must be good.

199
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,748
We've been saving our
allowances. Right, doll?

200
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,710
Give me two weeks.

201
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,968
I hear things are changing in Mexico.

202
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,679
Changing how?

203
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,223
Cali's going to start moving
product through the Gulf

204
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,141
with Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

205
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,062
But I don't see why that
should change our arrangement.

206
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,066
Going forward,

207
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,988
maybe we can make this
an exclusive relationship.

208
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,036
Knock ten percent off every
load over 400 kilos,

209
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,539
you're the only supplier
we do business with.

210
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,214
Félix has competition now.
He's weak.

211
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,299
We need to push harder.

212
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,093
It's time to expand.

213
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,609
Every time I sit down with him,
I feel like I need to wash my hands.

214
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,804
WHO WILL YOU PICK IN THIS ELECTION?

215
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,046
ON JULY 6TH JUÁREZ NEEDS YOUR VOTE

216
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,080
Amat, don't forget to vote, huh?

217
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,350
This is it.

218
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,561
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

219
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,897
And I thought our last
place was a shithole.

220
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,940
Home sweet home.

221
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,537
Welcome to Juárez.

222
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,421
All right, got it.

223
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,344
Indian motherfucker.

224
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,562
Listen up!

225
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,108
I spoke to Azul.

226
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,821
Says this shit with Tijuana has to stop.

227
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,617
Hey... I mean it, man.

228
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,494
Come on, Chapo.

229
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,247
Damn it, man.
Fuck those pussies.

230
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,250
Félix says it's over. So it's over.

231
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,586
We have to negotiate a price.

232
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,255
Kid's hurt, man. Look at him.

233
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,843
Put his heart and soul
in that fucking tunnel.

234
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,139
Your shit with the
steamroller didn't help.

235
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,268
Ramón fucked with a musician, man.
That's like picking on a child.

236
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,188
Fucking asshole.

237
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,108
Okay, fuck it. I'll talk to them.

238
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,570
At the end of the day,
shit's just money.

239
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,657
Go back and forth a little first.

240
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,826
Just not too hard.

241
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,287
For real, Cochi, don't mess with Ramón.

242
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,331
Fuck him, with his shirts.

243
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,877
I'll just talk with Benjamín
or the other one...

244
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,421
Eduardo?

245
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,549
Javier, the kid?

246
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,301
The other one, with the mopey face.

247
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,220
- Francisco.
- Him, Francisco.

248
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,680
He loves me. I'll talk with him.

249
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,767
Just settle it.
But don't offer too much.

250
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,936
Sounds good. See ya!

251
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,916
Mommy!

252
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,623
Next, we have a 1979 Boeing 727,

253
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,584
registration number N-1779.

254
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,795
Featuring forward and rear galleys.

255
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,633
Currently featuring 12 first-class
seats and 136 coach seats.

256
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,927
And this aircraft is ready,
willing, and able...

257
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,898
We can get in through the
north side of the fence.

258
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,847
Bad sight line for security.

259
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,685
Cut through. Two in,
one outside for lookout.

260
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,355
We need radios. A ladder too.

261
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,192
We can get in through the rear
airstairs, under the fuselage.

262
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:22,030
You figure it's open? Can you
even lock up a fucking 727?

263
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,409
Either way, I can pop the lock.

264
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,245
Stole a lot of cars
back in the days, huh?

265
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,580
Got me my first promotion.

266
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,001
Comandante was a big Buick guy.

267
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,129
One million. Can I get
one million? One million?

268
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,381
Carrillo Fuentes used
to be a cop, right?

269
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,593
He did two years at the DFS.
I'm sure he served with distinction.

270
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,513
And stole anything that
wasn't nailed down.

271
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,390
Sounds like your kind of cop.

272
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,271
How many of these things
is he fucking buying?

273
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,608
I definitely went astray somewhere...

274
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,903
end up sitting here with you
two broke motherfuckers.

275
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,656
I got an amen to that.

276
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,700
Sold to the man in black!

277
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,244
Son of a bitch.

278
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,164
And up next,

279
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,499
one of my personal favorites
on auction today.

280
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,043
We have a nineteen-seventy...

281
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,478
Hi.

282
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,237
Keep fucking walking, man.
I mean it.

283
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,783
Relax, 'Cisco. Fuck, man.

284
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,910
I hate fucking clowns.

285
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,509
What did the new doctor say?

286
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,304
Wants to do more tests on her.

287
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,891
There's some specialist up in San Diego.

288
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,186
Ruth might take her. We'll see.

289
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,687
Fuck, man.

290
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,149
God's going to protect her, man.

291
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,362
I've been praying every night.

292
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,655
Thanks, 'Mon.

293
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,671
- You want some?
- I left it there on the table.

294
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,888
Hey, Benjamín.

295
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,477
You remember Ivan? He works down
at the nightclub. Security.

296
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,103
Sure.

297
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,441
He's got something you want to hear.

298
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,359
Go on.
Tell my brother what you told me.

299
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,777
Hold up.

300
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,580
Hey, man. Take a walk, okay?

301
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,873
Benjamín. Come on.

302
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,209
He doesn't mind, right?
Or do you?

303
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,211
Nah, man.

304
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,963
It's cool.

305
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,471
What the fuck, man?

306
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,265
David's cool. I know him, man.
I trust him.

307
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,980
Who the fuck is he?

308
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,232
Some fucking American
you met in prison?

309
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,525
Gave you cigarettes?

310
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,488
Doesn't mean I trust him.
Use your fucking brain, man.

311
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,866
What is it?

312
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,745
Sorry.

313
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,624
My cousin's a cop, right?

314
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,919
State police, in Guadalajara.

315
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:08,965
So we get to talking, tells me about
how last week a call came in.

316
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,553
Gunshots. In this nice
neighborhood. Fancy.

317
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,181
When he shows up,
there's a couple of cars.

318
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,601
One's all shot up.

319
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,521
But whoever was inside... long gone.

320
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,066
The other car was bodyguards.

321
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,444
They tell my cousin it's been handled.

322
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,740
Put some money in his hand.
Fuck off, basically.

323
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,369
But this car that's been all shot up?

324
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,540
My cousin's seen it around town.

325
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,500
He recognizes it.

326
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,256
He knows who the target was.

327
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,760
What did you find out?

328
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,679
Did some digging.

329
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,348
I know why they aren't
interested in your money.

330
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,978
He and his brother are about to
make a bunch of their friends rich.

331
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:08,233
Oil, steel, and railroads rich.

332
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,194
What the fuck are you talking about?

333
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,991
I'm talking about his
plans for the economy.

334
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,453
With the 1988 election approaching,

335
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,040
a new generation of leaders
in the PRI had big plans.

336
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,419
And their new candidate was
the perfect man for the job.

337
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,504
Educated in the States,

338
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,640
this guy would be the kind of president

339
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,135
D.C. and Wall Street were looking for.

340
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,636
And he was gonna
shake shit up all right.

341
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,500
Under his leadership,

342
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,475
the PRI would drop its
old ties with labor unions

343
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,270
and gut the subsidies that
kept food prices down.

344
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,180
Communal farms called
ejidos would be chopped up,

345
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,234
sold to corporations.

346
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,987
But the main event of his
economic revolution?

347
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,740
That was known as privatization.

348
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:01,995
Idea was large-scale nationally-held
industries would be sold off.

349
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:07,917
Telecoms, steel, railways...
you name it.

350
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,336
And guess who'd profit?

351
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,200
The political insiders who
got to buy these assets

352
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,049
at bargain-basement prices.

353
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,763
In 1987, there was one Mexican
billionaire on the Forbes' list.

354
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,809
By the time the administration
ended, seven years later...

355
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,895
there were 24.

356
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,733
And don't think they weren't
reminded on a regular fucking basis,

357
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,695
by the president and his brother,
who put them there.

358
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,689
So why don't they want your money?

359
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,284
'Cause they don't fucking need it.

360
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,538
The brothers have cut deals
that will make them millions.

361
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,378
Bad news for your
relationship with the party.

362
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,629
What's left of it.

363
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,464
All right, talk to me.
Are we clear?

364
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,538
Okay, hold on.

365
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,833
The guard's still there.

366
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,798
Guard's moving.

367
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,593
He's making his round now.

368
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,524
All clear.
You've got three minutes. Go!

369
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,630
V-3-C-M-R-6.

370
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,178
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, a sec.
Hold up, hold up.

371
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,223
V-3-U-B-F-7.

372
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,518
V-3-U-B-F-7.
All right, we got one.

373
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,232
Two minutes.
Get a move on it.

374
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,528
Now get that fucking door open.

375
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,335
Fuck!

376
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,760
Head's up.
Security's on the move.

377
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,719
- Oh, shit.
- I'm almost in, almost in.

378
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,880
- Walt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

379
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,972
We see him. We see him.

380
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,183
- Ossie, come on.
- Almost.

381
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,644
- Ossie!
- Walt, you're running out of time.

382
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,314
Come on, Walt, go. Go, go.

383
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,819
The ladder, Walt.

384
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,283
Pull it! Pull it! Pull it! Pull it!

385
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,342
He's going out again. You've
got three minutes. Move!

386
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,836
Hey, guys.

387
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,049
I think we got something.

388
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,426
Tracker's up.

389
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,054
Fuck, what happened?

390
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,056
Shit.

391
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,100
Come on.

392
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,743
Six for six, baby.
He's a goddamn artist.

393
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,955
Nice work.

394
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,500
Thanks, man.

395
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,385
Yes, Benjamín. What is it?

396
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,013
I need to talk to you about
this shit with Sinaloa.

397
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,058
I've already handled it.

398
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,602
- Told them to make it right.
- Yeah, I know.

399
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,720
Cochiloco's on his way up
here to offer us money,

400
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,147
make this all go away.

401
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,317
Then what's the problem?
They're going to make peace.

402
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,401
The problem is

403
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,904
the Arellano Félix family isn't
interested in peace anymore.

404
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,239
We're interested in sending a message.

405
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
To everyone.

406
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,581
Benjamín, you're upset.
You need to be an adult about this.

407
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,916
They stole from us.

408
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,294
And now they're going to pay you back.

409
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,505
That's not good enough.

410
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:51,010
Look, I'll make that decision.

411
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,814
I've already made it, for myself.

412
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,898
Maybe you should start thinking

413
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,478
about what the Guadalajara
Cartel would look like

414
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,227
if Tijuana pulled out.

415
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,731
That will never happen.
Don't even think it.

416
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,735
This fighting between your
plazas makes you look weak.

417
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,323
I know someone took a run at
you last week in Guadalajara.

418
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,575
Shot up your car.

419
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,121
And that makes you look even weaker.

420
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,250
I don't think you want
to answer the questions

421
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,836
that losing my organization would raise.

422
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:32,218
Keeping my family happy should be
very important to you right now.

423
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,722
Yeah.

424
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,434
What did you have in mind?

425
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,600
Welcome to Juárez, boys.

426
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,180
What the fuck you smiling at?

427
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,000
One of the tracking
units is on the move.

428
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,035
What?

429
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,038
Left Belize about 8:00 a.m. our time.

430
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,415
Stopped over in the state of
Chiapas for a couple hours.

431
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,875
- Refueling.
- Yeah.

432
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,377
Started traveling north
again about four hours ago.

433
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,628
It's heading our way.

434
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,756
You're telling me we already
got a fucking bite?

435
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,841
Sal has got the signal up.

436
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,092
Yes?

437
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,053
- Yeah.
- Yes!

438
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,823
Left here. Left! Turn, turn!

439
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,325
Hold on.

440
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,956
Fuck, man. Try not to kill us, huh?

441
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,333
Well, which is it, man?

442
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,493
What are you doing?

443
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,120
I was going in with you.

444
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,539
Why?

445
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,792
Fuck, no.

446
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,919
Stay with the car.

447
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,905
This is what came in from Badiraguato...

448
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,307
Boss.

449
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,934
Get out, Miguelito.

450
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,439
When'd you get here?

451
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,858
How are you, Güerito?

452
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,277
We need to talk.

453
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:02,076
Afternoon, Mrs. Palma.
Boss is in there with him.

454
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,788
I'll just drop this for him in the shop.

455
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,376
Please give this to Mr. Palma
when you get a chance.

456
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,378
Thanks.

457
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,424
You can call me Guadalupe.

458
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,217
Very well.

459
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,640
I'm keeping an eye on things out here.

460
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,513
Basically in charge of security.

461
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,765
You're not from Mexico.

462
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,934
Venezuela.

463
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,691
Well, I hope you enjoy Sinaloa.

464
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,903
So far I like what I've seen of it.

465
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,490
Well, goodbye.

466
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,992
Goodbye.

467
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,852
Fuck!

468
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,605
- What?
- I lost the signal.

469
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,357
What are you talking about?

470
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,986
Fuck! Pull over.

471
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,832
Is there a problem?

472
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,751
Lost the signal.

473
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,968
Think we can get it back?

474
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,220
Well, I'm trying. We were
right on top of the thing.

475
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,017
Goddamn it.

476
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,987
Signal's back.

477
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,061
Holy shit.

478
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,202
This gives us everything.

479
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,705
All right.

480
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,959
Find a spot and set up surveillance.

481
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,045
Three-man teams.

482
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,839
Sal, me and Amat work
the first rotation.

483
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,799
This is it, boys.

484
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,967
Fuckin' A.

485
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:13,559
Look, I know things got
carried away with Tijuana.

486
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,688
But...

487
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,315
we're gonna pay Benjamín.

488
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,776
I promise.

489
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:28,991
Cochi's on his way right now
to talk to him, make it right.

490
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,913
I know Cochi's been sent to handle it.

491
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,081
Yeah.

492
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,211
But he's not coming back from Tijuana.

493
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,961
What?

494
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,107
Cochi's been in the
game as long as anyone.

495
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,900
They can't just...

496
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,989
Miguel Ángel, please.

497
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,368
This doesn't have to happen.

498
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,703
But it is happening, Güerito.

499
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,206
We were just fucking around.

500
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,208
Trying to make money, you know?

501
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,711
We got caught, so now
we'll just pay the tax.

502
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,966
It was just fucking around.

503
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,884
This is what we do.

504
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,720
We're not fucking accountants, man.

505
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,097
We're not cowboys either.

506
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,642
Things are different now, Güero.

507
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,063
Félix...

508
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,275
Cochi's one of the plaza's top guys.

509
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,277
We...

510
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,155
do not kill each other over bullshit.

511
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,364
Over fucking money?

512
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,159
Cochi's one of us, Félix!

513
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,870
Doesn't that mean something?

514
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,846
How long have you known him?

515
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,266
About 20 years.

516
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,894
Since I was a cop.

517
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,062
Twenty fucking years.

518
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:25,900
And now...

519
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,360
just because those pussies in Tijuana

520
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,904
get their fucking feelings hurt...

521
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,572
No, Güero!

522
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,118
Because you can't control your plaza.

523
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,415
You can't control your men.

524
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,959
You don't have the balls...

525
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,836
to be the boss.

526
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,924
Because you're weak.

527
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,805
Okay.

528
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,350
You're right.

529
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,396
But please don't do this, Miguel Ángel.

530
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,066
Call Benjamín...

531
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,653
and stop it.

532
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,976
Let's go.

533
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,820
It's done.

534
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,156
I came here...

535
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,201
so you'd hear it from me.

536
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,341
Going back to the house, boss?

537
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,815
Give me the keys.

538
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,693
I'm driving myself.

539
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,307
No, no, no. No snacks before dinner.

540
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,725
But I'm hungry.

541
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,519
After your homework. Go on.
Tell your brother too.

542
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,568
They never stop eating.

543
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,239
Papa.

544
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,116
Want your coffee?

545
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,370
Papa.

546
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,376
Papa?

547
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,797
- What is it?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

548
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,091
What are you looking at then?

549
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:53,607
I said yes, now I'm not playing.
Come here! Come here!

550
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,235
Give her back!

551
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,070
Come here, boy!

552
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,292
What the fuck do you think
you're doing out here?

553
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,837
Hello, María.

554
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,047
What are you doing, Miguel?

555
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,970
I'm sorry...

556
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:28,976
to show up like this.

557
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,441
I've been thinking about you.

558
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,235
I don't care what you've
been thinking about.

559
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,363
Yeah.

560
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,907
Things are fucked up right now.

561
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,744
You don't need me.

562
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,165
Remember?

563
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,543
I haven't forgotten.

564
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,962
And I don't need you.

565
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,423
None of us do.

566
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:03,427
You're like... You're like a
disease, Miguel, look at you.

567
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,349
I don't want you near me.
Or my children. You hear me?

568
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,185
Understand?

569
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,855
So no more showing up here.
No more following the kids to school.

570
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,317
You aren't wanted.

571
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,902
You're not welcome here.

572
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,572
So get the fuck off my property,
and don't come back.

573
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,808
Hey, let me see those.

574
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,112
Take a look.

575
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,170
How many planes you
say this dude bought?

576
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,130
Six.

577
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,928
Why would you need six fuel trucks?

578
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:33,225
Unless you're planning on refueling
all six planes at the same time.

579
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,938
Motherfucker.

580
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,721
Félix is planning on bringing
the whole shipment at once.

581
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,445
Why the fuck would he do that?

582
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,155
Take the chance?

583
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,034
Félix Gallardo is over-extended.

584
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,829
Fucker's desperate.

585
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,334
If all that coke comes in
at once, and we hit it?

586
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:01,753
Burn it to the ground?

587
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,883
We don't have to play hit-and-run
and bleed Félix slow.

588
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,969
He loses that shipment,

589
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,346
Colombians will put a bullet in him.

590
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,641
The fucker doesn't survive the weekend.

591
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,440
Walt, you gonna cut
Heath in on any of this?

592
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,071
Not yet.

593
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,533
I'd say we got Félix lined up.

594
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,620
And that would just complicate things.

595
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:49,129
History shows us that political errors

596
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,049
are always paid for.

597
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,260
The people and history...

598
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,389
are not forgiving.

599
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:08,565
Those who have betrayed the people
of Mexico will soon face justice!

600
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,693
They will be called to
account for their sins.

601
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,447
A new day is coming.

602
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,492
Some will be punished,

603
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,578
and others will be rewarded!

604
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,680
Mommy, he's doing it again.

605
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,141
Héctor, stop bothering
your sister and eat.

606
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,726
I'm not doing anything!

607
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,729
Is everything okay?

608
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,192
You haven't touched your dinner.

609
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,116
Héctor, what's wrong?

610
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,160
Nothing.
Leave it alone, babe. Okay?
