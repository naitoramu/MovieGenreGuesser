00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,398
<i>The Cali cartel
is an almost-perfect organism.</i>

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:28,904
<i>Even though we had cut off its head,
the body kept right on going,</i>

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,614
<i>making and selling cocaine.</i>

5
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,408
<i>They stuck to the plan.</i>

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,662
<i>And for a long time,
that plan had worked for them.</i>

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:41,166
The guy is innocent.
He didn't do any of it.

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,671
Easy, honey, easy, okay? Be careful.

9
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,672
The glove.

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,591
Screw the fucking glove, brother.

11
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,637
- That Fuhrman's a son of a bitch.
- He's an asshole.

12
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,473
- And he's been fucking the sister.
- Which one?

13
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:01,645
The sister! I don't even know her name.
Geraldo is fucking her, too.

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,939
<i>But no plan is perfect.</i>

15
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>Especially when you deal
with a substance as volatile as cocaine.</i>

16
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,405
<i>At some point...
you're gonna make a mistake.</i>

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,826
<i>And your enemies are watching and waiting.</i>

18
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,955
<i>They're gonna see your weakness
and make a move.</i>

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,833
<i>See, that's the thing about plans.</i>

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,794
<i>No matter how perfect
you think they are...</i>

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,923
<i>however brilliant or audacious
they may be...</i>

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,844
<i>well, they can still go to shit
when that one thing goes wrong.</i>

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,195
<i>And once that happens,
there's no going back.</i>

24
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,198
<i>It's all downhill from there.</i>

25
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,904
Oh, hey, hey.

26
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,867
Think that's him?

27
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,995
Has to be.

28
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,909
Let's go.

29
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,347
Close enough.

30
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,141
Lift up your shirt. Turn around.

31
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,443
I'm unarmed.

32
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,779
Approach slowly, hands out.

33
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,616
- You told nobody about this?
- Nobody.

34
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,661
- And you weren't followed?
- We're clean.

35
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,580
You headed north to Yumbo
instead of east from Cali.

36
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,082
And then straight on to Rozo.

37
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,215
I had to make sure you are
who you say you are. That you're alone.

38
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,968
Get in the car.

39
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,346
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're in the front seat.

40
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,276
I'm Chris Feistl. This is Daniel...

41
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,528
Daniel Van Ness. I know your names.

42
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,322
What about yours?

43
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,366
I don't want to be here
more than two minutes.

44
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,994
This is the only time
we're gonna speak face-to-face.

45
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,246
So you said you work
for the Rodríguez brothers.

46
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm the chief of security
for the Cali cartel.

47
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,377
- You're the head of security?
- Yes.

48
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,212
I have valuable information for you.

49
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:24,009
In exchange, I want safe passage
for my family and myself to the States.

50
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,137
Once there, with full immunity,
I'll help you in any way I can.

51
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,348
Listen, here's the thing, man.
You're head of security for the cartel.

52
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,472
You have a lot more to offer us
than just testimony.

53
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,019
Like Miguel Rodríguez.

54
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,689
Is that gonna be a problem?

55
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,817
Besides the fact
that we're all gonna end up dead?

56
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,652
There's a security system that I designed.

57
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,238
Safe houses, lookouts on every corner,

58
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,115
a radio communication system.

59
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,908
- We can work around all that.
- Maybe.

60
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,703
Then there's David, Miguel's son.

61
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,831
He personally controls
his father's security now.

62
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,751
- I don't even know where he is.
- But you can find out.

63
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,254
And if I do? The police? The military?

64
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,298
You can't trust them. I pay them.

65
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,468
We can get guys we trust, all right?
Don't worry about it.

66
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,803
Don't worry about it?

67
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,182
No. I'll testify. That's it.

68
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,145
Let me ask you something.
Why are you doing this? Talking to us?

69
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,775
I'm not a murderer. I'm not like them.
I want to get my family out.

70
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,194
Well, we'd love to help you
with that, but...

71
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,292
we can't do that
unless you give us Miguel.

72
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,699
And honestly,
we don't need your testimony.

73
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,327
Bottom line, you have a better option,
you're free to take it.

74
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,669
I need to think about this.

75
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,799
Still didn't catch your name.

76
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,013
Jorge. Salcedo.

77
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,200
I think we found a gold mine.

78
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,745
Guy says he's head of security
for the cartel and he wants to roll?

79
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,207
They don't call it the Cali KGB
for nothing, Chris.

80
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,336
Let's get the fuck out of here.

81
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,759
Franklin Jurado.

82
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,972
One testimony from him and he can
take down the entire Cali cartel.

83
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,724
He travels on multiple passports.

84
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,810
So, he gets on a flight,
we lose him who the fuck knows where.

85
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,313
I need him on a plane today
so that he's testifying in Miami tomorrow.

86
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,773
Okay, listen up.

87
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,017
We'll provide Agent Peña
and his men with any support they require.

88
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,087
Understood?

89
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,197
Okay, typically,
he goes to a cooperative credit bank

90
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,615
and then has breakfast.

91
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,660
- We sit on it and get him there.
- Hey, hey.

92
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,997
You plan to take him at the bank?

93
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,581
Mm-hmm.

94
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,001
You cannot do that, Agent Peña.

95
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,503
<i>Here's what you need
to know about Curaçao.</i>

96
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,547
<i>It's a smuggler's paradise.</i>

97
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,717
<i>And for the Cali cartel,
you can't beat the location.</i>

98
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,055
<i>Only 40 miles separates
South American coast from Curaçaon ports,</i>

99
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,726
<i>prized for centuries by smugglers,
slave traders, and now cartels.</i>

100
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,813
<i>Cruise ships filled with old people
next to speed boats filled with cash.</i>

101
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,942
<i>And what doesn't get smuggled through,
it ends up in banks. Hundreds of them.</i>

102
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,070
<i>Way back, some enterprising Dutchmen</i>

103
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,490
<i>set up a financial system
cloaked in old-world secrecy.</i>

104
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,160
<i>Their economy is so dependent
on money launderers parking their cash,</i>

105
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,746
<i>that you can make an arrest,
just not at or near a bank.</i>

106
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,456
DI STREA BANK CURAÇAO

107
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,168
<i>Of course, where do you think
Franklin spent most of his time?</i>

108
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,840
All right, we tail him. And then
we catch him somewhere that suits us both.

109
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,051
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay.

110
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,803
Okay, let's go.

111
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,035
<i>Good morning, gentlemen.</i>

112
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,274
Good morning.

113
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,859
As many of you know,

114
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,488
since Córdova's resignation,
I am the head of security.

115
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,162
It's festival time.
That means the city will be crowded.

116
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:26,459
The festival is not an excuse
to party on the job.

117
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:32,090
One more thing. David and his team will
now be handling security for his father.

118
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,718
Let's make them feel welcome.

119
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,388
And help them any way you can.

120
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,685
That's all, boys. Get going!

121
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,861
Wow. Look at you. You're sliding
into your new job like a glove.

122
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,737
You're a natural.

123
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:01,202
Look, David, if we're going
to work together, we need to cooperate.

124
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,120
Mm...

125
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,791
If you have questions or you want to talk
about your father's security...

126
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,252
I'm here.

127
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,379
Thank you.

128
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,882
I do have a question, Jorge.

129
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,844
How come none of your men
carry fucking guns? Huh?

130
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,390
Because we use our walkies
if we have a problem.

131
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,604
For what? To say goodbye
when you're getting clipped?

132
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,731
Do me a favor, Jorge.

133
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,860
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
All right?

134
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,748
Boss, you didn't mention
the DEA agents that are in Cali.

135
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,083
That's something David
might be interested in.

136
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,128
Listen, the last thing we need right now
is David and his crew

137
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,880
killing a federal agent, no?

138
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,341
Well, that's true.

139
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,136
For now, we'll monitor the DEA ourselves.

140
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,932
Besides... I doubt they have much.

141
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,439
I don't want to leave New York, Chepe.

142
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,445
- Why, Chepe?
- My love...

143
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,241
I know you don't want
to leave New York. I know.

144
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,827
I don't either.

145
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,457
But if they connect this lab to us...

146
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,670
we're going to have
every cop in the city after us.

147
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,297
Hey, look.

148
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,799
Here it comes.

149
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,469
<i>Spokesmen for the DEA say that
the cocaine lab that exploded in Queens</i>

150
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,638
<i>was operated by a Dominican gang.</i>

151
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,600
Exactly! Thank you, lady.
Fucking Dominicans!

152
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:52,271
<i>But Manuel de Dios, editor of</i> La Prensa,
<i>has discovered another side to the story.</i>

153
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,899
<i>This lab,
along with a number of others in the area,</i>

154
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,653
<i>was recently seized
by Colombian gangsters,</i>

155
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,323
<i>led by a man
going by the name Victor Crespo.</i>

156
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,950
- Motherfucker.
<i>- In the next few days,</i>

157
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,994
<i>we will be publishing
an investigative series</i>

158
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,122
<i>about this criminal enterprise,
including pictures.</i>

159
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,249
<i>This operation is much larger
than it seems.</i>

160
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,001
"No speak Spanish" my ass.

161
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,587
So that means we have to leave,
right, Chepe?

162
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,840
No, my love.

163
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,217
This man, he knows who you are, Chepe.

164
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,594
Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

165
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,678
Is that so?

166
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,850
So do me a favor and fix this.

167
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,561
Did you hear me?

168
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
Motherfucker.

169
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,741
So a new surrender deal.

170
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,993
Three years in jail. All of you.

171
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,247
Turn in the illicit businesses,
and we can keep all of the legal assets,

172
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,166
as in the old plan. It's a good deal.

173
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,076
He would've told you himself,

174
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,712
but he thought it was best for me
to explain in person.

175
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:00,548
Besides, I helped negotiate the deal.

176
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,884
I understand.
Thank you for coming, Nicolás.

177
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,180
Give me an update, Uncle Miguel.

178
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,140
An update?

179
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,352
On our efforts to maximize business
before surrender.

180
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,981
So I can inform my father.

181
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,317
Tell your dad everything's
still on track here.

182
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,571
Pacho's settled new terms with Amado
Carrillo Fuentes and is coming back soon.

183
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,116
And this accident in New York?

184
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,748
Chepe encountered an obstacle,
but you know Chepe.

185
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,458
I'm not worried.

186
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,378
Are we done?

187
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,047
One last thing.

188
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,260
Our friends in Bogotá
are concerned about their exposure.

189
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,930
Too many people know about the deal.

190
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,474
They worry about Mr. Pallomari.

191
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,769
My father would like you to handle it.

192
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,897
"Handle it"?

193
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,274
Do you know what you're talking about?

194
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,318
Do you have any idea?

195
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,403
Hmm?

196
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:11,577
Pallomari's our chief accountant in Cali,
and not easily replaced.

197
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,996
He's too valuable to just kill.

198
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,240
Tell your father I'll take care of it.
He doesn't have to worry about Pallomari.

199
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,253
Thank you, Uncle Miguel.

200
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,715
Take care.

201
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,480
So now the little prince
is giving you orders?

202
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,732
His father's orders.

203
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,613
Have Salcedo put Pallomari
in one of the safe houses.

204
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,782
Keep an eye on him.

205
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,496
You decide if you're coming tonight?

206
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,250
Our Salsa Festival party, Dad.

207
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,669
It's important.

208
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,174
You know how I feel about parties.
That's Gilberto's thing, not mine.

209
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,510
Which is exactly why you should go.

210
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,264
Dad, you're the new boss here.

211
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,475
Please, show them.

212
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,231
Or at least have a good time
before we have to roll over and play dead.

213
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,318
<i>Now why would
a Cali godfather come out of hiding</i>

214
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,403
<i>and risk getting captured?</i>

215
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,907
<i>Because what good is being the king
if nobody knows it?</i>

216
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:36,245
<i>The biggest thing to come out of Cali
wasn't cocaine. It was salsa.</i>

217
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,333
<i>And every year, the two combined</i>
<i>at the annual</i> Feria de Cali,

218
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,003
<i>a week-long extravaganza
of parties and salsa concerts.</i>

219
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,548
<i>And the man who always presided
over the opening-night festivities?</i>

220
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,051
<i>Gilberto Rodríguez.</i>

221
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,636
Cheers, gentlemen!

222
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,182
<i>But with him in jail,
it was time for a new king.</i>

223
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,726
How would you like to be my date tonight?

224
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,895
Hmm...

225
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,688
Where would we go?

226
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,233
Come here.

227
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,198
<i>♪ Let's go dancing ♪</i>

228
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,908
Do you like dancing?

229
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,079
As discussed with Don Miguel,
he'd like you to keep working from here.

230
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,791
Yes, I know what needs to be done.

231
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,167
Come in.

232
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,682
Guillermo, what's this?
You've got to be kidding, right?

233
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,434
- You're playing me for a fool.
- What's this?

234
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,521
This is unacceptable.
I need to speak to Miguel.

235
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,567
Talk to whoever you want. This is
the biggest apartment we have right now.

236
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,069
- Three bedrooms. Two bathrooms.
- Uh-huh.

237
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,447
A/C. Kids seem to like it.

238
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,949
- Kids, do you like it?
- Yes!

239
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,952
Really, Patricia.
You going to smoke inside?

240
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,996
What's the problem? This is a dump.

241
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,833
- The boys are here.
- Oh, now you're concerned about the boys?

242
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,378
Do not leave this apartment,
for your own safety.

243
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,974
Everything you've done for these people,
and this is how they repay you?

244
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,146
Yeah. Got it. Thanks, Stoddard.

245
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,274
All right, last hit
Duffy and López had on Salcedo,

246
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,318
he was deputy chief of security
for the cartel.

247
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,236
All right. So that much is true.

248
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,654
Had a degree in engineering.

249
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:37,158
Business license for a bio-diesel factory
that went belly-up.

250
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,743
- Wonder why.
- Ex-military.

251
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,120
Served under a Carlo Córdova. Major.

252
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,748
Who became head of security
for the cartel.

253
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,291
Must have been how he got the job.

254
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,752
Wonder if he clipped his old buddy
to take his spot.

255
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,630
And he was connected to the purchase
of bombs in a plan to kill Pablo.

256
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,797
Oh, just that?

257
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,092
Does that sound like the everyman
who only signed on

258
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,219
- to protect Miguel's family to you?
- Okay.

259
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,723
So he's a scumbag. Last I checked,
he's our best bet to get Miguel.

260
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,393
Scumbags I can handle.
What I don't like are liars.

261
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,605
So when he calls back
with Miguel's location...

262
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,067
- how you want to play it?
- If he calls at all,

263
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,569
we ask the hard questions,
see how he holds up.

264
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,867
I'm telling you, they're done.

265
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,703
Gilberto's looking
for some new way to surrender.

266
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,998
And you heard about this thing
in New York with Chepe, right?

267
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,585
And Miguel's in charge of everything here.

268
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,631
<i>Better said, the Cali cartel is dead.</i>

269
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,800
And you intend to...?

270
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:40,805
To do whatever I have to do
for the North Valley cartel.

271
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,016
Which is why I'm talking to you.

272
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,440
It's funny how things change, isn't it?

273
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,486
So, Amado... what do you say?

274
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,993
I say you're no fucking fun,
that's what I say.

275
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,080
But we both see the future the same way.

276
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,500
Look, starting next week...

277
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,464
I'll only be shipping product
for my new North Valley friends. Good?

278
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:19,885
And what about the other thing
we discussed?

279
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,939
Look, I need you to make room here.

280
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,943
And I want you to take care of the guests,
get them everything they need.

281
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,362
I also want a bottle
at each of these tables.

282
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,806
But I want the good stuff.
None of that shit you serve here.

283
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:41,866
Understood?

284
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,536
I was told you needed me.

285
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,497
I need to talk about something.

286
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,708
Leave your bitch down here.

287
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,667
Come on.

288
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,225
You don't tell anyone about this, okay?

289
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,396
I was thinking about what you said...

290
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,191
if I ever need your advice, and...

291
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,651
I could use your help.

292
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,862
With your father's security.

293
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,072
He's coming to the party tonight.

294
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,866
He's coming here?

295
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,787
Unless there's another fucking party
I don't know about? Yeah, here.

296
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,417
What do you want me to tell you, David?

297
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,753
Public places are always bad.

298
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,045
I know.

299
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,839
Too many people.

300
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,010
When does he plan on arriving?

301
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,970
I was thinking around 11:00.

302
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,933
Well, what fucking time is best, then?

303
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:52,102
Well, I think ten is better.

304
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,106
It's less crowded.
Maybe I can take him up to the balcony.

305
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,441
You'll take care of it?

306
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,279
I knew I could count on you.

307
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,326
I just need this night to be perfect.

308
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,453
Everything has to go well.

309
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,874
You can relax. I think we can manage that.

310
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,095
Boss, did you tell him
it isn't a good idea?

311
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,888
Of course, you think he listened?

312
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,890
He's an imbecile.

313
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,101
Pull over here.

314
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,064
Pinchadito said there's
a bad phone tap or something.

315
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,445
Stay here. I'll be two minutes.

316
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,751
- Hello?
<i>- It's Salcedo. I only have a minute.</i>

317
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,837
- You got us both.
- Listen.

318
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,380
Miguel's going to a party tonight.

319
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,300
<i>Libre Club. Carrera Ocho. Ten o'clock.</i>

320
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,263
It's gonna be crowded, so you have
to wait to get him until he's outside.

321
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,056
Is there any way we can check this, Jorge?

322
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,017
No. You're gonna have to trust me.

323
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,228
<i>And this promotion to security chief?
How'd that come about?</i>

324
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,064
That's... really complicated.

325
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,816
Okay, we're just trying to understand

326
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,486
why you would call us
the day after you get a raise.

327
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,363
<i>We don't have time for this right now.</i>

328
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,116
<i>He's going to be in the club
at ten o'clock. Carrera Ocho.</i>

329
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,618
Take him outside.

330
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,043
Hey. What's going on?

331
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,503
Nothing, boss.

332
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,066
- He bothering you?
- No, sir.

333
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,548
- I'm just buying fritters for my brother.
- Great, let's go.

334
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,008
- You want some?
- Sure.

335
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,772
"Complicated."
Everything with this guy is complicated.

336
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,721
Still, there's something about him
I believe.

337
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,598
Enough to walk into a cartel party blind?

338
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,685
For a chance
to get Miguel Rodríguez, maybe.

339
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,938
He's just stringing us along, Chris.
Or worse.

340
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,372
Stop! Hey!

341
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,209
Hey! Come here!

342
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,165
Get the back. Get the back.

343
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,178
Fuck!

344
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,309
Oh!

345
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,406
Don't run.

346
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,844
Franklin Jurado.

347
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,224
Javier Peña, DEA. You're being extradited
for money laundering and racketeering.

348
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,311
- My wife. You need to make sure...
- She's in Bogotá.

349
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,354
She'll meet us in Miami.

350
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,031
<i>Ambassador, I've got Agent Peña, line one.</i>

351
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,366
<i>- Peña?</i>
- We got him.

352
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,662
I'd like to get him into the United States
before the cartel knows he's in custody.

353
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,916
I spoke to the Prime Minister
this morning. Extradition papers are set.

354
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,084
As soon as he starts talking,
you let me know.

355
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,712
<i>- I'll update Justice.</i>
- Yeah, will do, sir.

356
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,756
<i>Agent Peña. Good work.</i>

357
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,930
- Let's see here.
- Zulema prays every morning.

358
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,473
Very good. And here?

359
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,018
- Worm...
- Dropper...

360
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,020
- Dad!
- Hi, kids!

361
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,191
I need to speak to you.

362
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,860
Okay. Girls...

363
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,447
please, go to your room
and finish your homework.

364
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,538
Something came up.

365
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,627
- What is it?
- I know how hard this has been for you.

366
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,547
I just want you to know
that I've almost got it figured out.

367
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,927
- All right.
- I'll tell you more tonight,

368
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,847
but for now, I want you
to get everything ready to leave.

369
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,225
Where are we going? How...

370
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,768
Do you trust me?

371
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,604
My love...

372
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,149
Paola... do you trust me?

373
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,484
Yes?

374
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,199
Everything will be all right. I promise.

375
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,875
Done. I'm finished.

376
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,629
I love that length on you.

377
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,548
Thank you, I like it, too.

378
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,386
And... a little extra for you.

379
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,849
And I have a little extra for you, too.

380
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,105
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

381
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,344
You were the one
who approached my wife?

382
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,638
You enjoy it?

383
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,559
Using her to get to me?

384
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,780
Know what I'd be
thinking about if I were you, Franklin?

385
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,483
That if your wife wants to see you...

386
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,445
she's gonna see you in jail.

387
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,406
Drive hours every week.

388
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,576
Get felt up by some sweaty guard
whose only highlight at work

389
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,995
is getting his hands
under your wife's dress.

390
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,623
You can say whatever you want.

391
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,919
- You can't scare me.
- No...

392
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,047
I can just ruin your life.

393
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,342
You know the brothers.

394
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,260
Pretty well.

395
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:31,431
What do you think will happen to them
without Gilberto running things?

396
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,269
You're young, Franklin.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

397
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,647
You really want to spend it in a cell?

398
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,858
Talk to me.

399
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,821
I'll get you a deal. You and Christina...

400
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,573
can start over.

401
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:51,952
Have a new life.

402
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,037
In the United States.

403
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,085
I'm not going to say a single word...

404
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,047
until I see my wife.

405
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,136
Okay.

406
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,266
Then you'll have your witness.

407
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,405
Stop. Stop here.

408
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,664
Turn around.

409
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,633
Franklin. His name is Franklin Jurado.

410
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,177
- Jurado or...
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

411
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,305
<i>We've called his room several times.
We're unable to locate him.</i>

412
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,015
Okay, well, did he check out?

413
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,225
Can you tell me if he's...
Have you seen him at all?

414
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,536
Sounds like you don't know anything.

415
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,604
<i>We have not seen him
and he has not checked out.</i>

416
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,731
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am. I cannot help you.</i>

417
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,400
<i>Thank you for calling
Baoase Luxury Resort.</i>

418
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,653
No, no, thank you.
Thank you for fucking nothing.

419
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,602
Manny. Thanks for meeting.

420
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:46,650
Julia said you might have...
something on Crespo?

421
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,158
Well, yes.

422
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,956
It's something I hope you like.

423
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,002
How can I help you, Mr. Crespo?

424
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,839
Or should I say, Mr. Santacruz?

425
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,008
Well...

426
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,137
I was hoping I could help you.

427
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,306
Where are you from?

428
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,395
- Cuba.
- Cuba! Gorgeous.

429
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,898
When you were young,

430
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:31,736
did you ever think you would come
to this country and do something special?

431
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,408
Well, I did.

432
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,830
I imagined myself coming here
to the United States, to New York...

433
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,207
and building something important.

434
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,918
That was also my dream.

435
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,880
The dream of a young immigrant,
like yourself.

436
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,343
And that's why I want to help you,
to make whatever dream you have a reality.

437
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,428
Whatever it is.

438
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,431
Regardless how much it costs.

439
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,266
In dollars.

440
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,231
You think you and I are the same

441
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,359
because we came
to this country with dreams?

442
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,611
Well...

443
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,573
My family fled Cuba
because we believed in freedom.

444
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,285
You came to sell cocaine.

445
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,204
Yes, we are both immigrants,

446
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,541
but we have nothing in common,
Mr. Santacruz.

447
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,964
My story is going to print.

448
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,474
Okay. Thank you for hearing my proposal.

449
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,895
Can I ask you a question?

450
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:52,942
How long will it take
to get to the airport from here?

451
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,862
I have no idea.

452
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,115
An hour or so.

453
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,829
I'll miss a lot about New York.

454
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,791
But not the traffic.

455
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,959
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. How are you?

456
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,093
Good evening.

457
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,176
Hello. How are you?

458
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,305
Good evening. Welcome.

459
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,349
Good evening.

460
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,609
Good to see you, David. What's up?

461
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,213
Looks like the whole family showed up.

462
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,406
Why don't we have a drink upstairs?

463
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,756
You know what?

464
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,550
I don't want this many people up here.

465
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,295
Good evening! Welcome to the Cali Fair!

466
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,386
Let's give a warm welcome
to a friend of the festival,

467
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,057
and our patron, Mr. Miguel Rodríguez!

468
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,687
Come. Come here.

469
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,438
Come!

470
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,774
Come here!

471
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,368
Say a few words.

472
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,006
Thank you all for coming.

473
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,593
Please, enjoy the party.

474
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,371
Your brother's a character.

475
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,042
His passion for tequila
exceeds his tolerance.

476
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,921
Well... my shift started already.

477
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,132
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
when you come back.

478
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,092
You're giving me a tip.

479
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,020
I told you he'd be here.

480
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,188
You came through.

481
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,857
I also said to take him outside.
It's too risky in here.

482
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,652
Tell your men to wait until he's leaving.

483
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,204
What men are you talking about?

484
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,706
Your men standing by the DJ booth.

485
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,876
We came to make sure
you were telling the truth.

486
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,461
We didn't bring any men.

487
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,755
The fuck are you talking about?

488
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,632
What?

489
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,216
Fuck.

490
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,719
- What's wrong?
- Fuck. You need to go.

491
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,803
- What?
- Just go!

492
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,105
Shh.

493
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,232
We aren't here for you.

494
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,110
Where is Pacho?

495
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,988
Pacho!

496
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,992
Pacho!

497
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,794
I need to talk to you.

498
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,006
- Don't interrupt me.
- We have a problem. We have to leave, now.

499
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,192
- Relax. It's a fucking party.
- We need to leave now!

500
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,885
- I said calm down! I'll say when we go.
- What's going on here?

501
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,013
We have to leave, sir. Please.

502
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:04,896
Get down!

503
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,154
Go! Watch out!

504
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,114
Pacho!

505
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,346
Watch out!

506
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,350
Stay there!

507
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,896
- Keep going!
- Careful! Get out of the way!

508
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,881
- Keep going!
- Get out of the way!

509
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,566
Keep moving.

510
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,154
- When I run...
- They're over here.

511
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,241
Shit! Shit!

512
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Give me the gun.

513
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,962
Go ahead.

514
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:14,966
Are you all right?

515
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,845
Motherfucker!

516
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,846
Álvaro!

517
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,823
Shoot them! Shoot them!

518
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:37,949
Go!

519
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,536
Over there!

520
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,644
- Careful!
- Head down, sir.

521
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,646
Head down!

522
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,399
- Slow down.
- Move it!

523
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:12,942
Motherfucker!

524
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,486
- Go!
- Let's go! Move it!

525
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,408
This shit...

526
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,750
Little brother! I need you to shoot.

527
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:33,004
Your gun. Keep shooting at them!

528
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,172
Pacho.

529
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,184
Head down!

530
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,810
I'll drive, Enrique. I'll drive!

531
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:49,645
Over here!

532
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,116
Who drove the car?

533
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,079
You got here by car. Who was driving?

534
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,789
- Me.
- Give me the keys.

535
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,416
Fuck you.

536
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,682
Peña.

537
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:28,846
<i>There are men at my apartment.</i>

538
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,145
- Yeah, they're ours.
- Yeah, no shit.

539
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,228
<i>Are you with them?</i>

540
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,815
No. I saw them and I freaked out,
so I left.

541
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,234
They're meant to protect you.
Have you talked to anyone?

542
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,363
No, I tried calling Franklin,
but I couldn't get in touch with him.

543
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,448
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

544
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,034
We arrested Franklin.

545
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,203
You did what?

546
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,330
<i>Christina, listen to me.</i>

547
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,499
I... You fucking asshole.

548
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,585
- Listen to me.
- I told you I was gonna talk to him.

549
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,003
- I told you.
<i>- Christina.</i>

550
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,255
You want it? This is it.

551
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,258
As soon as we hang up the phone,
you get yourself to the American Embassy.

552
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,635
<i>You don't talk to anyone,
you don't call anyone.</i>

553
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,845
<i>- You get yourself there.</i>
- Okay.

554
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,776
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

555
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,154
Are we close?

556
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,407
Yes. It's just around the corner.

557
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,784
Thank you.

558
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,286
You saved me. Really.

559
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,581
Just tell your friends about me.

560
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,542
But only the ones with money.

561
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,479
Why isn't this imbecile moving?

562
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,402
When is this car gonna move?

563
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,368
- Fuck!
- Oh, my God.

564
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,662
Oh, my God.

565
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,122
God.

566
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,417
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Fucking drive! Oh, my...

567
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,492
We start with just the basics. Okay?

568
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,703
Where they move the money,
where they keep the money.

569
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,733
Let me guess. It's his fucking lawyer?

570
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,264
Agent Peña. Alan Starkman.

571
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,557
Mr. Jurado's lawyer.

572
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,311
Yeah. Your client has indicated he's
open to a deal in exchange for testimony.

573
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,064
Before he learned
that his wife won't be joining him.

574
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,943
No. I've just spoken with his wife.
She's on her way to the embassy in Bogotá.

575
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,779
Now, I was informed she never arrived.

576
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,740
Oh, go ahead. Check with your people.

577
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:38,249
It's my understanding that she met up
with Mr. Jurado's employers instead.

578
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,837
I guess she's had a change of heart.

579
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,843
Whatever deal you had with my client...
is off.

580
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,735
Dad! Are you okay?

581
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,195
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

582
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,323
- Let's go inside.
- It's those North Valley motherfuckers.

583
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,743
- We got one of the shooters.
- They shot Álvaro, too.

584
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:15,995
Pacho is okay.

585
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,413
They're on their way back.

586
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:19,831
Are you okay?

587
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,460
- Close the damn door.
- What a fucking night.

588
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,963
Darío, please take her upstairs.

589
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,672
I'm coming soon.

590
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,558
What happened there?

591
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:39,727
It looked like...

592
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,606
you knew something was coming.

593
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:48,027
Jorge! You know what? I know why.

594
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,240
Because you are always working.

595
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,243
You saved my life tonight, Jorge!

596
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,080
- Dad, it wasn't my fault, I...
- One moment.

597
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,294
From now on, I want you back in charge
of my personal security.

598
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,712
Only you, Jorge.

599
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,757
Of course, Don Miguel.

600
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:14,678
And if you allow me, we don't know
if this will be the only attack or not.

601
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:17,514
So I need to know
where you are at all times.

602
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,433
Tomorrow is another day.

603
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,527
- <i>Gilberto, it's me.</i>
- Thank God!

604
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,905
- How are you, brother?
<i>- We're okay.</i>

605
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,783
Look, Gilberto,
they tried to kill Pacho, too.

606
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,869
<i>- Pacho! No, it can't be...</i>
- No, he's okay. He survived.

607
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,205
<i>- He's on his way home.</i>
- Thank God.

608
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:45,125
These North Valley motherfuckers,
I'm going to kill them. Sons of bitches.

609
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,712
Listen to me, Miguel.
Now's not the time for...

610
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:51,173
Everybody's watching.

611
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:56,512
<i>- It could ruin everything.</i>
- Look, Gilberto. They tried to kill me.

612
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,305
They tried to kill my son.

613
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,517
They tried to kill María.
They tried to kill Pacho.

614
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,644
Yes, I understand, brother, but...

615
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,607
for now, we can't afford to start a war.

616
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,693
Especially being so close
to the surrender.

617
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,903
What fucking surrender, Gilberto?

618
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,115
Before we can surrender,
they'll take everything from us.

619
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:20,786
- Brother, listen to me.
- Okay, no war. I understand.

620
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,830
<i>You'll see.</i>

621
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,291
Everything is going to be okay, brother.

622
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,794
Okay, Gilberto. Bye.

623
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,609
It's Salcedo.

624
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,825
- You alone?
- Yeah.

625
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,494
- Get the fuck in.
- How the fuck did you know where we were?

626
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,789
The same way I knew where to call you.
You think I'm gonna bring a gun here?

627
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,435
- We don't know what to think.
- Why didn't you have a team there?

628
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,210
Because you never gave us
a straight answer.

629
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,130
- Did you know that was gonna happen?
- You're serious?

630
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,966
How's the North Valley
shooting up the place gonna help me?

631
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,344
You look like a hero,
escorting Miguel out the back.

632
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,055
I had to do my job.

633
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,182
You're still not telling us
the fucking truth.

634
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,100
They killed the guy I replaced.

635
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,936
And they killed his wife.

636
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,814
And they're gonna do the same thing
to me and my family.

637
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:34,777
And you two are the only ones that can
help me get them out. You understand?

638
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,321
Yeah.

639
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,282
Then we need to trust each other.

640
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

641
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,789
Tell me you know where Miguel is.

642
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,804
This is a SkyPager. All right?
It's untraceable. Even by you.

643
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,306
We'll be in touch.

644
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,104
<i>Over 15 people were killed,</i>

645
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,980
<i>with dozens more injured</i>

646
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,442
<i>in a shootout tonight
at a Cali nightclub.</i>

647
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,487
<i>Reports say the shooting started
after 10:00 p.m.</i>

648
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,493
- I was worried.
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

649
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,912
- We're safe. We're safe.
- What happened?

650
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,083
It was the North Valley. I'm okay.

651
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,584
Where are we going?

652
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,796
Why do we have to leave?

653
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,047
What's going on?

654
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,925
Come with me. Come. Come. Come.

655
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,721
Tell me what's going on right now!

656
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,599
What I'm about to tell you
has to stay here.

657
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,685
You can't tell anyone, understand?

658
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,814
I'm working for the Americans.

659
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,359
It can't be.

660
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,904
It can't be.

661
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:02,573
I contacted the DEA.

662
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,074
I'm giving them Miguel.

663
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:07,202
In exchange, they will help us
get out of the country.

664
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,290
It's our only option.
There's no other way.

665
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,627
You're crazy.

666
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,047
They're going to kill all of us.

667
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,468
- You're insane. What were you thinking?!
- Paola...

668
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,353
<i>Things don't always go
according to plan.</i>

669
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,650
<i>You can use every hope and prayer
you have, take your shot,</i>

670
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,236
<i>and everything still goes to shit.</i>

671
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:46,700
<i>And when that happens, it's almost
like you never had a plan at all.</i>

672
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,078
<i>That's when people get desperate.</i>

673
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,789
<i>And things get dangerous.</i>

674
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,795
I want to welcome Pacho, Chepe.

675
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:02,299
I'm sorry it's under these circumstances.

676
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:05,177
North Valley attacked us.

677
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,262
Their intentions were clear.

678
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,684
They saw us
as vulnerable without Gilberto.

679
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,854
Weak, with me in charge.

680
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,690
They are trying to destroy us.

681
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,944
Take what's ours.

682
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,739
I...

683
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,996
All of us know there's only
one appropriate response to this.

684
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:38,085
One way to react against these people
who want to take everything from us,

685
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,546
what we've worked so hard to build.

686
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,675
War.

687
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,017
This is Gilberto's decision?

688
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,648
It's...

689
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,775
mine.
