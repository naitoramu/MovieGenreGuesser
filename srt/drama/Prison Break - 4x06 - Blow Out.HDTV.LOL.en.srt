1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,900
Previously on prison break:

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,510
Someone at homeland security did an enhanced

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,850
Image search on you today.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,580
Who?

5
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,140
His name is Don Self.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,150
Yes.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,610
What do you say you give me that little

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,170
Piece of paper in your hand.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,380
From now on,i'm asking

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,850
That everyone keep their card on them

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,100
At all Times.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,560
Where's the bird book?

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,500
Bird book?

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,940
Where's the book?!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,210
Someone was following me.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,380
Is this the guy? Yeah.

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,220
Who's that?

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,000
That's the man who killed my son.

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,900
Now he's come to kill us.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,250
Don't get used to it.

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,280
Sparklekid,gate 8.

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,080
Excuse me.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,230
Hi,there.

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,120
I would like to place some bets,please.

25
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,860
Uh,i'd like to place an exacta

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,940
On captain Brody and mister Hooper in the first race.

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,900
All right.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,170
$20,please.

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,160
Thank you.

30
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,400
I think you made a mistake here.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,800
I wanted a quinella

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,510
For captain Brody and mister Hooper in the first race.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,150
Uh,you gave me an exacta.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,780
That's what you told me you wanted.

35
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,260
No,it's not what I told you.

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,160
And I want you to fix it!

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,250
Sir,i gave you exactly what you asked...

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,430
No,you didn't-- what the hell kind of place is this?!

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,060
If you'll just calm down,please. I'm not--

40
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,070
Calm down? What-what are you talking about?

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,370
I want you to fix this.

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,940
This is-- you gave me

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,980
Yo,somebody's freaking out

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,810
On one of the clerks inside. We'll check it out.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,070
Hey,louis,we've got a disturbance by the windows.

46
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,430
I'm on my way.

47
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,480
What the hell kind of place is this anyway?!

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,340
If you'll just calm down,please. I'm not...

49
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,940
What,what are you talking about?

50
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,100
I want you to fix this!

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,830
This is-- you gave me the wrong bet.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,660
I'm not leaving this place until I talk to the guy...

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,710
Hey,you need to calm down. Who the hell are you?

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm the operations manager, all right. Take it easy.

55
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,050
Do you run background checks on your employees

56
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,620
Or do you just let cons work here?

57
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,760
Okay,there are no cons working here,all right?

58
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,850
Look at her. What is she doing?

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,110
Ma-mave-mave,do you have a record,mave?

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,620
Excuse me. Sir,hey!

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,510
I got a problem here. Did you come to help me

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,090
Or did you come to give me a hard Time?

63
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,880
Excuse me,miss.

64
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,770
Oh,my god. Thank you so much.

65
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,010
I would have been in so much trouble

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,560
If I'd Lost those. You Don't know my boss.

67
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:19,970
He would have gone up

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,470
One side of me and down the other.

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,740
Thank you. Any Time.

70
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Look at her-- why is she lookin' at me like that? Why are you looking

71
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,330
At me like that? Let's not yell at anyone,all right?

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,210
We'll take care of it. ...I just need to get...

73
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm not yelling at anyone.

74
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,530
Oh,sorry,sir.

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,420
I'll keep an eye on the monitors.

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,250
He's heading back.

77
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,220
Let's go.

78
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,930
How's it look? I'm getting a clear signal.

79
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,060
We're all set.

80
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,210
Cardholder number four, you're up.

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,280
Here you go,darling.

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,560
Yeah. Thanks.

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,550
The clocker said Sparklekid was edging

84
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,290
On the track record at prep.

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,840
Oh,that's great, honey.

86
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,440
Let's go.

87
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,470
They're up!

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,320
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,900
The starters are at the Gate... And we're ready to go.

90
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,320
And they're off and running.

91
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,440
What the hell?

92
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,010
Oh,we have a stall! It's stuck,it's stuck. The Gate's stuck.

93
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,190
I'll go talk to the manager.

94
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,400
It's...

95
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,330
You better have a damn good explanation

96
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,550
About what just happened.

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,630
All right, I'll get back to you.

98
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,790
We're looking into it right now,mr. Edison.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,650
Cue up the tape. Now.

100
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,520
We've made contact.

101
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,930
15% and counting.

102
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,610
Right there,it's stuck.

103
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,640
What happened to his Gate?!

104
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,740
I-i Don't know.

105
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,700
Lewis you better come down here.

106
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,300
Not now.

107
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,100
We found something on Gate 8 where Sparklekid was placed.

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,550
I'll be right back.

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,940
I'm coming with you.

110
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,200
Did we get it?

111
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,510
100% we're all there.

112
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,580
Card's all there.

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,110
You've never jerked a Loser before.

114
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,320
It's all your fault!

115
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,860
We're gonna need some backup.

116
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,170
Here come the cops. You better go before you get recognized.

117
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,640
Someone has to be lookout. I'll take care of it.

118
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,730
Go! Go!

119
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,460
All right,break it up,guys.

120
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,660
Let's go!

121
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,950
Hi,there.

122
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,050
Um,excuse me.

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,380
I was wondering if you could help me.

124
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,460
I placed a bet on Sparklekid for my boss.

125
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,770
Do you know what happened? Not right now, sweetheart.

126
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,710
Okay. My boss had me

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,520
Put more money on him than I make in a week.

128
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,440
Um,he's gonna flip out when I tell him about this.

129
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm really not the right person to ask.

130
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,450
Okay,but,here,i put $500 here for orca's revenge.

131
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,300
Maybe I could... You're gonna have to talk to one of the window clerks.

132
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,660
But maybe I could add it to that?

133
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,470
Look,i-i can't help you, all right?

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,630
Now,move it along,honey.

135
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,270
Okay,um,listen.

136
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm just trying to ask you

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,130
A couple questions.

138
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,420
Yeah,well, you asked one too many.

139
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,620
How about this?

140
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,540
Why Don't you help me find somebody

141
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,950
Who could help me sort all this out?

142
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,280
How's that? If you Don't take your hands off me

143
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,380
You're gonna have a lot more to worry about

144
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,490
Than an angry boss.

145
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,590
All right,well,um....

146
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,050
You take good care of yourself today,officer.

147
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,120
Excuse me?

148
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,730
This is a restricted area,sir.

149
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,650
You can't be back here.

150
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,890
Yeah,i'm looking for a manager

151
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,940
Because I'm getting the money back

152
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,010
That I bet on the horse that got stuck in the Gate.

153
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,940
Did you see that one? Yeah.

154
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,550
I said you can't be back here!

155
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,320
I need back up.

156
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,360
What are you doing?

157
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,470
Where's Mahone?

158
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,980
He's right there.

159
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,780
That's great.

160
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,920
He's got the device.

161
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,820
Mommy?

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,510
Go back to your room, okay,sweetheart.

163
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,410
Okay.

164
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,570
Oh,my god.

165
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,400
What happened to you?

166
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,600
Hey,sis.

167
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,000
We have an issue.

168
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,970
Good afternoon to you,too, Andy.

169
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,560
I've been reviewing your roster

170
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,210
From the northeast division,

171
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,150
And apparently two of your top buyers

172
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,420
Don't have valid social security numbers.

173
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,730
Care to explain that?

174
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,450
When I'm about to make a sale to a client,

175
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,490
"is the client being helped?"

176
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,850
And,"are we gettin' paid?"

177
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,270
There's a reason

178
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,620
Why I was the top Seller in the northeast.

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,420
I Don't get hung up on the details.

180
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,790
And what you're saying is...

181
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,860
There might be a typo or two in my reports,

182
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,220
But I'm pretty sure those checks cleared.

183
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,280
Fair enough.

184
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,980
You've had a busy morning, Frank.

185
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,050
Unlawful entry, resisting arrest.

186
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,350
It's not even lunchtime.

187
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,910
You're trying to put the fear of god into me.

188
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,710
Mission accomplished.

189
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,330
Listen,sergeant,

190
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,430
I know a decent amount about the justice system,

191
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,790
Enough to know that if you wanted to,

192
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
You could drop this whole thing and...

193
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,370
It would save a lot of trouble for everybody,huh?

194
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,670
What kind of phone is this?

195
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,040
It's a,a japanese brand.

196
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,050
Off market.

197
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,590
What about the ankle monitor you're wearing?

198
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,140
I've been on the straight and narrow,

199
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,110
And it's due to come off in a couple of Days.

200
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,210
Press your fingers in the ink.

201
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,250
I had two grand go up in smoke because of a bum Gate.

202
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,590
I mean,i got a little upset for a second.

203
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,020
You know what I mean? Who wouldn't?

204
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,480
Let's talk about this.

205
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,550
Should we talk about how you punched an officer first?

206
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,320
Or how you tried to flee the scene?

207
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,810
Pick a felony.

208
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,800
Take him to the holding cell.

209
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,230
What do you mean he got arrested?

210
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,230
W-what happened?

211
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,460
It's a long story,

212
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,800
But we need you to get Mahone and the device out.

213
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,720
Can you do that?

214
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,580
What,what do you think,

215
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,690
That every Time you guys screw up,

216
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,040
I can just magically make things disappear?

217
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,930
We ain't interested in your excuses.

218
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,990
Can you do it or not?

219
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,080
Lincoln,y-you know what? I'll call you back.

220
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,830
Excuse me.

221
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,670
Who are you?

222
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,290
What is this? I'm Brian.

223
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,550
I work in the it department.

224
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
We were getting some registry inconsistencies

225
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,000
On the server, so...

226
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,770
I'm just running a few routine spot checks.

227
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,840
So you just barge in here without asking?

228
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,490
I have level two clearance. See?

229
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,220
It's what I do.

230
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,620
I go into people's offices, I fix their computers.

231
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,260
I just figured it was better

232
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,060
To do it when you weren't here.

233
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,070
Well,you know what? You got to go.

234
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,330
Don't come back in here.

235
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,070
Sure thing.

236
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,640
You're all set.

237
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,650
So what's the word?

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,430
Self's on it.

239
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,250
On it,as in he's getting Mahone out?

240
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,660
He said he'd handle it.

241
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,880
What's there to handle?

242
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,790
Self yanked us all out of prison for way bigger charges.

243
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,630
Getting Mahone out should be easy,shouldn't it?

244
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,370
Yeah.

245
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,740
Let's concentrate on finding the next cardholder.

246
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,800
As soon as we get the device back,we'll move forward.

247
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,550
Would you please walk us through what we know so far?

248
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,320
Sure.

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,940
Howard Scuderi runs Agrisow,

250
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,100
Which is the world's largest agricultural conglomerate.

251
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,800
It actually has huge holdings in Laos,

252
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,400
Which,given the current inflation,

253
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,610
Means that they are making money hand over fist.

254
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,770
"my friends are playing at the park."

255
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,840
Sweetheart,why Don't you go play in your room

256
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,060
For a little bit,okay?

257
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,830
How are you feeling?

258
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,510
Better.

259
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,990
I,i made you a sandwich.

260
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,270
Thank you.

261
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,610
Um,you never explained what happened.

262
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,580
My car broke down in the middle of the desert,and,uh...

263
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
There was no one around for miles,

264
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,250
And my cell phone was dead,

265
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,780
So I walked here.

266
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,750
Hey,do you still have that owl

267
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,380
That I sent from germany?

268
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,240
Yeah.

269
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,860
I need to see it.

270
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:55,820
Okay.

271
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,030
Thank you.

272
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,250
Oh,my god,gretchen!

273
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,040
Is that,is that, that a real gun?

274
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,850
It is.

275
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,410
You Don't work for the irs?

276
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,440
I Don't.

277
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:21,930
Who do you work for?

278
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,670
As of now?

279
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,840
Myself.

280
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,120
He attended Touro Law School in Long Island.

281
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,270
He spent the next 18 years

282
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,180
Bouncing around the D.O.J. And D.O.D. Before being dumped

283
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,350
On the doorstep of homeland in '02.

284
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,140
Come in.

285
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,830
General.

286
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,500
What did you find out?

287
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,230
I tried accessing Self's user account,

288
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,140
But he has a tricky firewall system in place.

289
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,010
There's no easy way to get past it,

290
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,960
Not without...

291
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,490
Drawing attention.

292
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,190
So we still Don't know why he's interested in me.

293
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,310
Well,uh... Maybe if you gave me more Time.

294
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,600
I'll look into it.

295
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,680
Look,he's important to me.

296
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,460
Okay,he's doing a job for me.

297
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,590
Yeah,well, your ci punched

298
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
One of my officers in the face.

299
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,680
I understand...

300
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,450
You're lucky he's not being charged with worse.

301
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,800
I apologize for him.

302
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,810
Okay?

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,830
Look,i-i'm asking for a favor here,

304
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,870
Okay,from one badge to another.

305
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,540
When was the last Time you looked at your badge?

306
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,750
'cause I'm pretty sure mine says

307
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,080
"issued by the city of Los angeles,"

308
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,390
Not the federal government,

309
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,980
So unless you get a court order that... Hey,hey!

310
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,210
You want to go that route? You want to get smart?

311
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,070
Huh? Want to get detained at the Guadalajara Airport

312
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,000
When you're coming back from visiting your nana?

313
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,000
How does that sound?

314
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,820
Huh? You ever hear of a No-fly List?

315
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,680
That's what my badge could do.

316
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,730
Okay?

317
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,190
Want to see what else it could do?

318
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,170
I was starting to worry.

319
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,930
Sign these.

320
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,290
Yeah.

321
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,720
These aren't release papers. Well,i need you to sign that

322
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,360
So I can collect your personal...

323
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,910
They're gonna run my prints, and once they... You punched a cop.

324
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,350
Yeah,trying to save the mission. Keep your voice down.

325
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,050
Okay?

326
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,630
I did the best I could do.

327
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,300
You need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.

328
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,570
You... You want me to give up the one thing

329
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,920
That makes me valuable to the team.

330
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,010
Yeah,you knew the deal when you came on board.

331
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,440
Okay,we all sacrificed a lot to get this far.

332
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,550
You want to flush it down the toilet

333
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,950
Because you made a bad move?

334
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,010
Got it.

335
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,070
Self got the device.

336
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,160
Mahone's still in jail.

337
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,090
But Mahone-- he-he's part of the team.

338
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,100
Was.

339
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,310
Look,i feel just as bad

340
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,580
About his kid as everyone else,

341
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,790
But we can't blow this mission on one person.

342
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,480
Oh,yeah?

343
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,660
So if I get popped tomorrow,

344
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,120
You guys are just going to forget about me?

345
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,870
Yeah.

346
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,260
Hey,listen.

347
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,670
An assassin is trying to hunt us down,okay?

348
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,910
And that t-bag character is out in the wind

349
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,280
With the keys to the castle.

350
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,160
We got enough problems

351
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,150
Without having to worry about this guy's ass in jail.

352
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,220
You shut up.

353
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,040
Okay.

354
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,530
Alex has an alias, but if they run his prints,

355
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,510
They're gonna find out that he's... Not if--

356
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,880
Whenthey run his prints, they're going

357
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,020
To figure out who he is

358
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,170
And that he's not in a supermax like he's supposed to be,

359
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,650
And then they're gonna realize we're not...

360
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,520
Michael.

361
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,430
Linc's right.

362
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,430
We Don't have a choice.

363
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
We move forward with the plan.

364
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,970
Agent Self.

365
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,290
I'm an associate of general Krantz.

366
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,590
Word has gotten back to the general

367
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,060
That you've been pulling information on him.

368
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,950
Why is that,mr. Self?

369
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm homeland security.

370
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,990
It's my job to protect people

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,210
Who make attractive terrorist targets--

372
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,920
People in upper ranks of military,

373
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,130
People like Krantz.

374
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,680
Is there a particular threat I should know about?

375
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,790
Maybe you can debrief me on the situation.

376
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,920
What's your division?

377
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,920
You want to give me your clearance level?

378
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm a... Hired contractor.

379
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,710
Right.

380
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,690
Well,i usually Don't make a habit of giving civilians

381
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,150
Who corner me in underground parking structures

382
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
Classified information.

383
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,930
Okay?

384
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,280
So if the general has a problem, he can call me.

385
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,950
Is there something else you want to say to me?

386
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,150
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

387
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,310
I'm just here to give you a little friendly advice.

388
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,480
What's that?

389
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,060
The general-- he likes his privacy.

390
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,550
That's all.

391
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,540
Yes,so that was Wyatt.

392
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,880
I gotta tell you, I'm not a big fan

393
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,650
Of almost catching a bullet in my head.

394
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,980
Well,now you know what it's like.

395
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,780
So,how well do you know Mahone?

396
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,610
I know he wants to take down the Company

397
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,930
Just as much as we do. You also realize

398
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,430
He's a major liability.

399
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,700
I mean,

400
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,890
If Wyatt could find me, he could find Mahone.

401
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,440
And then people...

402
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,590
So get him out.

403
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,690
I told you I can't.

404
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,310
But I can get to him.

405
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,120
I mean,he can be touched.

406
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,150
I Don't know,maybe Mahone is a stand-up guy.

407
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,190
Or maybe he likes to run his mouth

408
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,180
To work an angle, I'm not sure.

409
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,230
But if need be, I can get rid of that angle.

410
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,010
I can eliminate that threat.

411
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,900
That's not an option.

412
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,430
Oh,yes it is.

413
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,390
Okay,because if a choice has to be made

414
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,480
Between him or us....

415
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,080
Hey,frank.

416
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,160
Got some good news.

417
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,280
Oh,yeah, what's that?

418
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,190
I can cut you a break.

419
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,160
As easy as that?

420
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,910
Spoke with the manager down at the racetrack.

421
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,860
Said you were spotted with another male caucasian

422
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,240
About ten years your junior.

423
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,240
That sound about right?

424
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,070
Here come the cops.

425
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,720
I have no idea

426
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,890
What you're talking about.

427
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,120
What was it?

428
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,450
The two of you were gonna go in there,rob the vault?

429
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,970
Grab as much cash and get out?

430
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,090
Someone has to be lookout.

431
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,280
I'll take care of it. Go!

432
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,540
Look.

433
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,590
Maybe you got a wife to get home to.

434
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,820
Family.

435
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,210
If you're willing

436
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,370
To give me the name of your accomplice

437
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
I think we can change your charges.

438
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,540
I thought we worked together,you know.

439
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,560
Help each other out.

440
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,950
You're on your own.

441
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,340
You holler if you change your mind.

442
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,660
All right,let's talk about the fifth cardholder.

443
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,660
The general is requiring

444
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,980
All the cardholders to have their cards on them at all Times,

445
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,770
So Scuderi will have his card,too.

446
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,350
Now,scuderi has major security around his house.

447
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,180
Big fence, lots of guard dogs.

448
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,990
Where are the documents?

449
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,260
These are from the county surveyor's office.

450
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,130
It shows the layout of his property,

451
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,180
And its proximity to every other house on his street.

452
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,130
He has-- surprise,surprise--

453
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,850
A top of the line electronic alarm system

454
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,080
That will alert him

455
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,660
If there's a breach in the structure.

456
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,440
If we cut the power-- the alarm goes off.

457
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,420
If we double the power

458
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,770
With a voltage spike

459
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,000
The alarm system, in order to protect itself

460
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,520
Against an overload, will shut itself down.

461
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,700
And that's how we're getting in.

462
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,630
Then what?

463
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,110
Look,i know what the score is.

464
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,420
It's every man for himself.

465
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,910
You get left behind you get locked up.

466
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,080
Tough titties.

467
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,920
Now,i signed on the dotted line

468
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,800
Like everyone else and I want to know exactly

469
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,270
What I'm doing on this job.

470
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,830
I'm with Bellick on this one.

471
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,870
You know,maybe

472
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,720
We should have a plan for when the cops get here

473
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,280
'cause if Mahone squeals

474
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,840
They're gonna come real quick.

475
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,150
He's a fed-- how many deals

476
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,810
Do you think this guy's made in his life?

477
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,730
You think he's just gonna tuck tail between his...

478
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,660
Shut up.

479
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,450
Look,we can sit here and debate

480
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,730
What Mahone is or is not gonna do for the rest of the Day,

481
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,250
We cannot break him out of a police station.

482
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,930
One... Two...

483
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,440
Three,four,five,six--

484
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,340
No. Too big.

485
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,400
Eight by ten.

486
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,840
This is the lowest gauge I could get.

487
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,300
It's perfect. Cool.

488
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,110
I guess,uh...

489
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,940
I guess we're gonna leave him in jail.

490
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,560
Is that a statement or a question?

491
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,180
It's just if something happens to Alex--

492
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,580
If,uh,if the Company finds him...

493
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,220
If the roles were reversed and you were the one locked up,

494
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,210
You really think Alex would risk it all to get you out?

495
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,880
I mean,i Don't know.

496
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,740
I think he'd finish what he started.

497
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,980
I think he'd bring the Company down.

498
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,780
Can I help you with something?

499
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Yes,i-i'm here to see Frank Zwan.

500
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,080
I'm a family friend.

501
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,060
I'm afraid you can't see him right now.

502
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,110
He's about to be transferred for his arraignment.

503
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,200
Actually,i'd like to be there...

504
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,480
For moral support.

505
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:46,930
Hello?

506
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,010
Michael.

507
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,660
Alex,look,i'm sorry.

508
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,940
He found me.

509
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,720
Wyatt-- he showed up at the station house

510
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,450
Where they're holding me. I Don't know how he did it.

511
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,890
I Don't know how he figured it out.

512
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,070
Let me call agent Self.

513
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,160
No,michael,listen...

514
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,330
No,maybe he can get you moved.

515
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,450
It's-it's over for me. It's Done.

516
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,700
It's-- and I'm not gonna say anything about anything.

517
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,010
But you need to promise me something,okay?

518
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,820
Okay,what?

519
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,760
Promise me...

520
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,470
That you will get to Wyatt

521
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,910
And you'll kill the son of a bitch.

522
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,180
And then you'll call Pam

523
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,060
And you'll tell her that he's gone.

524
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,250
All right.

525
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,930
I promise.

526
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,880
Okay.

527
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,550
Okay.

528
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,700
All right.

529
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,510
You ready to go?

530
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,590
Michael?

531
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,200
I'm his wife.

532
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm sorry, I'm-i'm still in shock.

533
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,750
I'll be down this afternoon.

534
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,110
Thank you.

535
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,950
Who are you?

536
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,060
I just have some things I need to take care of.

537
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,470
You Don't need to worry.

538
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,020
You have this...

539
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,950
Switch inside you.

540
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,170
I Don't know how you could just...

541
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,950
Shut yourself off.

542
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,010
You did it when mom died.

543
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,010
Did it with Emily.

544
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,240
Did it with me.

545
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,000
I do it because it's...

546
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,310
...It's just who I am.

547
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,160
No,it's not.

548
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,180
You used to be...

549
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,500
I have to go.

550
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,040
But thank you... For everything.

551
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,710
So,you're not here to take her?

552
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,780
If I was capable of being her mother,

553
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,520
I wouldn't have given you custody.

554
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,070
You be a good girl, okay?

555
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,720
Bye,emily.

556
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,570
Bye,auntie.

557
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,900
I love you.

558
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,830
Will we see you again?

559
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,430
I Don't know.

560
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,550
Call me if it goes south.

561
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,830
To listen to your messages press...

562
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,840
I was planning to make those grilled pork chops,

563
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,460
Unless you're not in the mood for them.

564
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,130
I hope you're having a great Day.

565
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,910
Hey,what are you guys doing?

566
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,490
We'll call you when we're Done.

567
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,260
Wait.

568
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,290
Where are you guys?

569
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:29,840
You have a problem.

570
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,030
What's that?

571
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,770
What can I do you for?

572
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,820
I just-- I've found some more inconsistencies

573
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,370
In your sales reports.

574
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,540
Actually,many more.

575
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,920
In fact...

576
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,430
Kind of looks like fraud, actually.

577
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,200
I knew you were rotten from the beginning.

578
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,620
I want you in my office in five minutes

579
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,830
To walk me through this,

580
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,250
And if you can't,

581
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,090
Well,i'm gonna call the authorities.

582
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,910
What are you doing?

583
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,900
Nice knowing you,sugar.

584
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,450
Cole,wait.

585
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,750
I was traveling abroad when he passed away.

586
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,580
Again,i'm very sorry.

587
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,770
Is this your husband?

588
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,360
Yes.

589
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,560
I need to see some identification

590
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,890
So I can sign over his personal belongings to you.

591
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,370
So... You and your spouse had different last names?

592
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,750
That's correct.

593
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,540
I realize this is an inconvenience,

594
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,870
But I need to see other documentation

595
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,350
Proving you were married.

596
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

597
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,530
I'm sorry,ma'am.

598
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,460
Rules are rules.

599
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,900
Hey,mr. Pfeiffer,this is Crystal from Instahomes

600
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,930
Getting back to you.

601
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,190
Just wanted to let you know

602
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,380
That your security deposit check cleared

603
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,660
And your one bedroom is ready. Thank you.

604
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,470
Hi,i'm,uh, representing Frank Zwan.

605
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,870
I'm going to need his jacket from you.

606
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,720
I've been informed he's going indigent.

607
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,700
Uh,he was.

608
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,390
His mother in Santa Barbara,however,is not,

609
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,920
And she retained me this morning.

610
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,470
Be my guest.

611
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,700
Much obliged.

612
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,050
Five.

613
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,730
Four.

614
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,190
Three.

615
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,780
Sir,sir.

616
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,940
Two.

617
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,220
Please take a seat.

618
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,690
One.

619
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,840
One.

620
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,760
I Don't know

621
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,460
If,uh,you guys...

622
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,580
Did this for the team or if you did it

623
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,010
For me,and...

624
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,620
I Don't care.

625
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,230
I just...

626
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,440
Thank you.

627
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,950
Yes.

628
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,730
I got your message.

629
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,770
I was wondering when you were going to call.

630
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,300
You told my wife

631
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,850
You wanted me to turn myself in.

632
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,590
So,uh,why Don't you tell me where to go and I'll meet you?

633
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,540
Let's get this over with.

634
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,360
This thing is far from over,

635
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,100
Alex.

636
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,300
First I find Sara Tancredi here,

637
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,590
Then you.

638
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,000
Seems like there's a great deal of things for us to talk about.

639
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,760
Oh,no.

640
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,020
No,no,no.

641
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,360
There's only one thing for you and I to discuss.

642
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,980
You worked for the Company once,alex.

643
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,520
You should know better than to take things so personally.

644
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,410
I'm gonna wrap this up,

645
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,680
Just in case you decided to trace this call,

646
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,200
But I promise you...

647
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,070
...We will meet again, and when we do,

648
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm going to show you just how personal things can get.

649
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,110
Oh,yeah.

650
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,970
Cole Pfeiffer.

651
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,730
What you gonna do now?

652
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,810
Who the hell are you?



9999
