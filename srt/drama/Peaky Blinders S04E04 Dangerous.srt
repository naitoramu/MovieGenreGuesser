been my son's 21st birthday.

And, as a gesture,

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,136
I thought I would
invite your brother, Arthur.

29

Not exactly forgiveness.

But something like that.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,773
And also it's a way of saying
thank you to the Shelby family

33
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,649
for helping me and my children get by

Well, I will let Arthur know.

the Birmingham branch

Distilled for the eradication

I'm going to put that on the label.

328
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,334
I'll book myself a room.

Already done. The Midland. Suite.

330
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,654
I stay there myself sometimes.

331
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,692
Sometimes, it's where you stay.

332
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,171
But not tonight, it would seem.

333
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,132
Well, since I'm stuck here,
maybe I should try your gin.

334
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,095
- 4:00 then.
- Where?

335
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,380
I'll find you.

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,690
What the fuck
was that about, Lizzie? Eh?

337
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,534
Have a guess.

338
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,459
You know what,
I can't even guess any more.

339
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,020
I'll be back at 4:00.

340
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Why is she still here?

341
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,617
Something to do
with the coal miners, apparently.

that at any time,
we can reach your son.

- Fucking her.

for the rest of the week?

Okay, I'll read your tea leaves
if you go and get Tommy's diary.

So what do you say, Mr Maine?

396
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,417
He works hard. He's game.

397
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,571
I'll need to work on his defence.

398
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,573
Right now, his left hand
is just good for wanking

399

You don't have to earn your money.

400

We're paying you anyway. Is he ready?

401
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,333
Is he even registered?

402
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,018
I put him down as a welterweight,

who do you see across the canvas, eh?

410
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,694
I see myself.

411
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,738
Forty years old having done fuck all,
except tramping the lanes.

412

00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,139
He said he's at a meeting.

419
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,180
Yes, I was wondering,

420
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,740
do you have any boots
that I could borrow?

421
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,573
Why do you need boots?

422
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,174
Well, no one here will speak to me,

423
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,694
so I thought I'd take a walk
by the canal.

424
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,134
Is he really making gin?

425
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,936
He's going mad cooped up here
is what he is.

426
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,898
Like a wasp in a beer glass.

- Oh.
- Thank you, Curly.

If you're going to take
a walk along the canal,

431
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,695
you'll also need this.

They were busy.

447

Apparently, there was a report
of armed men in the Small Heath area.

And there was a murder

And something happening
on the Stratford Road.

The strikers threatened
the men's families.

They said, come the revolution,
their names would be on a list.

Did you ever consider the possibility
that the communists might win?

And you and me, traitors to our class,

will be put up against a wall

I consider all possibilities.

No. I don't really have time
for hobbies.

More of a place
where I try things out.

I've decided, if I'm gonna be
stuck here in Small Heath,

I might as well do something useful.

Less of a hobby.

More of a venture.

Since the start of prohibition,

483
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,420

00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,089
(CHUCKLES)

486
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,493
But my supply lines from Scotland
have been unreliable.

487
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,900
There's been a lot of thefts.

488
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,138
And in this modern age, American women
drink as much booze as the men.

489
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,131
And women, apparently, prefer gin.

490
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,939
So with the help of a friend of mine
in Camden Town,

491
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,057
I've set up my own source of supply.

492
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,372
Junipers, potatoes, sugar and water,

493
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,493
all turned into US dollars.

494
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,615
When we're up and running,
we'll produce over 200 gallons a week.

495
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,490
But before then,
I need to get my recipe right.

496
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,619
So tell me the truth.

497
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,212
- The truth?
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,371
You're unlike any man I've ever met.

499
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,620
- And the gin?
- Too sweet.

500
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,694
You said you'd booked a room.

501
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,293
No, I booked a suite.

502
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,654
Thank you.

503
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,939
If you book a taxi, I'll go.

504
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,657
You're a businessman, Tommy.
A good one.

505
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,415
- If only you could...
- If only I could what?

506
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,418
If only you could change?

507
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,732
Go on, say it.
If only you could change the bad.

508
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,376
And "the good" is laying off
a thousand men, which I do.

509
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,336
Like a good businessman,
and I do it like that. (SNAPS FINGERS)

510
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,853
And people go hungry.

511
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,254
And the bad, the bad's
a fucking win on the horses

512
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,936
and a gun
and some fucking self-respect.

513
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,893
You fucking people...

514
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,859
You bite like your horse.

515
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,892
I don't trust taxis any more.

516
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,619
Come with me.

517
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,779
ARTHUR: There we go, brother.

518
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,973
Home sweet home.

519
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,449
A place for you to bring women back,
bring your mates.

520
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,214
Play games, gamble, cards,

521
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,492
and you keep an eye on our backyard.

522
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,452
It's Artillery Square, the place
is full of communists and strikers.

523
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,411
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

524
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,690
Light the fucking fire.
Take some of this shit off the walls.

525
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,451
Curly'll be over later
with some poison for the rats.

526
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,578
- Arthur?
- Huh?

527
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,494
This morning, I wouldn't
have been able to pull that trigger.

528
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,138
I know I wouldn't.
They would have just walked past.

I'm notJohn.

530
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,933
- I know I'm not.
- All right.

531
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,969
All right, brother.

532
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,900
I know you're not.

533
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,014
I know.

534
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,817
In the end, it's God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

535
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,178
We don't get to decide
who lives and who dies, Finn.

536
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,334
Not us.

537
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:10,414
You just have to flick a switch
in your head.

538

Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

539
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,819
And he's right.

540

They all know we're on the ropes.

546
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,732
- And that's not including the mafia.
- Yup.

547
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,254
Here's your carriage.

548
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,491
You can catch the 7:15 train.

549
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,932
I thought there was a strike.

550
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,534
What gave you that idea?

551
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,214
My God.

552
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,939
I know.

553
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,613
The bad I can't help.

554
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,776
I wanted you to stay.

555
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,772
And normally, I get my own way.

556
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,689
Losing occasionally makes me worse.

doesn't she, Tom?

559
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,140
- Walk her to the train, Curly.
- Yeah.

This talk of national austerity,

562

this talk of tightening our belts
must be met with a resolute certainty.

563
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,252
We will not accept any cuts in pay.

564
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,050
We will not accept working
longer hours for the same wage.

don't allow unaccompanied

In return for something very unusual.

- To sit down with you and talk.

we have no need to talk.

Dear God, are you serious?

My brother's a bookmaker.

Bookmakers hedge their bets.

Sometimes, long shots come in.

617
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,938
And because we emptied
his buses today,

618
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,579
he thinks we are among
the runners and riders.

619
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,413
Beneath it all,
my brother is a very rational man.

620
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,854
Beneath all what?

621
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,533
You mean, beneath the beatings,
the cuttings,

622
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,816
- the shootings, the murders.
- Yeah. Beneath all that.

623
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,374
Tell your brother
that when we take power,

624
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,816
all means of production
will be owned by the workers.

I really have nothing to wear.

You'd need to wear boots.

635
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,300
He's suggesting dinner
in a scrap metal yard.

636
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,417
He said you'd appreciate
the sentiment.

If you don't show up,
the offer of parity is withdrawn.

since we left London.

He grows in the dark.

- Do ya?

652
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,337
Yeah? Well, the place is a shit hole.

653
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,298
Yeah? So why don't you
just knock yourself out.

- Yeah, it is. It is.

everybody's in fucking bed?

Right.

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,653
Let me introduce you to David.

00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,740
This way, boys.

Oh, right, the problem, right,
between rum and gin

671
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,374
is that gin, right,
it leads to the melancholy,

672
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,770
whereas rum incites violence.

673

You know, it also allows you
to be liberated from your self-doubt.

00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,130
I hear you're probably
more in need of the old rum

675
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,132
at the moment
rather than gin, mate. Hmm?

you've got fucking starlings, mate.

Oh, yeah.
That shit will rot your pipework.

It's all right, Alfie.
There's no need.

It's all right, I'm, er...
I'm getting a kestrel.

00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,089
I hear that you've got Italians, mate.

You've got a kestrel for them and all?

- Yes.
- Hmm.

685
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,293
I have a kestrel for them as well.

You are back where you belong, Tommy.

I know you don't touch it,
but you have a good nose.

691
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,700
Right. Well,
you've got to ask yourself,

692
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,055
seriously though, you know,

693
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,815
did I even want to
piss and shit indoors?

694
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,053
Or was I actually born that I were to
defecate in fields and the outhouses?

695
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,450
This is a serious issue,
though, Tommy,

696
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,612
'cause your people, your class

697
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,010
and my religion
is quite similar, actually,

698
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,331
because you just cannot
wash it out, right?

699

Hmm. No.

What have you heard, Alfie?

703
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,697
I heard a copper got shot.
Who shot him?

704
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,938
- My kestrel.
- Right, oh, up the stakes, very good.

705
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,693
Where are the Sicilians?

706
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:49,095
They're still using Sabini
for vehicles and for places to stay.

707
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,409
Mmm-hmm. And reinforcements?

Ah, they know the Sicilians,
don't they?

709

They don't trust nobody who ain't
fucked a goat on the morning

710

of their first pubic hair.
They've got traditions.

711
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,411
- How many are here?
- Eleven.

712

who wrapped his balls in an OBE,

713

can ask you that question, eh?

719
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,254
But the truth is, Tommy,

720
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,899
you're going to be
fucking dead soon, yeah.

721
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,017
Then your starlings, right,

722
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,251
they will peck out
your blue eyes, won't they?

723
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,891
And the jackdaws, they will steal
your gold and your medals

00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,050
and pretty soon it'll be as if

725
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,371
it never even
fucking happened, mate.

726
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,814
Tommy, there are men approaching.

727
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,414
Yeah, let 'em pass.

728
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,658
Right. You tell Darby Sabini from me,

729
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,335
that if the Italians win,
they're not planning on leaving.

730
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,010
And after me, it'll be him,
and then you, then the Titanic.

731
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,451
They're the fucking mafia, Alfie.

732
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,294
They've come here and can't believe
our coppers are unarmed.

733
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,020
They can distil their liquor
and it's against the law.

734
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,296
They've come here
and they like what they see.

735
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,576
They're coming
and they're here to stay.

739
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,491
Tommy, when a pikey walks in
with hair like that,

740
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,572
you've gotta ask yourself,
"Have I made a mistake?"

741
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,578
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

742
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,051
- Who the fuck is this?
- I, my friend,

743
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,934
I am the uncle,

744
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,092
I'm the protector
and the promoter,

745
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,979
of that fucking thing right there
in whose shadow

746
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,337
nothing good nor godly
will ever fucking grow.

747
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,653
That there, right, is the Southern
Counties welterweight champion.

748
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,296
He is of mixed religion,
therefore he is godless,

749
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,292
he was adopted by Satan himself,

750
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,849
before he was returned
out of fear of his awkwardness.

751
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,973
He is impossible to marry off
due to his lethal dimensions,

752
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,734
his mother terrified,
she's fucking abandoned him.

753
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,857
And there he is stood before you

754
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,978
like the first of some
brand new fucking species.

755
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,178
Any man that you put before him,

756
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,378
right, it'd be like entering
a fucking threshing machine, mate.

757
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,379
Now, will you offer your son?

758
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,138

Yeah. Your mother wants me to go
