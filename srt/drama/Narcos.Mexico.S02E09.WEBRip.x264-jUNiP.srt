1
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,156
Oh, look who's here.

2
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,326
She finally calmed down.
She's been crying since you left.

3
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,827
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

4
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,749
- She's acting like she's sleeping.
- Yes!

5
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,420
The genius is out back waiting for you.

6
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,255
Genius?

7
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,507
Can I come?

8
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,468
- No, you can't go out there.
- You're staying with me.

9
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,099
Hey!

10
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,353
Working too hard or what?

11
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,691
Look.

12
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,194
What?

13
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,865
Fuck. No seeds.

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,784
Told you it was possible.

15
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,369
Told you it was possible!

16
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,914
Fuck, what are we gonna do with this?

17
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,749
Get super fucking high.

18
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,769
It's nice being here.

19
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,564
Reminds me of how things were.

20
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,944
You hated the way things were.

21
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,863
You hated it here.

22
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,325
I did.

23
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,290
Abril's having a recital...

24
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,377
at the school on Tuesday.

25
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,545
You should come.

26
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,631
Really?

27
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,759
You don't mind?

28
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,012
She wants her father to be there.

29
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,224
So I want you to be with her too.

30
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,980
That's good.

31
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,233
Well, how about this...

32
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,610
I'll go,

33
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,280
but in return, can you
come somewhere with me?

34
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,003
An event for the
election in Mexico City.

35
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,618
Don't make this a negotiation.

36
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,121
That's not what I meant.

37
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,290
I already said I'm going.

38
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,293
I'm asking you because...

39
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,797
I want you there with me.

40
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,304
Why'd you come back here?

41
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,598
Tell me the truth.

42
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,934
And don't say it's me.

43
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,608
Someone tried to kill me.

44
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,655
Who?

45
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,534
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

46
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,415
I tried to cut a deal with the Gulf.

47
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,546
Tried to outmaneuver
the Colombians, but...

48
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,050
I fucked up, and he outmaneuvered me.

49
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,011
That's why you took on this shipment.

50
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,764
Somehow prove you could still win.

51
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
Oh, Miguel...

52
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,729
You're never going to change.

53
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,777
Maybe I will.

54
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,404
Give me a chance?

55
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,493
You know, I haven't forgotten
what I did to you.

56
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,120
Neither have I.

57
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,251
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,760
So what are you going to do?

59
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,805
This shipment doesn't get through,
there won't be a you.

60
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,352
And if it does?

61
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,897
I'll be on top.

62
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,817
I'm almost there.

63
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,570
Where is there?

64
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,364
And what happens when you arrive?

65
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,370
Drug trafficking works
like any other business.

66
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,124
Supply and demand.

67
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,917
Supply starts in Colombia,

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,253
America's got no shortage of demand,

69
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,672
and Mexico plays the middleman.

70
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,257
That's the model.

71
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,040
And like any other business,

72
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,469
traffickers are always
trying to scale up.

73
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,848
Bring as much of the supply
to the demand as you can.

74
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,392
You can move one, why not ten?

75
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,853
Move ten, why not a hundred?

76
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,356
You ain't going up, you're going out.

77
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,230
In 1987, it was estimated that 140 tons

78
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,362
were smuggled into the United States.

79
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,615
Félix was planning on moving
half of that in one night.

80
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,659
Seventy fucking tons.

81
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,828
How's that for scaling up?

82
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,746
Fuck being the middleman.

83
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,458
Félix was about to reshuffle the deck.

84
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,086
Have you heard?

85
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,673
About what?

86
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,762
Félix is about to move 70 tons
of cocaine through Juárez.

87
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,932
How do you know this?

88
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,644
Might be asking the wrong question.

89
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,858
I heard it from a friend.

90
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,944
You didn't.

91
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,030
What do you think that means?

92
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,284
He's back to keeping secrets.

93
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,453
Fucking Juárez.

94
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,289
No. Fucking Félix.

95
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,836
Seventy tons?

96
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,756
A shipment that big?

97
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,176
And he fucking pulls it off...

98
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,679
If this fucker pulls this off,

99
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,683
we're as good as dead.

100
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,687
Then, God willing, someone
puts a bullet in him first.

101
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,946
So anyone Félix had ever wronged,

102
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,031
anyone who ever stood in his way...

103
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,576
you've gotta believe they
were rooting against him now.

104
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,118
- What's up?
- Good afternoon.

105
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,872
- What's up?
- Everything's good.

106
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,997
'Cause if Félix pulled this off,

107
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,296
the past would be that.

108
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,382
Left behind.

109
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,759
Somehow forgotten.

110
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,869
Someone told me you were looking for me.

111
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,765
Yeah.
You're still down in Mexico?

112
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,560
I thought you were coming home.

113
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,063
Soon. It's... It's complicated.

114
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,441
I'm working on something
really big here, so...

115
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,319
Good, I'm... I'm glad.

116
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,406
Walt, that's... that's good.
Listen...

117
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,242
the reason I was calling is...

118
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,829
a position opened up.

119
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,623
At the hospital out in Round Rock.

120
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,751
That's great news.
It's a little far, isn't it?

121
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,421
Yeah...

122
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,839
Me and Danny are moving.

123
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,050
You're selling the house?

124
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,345
Yeah.

125
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,599
All right, well, I'd...

126
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,560
really like to come by there,
you know, maybe...

127
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,897
spend some more time in Greg's
space before you let it go.

128
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,108
Well, we sold it, so
it'd have to be now.

129
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,321
You're moving quickly. What...

130
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,574
What'd you do with all of Greg's things?

131
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,954
I donated what I could and...

132
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,791
you know, a couple things
I'm taking with me.

133
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,254
Listen, I...

134
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,174
I knew hearing this would
hurt, Walt. I'm...

135
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,886
I'm sorry.
I don't mean for it to.

136
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,639
But...

137
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,016
we talked about this, right?

138
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,519
I need to move on.

139
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,397
It's time.

140
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,527
It's just gonna be really
tough driving by your place

141
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,655
and not seeing the two
of you guys out front.

142
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,115
Look, Walt, you've been...

143
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,787
You've been torturing
yourself for a long time now.

144
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,375
Maybe it's time that...

145
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,877
you let go of the past too.

146
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,756
I don't want to forget him
and get on with my life

147
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,008
like it doesn't matter that he's gone.

148
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,345
And nobody will.

149
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,684
Listen, nothing that you do is
gonna make him matter more, Walt.

150
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,271
He already does.

151
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,984
Listen, I should go. I...

152
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,821
Whatever it is that you're
doing down there, I...

153
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,282
I hope you find what you're looking for.

154
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,629
A saying I heard once...

155
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,881
When you set out on
a journey of revenge,

156
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,967
dig two graves.

157
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,470
But if two, why not ten?

158
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,848
If ten, why not a hundred?

159
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,435
Because if the past wasn't
going to catch up to Félix,

160
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,729
then it was time to force its hand.

161
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,620
They're all fucking coming at
once, just like you thought.

162
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,755
We've been over the risks.

163
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,468
But I want to be really
clear on something.

164
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,849
This is no longer the same
job you've been hired for.

165
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,226
We have no support on this.

166
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,854
Shit goes south out there, it's on us.

167
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,647
Believe me,

168
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,275
this ain't worth the shitty stipend
you've been getting paid.

169
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,737
Some of you got kids, families.

170
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,031
Just because you've been
helping us run surveillance

171
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,325
and have known this
asshole your whole life,

172
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,951
doesn't mean you're locked in.

173
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,705
So if any of you are feeling
any hesitation or nervousness,

174
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,248
you need to tell me now.

175
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,255
We do this, we cripple Félix
Gallardo's entire operation?

176
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,882
Yes.

177
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,858
Fuck being nervous.

178
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,636
We'll never get this chance again.

179
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,513
Come on, let's do this shit.

180
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,603
Okay.

181
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,605
Let's fucking cripple it.

182
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,544
Colombians called.

183
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,905
We're set for this afternoon.

184
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,241
Good.

185
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,744
We are ready for tonight.

186
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,625
The other plazas, you think they've
heard about this shipment?

187
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,211
Don't doubt they've heard rumors.

188
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,130
That worries me.

189
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,551
They've been struggling.

190
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,971
And with them helping you
with the election...

191
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,725
If Cárdenas had won,
we'd have all been arrested.

192
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,894
Don't let them fool you, Azul.

193
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,357
They saved themselves
as much as they did me.

194
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,736
Right now, let's focus on Juárez.

195
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,074
You should maybe speak to Amado.

196
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:32,162
From what Aguilar's said,
the kid seems a little off.

197
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,961
No. He's all about business.

198
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,424
His uncle went down,
and he never said shit.

199
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,219
I hope that you're right.

200
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,765
Hey, Azul.

201
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,811
You got a lot of opinions today, man.

202
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,647
Something else on your mind?

203
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,485
You're gambling with our lives.

204
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,321
Something goes wrong,

205
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,156
it isn't just you.

206
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,199
We all take the fall.

207
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,119
That's right.

208
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,163
You all rose with me.

209
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,666
Without me, everyone is fucked.

210
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,380
But if we survive tonight,

211
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,091
brace yourself.

212
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,427
The future is ours.

213
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,098
Well, I'm rooting for us.

214
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,385
Welcome to Chiapas.

215
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,846
Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.

216
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,264
How are you?

217
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,642
Your pizza.

218
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,852
What is this?

219
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,354
I'll need you to sign here.

220
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,565
What, can't take me at my word?

221
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,735
Bullshit bureaucracy.

222
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
I've always liked jungles.

223
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,122
Being in touch with nature is nice.

224
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,877
I imagine you made quite a bit
of noise, building this place.

225
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,587
I feel for the animals.

226
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,173
The big ones left when they heard us.

227
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,843
Only the snakes stayed.

228
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,012
Like you.

229
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,809
Which of these saucepans
will be taking me home?

230
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,352
That one.

231
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,826
Someone sends you very special
regards. And a big kiss.

232
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,994
Oh, fuck!

233
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,165
Well, return the kiss with
much love and respect.

234
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,959
Listen...

235
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,588
that coke is prime quality.

236
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,423
So don't go sticking your nose in it.

237
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,551
Good luck on the rest
of your journey then.

238
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,761
Been a pleasure, Amado.

239
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,400
Your wife's arrived.

240
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,985
Good.

241
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,071
Waiting for you downstairs.

242
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,921
Ready to fly?

243
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,564
Which one of these do you want to take?

244
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,091
None. I'm staying.

245
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,593
Then who's going to fly the last plane?

246
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,554
None of your business, motherfucker.

247
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,986
I'm glad you came.

248
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,740
When someone sends a jet...

249
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,247
You look beautiful.

250
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,461
Not bad for two kids from Sinaloa.

251
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,132
Let's go.

252
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,503
Hey, there you are.

253
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,924
What's up? All good?

254
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,135
Yeah, I guess so.

255
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,346
Just something I can't figure out.

256
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,181
What's that?

257
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,935
Why'd you have me put the
transponder back on that plane?

258
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,990
This place is amazing, right?

259
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,743
Where you've always wanted to be.

260
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,372
And here's the man that
made tonight possible.

261
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,582
How are you?

262
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,501
I'm glad you could join us.

263
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,752
Of course.

264
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,128
- You must be María.
- Yes.

265
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,798
You're so cute. Pleasure to
meet you. I'm Cecilia Rosario.

266
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,801
The pleasure is mine.
What a beautiful party.

267
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,344
And we've only just begun.

268
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,637
That's right.

269
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,139
Let me show you to your table.

270
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,849
What a show we're all in for tonight.

271
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,518
You see that gray-haired guy over there?

272
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,520
His name is Hank González.

273
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,188
He made his money in banking.

274
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,651
Fancies airplanes, has
quite an impressive fleet.

275
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,697
Though he'll still try and tell you
his real passion's in teaching.

276
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,899
This way, please.

277
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,478
All right, everybody be safe out there.

278
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,202
I'll be in your ear.

279
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,121
Stay alert, you stay alive.

280
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,927
The person talking to the president

281
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,971
is the engineer Carlos Slim.

282
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,141
He made a fortune in the stock market.

283
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,561
Known as a champion of the working man.

284
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,731
So, you'd have to ask him why
he sells all his companies

285
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,566
as soon as he can turn a profit.

286
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,610
And us?

287
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,487
Who are we pretending to be tonight?

288
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,947
Yourselves.

289
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,699
There's no more pretending.

290
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,284
You're friends of the party.

291
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,870
And that's all that really matters.

292
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,497
This way, please.

293
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,461
Plane one is wheels down.

294
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,296
Let's get to work.

295
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,557
I appreciate you all coming tonight.

296
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,354
Squeezing into those
beautiful outfits for us.

297
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,941
For some of you,
I know that wasn't easy.

298
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,699
All of you mean a great
deal to my family.

299
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,828
We thank you for your support.

300
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,081
The election...

301
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,044
was a little closer than we'd hoped.

302
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,295
But in the end,

303
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,049
democracy has a way of
choosing its own path.

304
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,052
Thanks to all of you, it's chosen ours.

305
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,763
Thank you so much.

306
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,942
I think my brother'd
like to say a few words.

307
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,736
The president.

308
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,501
Plane two is wheels down.

309
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,962
Plane one, what's the
status of the cargo?

310
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,465
Almost done unloading.

311
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,259
Well, hurry the fuck up.

312
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,100
I look around this room tonight,

313
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,019
and I see the faces
of those responsible,

314
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,397
responsible for our great victory.

315
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,568
And from that victory,

316
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,529
a new world begins.

317
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,283
Affirmative on the product.
Go, guys.

318
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,308
Good evening, asshole.

319
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,571
My friends, your involvement
will be rewarded.

320
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,115
Because together,

321
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:38,036
we take the first step, and
join those in the first world.

322
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,590
United by the belief

323
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,469
that a change is necessary
for our worlds to grow,

324
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,973
for our economies to align.

325
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,394
Talk to me out there, boys.

326
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,229
How are we looking?

327
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,277
A great change is on the horizon.

328
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,531
One that will see Mexico
stand as one with Europe

329
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,074
and the Americas.

330
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,004
And those of us sitting here tonight
will be the first to prosper.

331
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,472
As you join me in taking the first step,

332
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,697
guiding Mexico into the 21st century,

333
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,534
ladies and gentlemen,

334
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,787
join me in raising a glass...

335
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,173
as we toast

336
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,885
to the work yet to be done.

337
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,679
To the growth...

338
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,892
prosperity...

339
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,106
and liberation of a new Mexico!

340
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,817
Liberation of a new Mexico!

341
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,110
Move!

342
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,427
What the fuck is this?

343
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,256
On the fucking ground,
right now, all of you!

344
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,224
Don't make me fucking
kill you. Don't move.

345
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,892
I said on the fucking ground!

346
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,728
What the fuck is this?

347
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,462
Jesus.
The weight of these things...

348
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,268
Come on. Let's get this done!

349
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,383
Yeah!

350
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,019
Fucking thing is too heavy.

351
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,649
Hey, Walt!

352
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,860
This isn't coke!

353
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,909
Take cover! It's an ambush!

354
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,983
You okay, Ossie?

355
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,568
No, we're fucking pinned!

356
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,656
We gotta move!

357
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,159
Fucking go where?

358
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,411
Let's head to the mountain!

359
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,788
We'll never make it!

360
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,249
What the fuck else are we gonna do?

361
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,923
Hey, Walt! Wait.

362
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,091
The keys are in the truck, right?

363
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,638
The fuck are you talking about?

364
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,345
I'm fucking dying, man.

365
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,510
Please, Walt, let me fucking do this.

366
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,730
I can help you make it out.

367
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,899
Get me in the truck.

368
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,859
Please.

369
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,741
Walt, what the fuck are you doing?

370
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,662
Cover me!

371
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,125
- Where's Amat?
- What?

372
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,327
He was right behind you.

373
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,379
Fuck.

374
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,965
Go back to the safe house.
I'll meet you there.

375
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,800
Dude, let's get Amat
and go the fuck home.

376
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,177
Hey. Sal, this is on me.

377
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,346
Get the fuck back to the safe house.

378
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,430
Go!

379
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,516
Go!

380
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,351
Fuck.

381
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,651
We got one!

382
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,736
Fuck.

383
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,919
- You guys got one?
- Fucker's still alive.

384
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,521
I never thought I would
be so happy to see you.

385
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,066
Where's Walt?

386
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,992
Man, get me out of here.

387
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,285
Please.

388
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,414
And I swear to God, I've
never seen your face before.

389
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,421
I'm sorry.
I can't take that risk.

390
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,426
Holy shit!

391
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,012
He came out of nowhere.
He almost got me.

392
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,431
One went that way, and the
other went the other way.

393
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,809
Run. You can still catch them.

394
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,031
You out there, Walt?

395
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,584
There's nowhere to go.

396
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,389
What the fuck did you do?

397
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,975
What you made me.

398
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,064
If you hadn't cut me off, I could've
warned you this would happen.

399
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,818
They found the
transponders two days ago.

400
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,570
You walked into a trap.

401
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,447
But you wanted to go your own way.

402
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,825
He deserved to walk away, Walt.
They all did.

403
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,495
But they were never going to.

404
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,831
You made sure of it.

405
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,710
You should've been the one
to die tonight, Walt.

406
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,004
But I'm going to let you live.

407
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,923
Get the fuck out of here

408
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,426
and don't stop walking until
you hear them speak English.

409
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,641
I heard from the team
in Juárez. It's done.

410
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,954
Were there any problems?

411
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:46,000
None.
Nothing we weren't expecting.

412
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,128
I'll fly the real shit in tomorrow.

413
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,089
Good.

414
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,384
Fucking Amado.

415
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,097
You fucking did it.

416
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,891
All right then.

417
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,905
I still can't believe it.

418
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,576
Amazing, what you've done.

419
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,080
I hope you realize that.

420
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,289
Yeah.

421
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,792
You survived.

422
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,378
You might be the only one
who thought you would.

423
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,049
I think a few people may
have counted me out,

424
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,010
but I'm only back where I started.

425
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,471
And what have you learned?

426
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,684
It isn't about where you are.

427
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,772
That's been your problem all along.

428
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,440
Oh, yeah?

429
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,069
It's what you learn along the way.

430
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,996
Thank you for coming tonight.

431
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,166
Really.

432
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,543
It means a lot to me.

433
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,631
Son of a bitch.

434
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,791
Who else made it out?

435
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,086
Walt.

436
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,507
Who else made it out?

437
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,389
Everyone's gone.

438
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,383
Sorry to keep you gentlemen waiting.

439
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,763
Why don't we get started?

440
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,475
Is Administrator Lawn coming?

441
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,270
I don't believe that he is.

442
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,234
Well, a certain context for what
took place down there, sir,

443
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,986
I think he should be here.

444
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,074
I've read your file. I'm aware
of any context I might need.

445
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,163
So...

446
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,417
a rather unfortunate ending
in Mexico, wouldn't you say?

447
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,716
I think it's easy for you
to sit here in your chair

448
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,218
and make assessments about
the work that I've done.

449
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,889
But I can assure you that
I tried my hardest to...

450
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,267
fulfill the missions that
I was assigned to...

451
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,936
and bring justice to Agent Camarena.

452
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,980
I'm not sure that's true.

453
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,880
The operation you were
assigned was ill-conceived,

454
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,151
that's putting it mildly.

455
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,196
But, gentlemen, that operation ended.

456
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,989
Leyenda was over.

457
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,407
And we were told to keep going

458
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,368
and pursue leads that
were provided to us...

459
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,745
As I said, I have the
file in front of me.

460
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,415
A thoughtful summary on
Leyenda has been provided,

461
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,300
as well as a letter from this office

462
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,379
regarding its impact
on the War on Drugs.

463
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,131
I've passed that letter
along to the White House

464
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,092
at the DOJ's request.

465
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,219
And that is where your file ends.

466
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,847
I'm hoping there's no confusion on that.

467
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,936
So we're just gonna forget
that this ever happened?

468
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,105
And hope to God everyone
else does the same.

469
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,650
Are you gonna fucking weigh in
here and fucking say something?

470
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,530
You went too far, Walt.

471
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,533
Be happy it's ending here.

472
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,997
Some sage advice from
Special Agent Heath.

473
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,417
I'd take it to heart.

474
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,296
Your reassignment details
are provided here.

475
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,040
A representative from
the office in Sacramento

476
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,635
will be reaching out shortly.

477
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,055
There is no better outcome for you.

478
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,851
Quite frankly, in my opinion,
it's more than you deserve.

479
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,236
So, what about my men?

480
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,990
Do whatever you want to me.
I don't give a fuck.

481
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,616
But we made these men promises,

482
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,577
and we owe it to them to follow through.

483
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:01,333
A request for sentencing reevaluation
for Amat Palacios's brother.

484
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,545
A work visa for...

485
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,089
Ossie Mejía's uncle.

486
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,175
Cash.

487
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,930
Amat's brother robbed a
liquor store three years ago.

488
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,940
Ossie Mejía was deported ten years ago

489
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,060
under suspicion of grand larceny.

490
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,564
I believe that warrant
is still outstanding.

491
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,610
These men are criminals, Agent Breslin.

492
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,488
This country owes them nothing.

493
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,243
I wouldn't be sitting in your
fucking office right now

494
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,579
if it wasn't for these
men that saved my life.

495
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,680
I'd ask yourself why they
were ever in a position

496
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,875
where they needed to.

497
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,878
It's over.

498
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,797
You lost, Agent Breslin.

499
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,730
Guess you knew what you were doing.

500
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,775
Figuring it out.

501
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,529
Get it on the trucks.

502
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,980
The Colombians want it
delivered to a warehouse

503
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,826
in Sylmar, California.

504
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,788
Azul.

505
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:11,297
Seventeen and a half tons to each plaza.

506
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,136
Make sure the Colombians know how
the payments are to be made.

507
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,556
Equal shares?

508
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,766
We're partners, aren't we?

509
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,229
Told you I was still working their end.

510
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,066
We'll see if this'll make 'em happy.

511
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,820
They'll be over the moon.

512
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,875
Partners?

513
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,419
Yeah.

514
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,634
Thanks for your help.

515
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,054
I couldn't have done it without you.

516
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,353
This really what you want?
Everyone happy?

517
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,022
Well, yeah.

518
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,109
I wasn't sure I could do it.

519
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,528
Maybe the first time in my life.

520
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,531
So what happens next?
