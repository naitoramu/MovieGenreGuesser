1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,390
previously on prison break...

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,760
the price of the operation is the safe return of scylla.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,590
see if the buyer left him a message.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,660
yeah, it's a miami area code.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,930
the item.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,430
i'm sure you understand no one can know

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,690
where scylla's going.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,930
do you know who took it?

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,130
no, but self and gretchen do.

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,060
then you've got your team.

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,290
i'm not working for them.

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,890
there are holes in your resume

13
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,590
that gretchen or self or even bagwell can fill.

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,630
what happened?

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,060
he got away.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,290
what's this?

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,490
my resignation.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,860
whatever plan you're working on to get us out of here,

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,430
we better make a move on it.

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,000
you're not getting out of here, michael.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,190
i made a deal.

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,030
your life in exchange for scylla.

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,330
you think you can do that

24
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,860
knowing what you know about the company?

25
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,290
you want to know what i know about the company?

26
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,100
mom worked for them before she died.

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,360
now, i'm gonna do

28
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,960
everything and anything i can to end this.

29
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,060
hello?

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,490
sara, it's me.

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,890
where are you?

32
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,290
miami. the guy who took scylla's here.

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,130
so you're-you're actually trying to get it back for the company?

34
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,690
i'm gonna give it back to the company so we can

35
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,530
walk away from this.

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,530
how's michael?

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,760
i don't know.

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,860
i don't know. two guys from the company came,

39
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,460
and they brought me to a hotel,

40
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,530
and-and i was given... flowers

41
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,830
and a fruit basket,

42
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,790
and absolutely no information about michael.

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,160
is fernando with you?

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,730
sucre split.

45
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,160
we, uh, we left some messages

46
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,760
with mahone, telling him

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,830
where we are, but that

48
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,000
was two cell phones back.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,560
sorry, who's "we"? who are you with?

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,860
people i don't trust.

51
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,590
okay.

52
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,160
listen, um...

53
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
lincoln, i know why you did it, and-and...

54
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,390
i'm grateful to you, because he was gonna die.

55
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,590
but do you really think that

56
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,190
they're just gonna let us live when we give them scylla?

57
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,930
you know what, sara, i'm doing my best.

58
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,660
just-just call me

59
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,190
if you hear anything about michael, please.

60
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,560
gretchen: linc, the company's data tech

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,060
finally got a hit on our guy's cell phone.

62
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,530
it's a number, and it goes to this address--

63
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,890
the grafton; it's a club.

64
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,930
how many calls?

65
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,730
three. all outgoing.

66
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,690
how do we know this guy's

67
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,730
still in miami,

68
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,190
that he hasn't sold it already, huh?

69
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,690
not that i'm complaining.

70
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,060
i've had some filthy, filthy times in this state.

71
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,190
don't screw this up, all right?

72
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,100
because that's our only lead on this guy.

73
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,260
be thankful i haven't killed you.

74
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,130
oh, yeah? wh-what are you, eliot ness now? huh?

75
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,490
what, are you upset because i screwed you over, linc?

76
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,860
'cause don't act like

77
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,530
you haven't done that to ten times as many people.

78
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,760
all right? we're just crooks that got caught, lincoln.

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830
this...

80
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,130
this guy, this isn't gonna work.

81
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,460
why don't we all just focus on who's got scylla.

82
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,560
what do you say?

83
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,990
man : hey, scofield.

84
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,390
where am i?

85
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,630
he's awake.

86
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,360
i said, where am i?

87
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,630
it's a house, in the woods,

88
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,360
60 miles from anywhere.

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,960
swept clean of weapons, so you don't need

90
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,560
to worry your head about that.

91
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,190
there are no bars on the windows or the doors,

92
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,590
but there are three types of mountain lion in the area,

93
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,260
so you might want to stay close by.

94
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,990
i'll take it from here.

95
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,530
dr. roger knowlton, michael.

96
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,190
how are you feeling?

97
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,430
you some kind of neurologist?

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,060
psychiatrist.

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,530
given that you've got

100
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,830
some free time, the general asked if i'd sit with you.

101
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,790
a cigar's a cigar.

102
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,530
are we done?

103
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,890
you've been operating under some...

104
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,860
misconceptions about the company,

105
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,160
and the general wants

106
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,930
to, uh, open the books.

107
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,390
i'm here to... provide facts

108
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,560
and to help you process them.

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,730
if by facts, you mean what's on scylla

110
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,060
and that my mother once worked for the company,

111
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,730
i already know these things.

112
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,490
"worked"?

113
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,230
your mother...

114
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,530
works for us.

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,130
your mother is alive.

116

120
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,290
hey.

121
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,960
we don't open till 3:00. i'm just looking for someone.

122
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,030
haven't got the guy's name,

123
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,130
uh, but he called here yesterday

124
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,100
about three times-- new yorker, dark hair,

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,460
bits of gray.

126
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,760
you know where i can find him?

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,760
uh, yeah, i can't help you. sorry.

128
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
you sure?

129
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,530
my man, you need to check your ears,

130
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,530
all right, 'cause he just said we don't know who you're talking about.

131
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,530
is that right? yeah, that's right.

132
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,400
well, what about blondie?

133
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,790
you've got about two seconds...

134
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,000
how about it?

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,960
i don't know his name.

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,830
how about it!

137
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,390
he works...

138
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,660
this girl... works here, he dates her.

139
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,400
you're gonna take me to her.

140
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,960
well, this is all just..

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,830
fascinating, doctor.

142
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,690
knowlton: i don't know how better to say this.

143
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,000
she left you and your brother to protect you.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,890
from the dangers of solar synthesis work?

145
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,890
i know what's on scylla.

146
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,130
there were threats, you and lincoln might be kidnapped.

147
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,930
you were in imminent danger.

148
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,390
really.

149
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,190
where was she when my brother was strapped

150
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,760
to an electric chair?

151
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,190
she'd been working in a madagascar rain forest,

152
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,690
without satellite access.

153
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,530
or she wasn't alive, hasn't been for 25 years,

154
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,890
and this is all fiction.

155
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,760
there's a million acres, corn and soy, outside cordoba

156
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,790
that was arid scrub before your mother's research.

157
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,530
that's not fiction,

158
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,030
that's food...

159
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,730
for thousands.

160
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,860
millions.

161
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,100
there's so much more

162
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,290
on scylla than you know.

163
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,590
it sounds like we'd have a lot to talk about.

164
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,430
why don't you get her on the phone.

165
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,860
when you're ready.

166
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,890
no time like the present.

167
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,430
when you're ready...

168
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,830
to join her.

169
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,960
us.

170
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
that's... what this conversation

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,930
is about.

172
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,760
joining...

173
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,400
the company.

174
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,100
hey, erica, it's me.

175
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,930
so, are you coming?

176
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,860
i really need to talk to you.

177
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,660
she's on her way.

178
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,860
oh, my god!

179
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,530
why'd this guy call the club's phone and not erica's?

180
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,860
i... they fight a lot,

181
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,690
so when she doesn't answer, he calls the club.

182
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,490
what do you want with this guy?

183
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,630
he took something that belongs to me.

184
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,560
i want it back.

185
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,030
there.

186
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,560
there's erica.

187
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,060
wait here.

188
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,930
get him stitched up.

189
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,360
big guy.

190
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,460
shaved head. crazy.

191
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,560
- who the hell is he? - i don't know.

192
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,760
he bought the whole thing about you being friends

193
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,230
with this chick or whatever?

194
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,100
he didn't know i was with you,

195
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,630
and by the time he did, he was trying not to get shot.

196
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,360
you did good.

197
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,930
i just need a smoke so bad.

198
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,330
oh, no.

199
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,000
what?

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,930
my wallet.

201
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,430
this is the chick who set me up.

202
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,730
we find her, we find our guy.

203
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,600
gretchen: busting up clubs, firing shots in public.

204
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,730
you keep that up and we're not going to last here much longer.

205
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,860
i don't plan on staying here very long. you?

206
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,730
see, that's why i have to give it up to the general.

207
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,900
he puts four enemies together, guaranteed dissension.

208
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,930
no alliances form against him.

209
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,130
this is our guy's girlfriend's address.

210
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,130
he's probably gone,

211
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,230
but see what you can find.

212
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,460
this is tia.

213
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,960
do you want to know what i think they were talking about?

214
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,600
i don't care.

215
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,100
just as long as they keep out of my way.

216
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,300
same with you.

217
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,730
send her in.

218
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,830
sarah! you're looking...

219
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,730
rested.

220
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,290
how is the hotel?

221
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,260
i would like to offer my professional

222
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,290
assistance in michael's rehabilitation.

223
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,230
kind...

224
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,290
but he's receiving excellent care.

225
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,800
there's nothing for you to worry about.

226
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,630
whatever it is you have planned for him,

227
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,800
i would simply like to help maintain his health.

228
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,660
and that's appreciated, but it's impossible.

229
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,960
believe me, you serve michael best

230
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,260
at a distance right now.

231
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,030
trust me.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,030
i have no agenda apart from simply...

233
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,860
wanting to see that he's okay.

234
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,330
and in three days to a week,

235
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,130
he'll be back in your loving arms forever.

236
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,930
okay, i'm not that patient.

237
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,100
indulge yourself.

238
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,460
sit by the pool,

239
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,390
envision the future:

240
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,760
financial security,

241
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,500
michael's talents being utilized on a global scale,

242
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,830
you beside him innovating.

243
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,360
michael's talents being utilized on a global scale?

244
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,460
i'm simply trying to maximize his potential.

245
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,160
yours, too.

246
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,900
what's being done to him?

247
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,860
i'm putting an end to this exhausting cat-and-mouse.

248
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,500
thank you for stopping by.

249
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,530
"radical architecture is a rejection of all formal

250
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,960
and moral parameters."

251
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,530
from your thesis.

252
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,000
someone else's words heavily paraphrased.

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,430
and it pertains to buildings, structures.

254
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,160
i think you meant it as a metaphor.

255
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,860
what, that the ends justify the means?

256
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,100
which neatly

257
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,460
coincides with your mother's philosophy.

258
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,760
did you know that she had an almost identical quote

259
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,660
in her thesis?

260
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,700
from 30 years ago.

261
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,960
you've done a lot of homework.

262
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,130
just a few conversations.

263
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,430
let me guess. you two had some kind of moment

264
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,200
at the company Christmas party?

265
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,700
I’ve known your mother for years.

266
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,100
well enough to know you've got the same brilliant mind

267
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,760
and the same sense of humor, for that matter.

268
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,130
I’m guessing this isn't about my sense of humor.

269
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,360
she was just

270
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,530
as resistant to joining the company,

271
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,330
but then she learned the truth.

272
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,360
if the truth is that the company is all about saving the world,

273
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,730
I don't buy it.

274
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,960
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company,

275
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,800
what do you want with me?

276
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,060
a fully functioning scylla project would exist

277
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
on a global scale.

278
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
it can't be managed

279
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
by one person.

280
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,230
but two...

281
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,430
equally formidable, working in lockstep?

282
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,630
absolutely.

283
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,530
that's very good.

284
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,360
you've clearly thought of everything.

285
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,060
michael...

286
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,660
if i weren't telling you the truth,

287
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,690
how would i have gotten this?

288
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,660
this is just a stupid girl who dates a criminal.

289
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,730
this is  a waste of time.

290
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,000
a signature of burrows' leadership.

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,260
all right, we need to make a shift.

292
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,660
bagwell, i'm telling you right now,

293
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,700
if i make my play and you go soft,

294
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,330
i will sail you off that loft balcony

295
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,760
and no one will bat an eye.

296
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,500
my aim is true, don.

297
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
keep it in your pants.

298
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,330
i'll keep it in my pants, all right?

299
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,830
all right, all in favor of changing the regime, say "aye."

300
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,260
aye, aye, captain.

301
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,300
aye. all right, burrows is out.

302
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,360
good, great. send it.

303
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,460
the company's e-mailing tia's credit card history.

304
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,860
you know, i'm thinking more and more that this is an inside job.

305
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,530
-why?  -a couple reasons.

306
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,230
the hardware he brought to the meet.

307
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,860
he could read scylla right on the spot.

308
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,930
since he's disappeared,

309
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,130
i should be able to find this man, and i can't.

310
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,030
people you can't find are usually company.

311
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,560
how does that change anything?

312
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
it doesn't.

313
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,130
it just makes everything harder.

314
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,500
lincoln...

315
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,560
when are we going to get this out of the way?

316
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,060
what?

317
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,130
of all the mercenary humps i've thrown at guys

318
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,800
in my lifetime, i think i'm due for one i want.

319
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,530
don't flatter yourself.

320
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,100
too late.

321
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,630
name it.

322
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,100
and i do mean anything.

323
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,460
a big ol' fat load of nothin'!

324
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,160
a big ol' goose egg.

325
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,100
nothing. old address books, photographs,

326
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,430
hard drive from her computer.

327
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,930
i checked her e-mails and her web sites.

328
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,330
there's nothing from our guy.

329
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,360
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here?

330
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,100
because this is starting to feel like a wasted trip.

331
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,500
how long is it gonna take the company

332
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,900
to pull everything off this thing?

333
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,160
a couple hours.

334
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,530
all right, linc, this is the deal.

335
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,030
look, we appreciate your effort,

336
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,360
but bagwell and i took a vote,

337
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,430
and this being florida and all, you came up a little bit short.

338
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,600
meaning?

339
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,930
you're not in charge.

340
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,700
who is?

341
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,290
him. yeah.

342
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,630
the bull-in-the-china- shop routine

343
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,130
might have worked when you were stealing gumballs,

344
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,900
but our asses are on the line now, okay?

345
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,330
and we all have deals with the general.

346
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,360
so that's the way it's gonna be.

347
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,830
and if you notice, even gretchen hasn't leapt to your defense.

348
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,130
linc, just let him wear his crown.

349
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,230
i would if i thought he wasn't gonna sell this thing.

350
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,330
oh, what, am i the only one who's thought about that?

351
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,430
look, here's the deal, linc.

352
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,860
at some point, you'll have a vote.

353
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,290
but until then, you're done, all right?

354
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,360
we're shuttin' you down, okay?

355
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,730
you're no longer in charge.

356
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,160
uh-oh, looks like there's been a recount.

357
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,430
bad time?

358
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,160
no, perfect.

359
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,100
the second you stop doing what i tell you to do,

360
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,330
i'm gonna blow your brains out.

361
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,870
bring her back.

362
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,830
it's not gonna be the same.

363
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,630
stir any memories?

364
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,800
i was ten. we were on a camping trip in jackson hole.

365
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,270
fishing, hiking.

366
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,830
family huddled under a blanket in front of the bonfire.

367
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,030
you can stop now.

368
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,300
why? because two years later it was gone?

369
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,630
you know, three of the four

370
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,370
people in this photograph are still alive.

371
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,960
so what are you suggesting,

372
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,730
grab my fishing pole?

373
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,900
time for a...a family reunion in wyoming?

374
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,030
or wherever you like.

375
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,870
don't tell me it's something you haven't wished for.

376
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,170
i wished for a lot of unrealistic things.

377
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,430
i got over them, too.

378
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,870
why,

379
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,970
when we can make this happen?

380
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,470
these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time.

381
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,770
before you were incarcerated,

382
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,830
you'd go to visit her grave on the anniversary

383
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,130
all right, enough.

384
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,870
you'd bring a bouquet of blue irises.

385
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,900
you'd sit for an hour.

386
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,130
i said stop it.

387
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,230
when you'd leave, you'd take a flower

388
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,700
and pin it to your lapel.

389
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,130
she watched you do this every year.

390
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,400
she's seen the pain you carry.

391
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,430
she wants to make amends.

392
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,800
all right!

393
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,030
so you did a little digging. good for you.

394
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,000
but everything out of your mouth is a lie,

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and i don't believe a word of it.

396
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,230
so let's just stop.

397
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,970
let's just stop.

398
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,100
that's tia's address

399
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,170
right there. pull it up.

400
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,130
all right, she lives here, works here, but yesterday

401
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,870
she used her credit card to buy a drink

402
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,100
at the pelican club a little after noon,

403
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,930
and then she picked up something at the gift shop

404
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,230
a little after 1:00.

405
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,130
waiting for her boyfriend to debark.

406
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,360
disembark.

407
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,630
he's already in town. yeah.

408
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,100
then he lives in the marina.

409
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,630
or this is another reason to think it's an inside job.

410
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,470
if he's working with someone from the company,

411
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,900
they wouldn't want their names on any flight manifests.

412
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,330
all right, they're trying to get scylla

413
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,730
out of the country by boat undetected.

414
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,730
let's go.

415
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,330
alex, yeah?

416
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,430
thanks for coming when you did, man.

417
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,430
you helped me like you said you would. i owe you.

418
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,700
okay, i'll do the talking.

419
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,100
you guys wait here.

420
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,970
alex, let's go.

421
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,870
afternoon.

422
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,170
how's it going?

423
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,900
what can i do you for?

424
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,830
recognize her?

425
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,700
her name's tia hayden.

426
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,000
can't say i do. wish i did.

427
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,470
nice little tomato there.

428
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,370
she was in here yesterday with a man.

429
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,800
can't help.

430
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,370
sorry.

431
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,730
don self, homeland security.

432
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,670
and this is my partner bruce liberace.

433
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,470
no relation.

434
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,330
our department is working with the office

435
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,030
of foreign assets control. have you heard of them?

436
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,400
yep.

437
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,830
bet you have. we're looking into smuggling

438
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,670
and contraband transportation of cuban cigars.

439
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,960
none here, swear to god.

440
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,830
all right, well, that's for us to decide.

441
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,330
it's going to take about a week,

442
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,430
and it's going to involve shutting down this entire marina...

443
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,330
oh, yeah.

444
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,400
...for about a week.

445
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,700
or... she was here

446
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,060
with that guy you were talking about.

447
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,770
he wanted to know which berth a private charter was docking in.

448
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,000
he asked me to move it further down the dock, which i did.

449
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,870
further away from the coast guard slip?

450
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,500
i didn't ask. and i didn't accept any money.

451
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,100
if he said he paid me, he's lying.

452
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,730
what's the point of departure?

453
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,530
nassau, bahamas. round trip.

454
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,870
when does it arrive?

455
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,800
arrived.

456
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,370
hey, everybody! okay, my name is don self!

457
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,400
homeland security.

458
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,230
my colleagues and i are hoping that you guys have a wonderful

459
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,630
and safe trip. unfortunately,

460
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,060
we're going to have to do a quick luggage check search.

461
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,900
shouldn't take more than a minute, folks.

462
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,230
your cooperation is all

463
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,970
that's required. open your bags.

464
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,430
get on your knees!

465
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,830
okay, okay, okay.

466
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,470
where is it? where's scylla?

467
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,470
what have you got in here?

468
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,670
three joints.

469
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,330
i'm on probation.

470
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,700
is this going to send me back?

471
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,030
make yourself a helmet, pal.

472
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,230
just like old times.

473
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,200
bring her back.

474
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,170
you know i can't do that.

475
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,930
but, look, there's some stuff

476
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,600
that i can do.

477
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,770
it's not going to be the same,

478
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,130
but we're going to figure it out.

479
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,700
and, no matter what,

480
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,770
it's still going to be me and you.

481
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,470
i am thrilled that you're enjoying your trip to the mountains,

482
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,960
but it's not an open-ended vacation.

483
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,570
scofield's exhausted. despondent.

484
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,300
he's very resistant, but a classic abandoned child.

485
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
he'll come around.

486
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,800
time frame, doctor?

487
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,000
unaided, three days.

488
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,500
with the pentothal?

489
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,230
sooner, but it's nearly a chemical lobotomy.

490
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,960
but, if he turns on his own, it'll be his decision,

491
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,370
his reasoning.

492
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,430
we'll own him forever.

493
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,500
scofield's squirrelly.

494
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,000
i won't trust him till he walks hot coals.

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,600
i think i can get him there.

496
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,200
good. but, if

497
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,060
i find out he's been playing you, doctor,

498
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,470
you'll get the same lobotomy as scofield.

499
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,260
just get it done.

500
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Let's go.

501
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
In the van.

502
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,260
Go.

503
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
if you fight when those cuffs are off,

504
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,770
the guards will stomp the life out of you.

505
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,930
yeah.

506
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,500
forgive the dramatics.

507
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,600
the company can't know i'm talking to you.

508
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,970
you are the company. you're his daughter.

509
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,440
do you want to find michael scofield?

510
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,030
of course i do.

511
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,170
it's 60 miles northeast

512
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,340
of downtown. i'd move quickly.

513
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,670
what are they doing to him?

514
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,700
having lemonade.

515
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,670
they're carving out his personality.

516
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,700
that's how they recruit.

517
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,200
or you're setting me up.

518
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,600
clandestine warfare isn't pretty,

519
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,970
but the rules of engagement

520
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,730
don't include killing and torturing the innocent.

521
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,400
at least not for me.

522
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,900
michael is the object of a quick and nasty

523
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,140
process, and you're wasting time.

524
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,440
out.

525
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
out.

526
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,730
we need the footage from that security camera.

527
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,300
not to offend either of you, but i took

528
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,840
the liberty of calling my attorney

529
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,700
to find out exactly what the scope of your authority is here,

530
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,140
- and he tells me... - just get the tape, all right?

531
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,140
Sure

532
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,040
either we missed scylla...

533
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
no, no, no. we did not

534
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,270
miss scylla.

535
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,300
we searched every bag.

536
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,770
then maybe the buyer was already on the boat,

537
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,700
and was disembarking, right?

538
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,940
i mean, if they don't want their names on any flight manifest,

539
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,670
maybe they just eased back on in.

540
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,870
that wouldn't be the worst news.

541
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,200
that means they're in miami.

542
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,450
Right.

543
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,190
So get yourself back down with your disgraced badge to steamboat willie,

544
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,200
And have him cough up every name of every person on that boat coming off.

545
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,280
Okay, that's good,

546
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,480
Because they probably would have traveled in on a

547
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,100
Low-grade charter from the bahamas, and used their real names, right?

548
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
That would be a good plan.

549
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,070
How is he?

550
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,840
He's alive.

551
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,440
So we get scylla.

552
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,400
Then we're free, all of us-- pam, lj...

553
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,040
All of a sudden, the company grew a heart?

554
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,300
They're just tired of us.

555
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,370
They want scylla back. that's it.

556
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,070
Then we never really had anything they wanted.

557
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,700
Exactly. now we got leverage.

558
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,170
We don't have it yet.

559
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,270
Anything?

560
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,600
No.

561
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,140
Nothing yet.

562
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,700
Nothing.

563
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,040
No, lincoln, you don't understand.

564
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,700
The way she said "recruit" made my stomach turn.

565
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,730
They're going to torture him.

566
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,700
He can take care of himself, at least for one day, until we get scylla.

567
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,170
Lincoln, he needs to be in the icu.

568
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,340
What's your plan?

569
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,100
Break him out?

570
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,770
I don't know. I don't have one.

571
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,040
Well, you're putting him and us at risk.

572
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,270
Just stay in the hotel until we get back to l.a.

573
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,700
All right?

574
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,100
Tancredi got the location of her shining knight.

575
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,730
She may be heading there now.

576
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,470
Exemplary, bagwell.

577
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,710
Thank you, sir.

578
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,170
A deal's a deal, right? not to be a broken record, but all I ask...

579
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,730
But I think we're making some real progress, general.

580
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,390
The scofield/burrows family would have been a formidable asset to the

581
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:09,240
Company, but since his lapdog insists on complicating matters, we move on.

582
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,100
General, we can handle a lone female.

583
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,540
If, indeed, that's what we're dealing with.

584
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,400
But it's my experience, that with the one comes many.

585
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,940
Do it now, doctor.

586
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,900
I need an hour. he just ate. I don't want him to aspirate.

587
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,370
Now, doctor.

588
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,070
I want scofield pliable for transit.

589
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,370
Your vehicle arrives in 20 minutes.

590
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,370
And if we can't revive him?

591
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,140
C'est la vie!

592
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,100
Michael, come out. we need to talk.

593
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,760
Think of something.

594
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,160
That's it!

595
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,660
That's our guy!

596
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,830
There's tia right beside him.

597
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,390
We've got to pull that image, get it to the company,

598
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,230
And have them match it.

599
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,530
Where's gretchen?

600
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,030
How'd you find me?

601
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,450
Once I found your mug shot,

602
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,200
It really wasn't that hard getting your legit cell number.

603
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,200
well, now i'm here.

604
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,630
what do you want?

605
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,760
you never bothered to ask back in los angeles--

606
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,960
you were too busy planning on killing me--

607
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,760
but i actually worked for the company.

608
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,630
i know who you are.

609
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,300
and i'll ask it again.

610
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,430
what do you want?

611
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,000
to solve your problems, scott.

612
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,100
i mean, it is what gets me up out of bed in the morning.

613
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,230
you have a big problem, and so does

614
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,000
whoever it is you're working for.

615
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,260
and you obviously know that

616
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,000
or you wouldn't have graced me with your presence.

617
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and you can make that problem disappear?

618
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,630
quickly and completely.

619
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,590
with an extra added bonus.

620
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,660
crucial, i might add.

621
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,560
i then feed the company a story

622
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,800
that has them looking elsewhere.

623
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,560
meaning you're invaluable

624
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,400
and please don't kill you. yeah.

625
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,930
without the "please."

626
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,230
how much?

627
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,630
a lot.

628
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,730
and it's about to double here in a second

629
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,460
if you don't look at me when i'm talking to you.

630
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,230
you go run and talk it over with your boss.

631
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,530
call me with a number.

632
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,160
i'm authorized to negotiate on their behalf.

633
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,260
if you serve up

634
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,530
whoever's looking for us and get the company off our scent--

635
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,400
$10 million.

636
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,830
best and final offer.

637
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,590
ask for a penny more and i'll shoot you

638
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,790
in the chest and take my chances.

639
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,400
take it easy, michael.

640
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,860
this...

641
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,630
is for your own good.

642
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,100
what was that?

643
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,300
sounded like the water heater.

644
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,730
came from the bathroom.

645
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,160
pick it up!

646
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,830
now give the doctor his medicine.

647
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,030
no.

648
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,030
bedpost.

649
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,960
ferguson: in here, in the bedroom.

650
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,130
come on!

651
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,930
thank you. perfect. let me know if you hear anything else.

652
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,500
where the hell you been?

653
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,860
figuring this whole thing out.

654
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,100
i know who it is.

655
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,500
the buyer.

656
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,060
his name is lawrence wilcott and he's been working

657
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,300
for the company for ten years.

658
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,560
how did you figure that out?

659
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,960
i still have friends on the inside,

660
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,330
and on the outside of the company.

661
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,530
i've been putting together a profile,

662
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,530
narrowing down the candidates.

663
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,830
wilcott got on a plane

664
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,860
in bogot?and flew to the bahamas yesterday

665
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,660
and then got on a boat.

666
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,100
the guy who took scylla off us in l.a.?

667
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,430
we pulled his image off the security tape.

668
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,800
company's running a recognition match right now.

669

we gotta pull the pin here, guys.

713
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,500
just because she switched sides at the last second

714
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,530
doesn't mean she wasn't going to kill us two minutes ago, okay?
