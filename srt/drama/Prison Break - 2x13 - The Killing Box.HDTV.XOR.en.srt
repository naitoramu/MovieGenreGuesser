1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:02,985
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:06,321
- We're staying.
- Give 'em hell.

3
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,210
Phil, don't do this.

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,451
I've dedicated my life to this country,
to president Reynolds.

5
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,218
Every photo, every file--
get rid of it all.

6
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,454
Phil, don't do this.

7
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:26,133
- You left a message for Mr. Geary.
- I'm going to gut you, bow to stern.

8
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:28,982
- I did not kill Roy Geary.
- Bagwell set me up.

9
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,000
You are under arrest for the first
degree murder of Roy William Geary.

10
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:34,660
My therapist said that
I need to confront you

11
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:37,000
to let you know how
betrayed I feel.

12
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:40,408
This is the Tribune Police.

13
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:43,534
Look, as long as you do your
job with me, not a chance.

14
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:46,031
And then you can go backo
Colorado and visit your son.

15
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:46,760
Cameron.

16
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:50,751
Don't you ever mention
his name again.

17
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:52,541
What about your
friend back there?

18
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,290
If we're going to go down...

19
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:57,101
might as well go down swinging.

20
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:04,800
- Sara.
- Michael?

21
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:14,702
Almost made it.

22
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:15,633
Hello.

23
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:17,733
Hello. Michael?

24
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,283
Is that you?

25
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:21,211
Get up.

26
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:25,891
Turn around.

27
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:28,210
Turn around!

28
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,140
If you're going to
murder us, Alex,

29
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:32,342
you're going to have to look us
in the eyes while you do it.

30
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,121
Shut up.

31
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:35,753
You want me, you got me.
Let my brother go!

32
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,892
I don't want either of you.
I just want my life back!

33
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:41,732
You're going to kill two
innocent men to get it, huh?

34
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:42,681
Absolutely.

35
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:45,072
This is the United
States Border Patrol.

36
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:48,453
Drop the weapon and
remain where you are.

37
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:53,972
United States Border Patrol.
Drop your weapon.

38
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:59,782
I'm FBI.
These men are in my custody.

39
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:02,403
I don't care who you are.
Until we verify,

40
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:07,252
you will drop your weapon or
we will drop you. Your choice.

41
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:28,273
Hands on your head now.
DOn't move.

42
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:38,273
- You got anything to drink?
- Check the back.

43
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:41,830
Unknown rider, unknown rider,
this is DEA on guard.

44
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,550
Bring up frequency 1145.

45
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:48,713
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

46
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:50,401
What do you mean, "Uh-oh"?

47
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,223
Border Patrol's
on our ass, man.

48
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,641
How long till we get to Mexico?

49
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,471
We're already in Mexico, Papa.

50
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,922
I thought they couldn't follow
us once we crossed the border.

51
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:01,203
Hey, not since 9/11, hombre.

52
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,172
I repeat: this is DEA on guard.

53
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,230
What are we going to do?

54
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,522
Pull the chord. And pray.

55
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:09,530
Oh, hell, no.

56
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:12,822
Look, we try and land the plane,
we're pinched for sure.

57
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,170
And if we jump?

58
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,653
We're in the middle
of the desert.

59
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:20,110
Patrol have a hard time trying
to find us once we land.

60
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,983
- If we land.
- Oh, you're going to land.

61
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,130
It's just a matter of how hard.

62
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:27,501
Good luck, amigo.

63
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:41,733
Unknown rider...

64
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,751
Identify yourself.

65
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:48,050
We're receiving reports that
escaped convicts Lincoln Burrows

66
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,490
and Michael Scofield
have been apprehended

67
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:53,122
just a few miles north of
the US-Mexican border.

68
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:55,700
Federal Agent Alex
Mahone with assistance

69
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:57,630
from the United
States Border Patrol

70
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:00,060
took the men into custody
just a short time ago.

71
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,692
Now, not a lot of information
available at this time,

72
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:05,271
but we do know the brothers were
apprehended without incident

73
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:08,361
while attempting to leave the country
through the deserts of New Mexico,

74
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:11,492
quite a long way from Illinois's
Fox River State Penitentiary,

75
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,880
where they escaped from
less than ten days ago.

76
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,131
The Fox River Eight, as the group
of convicts were once known,

77
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:20,970
are now down to four,
as only Benjamin Miles Franklin,

78
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:25,631
Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik and
Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

79
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:31,221
Sir. He just heard.
And he'd like to see you.

80
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:40,213
Convicts are now down to four,
as only Benjamin Miles Franklin,

81
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:45,240
Fernando Sucre, Charles Patoshik and
Theodore Bagwell remain at large.

82
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:46,883
Godspeed, gentlemen.

83
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:10,821
'Scuse me, Sarge.

84
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:14,510
I, uh, was wondering if you could,
uh, help a brother out.

85
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:15,492
With what?

86
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:20,563
I only recently returned from
delivering democracy to the desert

87
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:24,833
and, uh,
I was wondering if you could tell me how

88
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:28,410
a guy goes about getting a hold of
one of those prosthetic jobbies.

89
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,260
What, they make you whole
before they shipped you back?

90
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,883
Well, let's just say
the doctor made the bed.

91
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,310
He just neglected to
tuck in the sheets.

92
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:39,320
Best thing for you to do
is go on down there to VA.

93
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,333
Get in line.

94
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:44,400
- That simple?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:48,071
Till they send you the bill and
you got to figure out how to pay.

96
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:51,033
Those bastards up there in Washington
send us off to fight for them;

97
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,933
not a damn one of
'em fights for us.

98
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:54,570
And that is a crime.

99
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:57,513
But luckily for me, uh...

100
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,352
- money is not the issue.
- Is that right?

101
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:05,773
Any particular, uh,
forms I might need in order to qualify?

102
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:09,222
You know what, Mr.
Don't Ask, Don't Tell?

103
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:12,463
You figured out how to
dye that hair of yours up

104
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:15,882
like a nancy all by yourself,
you sure as hell can figure out

105
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:20,770
how to get a prosthetic for that
stump of yours by yourself.

106
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:27,913
Yeah, I think I got a pretty
good idea where to start.

107
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:46,691
I'm here with Ed Pavelka, the new
warden of Fox River Penitentiary,

108
00:06:46,878 --> 00:06:48,851
where Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield

109
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,511
are scheduled to be returned
to sometime tomorrow.

110
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,010
Now, Warden,
the escape happened a mere two days

111
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,161
before Burrows was scheduled
to be put to death.

112
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:59,621
He's already been granted one day;
do you anticipate any further?

113
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,972
Lincoln Burrows is a
convicted murderer.

114
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:06,243
His escape has endangered the lives
of civilians across this country.

115
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:09,560
He is not a celebrity.
He is not a martyr.

116
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:13,913
I can assure you that whatever
leniency was afforded him

117
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,810
and the other prisoners under
the old regime at Fox River

118
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,530
will no longer be tolerated.

119
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:21,062
The only thing that Mr.
Burrows can expect

120
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:25,110
is what a jury of his peers demanded:
a speedy execution.

121
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:26,460
And Michael Scofield?

122
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:30,172
With his escape,
the aiding and abetting charges,

123
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,422
the felonies he's racked
up along the way,

124
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:36,130
on top of his original sentence,
I'd say Mr. Scofield

125
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:39,843
will be spending the rest of
his life behind bars. Thank you.

126
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,630
Who's got Mahone?

127
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,120
- Congratulations, sir.
- What do you got?

128
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,422
A call from the Illinois DOC.

129
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,530
They're sending a huge
contingent down there

130
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,160
to collect Burrows
and Scofield,

131
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,300
take them back to
Fox River personally.

132
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,890
Remind them this
is a federal case

133
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:34,393
and we'll handle the
transport. Now...

134
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,112
I did.
But it's an election year,

135
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,303
collar this big,
everybody wants a piece.

136
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,450
The warden called in a
favor to the Bureau Chief;

137
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,173
he okayed it, so here we are.
Should be there in about an hour.

138
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,463
I want to be placed in the
prisoner transport vehicle.

139
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:47,943
- What for?
- Just get it done.

140
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:52,403
Sir, these were the big fish.
And you brought 'em in.

141
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,461
You should feel
good about that.

142
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,712
Yeah... Yeah.

143
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:04,460
- Well, at least we're together.
- Yes, there is that.

144
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:12,050
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking about the old man.

145
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:16,128
What he tried to do, you know.

146
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:21,524
Tough to go down swinging
when you're locked in a box.

147
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:25,262
This isn't over yet.
We're entitled to a phone call.

148
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,331
We make that one call to Sara

149
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,493
and she has the information
Dad said she has,

150
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,402
we can get you exonerated before
this whole thing goes down.

151
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:32,993
Michael.

152
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:34,340
Hey.

153
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,882
We're entitled to a phone call.

154
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:40,603
You're entitled to
precisely squat

155
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:42,532
until you're
officially in custody.

156
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,210
And that won't happen until
you're back in Fox River.

157
00:09:45,337 --> 00:09:46,921
So sit tight.

158
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:54,921
- It's not over yet.
- Not yet.

159
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:59,742
A lot of ground to cover
between here and Illinois.

160
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:00,802
I mean,

161
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:04,131
what are the chances we even
make it back to Fox River alive?

162
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,073
Saw you on the news, Alex.

163
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:13,130
- Did you?
- The brothers too.

164
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:15,852
They were a little more, um...

165
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:18,382
breathing than I had hoped.

166
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,981
Yeah, well, Border Patrol showed up.
Nothing I could do.

167
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,032
Really?

168
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:26,351
Burrows and Scofield,
can you see them from where you are?

169
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:29,973
- Yeah.
- Then put a bullet in their heads.

170
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,312
They're being watched.

171
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,123
- I don't care.
- By armed guards.

172
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:38,693
They make it back to Fox River,
it is over. For all of us.

173
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:42,040
There's not much more this country
loves than a bad man with a good story.

174
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,993
How much longer do
you think it'll be

175
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,442
before someone puts a
microphone in front of them?

176
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:49,270
- Hey, are you listening?
- Okay, with the security here,

177
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:51,970
what you're asking me to do
is tantamount to suicide.

178
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,932
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I wasn't asking anything.

179
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,481
That would imply you
had a say in the matter.

180
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:02,393
Pull this off and you're
halfway home, Alex.

181
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:06,330
You remember what home is like.
Don't you?

182
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:10,040
900 West End Avenue.
White fence. Red door.

183
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:12,153
Stay away from my family!

184
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,481
You got a little
something on your, uh...

185
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,080
No, uh... here, let me.

186
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:22,092
- Pardon my forwardness, I was...
- It's okay. Thank you.

187
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:24,492
Normally I wouldn't intervene,
it's just...

188
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:27,441
yesterday when I
got home from work,

189
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:30,962
I found what looked like
the Brazilian Rain Forest

190
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:33,450
lodged between my
two front teeth.

191
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,983
And all I could think about was

192
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:38,150
the number of people who
must've seen and not...

193
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,720
not a damn one of them had
the decency to tell me.

194
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:46,243
- Mild diastema.
- Excuse me?

195
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:50,441
It's a slight gap between
your eight and nine.

196
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,571
Your two front teeth.

197
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:57,091
And that it sometimes can act
as a magnet for food like...

198
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:01,462
broccoli and tuna
and sometimes rice.

199
00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:02,812
Or relish.

200
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:07,323
All this and brains, too?
What are you, a dentist or...?

201
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:10,990
Me? No, hardly, no.
I could never.

202
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:14,512
- My ex-husband, he was...
- A bastard?

203
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,851
That too.

204
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:28,762
Have you ever been
to Italy, uh...?

205
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:32,612
- Denise.
- Denise, that's a lovely name.

206
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:33,443
Um...

207
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:41,081
You know, in Italy,
they have wine every day with lunch.

208
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,431
And what do we do
in this country?

209
00:13:43,696 --> 00:13:46,370
We power our food down with
caffeine, carbonation,

210
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,572
and high fructose corn syrup.

211
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:53,233
No one ever takes the time
to enjoy things anymore.

212
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:59,322
Denise, would you
do me the honor

213
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:05,200
of "enjoying" the rest
of your lunch with me?

214
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:09,520
I think I'd like that.

215
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:13,401
White or red?

216
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:20,263
...and with limited financial
resources he poses no flight risk...

217
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,301
Unless he'd rather not stand
trial for capital murder.

218
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:26,340
The defendant has shown
great resourcefulness

219
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:29,872
in being able to travel across
country with little money.

220
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,821
There's no reason he
couldn't do it again.

221
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:37,382
If you don't want to believe me,
believe Mr. Bellick.

222
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,183
You thieving son of a bitch.

223
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:43,250
You better get down on
your knees and pray to God

224
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:45,931
that I never find you because if I do,
mark my words:

225
00:14:46,055 --> 00:14:48,252
I will gut you bow to stern.

226
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,212
He promised to kill Mr. Geary,

227
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,583
and then he kept that promise.

228
00:14:56,817 --> 00:15:02,081
A man like the defendant
should not be out in society.

229
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,711
- I concur.
- Bail denied.

230
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,810
Who would that be?

231
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,203
Only one person.

232
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,922
Michael, it's me. Listen,
this phone rang last night and, uh...

233
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:23,143
I went to answer it,
but I couldn't hear anything

234
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:25,613
and I wonder if maybe
it was you? Um...

235
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:28,411
Oh, God,
I don't know what I should do right now.

236
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,233
I don't know if I
should leave a message

237
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:32,913
or who might be listening to this,
but... um, I, uh...

238
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:37,082
I need to know that you're okay.
I need you to know that I'm not.

239
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:40,102
I didn't leave you in Gila.
Something happened to me and I don't...

240
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:42,240
um, I don't know what
to do right now.

241
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:43,921
I'm not too sure where to go,

242
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,213
but I know that you're the
only person I can trust

243
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:48,031
and I need you to, um...

244
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:53,483
I need you to be
okay and, um...

245
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:58,393
And I need you. Please.

246
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:36,621
Alexander Mahone, Bureau.

247
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,611
These are my prisoners
and I will be

248
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:42,470
personally escorting them
in their transfer vehicle.

249
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:45,721
- You can follow in the chase car...
- I don't believe you heard me.

250
00:17:45,756 --> 00:17:48,193
I'll be accompanying
them in their...

251
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,953
The only people allowed in the
van are the driver and two guards

252
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:55,803
who've been trained and
certified in prison transport.

253
00:17:57,557 --> 00:18:01,182
Are you really going to
make me go over your head?

254
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:04,363
I'll even dial
the phone for you.

255
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:07,090
Now look, this is standard procedure,
Agent Mahone.

256
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,000
We need to keep that environment
as controllable as possible.

257
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,461
The more bodies,
the less control.

258
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:17,710
These men may have knowledge of
the location of the other escapees.

259
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,552
This is knowledge that I...

260
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:24,170
- I need to do my job.
- And my job is to ensure

261
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:27,130
the safe and successful transfer
of these two prisoners.

262
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:29,833
Chase vehicles
are right outside.

263
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:47,571
There better be a damn good reason
why those brothers are still alive.

264
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:48,770
Bad day, Bill?

265
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:53,182
Sorry, I thought this was
someone who still existed.

266
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,290
How's the jerky business, Owen?

267
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:57,362
Actually, it's looking
pretty good right about now.

268
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,420
You call this number again,
you're a dead man.

269
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,283
Actually, you don't kill Burrows
and Scofield today, so are you.

270
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,611
You know it and I know it,

271
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:06,162
and luckily for you,
I know how to save your ass.

272
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:14,490
The brothers are already being
transferred. You're too late.

273
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:18,821
Actually, that transport van is
exactly where you want them to be.

274
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:20,543
Why?

275
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:24,432
Why? You want my help,
Bill, I want my job back.

276
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:26,360
That means direct access
to the president.

277
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,841
I report only to her.

278
00:19:28,037 --> 00:19:30,381
You're reaching,
Paul. Good-bye.

279
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:32,011
Don't shut me out, Bill.

280
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,752
You think Burrows and Scofield are
a threat to this Administration?

281
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:37,822
I know everything Caroline
Reynolds has done.

282
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:39,412
Everything.

283
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,660
Now, before you panic,
all I'm asking

284
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:44,993
is to be allowed to finish
the job that I started.

285
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:47,190
To prove to the
president and to you

286
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,933
that I'm still an asset
to this administration.

287
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,871
What's your plan?

288
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:58,880
I have an old associate
in the Illinois DOC.

289
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,410
They're heading
up the transfer.

290
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,520
It's going to take more
than one guy on the inside.

291
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:05,042
Not if the guy's in
the right place.

292
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,422
Bill, you give me
the go-ahead on this,

293
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,351
when those brothers
get in the van,

294
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:11,540
it'll be the last
thing they ever do.

295
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:38,302
I have never done that before.

296
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:44,311
Then I guess we were making
up for some lost time.

297
00:20:47,966 --> 00:20:50,221
I have to ask, Sam,
are you, uh...

298
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:51,903
are you married or something?

299
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,720
Me? No.
What makes you think...?

300
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,440
Come on.
I may be plain, but I'm not a fool.

301
00:20:57,576 --> 00:21:01,061
Usually the men I end up with
are just looking for something...

302
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:03,312
on the side.

303
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:10,721
Denise, the only "side" I'm
interested in, is the inside.

304
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:13,252
And that place within you...

305
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:15,832
is not plain.

306
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,053
- I have to get back to work.
- Do you really?

307
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,832
I have to close tonight.

308
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,431
How 'bout I pick you up after?

309
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,091
We can have dinner.

310
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,812
- Are you sure?
- Denise...

311
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:32,870
I insist.

312
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:50,500
- Yeah.
- Good news.

313
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,131
You're off the hook.

314
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,052
Paul Kellerman has a team
ready to move on the caravan

315
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:56,581
just outside of Albuquerque.

316
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,770
Okay. So where does
that leave us?

317
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:02,051
When it goes down, there's sure
to be a moment or two of chaos.

318
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:04,852
A certain amount of confusion,
lots of bullets flying.

319
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:10,921
I need you there to make sure
Paul Kellerman catches one.

320
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:15,501
It's a little early to be
covering your tracks, isn't it?

321
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:20,933
The escapees--
that was our deal. That's all.

322
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:24,222
Right. Our deal.

323
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:28,012
Refresh my memory.
Was our deal supposed to end

324
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:31,063
with Burrows and Scofield
going back to prison or...

325
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:33,453
bleeding from a hole
in their heads?

326
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:37,441
We're giving you a chance
to make this right, Alex.

327
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:41,191
Just let Kellerman take care of it.
Let him be our Oswald.

328
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:43,441
Then, that makes
me your Jack Ruby.

329
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:45,462
Jack Ruby was working alone.

330
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:49,241
You've got the support of the United
States government behind you, Alex.

331
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,792
Good luck in Albuquerque.

332
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,533
I promise, sir,
this will all be over shortly

333
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:07,651
and it will be back
to business as usual.

334
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:14,250
- Do you regret it?
- What?

335
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:19,803
Knowing what you know now,
do you regret helping me?

336
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:22,480
You'd have done the
same thing for me.

337
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,780
- You think?
- I know.

338
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:31,481
You didn't answer the question.

339
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,311
I don't regret the act.

340
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:38,891
Just how it turned out.

341
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,672
We've got a premeditated
murder on our hands.

342
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:47,401
You wanted to steal money and
then kill the only witness.

343
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:49,843
- Are you my attorney or theirs?
- I told you I didn't do anything.

344
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:52,231
No, I'm just explaining their
theory of what happened.

345
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:55,012
Your explanation to the cops
that you didn't kill Geary

346
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:56,771
because you were
too busy trying

347
00:23:57,098 --> 00:23:59,070
to steal five million in
federally insured money.

348
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,913
Probably not the best move.
But there is good news.

349
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,171
What's that?

350
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:08,780
The DA is willing to offer a deal.
25 years.

351
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:09,523
No.

352
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:12,201
Brad, they'll drop
the capital charge.

353
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,540
No death penalty. No.

354
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,513
I'd be almost 65
when I get out.

355
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:19,892
But you'd get out.
If this case goes to trial,

356
00:24:20,107 --> 00:24:22,802
there's an excellent chance
you're sentenced to death.

357
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,312
Now, I've been doing
this a while, Brad,

358
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:29,213
and I can tell you these
things never go down good.

359
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:30,802
When the system wants you,

360
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:34,092
they get you,
one way or another.

361
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:43,932
Part of the deal's got to be
I do my time in Illinois,

362
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:47,440
so I can be near my mom.

363
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:09,751
- Where are they taking us?
- Another foster home.

364
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:12,001
I don't want to go.
I liked it there.

365
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,702
- I know you did.
- It's 'cause of you.

366
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:17,752
The reason they're making us move,
isn't it?

367
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:19,833
'Cause you were getting
in trouble again.

368
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,262
Yeah, and I'm sorry.

369
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:31,283
Seems like I've been dragging
you into trouble my whole life.

370
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:33,532
Pulled me out of some, too.

371
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:36,351
Yeah.

372
00:26:00,136 --> 00:26:02,802
- Yeah.
- Alex. Paul Kellerman.

373
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:05,383
- Have you spoken with Bill Kim?
- Yeah.

374
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:08,812
Yeah, he filled me in.
You're staging in Albuquerque.

375
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:12,050
Now, listen.
Me jumping in at this point.

376
00:26:12,288 --> 00:26:15,813
It in no way reflects my feelings
about the job you've been doing.

377
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:19,051
- I just wanted you to know that.
- Of course.

378
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:21,423
So long as we get the job done.

379
00:26:21,608 --> 00:26:24,052
And we all get to go back
to our families, right?

380
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:28,963
The sooner the better.
So what do I need to know?

381
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:35,780
Fugitive Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield

382
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:44,961
have been apprehended just a few
miles north of the US-Mexican border.

383
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:46,922
- What's going on out there?
- Let me go check.

384
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:52,792
- What do you see?
- I'll let you know.

385
00:27:58,036 --> 00:28:00,302
How much time is it going
to take to move the semi?

386
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,490
I've got my men
working on it now.

387
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:14,373
- What's going on up there?
- Are you in a hurry, convict?

388
00:28:16,316 --> 00:28:19,460
Hey, we need some help getting
this rig out of the road.

389
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:25,652
Linc.

390
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,202
All right,
let's say we get the cuffs off.

391
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:40,340
- Where do we go?
- There.

392
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:42,942
That's too easy.

393
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,141
Come on.
Come on, Michael, take it.

394
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:51,733
Come on, come on.

395
00:28:55,518 --> 00:28:56,402
Take it.

396
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:01,463
Take it and run.

397
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:17,460
Let's think about this.

398
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:19,441
The keys are
accidentally left out,

399
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:21,533
the door is
accidentally left open.

400
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:24,012
- It's our only shot.
- It's their only shot.

401
00:29:24,158 --> 00:29:26,750
They don't have an excuse to kill
us unless we give it to them.

402
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,890
- How are we doing?
- Nothing so far.

403
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:32,252
- None?
- They're talking, that's all.

404
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,090
If they haven't bitten
in five minutes,

405
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,872
you haul the semi,
you tell them it's fixed.

406
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,062
- You release traffic.
- And do what?

407
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:41,090
If you want the rabbit to hop,
you move the carrot, Alex.

408
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:02,422
You showed.

409
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:06,202
A gentleman always does.

410
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:09,682
- Where are we going to eat?
- Wherever your heart desires.

411
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,612
You know, there's just one

412
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:14,912
teensy-tiny thing I
been meaning to ask.

413
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:17,741
Anything.

414
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:24,541
You know, forwarding addresses
are supposed to be confidential.

415
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,702
I really shouldn't
be doing this.

416
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,813
Well, uh... you shouldn't have
been doing a lot of the things

417
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:31,813
we did this afternoon, but, uh,

418
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,523
neither of us has
been smited down yet.

419
00:30:36,777 --> 00:30:38,030
There she is.

420
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:42,602
I'd imagine your cousin'll
be pretty surprised

421
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,011
to hear about the money
her uncle left her.

422
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:47,223
You can be certain of it.

423
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:55,732
Sam, I hope you don't mind me asking,
but, um, your hand.

424
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:59,012
What happened to it?

425
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:00,343
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,823
I didn't want to make you feel
uncomfortable or nothing. I just...

427
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,993
I want to know you.

428
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:09,741
I want to know everything
about you, and...

429
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:16,193
if this is a part of who you are,
then I want to know how it--

430
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:21,252
Oh, dear God.

431
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:30,813
I really wish you
hadn't seen that.

432
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:56,583
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

433
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:58,311
You and some of the boys

434
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,432
get yourselves transferred
over to AD SEG.

435
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,013
That way, we can spend our days

436
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,372
playing Scrabble and
watching Sportscenter.

437
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:04,331
Look, Cap'n...

438
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:06,220
Then, in about a year
and a half or so,

439
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:08,500
you're gonna recommend me for one
of those work-release programs.

440
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:11,222
Then, I can sweat off the rest of my
time heaving hay and getting sun.

441
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,760
It ain't freedom,
but it's damn close.

442
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,723
Is that why you requested
to be sent here?

443
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:17,303
I go anywhere else--
as a former CO, I'm a dead man.

444
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,140
But here I got men to watch my back.
Get me the finest accommodations...

445
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,160
They're not putting
you in AD SEG.

446
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,231
I don't care where they're putting me.
Just take me to AD SEG.

447
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:26,873
It's not like it
used to be, Cap'n.

448
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:28,903
The COs don't run the
game here anymore.

449
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,702
- What do you mean?
- This new warden.

450
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:32,042
He's cracking down.

451
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,063
And to prove he's serious about
showing preferential treatment,

452
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:37,913
he's making an
example out of you.

453
00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:42,792
Lou, what the hell is this?

454
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:44,290
General Pop.

455
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:04,803
Welcome home, Boss.

456
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:16,892
Okay, everybody,
we're moving out.

457
00:35:28,596 --> 00:35:31,563
Window's closing, Michael.
Once the truck moves, we're...

458
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,690
If we run now, we give them permission
to put a bullet in our heads.

459
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:37,462
We stay, I'm dead within the week,
and you're locked up for life.

460
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:39,703
Or until they find
a way to get to you.

461
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:41,233
And, believe me, they will.

462
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:43,602
If we go back to prison,
we'll have a few extra days.

463
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:45,100
We'll have a chance
to contact Sara.

464
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:47,992
We don't know where Sara is.
Sara may be dead, Michael.

465
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:53,220
Let me get us out of here
the only way I know how.

466
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,092
- Fighting?
- Yeah.

467
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:01,791
Get the keys.

468
00:36:08,196 --> 00:36:09,873
Here we go. Here we go.

469
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:11,232
Copy that.

470
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:14,552
All right, we're on. Heads up.

471
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:16,041
Hold traffic.

472
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,141
You know we have no idea
what's behind that door.

473
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:34,773
Nope.

474
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,750
- You ready?
- No. You?

475
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:40,680
No.

476
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:43,441
Let's go.

477
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:29,223
Just pray there's
another way out of here.

478
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:50,130
This way.

479
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,481
Hey, they're in.

480
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,233
And they're heading
straight for you.

481
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,782
- Armed?
- No.

482
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,520
Where are you?
I'll back you up.

483
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:34,922
Just keep moving As long as
they're running from you,

484
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:37,162
they're running toward me.
They're boxed in.

485
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:38,700
Yeah.

486
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,870
Hold on one sec.

487
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:13,501
Can I write a check for the
food 'cause I don't have...

488
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,561
Hello, Mrs. Hollander.

489
00:39:15,705 --> 00:39:18,420
They say a good woman
is hard to find.

490
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:22,650
Well, if that's true,
you must be very, very...

491
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:27,203
very good. Don't be frightened.

492
00:39:28,638 --> 00:39:30,081
Teddy's home.

493
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:20,990
They're improvising,
heading toward the surface.

494
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:35,130
- Where to?
- I don't know.

495
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:37,010
Look, if something
happens to us,

496
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:39,403
if we get seperated or
of us doesn't make it,

497
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:42,221
- promise me you'll find Sara.
- We're gonna make it.

498
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,660
- Just promise me.
- I promise. Come on.

499
00:41:45,176 --> 00:41:46,481
Whoa, whoa!

500
00:42:15,406 --> 00:42:17,422
President Reynolds
ruined your lives.

501
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:21,402
She ruined my life.
You want to take that bitch down?

502
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:25,962
You just found youside man,
but it's gotta be right now.

503
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:27,081
Let's go!

504
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:28,252
Now!
