37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,080
This is the case of a family
of Birmingham gangsters

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,440
on trial for murder and sedition.

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,600
Why would the King intervene?

40
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,080
The leader of the gang,
Thomas Shelby.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,680
He claims his family was caught up
in a wider conspiracy.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,520
He names Winston Churchill.
You woke me up for this?

43
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,920
And he also sent us this.

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,560
How the fuck did
a Birmingham racketeer

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
get his hands on a personal letter
written by King George?

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
During a robbery at Hampton Court,

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,080
Shelby discovered
a box of correspondence.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Among the papers he stole was
that letter from the King himself,

49
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
which proves
His Majesty was involved.

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Oh, utter fuck.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,320
If his family walks free, then he
will burn the papers in my presence.

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,640
When are they due to hang? Today.

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,960
This morning,
in Winson Green Prison.

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,160
Why the hell didn't you
bring it up before?!

55
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
The plan was for
the Lord Chamberlain

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,600
to intervene at the appeal
but late last night

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,800
some local judge brought
the executions forward.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,360
Oh, my giddy aunt!

00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,760
No.

182
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,680
Michael?

183
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,600
Look...sometimes I have
a sniff of snow, so what?

184
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,240
How's your mother?

185
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,360
I drove past her house.
The drainpipe was hanging off.

186
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,600
Look, the cocaine keeps me awake.

187
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,360
Very long hours these days,
and when I do sleep,

188
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,640
I dream about what happened.

189
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,840
I wasn't asking
about you, Michael, was I?

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
I was asking about your mother.

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Since she was pardoned,
she's been on these fucking tablets

192
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

193
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
She says that when she was
inside the noose...she saw spirits.

194
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,320
She's running seances,

195
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,480
but people just come into
the house to steal things.

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,960
Tommy, it's bad.
All right, all right.

197
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,960
Hm! Now, listen to me, Michael...

198
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,200
..the spirits she sees are real.

199
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,800
Believe they're real.

200
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
Believe it with her.

201
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Then eventually...

202
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,640
you can take the remembered noose
from around her neck...

203
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,520
..like a horse that's
been choked off.

204
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,360
Keep her off whisky,
throw away the tablets...

205
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,120
..and stop giving her fucking snow.

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,640
Fuck, Tommy, that sounded like
family advice.

207
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
Are you coming back?

208
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
Nothing to come back to.

209
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,640
Truth is, they're all fucked.

210
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,720
The lot of them. Yeah.

211
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,800
Find out about that woman,
Jessie Eden.

212
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,480
Don't let your mother keep cash
in the house. And, oi!

213
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
No cocaine
in my registered premises.

214
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,360
Did you see they all came?

215
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,080
Yeah, I saw you at the back.

216
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,320
It's funny they don't notice.

217
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
Oh, my sweet!

218
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,320
Oh, my heart!

219
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,080
Crushed to death in the canal.

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,120
But back home again,
and so beautiful!

221
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh!

222
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,080
WHISPERS: Inside the loop.

223
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,600
Inside the merry loop.

232
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,560
Come on.

# Alas Salvation

# Gilded lily nest of vipers
Never ever did invite us. #

236
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,320
I thought we'd lost you to
the great white way of Broadway.

237
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760
No. Well, this beats
Watery Lane, John.

238
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,840
Does it?
Take a seat, I'll grab the kids.

239
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,040
Oh, it's all right,
I'm not stopping.

240
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,440
I just want to drop those presents
off for tomorrow.

241
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,640
I don't want words on Christmas Eve.

242
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
It's my house. You're welcome.

243
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,680
Hm.
FAINT CHILDREN'S CHATTER

244
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,320
It's OK, I'm staying with Polly.

245
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,360
Yeah. She's in a bad way.

246
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,120
Mm. I'll bring her to her senses.

247
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,800
Michael's already tried that.
I'll get through to her.

248
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
You still going to come to
the party on New Year's Eve?

249
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,040
Yeah. Who else is coming?

250
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,560
Arthur, Linda...

251
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,280
Hello, Esme.

252
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,280
Who paid for your car and driver,
Ada?

253
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,560
Shelby Company Limited.

254
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,120
Nice car. He treats you well.

255
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,960
His last little pet.

256
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
Look, this visit is meant to be
about making things all right.

257
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,040
John had a rope around his neck.
He shit himself.

258
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,680
All right, Esme, that'll do, yeah?
Go in the kitchen.

259
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,840
Take a curse back to the money.

260
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,800
Anyway, there's your presents.

261
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,440
How's Arthur?

262
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,400
For Christmas,
get him a sewing kit...

263
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
..so he can sew
his fucking balls back on.

264
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,560
Oh!

265
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,280
GEESE HONK

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,040

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,400
Maypole 245.

268
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
Hello, Esme.

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,040
There you go, look. That's a couple
of eggs. Two eggs. There we go.

270
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,880
Arthur?

271
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,320
Be careful with Billy in there,
there's a cock.

272
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,160
Yeah, I will.

273
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,360
And don't smoke that near him.

274
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,400
All right. Get out of it!

275
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Esme called to say
Ada's on her way over.

276
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,520
HE LAUGHS

277
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,560
Did you hear that, Billy boy?

278
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,640
Your Auntie Ada's coming
all the way from America.

279
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,160
Bye, chickens!

280
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,320
Oh! We dropped an egg, look!

281
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,840
We dropped an egg, Billy boy.

283
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
Give him the hell he gives us,
Miss Eden.

284
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,480
# Take a little walk
to the edge of town

285
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,200
# And go across the tracks

286
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,120
# Where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom

287
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,520
# As it shifts and cracks

288
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,520
# Where the secrets lie
in the border fires

289
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,040
# In the humming wires...#

290
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,240
Excuse me! This is the gents...

291
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
You don't have a women's lavatory
on the second floor

292
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
because no women get this far up.

293
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,800
If you don't have a women's
lavatory, I can't go to it, can I?

294
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,680
# On a gathering storm
comes a tall handsome man

295
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,600
# In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand. #

296
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,200
You say there is a disparity in pay
based on sex.

297
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,360
The male wire-cutters
in the Rover factory

298
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,840
a mile and a half down the road

299
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
are paid ten shillings a week more

300
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,080
than the female wire-cutters here.

301
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,960
Different factories,
different rates.

302
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,960
But both factories
are owned by you, Mr Shelby.

303
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
Not in your own name, of course.

304
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,200
In the name of Arrow House Holdings.

305
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
You own the Lanchester
car and van factory

306
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,480
in the name
of Tilton Company Limited,

307
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,480
the Billings machine tools factories
at Hay Mills and Greet

308
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,360
in the name of
Stetchford Engineering,

309
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,520
the Bilston Forgings and Pressings
factory in the name of Canalside,

310
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,680
and the canal warehousing
in Gas Street,

311
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,560
Saltely and Cadbury in the name
of Shelby Company Limited.

312
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,320
Also, 255 streets
of back-to-back houses.

313
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,560
Very good.

314
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
Very good.

315
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,280
So this isn't about women and men.

316
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,960
It's about me, eh?

317
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,120
Tommy Shelby, OBE.
No, it's not about you.

318
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800
It's about disparities.

319
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,560
It's about ten shillings a week
for working mothers

320
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,280
so they can buy shoes for their
kids. Never had shoes myself.

321
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,120
So, now you deny others?

322
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,760
And, barefoot, I grew up mean.

323
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,360
Oh, I know.
Oh, yeah, you know everything.

324
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,080
Your turn of phrase...
Is unacceptable?

325
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,000
You grew up mean, you say? A threat
in there, I think, somewhere.

326
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,920
No threats. The whole of
Birmingham knows you, Mr Shelby.

327
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,280
Sweetheart...whatever you've heard,
I don't need to make threats.

328
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,640
My comrade brothers and sisters...

329
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,320
Huh! Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

330
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,560
I will conduct myself
as a businessman...

331
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,240
Who says "sweetheart"!

332
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,280
You say there is
a ten-shilling disparity

333
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,240
between male and female cutters
in two of my factories?

334
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
Very well.

335
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I will increase the pay of
the female cutters

336
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,240
in this factory by five shillings.

337
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,000
And I will cut the pay

338
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,440
of the male cutters in the Rover
by five shillings...

339
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,760
..thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

340
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,600
And I will tell the men
with families to feed

341
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,320
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

342
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,520
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

343
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,040
Oh, yeah? The week after Christmas?
You think so?

344
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,960
You know, everything
you've said here today,

345
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,320
and the fact that we're having
this meeting today

346
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,720
tells me that you are
a woman without a family.

347
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,600
And everything I hear about you

348
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,960
tells me you are a man
without a family, as well.

349
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,600
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

350
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,720
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

351
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,600
as soon as Boxing Day.

352
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,360
You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

353
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,600
I've heard lots of whistles blow,
sweetheart!

354
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,400
HE EXHALES

355
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
FOOTSTEPS

356
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,160
DOOR OPENS

357
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

358
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,040
I'm sorry to keep asking,

359
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,120
but Chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

360
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,440
He's new. He's foreign.
He gets very upset.

361
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,480
Right. Well, you tell Chef

362
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,000
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,360
27? Family?

364
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,320
Yep. I thought Charlie
could do with some company,

365
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,400
so I asked Johnny Dogs if he knew
anyone who liked to eat goose...

366
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,120
..and he said he knew 26.

367
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,360
Tell Chef I want ten geese,

368
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,640
a buck cut into steaks,

369
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
some trout from the river.

370
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,080
Fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar. Best we have.

371
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,360
There will be children?

372
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,440
Lots of children.

373
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,960
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor.

374
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,720
So have mops and buckets ready, eh?

375
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,440
And I want you at the table,
Frances, so make it 28.

376
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,520
I will be busy.

377
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,680
You've put up with me
this past year,

378
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,840
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business.

379
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,040
Tomorrow, you will eat at my table.

380
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,960
Things will get better, I think,
next year.

381
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,840
Uh-huh.

382
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,160
HE CLEARS THROAT

383
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,800
HE BREATHES HARD

384
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,440
It gets much warmer
than here in the summer.

385
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,880
Much colder in the winter.
I knew it. Mm.

386
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,000
But parts of it are
just like Birmingham.

387
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,200
Yeah. Shit and smoke
are the same everywhere.

388
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,440
Hm. What about you, Linda?
Are you working?

389
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,040
I've been seeking work as a teacher.
A teacher.

390
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,400
But, you know, it's quite difficult.

391
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,040
The Shelby name,
it's always in the papers.

392
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,920
And, er...what do you
get up to all day, Arthur?

393
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,800
As you know,
Arthur's previous endeavours

394
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,480
have left us with
no need for a salary.

395
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,440
Arthur occupies his time in
the garden, doing voluntary work.

396
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,080
He drives old people and cripples.

397
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,040
Oh. Yeah, well,
it's something to do.

398
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,840
I want to open a garage.

399
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,120
Some day. Fixing cars, you know?

400
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,160
Sometimes cars attract
ambitious men.

401
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,080
Yeah, well...I like fixing cars.

402
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,760
Mm.

403
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,400
PHONE RINGS

404
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,960
I'll go. I got it.

405
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,800
Maypole 245.

406
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Arthur, have you checked your post?

407
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,320
I just got served a black hand.

408
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,720
I just got delivered a black fucking
hand to the house.

409
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,600
From Luca Changretta.

410
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,000
WHISPERS: Jesus!

411
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,120
Jesus Christ!

412
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,120
Wait a minute, John,
which one was Luca?

413
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,720
The old man's oldest son.

414
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
He was going to get done for
killing a bank clerk in a robbery,

415
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,960
so his old man sent him
back to New York.

416
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,840
You know what the black hand means
among the wops, Arthur?

417
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,800
It's Mafia shit.

418
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,560
The Sicilian fucking Mafia!

419
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Check your post, Arthur.

420
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,440
Arthur, I was just leaving.
No, you're not.

421
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,200
I need...I need to talk to you.
Arthur?

422
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
It's all right, Linda. Stay here.
Ada, please.

423
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,880
Linda? You stay here.

424
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Did you say Mafia?

425
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Esme, I need to make a call. No!

426
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,800
I need to make a fucking call! Give
it here! What the fuck is this?!

427
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,160
Give it here! Not until you tell me
what the fuck it is!

428
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,600
Give it here! What is it?!

429
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,000
It's from Luca Changretta,
all right? We killed his dad.

430
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,400
I remember.
It was Tommy who killed him!

431
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,200
It was fucking Arthur
pulled the trigger!

432
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,000
All right, it was mercy,
but it was Arthur!

433
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,880
Anyway,
it makes no fucking difference!

434
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,160
For the wops, it's family.

435
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,720
The black hand came here.

436
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Everybody will have got one.

437
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,360
They're coming for us all!

438
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,640
We made an agreement.

439
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,360
We made a solemn promise.

440
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,680
We're the family now.

441
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,840
Here, look at that.

442
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,920
That's from Changretta's son, Luca.

443
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,640
How the fuck he
knows where I live. Eh?

444
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,040
And why's he waited a year?

445
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,320
I'm going to see Tommy next.
I'll talk to him.

446
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,040
I've been served a black hand
and she won't even let me

447
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,800
keep a fucking
spud gun in the house.

448
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,400
Go to a hotel.

449
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,920
It's Christmas Eve, Ada.

450
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,800
I've got a gun in the glove
compartment. You take that for now.

451
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,680
I'll talk to Tommy
and have him call.

452
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,320
Just make sure you get to the
phone first. Yeah. Now hug me,

453
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,800
like you came out here
because you were emotional.

454
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,640
I am emotional. I just don't know
what fucking emotion it is.

455
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,360
It'll be OK. I'll talk to Tommy.

456
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,000
You talk to him.

457
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
GOOSE HONKS

458
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,000
You and me both, brother.

459
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,040
ENGINE STARTS

460
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,520
Ada!

461
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,840
You wait there,
you won't leave empty handed.

462
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,400
Here you go, look, some eggs,

463
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,120
you give them to Polly, all right?

464
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,560
And you, keep your eyes on the road.

465
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,040
Take care.

466
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,840
Who was on the phone, Arthur?

467
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
John. Wishing me Merry Christmas.

468
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,640
Come inside. It's getting late.

469
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,280
SHIP'S HORN

470
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,480
Thanks.

471
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,560
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

472
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,360
Take off the hat.

473
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,400
Are you with those other Italians?

474
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,240
We're Americans.
It says it right there on the paper.

475
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,040
USA.

476
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,680
And what's the purpose
of your visit?

477
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
Pleasure.

478
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,520
Mum? It's me.

479
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,960
You left the door open.

480
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
To change the air.

481
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
I told you I was busy today.

482
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
What do you want?

483
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,640
Why haven't you opened your post?

484
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,880
I tidied up.

485
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Ada's coming today.

486
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,560
She's late.

487
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,520
Tommy asked about you today.

488
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,160
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

489
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,960
Is Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

490
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah.

491
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,720
Bentleys are no good in the cold.

492
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,440
You should tell him.

493
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
I will.

494
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,800
Any other messages for Tommy?

495
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,160
Yeah. Fuck off.

496
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,400
He saw that your drain pipe
was broken. He was worried.

497
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,080
Is that it? Is that all
he asked about? Drainpipes?

498
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,440
No. He said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

499
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
That you've always had a gift.

500
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,640
What gift?

501
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,400
Second sight.

502
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,760
Spirits. All that gypsy stuff,
he said that I'm to believe you.

503
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,760
You think I don't
hear his voice in yours.

504
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
You don't think
I recognise his strategies.

505
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,840
I'm still a match for him.

506
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,880
Yes.

507
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,160
You are. And you still can be.

508
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
Me and Lizzie decided that

509
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,960
this New Year
we're all to turn the page.

510
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,680
You can't spend another
year like this, Mum. "Mum."

511
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,720
Mum.

512
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,080
That word is like a bullet to me.

513
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,320
I see your sister in
that chair sometimes...

514
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,680
Look, me and Lizzie
have decided.

515
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,840
It's time.

516
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,160
I bought these.

517
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,600
One for you and Ada

518
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,240
and one for you and me.

519
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,480
So Tommy said,
"Keep her off the whisky."

520
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,160
I'll drink Champagne
the day my son leaves

521
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,480
the employment
of Shelby Company Limited.

522
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

523
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,040
Right. Now, this is your job,
Charlie. We give those to Santa

524
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
and Rudolph.

525
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,720
Good boy. Put this out for Santa,
for his whisky.

526
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,080
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

527
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,440
I will see you tomorrow. Sleep well.
Come on, Charlie.

528
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,720
APPROACHING VEHICLE

529
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
KNOCKING

530
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,600
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

531
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,000
I know. Send her in.

532
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,680
I got a card, Ada.

533
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,840
I'm guessing Arthur
and John have had one as well.

534
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,280
Hello, Tommy. "Hello, Ada, welcome
home." Thanks, it's nice to be back.

535
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,800
I've spoken to Moss.

536
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,560
Moss said Changretta is a soldier
for the Spinetti family,

537
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,280
which means he will have men
with him, professional men.

538
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,920
They usually operate in
units of around ten.

539
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,240
Moss is checking Cunard records to
see if they're already in England.

540
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,560
This one's for you.

541
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
What is it? A time machine?

542
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
My God. Tommy Shelby.

543
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,960
Is that regret?

544
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,560
I'll open it tomorrow.

545
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,960
So, boss, in the light of
the changed circumstances,

546
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,520
what are your orders?

547
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,040
Changretta knows where we all live.

548
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,720
If we stay out
in the open, isolated,

549
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,080
he'll pick us off one by one.

550
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,040
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

551
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,000
You mean back home?

552
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,960
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

553
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

554
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,240
I'm calling a family meeting.
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

555
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,720
Finn's already there.
You tell Polly and Michael.

556
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,120
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

557
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,600
And Esme and Linda?

558
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,480
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

559
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,840
needs to come to where it's safe.

560
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,000
These bastards
will kill kids as well.

561
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,760
When this business is finished,
we can...go our separate ways.

562
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,080
Go and see Polly and explain.

563
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,600
She'll have had a card as well.

564
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,760
Do you think I'm on the list?

565
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,280
We're all on the list, Ada.

566
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,600
I gave my gun to Arthur.

567
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
Welcome home.

568
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,000
Holy shit, it's Father Christmas.

569
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,360
Yeah, and if you're good...
you get what you deserve.

570
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,040
Fucking come here, you!

571
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,840
PHONE RINGS

572
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,960
Fuck.

573
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,400
Yeah, put me through to Maypole 245.

574
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,840
PHONE RINGS

575
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,640
Hello. Arthur, it's Tommy.

576
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,120
Be quick, they're asleep.

577
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,840
Family meeting,
Charlie's yard, Boxing Day, midday.

578
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,080
I can't raise John but
I'll send Michael to get him.

579
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,680
If you have to pull a gun on Linda,
do it. Merry Christmas.

580
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,000
Merry Christmas, Tom.

581
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,720
What did you do with them?

582
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,800
My tablets were in
the bathroom cabinet.

583
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,960
What did you do with them?

584
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,680
I threw them in the lavatory.

585
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,320
Tommy's orders?

586
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,480
No. My own decision.

587
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,440
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

588
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,760
They close everything.

589
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,880
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

590
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,800
I'll help you.
They don't open anything.

591
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Fucking no apothecary, nothing.

592
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,000
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

593
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,040
How can I get through
fucking Christmas? Without...

594
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,560
Without anything! How?

595
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,840
SHE BREATHES HARD AND RAPIDLY

596
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,520
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

597
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,400
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby!

598
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,880
Fuck off! It's all right it's me.
Mum, this as got to stop!

599
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,080
I don't want you,
I don't want you, Thomas Shelby.

600
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,640
My husband is back and he loves me.

601
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,040
Tommy said to believe in
spirits with you, but I can't.

602
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,160
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.
Merry Christmas.

603
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,680
The door was wide open.

604
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,000
Fuck.

605
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,280
I spent the whole day tidying up.
I wanted it to be nice.

606
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,840
I wanted it to look nice!

607
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,640
Why, Pol? It's only me.

608
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,880
It's OK. It's OK.

609
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,480
We can sit, sit and talk
and put things back together.

610
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
It's OK.

611
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,120
I'll leave you two to it.
No, you stay.

612
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,120
Now, listen, something's happened.
Things have changed.

613
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,760
Today everyone in the family
received one of these.

614
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
What does it mean?

615
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,000
Tommy's called a family meeting.
He wants you both to come.

616
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,360
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

617
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,720
KNOCKING

618
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,400
Come.

619
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm really sorry to
bother you again, sir,

620
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
but Chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

621
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,760
Francis, for the last time,
it's Johnny Dogs. They're gypsies.

622
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,560
They're camped down by the river.

623
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,080
When they're ready
they'll walk up. All right?

624
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,600
He says it's about preparation, sir.

625
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,040
What is?

626
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,120
He's asked specifically.

627
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,360
Will they arrive before
the King's speech or after?

628
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
You said he was new, this chef.

629
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,280
When did join us?

630
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,320
October.

631
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,920
October.

632
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,720
And he's foreign?

633
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,880
He's Italian, sir.

634
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,360
Oh. He's the best chef we've
ever had in the house.

635
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,200
No shouting or swearing
or blaspheming.

636
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,600
Do we have his references?

637
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,080
Yes.

638
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,920
The only problem
has been his assistant.

639
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,480
What assistant?

640
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,720
He brought an assistant with him.
He calls him his sous-chef.

641
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,520
Are they still working, Frances?

642
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,360
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

643
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,040
Right, thank you. Good night.

644
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,080
You can go to bed.

645
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,480
Merry Christmas, sir.

646
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,360
And I thought about your offer.

647
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,520
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

648
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,960
Right, thank you.

649
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,160
What's your name?

650
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,280
Max, Mr Shelby.

651
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,480
Max.

652
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,120
It's all right. Don't get up.

653
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,480
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, yes.

654
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,000
You're new. I'm Mr Shelby.

655
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,640
Hello, sir.

656
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,560
I haven't taken time to
introduce myself.

657
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,760
Antonio.

658
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,160
What have you done
that's so wrong, eh?

659
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,920
Excuse me?

660
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,920
A sous-chef peeling potatoes.

661
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,480
It's an emergency. Late notice.

662
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,440
Oh. Late notice.

663
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,520
Right, right, carry on.

664
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,920
Antonio...

665
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,480
..here, £10.

666
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,880
For the late notice.

667
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,800
You wanted to know if
my guests would arrive

668
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,400
before or after the King's speech?

669
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,320
Eh? Yes.

670
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,040
It'll be after.

671
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,920
How are you?

672
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,120
Oh, just...worried about tomorrow.

673
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,280
Yeah? I'm worried about Antonio.

674
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,240
You've been here two months
and we've not met before.

675
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,160
It's my fault. I've been busy.

676
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,880
Thomas Shelby.

677
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,400
My hand has blood.

678
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,840
Oh, mine too.

679
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,160
Hey, er, how much do
you pay Antonio?

680
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,320
I forget.

681
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,720
Must be a lot.

682
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,880
I just gave him £10.

683
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,960
Didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

684
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,480
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

685
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,440
I've been reading up on you.

686
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,320
Bertorelli. Claridge's.

687
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,280
You used to work in a place
called San Marco's,

688
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,640
on...on Fleet Street.

689
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,960
I used to know the man
that owned San Marco's.

690
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,600
A man called Darby Sabini.

691
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,720
I never met him. No.

692
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,120
Maybe your...assistant, Antonio,
maybe he's met him.

693
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,920
Here's how it is.

694
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,760
Antonio was sent from New York.
I don't know. Please...

695
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,200
Darby Sabini facilitated.

696
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,240
He passed him on to you and told
you to bring him into my house.

697
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,760
They threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

698
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,680
You want me to dress you like
you dressed that fucking stag?

699
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,320
Please!

700
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,680
You know about me, right? Mm-hm.

701
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,240
You know what I do? Mm-hm.

702
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,880
You wanted to know when
my guests would arrive

703
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,520
because Antonio needed me alone.
He's an assassin.

704
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,720
The plan is to kill me tomorrow.

705
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,320
I don't know.

706
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,240
They just said bring him here.

707
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,200
Well, bring him here.

708
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,560
Antonio!

709
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,120
HE CALLS OUT IN ITALIAN

710
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,080
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

711
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,800
Aaaargh!

712
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,560
Aaaargh!

713
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,120
You are a black hand!
You are a black hand!

714
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,200
How many came from New York?
How many fucking came from New York?

715
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,760
Vaffanculo!

716
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,200
What did he... What did he say?
Is that a curse or a number?

717
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,880
What did he fucking say?
What did he fucking say?

718
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,720
He said, "Fuck you." Yeah?

719
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,040
GUNSHOT

720
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,040
The black hand means
kill or be killed.

721
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,840
You go back to London,

722
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,680
you tell Darby Sabini he picked
the wrong side in this war.

723
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,360
Once we've dealt with the Americans,
we'll come for him.

724
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,160
Go on, go.

725
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,320
Go.

726
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,960
Oi! You tell anyone else,
I'll come and find you.

727
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,240
Harrow 335.

728
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,920
The Hare and Hounds pub.

729
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,600
Robert. Yes, it's Mr Shelby.

730
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,480
Merry Christmas to you too.

731
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,960
Robert, is there a gypsy in
the public bar playing

732
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
the fiddle for shillings?

733
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,440
Yes.

734
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,800
Can you, er, can you tell him
I need to speak to him?

735
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,600
Thank you.

736
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,560
Oh, fuck, Tom.

737
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,560
I thought these sporting
days were over.

738
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,320
Yeah, so did I.
But they keep coming back at us.

739
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,960
There's a black stallion
in the stables.

740
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
He's invisible at night, use him.

741
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,640
Take the body across the river
to the rough ground.

742
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,800
Burn him? No. This one's a message.

743
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,400
Will there still be
geese for dinner?

744
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,800
Only if you can steal them
on the way. On the way where?

745
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,640
We're going back, Johnny.

746
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,360
Back to Small Heath.

747
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,920
Back where you belong.

748
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,160
HE SPEAKS HIS OWN LANGUAGE

749
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,000
Merry Christmas.
You can keep the stallion.

750
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,840
Christ the fucking night.

751
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,560
Michael, they're coming today.
Michael, shut up and listen.

752
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,120
You've got to get everyone out.

753
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,400
Get Polly and Ada to Charlie's yard.

754
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,320
I've told Arthur
but I can't reach John.

755
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,120
When you've dropped Polly and Ada,

756
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,600
go out to John's place
and get him out. All right?

757
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,240
Is it Christmas?
Not just yet. Let's go, eh? Mummy!

758
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,440
Move!

759
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,520
Hello?

760
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,240
GUN COCKS

761
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,240
Oh, fuck. It's you. Got nothing
better to do on Christmas morning?

762
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,560
Tommy wants everybody at
Charlie's yard now. Come on.

763
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,000
Get in. Get in. What's going to
happen? It's fucking Christmas.

764
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,880
Look, John, we don't
have time for this.

765
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,720
Come into the house. Just come
to the meeting. Have some food.

766
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,480
Tell Tommy Shelby
we can look after ourselves.

767
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,520
Tommy says they could
come for us today.

768
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,600
Tommy says, Tommy says.
Are you his fucking parrot?

769
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,160
Look it's the Mafia, all right.

770
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,520
This is the New York Mafia
we're talking about.

771
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,640
And we're
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

772
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,920
No, we're not, John.

773
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,680
We're not the Peaky fucking Blinders
unless we're together.

774
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,080
You were together on the gallows,

775
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,680
with one man missing.

776
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,720
John? John, come to the meeting,
all right? Think about the kids.

777
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,480
Come to the meeting and
if you want to leave then fine.

778
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,040
HORSE HOOVES

779
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,320
No. It's Christmas Day.
We're the family now.

780
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,480
We're staying at home.

781
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,200
In the fucking house! Esme...

782
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,840
John!

783
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,680
GUNFIRE
