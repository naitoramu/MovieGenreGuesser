1
00:00:05,288 --> 00:00:06,986
Previously on Prison Break.

2
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,344
I'm so sorry.
They got me and Sara.

3
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:13,011
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?

4
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:15,825
I want a picture of my son and
Sara to prove they're alive.

5
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:18,503
I will have a court date one of
these days, and you will be there.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,753
- You're on your own.
- Sofia Lugo.

7
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:22,809
I'm James
Whistler's girlfriend.

8
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,803
- Why does he want this?
- He's just a fisherman.

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,827
Tell your fisherman friend
Scofield's brother has this.

10
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,220
- Just take the bounty off Whistler.
- Whistler don't mean nothing to me.

11
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:35,096
There are ways I can
be of assistance.

12
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:38,405
Whistler's clear?

13
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:40,485
Clear as the blue sky, brother.

14
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,742
- So, how are we getting out of here?
- I have no idea.

15
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:51,313
- What the hell are you doing?
- I just...

16
00:01:52,756 --> 00:01:56,391
I need some money, and I didn't...
I didn't know where else to go.

17
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,071
- I've got about $50.
- No, no.

18
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:03,031
I'm talking about the millions, papi.
The backpack?

19
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,013
There's all sorts of
cash in that thing.

20
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,750
Need a place to crash, I got your back,
but the backpack's gone.

21
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,632
Any money I dig out
is for my brother.

22
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,431
Remember him? Tall guy, kind of thin.
Busted your ass out of jail.

23
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:18,872
I feel bad about Mike.
I do, Linc.

24
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:21,040
But not all of us got exonerated,
you know.

25
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,403
- Pretty clear on that.
- I can't ever go home again.

26
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,910
- You got problems, Sucre?
- You ain't the only one, Linc.

27
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:31,362
That's right.
We're all guilty of something, man.

28
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:35,091
All of us. Not them.

29
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,292
I want to help.

30
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:40,161
But it seems like it's only
getting deeper and deeper.

31
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,740
Look, I just want money to get back
on my feet and that's it, Linc.

32
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:46,791
Linc?

33
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:49,911
Never mind.

34
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:22,763
Doesn't take too long for
a man to become animal, no?

35
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,491
The smart ones go
for his bunk first.

36
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,651
What do the dumb ones do?

37
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:31,822
Hey, I was here first.

38
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,471
Mampi bitch,
you been here two days.

39
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,772
I was the first one to the shoe,
you sack-in-the-box--

40
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:36,602
now hand it over.

41
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,250
You're asking for a chicken foot,
friend. You want this shoe?

42
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:41,522
You're gonna have
to come and get it.

43
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:53,750
Leave him. Leave him.

44
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:57,152
I just wanted to express
my thanks for, uh...

45
00:03:58,946 --> 00:03:59,740
for Whistler.

46
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:02,751
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.

47
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:03,783
My mistake.

48
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,492
Anyway, I thought maybe we could
make some kind of arrangement.

49
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,973
Maybe I could help
out around Sona.

50
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:14,743
Come here, boy. Leave.

51
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:24,523
You help me?
I'm the bucky massa here, boy.

52
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,451
Me. Not you.

53
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:29,420
So if anyone want
anything at Sona,

54
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,300
it's me them will come to.

55
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:33,611
So do not walk in here
asking for some favor

56
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,332
like we have some understanding.
No, no, no, no, no.

57
00:04:36,518 --> 00:04:38,681
We do not.

58
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:41,183
The next time you roll
in here like that, boy,

59
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:46,293
the only thing you ask
me for is mercy. Si?

60
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,153
Scofield, visitor.

61
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,303
Go on, boy.

62
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,272
Now, run along,
your momma calling ya.

63
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:19,470
That bad, huh?

64
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:23,392
It's not good. You?

65
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:25,512
I followed that message
you got from Whistler.

66
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:28,963
It's all about some book.
A bird guide. Names and numbers on it.

67
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,641
Any clues as about
who he might be?

68
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,610
No. We weren't the only ones
following his directions.

69
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,203
His girl was there,
says he's some kind of fisherman.

70
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,421
Yeah, sure he is.

71
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:41,860
Listen, man,
I want you to check something out.

72
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:47,302
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:52,421
The way she's holding the paper it's
like she's pointing at something.

74
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,353
- It's too small I can't read it.
- This is today's paper.

75
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:58,942
She's pointing at Santa Rita.
It's a small town 20 miles from here.

76
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:02,510
She's trying to tell
us where she is.

77
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,662
I have to talk to her, Linc.

78
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,270
Even if they let you
talk to her, man,

79
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,863
they'll be listening to every
word you say. You can't do that.

80
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:12,850
We're gonna need more than
the name of that town.

81
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,640
I'm coming up
empty-handed here, Linc.

82
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:18,743
It's already been
three days and...

83
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,962
I got nothing to show for it.

84
00:06:22,305 --> 00:06:24,952
So, if I can't break
Whistler out of here...

85
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,072
you're gonna have to
break them out of there.

86
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:33,073

87
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:03,020
So, what's the deal, mate?
When's moving day?

88
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:05,622
I'll tell you the plan when
you tell me who you are.

89
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,212
- I'm a fisherman.
- Really? So am I.

90
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:12,220
You're worried about trusting me?
My life is in your hands.

91
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,242
How am I supposed to know
that I can trust you?

92
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,552
You don't.

93
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,123
- Boo-yah!
- Hey.

94
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,102
Stuart Scott.
Number one, right?

95
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,221
- You watch the SportsCenter?
- Not recently.

96
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,722
Look, I need to get
my hands on a phone.

97
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,522
I need to get my
hands on some pechos.

98
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,381
But that ain't gonna happen either,
is it?

99
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,190
Who you got to call
so important anyway?

100
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:38,943
Sara.

101
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:42,612
Absolutely not.

102
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,783
It ain't a request;
it's a dictation of terms.

103
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:47,412
My brother ain't thinking about
escape till he talks to Sara.

104
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:51,630
Aw, that's sweet.
I can assure of two things, Lincoln.

105
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,423
One, that Sara's fine and two,

106
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,103
you have a better chance
of banging me on that bar

107
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:58,801
than you do of talking to her.

108
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:00,543
I appreciate the offer,
but I'll pass.

109
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:01,660
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:03,960
Oh, what if that's a
dictation of terms.

111
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:07,222
It's not a matter of negotiation.
Government rip out all the phones

112
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:10,473
when they find out bad men in
Sona still setting up deals.

113
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:14,401
Making bang-bangs just like before.
They just did it over the phone.

114
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,801
Well, if they cut the lines,
maybe we can fix 'em.

115
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:18,353
There's nothing to fix, bro.

116
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:20,871
There used to be a whole row
of them all along the wall,

117
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:22,023
but they're gone now.

118
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:24,850
If you have no more questions
I'm just gonna get going.

119
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:27,352
Michael got the bounty off
Whistler's head in two days.

120
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,761
That's more than your people
could do in two weeks.

121
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,121
Show some goodwill.

122
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:33,522
He'll get his goodwill
when Whistler's out.

123
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,732
One thing you should know about
my brother, he's very stubborn.

124
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:39,752
You want him to fetch,
you throw him a bone.

125
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:43,483
How does Michael think he's gonna
get his hands on a phone inside Sona?

126
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:44,891
What about cell phones?

127
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,921
With all the traffic
moving in and out of here.

128
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:50,031
Cell phone big no-no.
Only one man has access to it,

129
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:52,522
and he would never let
a zanahoria like you...

130
00:08:52,638 --> 00:08:55,212
- ... get his hands on it.
- Let me guess.

131
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,471
What is it?

132
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,272
The weekly from your
operations on the outside.

133
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,920
Grave digger dropped it off.

134
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:10,363
That couldn't be.
This envelope way too thin.

135
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:14,282
Stuff just moving a little slow
on the outside these days.

136
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,423
Oh, stuff moving slow.

137
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:20,973
Somebody making it move slower.

138
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:32,873
Teodoro.

139
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:37,651
Set up something at the
barber downstairs for me now.

140
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,762
Yes, sir. No problem at all.

141
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:43,351
You tell that bitch she nick
me with the razor again,

142
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:44,712
I'm gonna use it 'pon her.

143
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,580
- You're still alive.
- And you're still lovely.

144
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,896
Oh, please,
I haven't showered in three days.

145
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,725
Whatever you smell like,
it's a significant upgrade.

146
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:24,055
- When I didn't hear from you, I...
- I'm sorry.

147
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,340
- I warned you it might be a bit...
- I know, I know.

148
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:32,170
It's just...
every time they dragged out a body...

149
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:36,282
Look at me. I promise you when I leave
this place, it won't be like that.

150
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:37,913
Okay.

151
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:44,171
- Were you able to find my book?
- Yeah. But there was this guy.

152
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,483
- He followed me.
- What guy?

153
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:50,611
- I don't know.
- Did he hurt you?

154
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:54,011
No, but he took it.

155
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,083
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to do.

156
00:10:56,265 --> 00:11:00,103
- What did he lo like?
- Um... shaved head, kind of big.

157
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:05,080
He said to tell you that
Scofield's brother has it now.

158
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,542
- Who's Scofield?
- Okay.

159
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:12,862
- Who's Scofield?
- Hmm? No one.

160
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:17,100
He's just, um...
he's someone I'm working with.

161
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,451
- He's gonna help me get out of here.
- He's a lawyer?

162
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:21,420
Basically.

163
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,792
That's why you want
him to have the book.

164
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,212
Look, Sofia, the less you know
about this, the safer you'll be.

165
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:28,800
The less I know,
the less help I'll be.

166
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:32,290
Exactly. I just need you to lay
low for a while. Okay, sweetheart?

167
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:34,063
What the hell is
going on, James?

168
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,893
What is so important
about this book?

169
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:40,961
Nothing. It just has notes in it,
you know, phone numbers.

170
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:43,853
It's people who know people who are
going to help me get out of here.

171
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:45,431
You're lying.

172
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,130
Why would I lie to you?

173
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:53,400
You're the only person the
world that I can trust.

174
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,521
Come here.

175
00:11:58,197 --> 00:11:58,890
Come here.

176
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,121
Now, I just need
you to trust me.

177
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,230
- And do what?
- Nothing.

178
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,123
Sign out, please.

179
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:44,841
- You looking for something, blanquito?
- Yeah, yeah, I am, I am.

180
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:48,810
- What you looking for then?
- Just a little, uh...

181
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,292
- Little something to pass the time.
- You got paper?

182
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:59,242
Go down to the lost and
found with the rest of them.

183
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,501
- They'll hook you up proper.
- All right.

184
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:04,273
I find you sniffing around
where you don't belong,

185
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:06,773
you'll find yourself
in that ring again...

186
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:07,941
against me.

187
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,903
I don't like your odds.

188
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,501
Hello?

189
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,053
I want you to check something out,
all right?

190
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,163
Look at her left hand--
like she's pointing at something.

191
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,273
You'd better tell my cousin he'd
better make himself available.

192
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:44,893
Better him short money
than me short patience.

193
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,522
No comprende, boy?

194
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:51,042
I need a charge.

195
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,190
Teodoro, go on,
get me laundry, no?

196
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:58,060
Sure thing, boss-- oh, almost forgot.
I talked to the barber.

197
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,040
She's gonna squeeze you
in today around 2:00.

198
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,632
If that pleases you, patron.

199
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:05,571
Patron.

200
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:15,981
I think it's time you made good on
all the bad you've done, Theodore.

201
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,952
You and me, we're going to make a deal.
Lechero has a cell phone.

202
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,210
- I need it.
- No problem.

203
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,522
Shall I turn water into
wine while I'm at it?

204
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,872
Maybe give the guy's
mother a good rodgering?

205
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,140
She'd be a little old
for your tastes, no?

206
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:34,701
Careful, Pretty. Don't bite the
hand you trying to get fed out of.

207
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,722
I'm not looking for food,
I'm looking for a favor.

208
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:38,542
Why the hell should I
do you a favor, huh?

209
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,672
Cause unlike your new compadres,
I know who you are,

210
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,732
what you've done and
who you've done it to.

211
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:47,141
- Let me get this straight.
- You're saying you gonna tell on me?

212
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:52,532
This here is a religious country,
and I'm willing to bet the good folks

213
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:57,122
down in Panama don't take too
kindly to rapists and pedophiles.

214
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,522
You want to bet against me?

215
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:19,350
Listen, mate.
Here's what I know so far.

216
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,713
I know you've got a brother
helping on the outside,

217
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,290
I know he ran into
my girlfriend,

218
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:25,632
and I know he took a book
from her that belongs to me.

219
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:30,081
- I'd like it back.
- What's so special about this book?

220
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:32,543
Well, unless it has directions
out of this prison,

221
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,510
I don't think it should
really matter to you.

222
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:38,250
You don't know what
matters to me.

223
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,432
You can get that book back
when we get out of Sona.

224
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:43,110
Oh, yeah?
And when the hell is that exactly?

225
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:46,142
Because so far I haven't seen bollocks
in the way of breaking out of here.

226
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:48,911
Okay. Let me tell you
what I know so far.

227
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:52,870
Some very bad people who have
done some very bad things

228
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:55,750
want you alive and
out of this prison,

229
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:59,102
which is why every bone in my body
is telling me to do the opposite.

230
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:02,533
Then why are you doing it?

231
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:05,310
You're upset because someone
took a book from you.

232
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:09,101
This is what they took from me.
So let's be clear.

233
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:15,520
This is what matters to me,
not you and not your book.

234
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,783
- Hello.
- Cousin, how is it?

235
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:38,681
- Hey, Augusto. You tell me, man.
- Oh, business is cyclical, don dada.

236
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,710
Ebbs and flows.

237
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:44,881
Seems like there's more ebbing
than flowing these days, huh?

238
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:48,181
- You think?
- I'm gonna tell you what I think, man.

239
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:52,040
I think a black heart is
trying to steal my business.

240
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:56,011
Is taking advantage
of my situation.

241
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,951
If there are mistakes have been made,
all I need is some honesty, man.

242
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:01,102
No mistakes, patrón, I swear.

243
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:05,431
Well, maybe the problem
isn't on the outside.

244
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:08,103
Maybe the problem is...

245
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,441
Augusto. Augusto?

246
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,692
Battery dead.

247
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:23,043
The bloodfire!
How me phone come unplugged? Huh?

248
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:26,583
My battery dead.
None of you know nothing, huh?

249
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,502
Mr. Mahone? Raul Darinda.

250
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,670
I am the public defender
appointed to your case.

251
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,473
That's, uh...
uh, that's great, that's great.

252
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:00,252
I've been putting together
some notes that I...

253
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:03,651
- Looks like I have some great news.
- We got you a trial date.

254
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:09,301
That's really... thank God.
Thank God-- when?

255
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,492
June 13.

256
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,541
Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, the...
13th, 13th, that was last week.

257
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:20,443
- What, we missed it?
- June 13 of next year, Mr. Mahone.

258
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,250
Next year.
How the hell is that great news?

259
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,060
It usually takes
two and a half years

260
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:28,491
for a non-citizen to
get before a judge.

261
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,463
I've got a guy in, in here,
his name is Michael Scofield

262
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:34,911
and he will testify
that he set me up

263
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,972
and that he put the
drugs on the boat.

264
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,913
Which will all be taken
into consideration...

265
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,310
A year from now!

266
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:44,891
I'm going to have to ask you
to calm down, Mr. Mahone.

267
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,852
It's open and shut.
It's a no-brainer for you.

268
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:49,353
I got a guy who can cop to...

269
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:52,843
The notion of one inmate taking the
fall for another is not exactly fresh

270
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,963
and usually means someone was
pressured into the confession.

271
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,793
Well, here's the thing, Raul.

272
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:02,231
I require a certain
medication that they,

273
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:06,771
well, they just don't provide here,
and I am...

274
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:12,950
Let's just say that it would
be good for everybody if, um,

275
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:17,632
- if I got this medication.
- Is that a threat?

276
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:21,543
No. No, it's a reality,
it's, it's...

277
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,360
It's called Varatril
and if you...

278
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,310
Look, if you are asking me to smuggle
drugs into this prison, then...

279
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:30,122
No, no, I'm not...
I'm not asking you to smuggle it.

280
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,161
- If you could get...
- Good luck, Mr. Mahone.

281
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:33,701
So... Wait, you son of a bitch!

282
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:05,942
- Uh, boss, it's almost 2:00.
- All right.

283
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,261
You want your cell
phone, brother?

284
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:16,230
No, just be a half hour.
Leave it for charge.

285
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:35,241
You got 30 minutes
until he gets back.

286
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:38,051
If that phone ain't back on the cradle,
we're both dead, you hear me?

287
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,921
'Cause my Alabama ass is
not going down alone.

288
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,913
- Yeah?
- Tell Sara to call me at this number.

289
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:46,541
All right, but this Susan chick,
she hasn't even agreed to it yet, man.

290
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:47,380
What?

291
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:50,492
I only have 25 minutes
with this phone, Linc.

292
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:53,840
I'm meeting her right now, but listen,
Santa Rita ain't a one-horse town.

293
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:56,731
I hope that Sara can give
us some kind of clue as to where...

294
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:59,040
Just get her on the line.
Just get her on the line, okay?

295
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,992
- This is a one-shot deal.
- Yeah, I know, man.

296
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:06,633
- 23 minutes.
- I'm nearly there.

297
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,720
Hey, looks like we got off
on the wrong foot here.

298
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm not a violent guy.
It's just that I need that shoe.

299
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:30,072
I can't hardly walk, and this place--
it changes people.

300
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:34,563
Oh, I never even got your name.

301
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:39,760
- Pistachio.
- Pistachio? Now, that's just...

302
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:43,392
- That's a beautiful name.
- What you want then?

303
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:47,250
Well, I was hoping we could make
some kind of a deal. Trade.

304
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,981
The only thing sell,
me no want to buy.

305
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:52,723
I like me men a little more...
How you say, uh... ?

306
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:56,381
- Not fat.
- Fat? This is all muscle. And I'd prove it

307
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:58,883
to you if I didn't think you'd take
things south of the border.

308
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:02,312
Now, hold on. This is a negotiation.
You don't have to...

309
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:05,423
I no gonna cut you.
I got clients.

310
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:06,640
Get.

311
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:11,152
Welcome, patrón.
I'm so honored to have you.

312
00:23:11,436 --> 00:23:12,891
Let's make this quick.

313
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,090
- Where the hell have you been?
- A girl's got to look her best.

314
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:25,110
- This ain't a game, sister.
- You'd better back the hell up.

315
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:28,371
It's becoming pretty clear you need us,
so stop pretending you're in charge,

316
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,390
and give us what we
want when we want it.

317
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:32,632
Starting with the
damn phone call.

318
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:44,000
- Hello?
- It's me.

319
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:48,233
- How are you?
- I'm tired. Where...?

320
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,000
- Where are you?
- It's a long story.

321
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:54,631
As it turns out,
I don't appear to be going anywhere.

322
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:59,351
I know. I know.
I'm working on that.

323
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:04,082
Listen, Sara, I miss how we used
to talk. Do you remember...

324
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,583
How we used to talk?

325
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:09,050
- Yes.
- Oh, good.

326
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,440
Good, because I saw
your picture totay,

327
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,171
and I want you to
know I understand...

328
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:17,372
I understand the
difficult place you're in.

329
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:21,443
Michael, listen, I...
I don't want you to think like that.

330
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:26,022
- Why is that?
- You have to know it's a lost cause.

331
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:31,030
LJ and I-- we can see it now.

332
00:24:31,825 --> 00:24:38,313
- It's a lost cause. Do you understand?
- No, no. No, I... I don't. I don't.

333
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,290
Help me understand.
Help me understand.

334
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:44,343
All I can think of to help is,
maybe you just need more time?

335
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,060
It's like... It's like they're
giving you until midnight,

336
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:50,273
and I'm sitting
here at 3:00 a.m.

337
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:52,810
They're saying I
have to hang up.

338
00:24:53,328 --> 00:24:56,582
- Sara, I love you.
- I love you, too.

339
00:24:56,865 --> 00:25:00,931
Sara? Sara?!

340
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:10,761
Linc, they were
never in Santa Rita.

341
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:12,422
- What?
- She said it was a lost cause.

342
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,583
She said she could see
it was a lost cause.

343
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:15,370
So?

344
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:17,992
The patron saint of lost
causes is Saint Rita.

345
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:19,483
She was never telling
us where they were.

346
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,970
She was telling us what they
could see from where they were.

347
00:25:22,005 --> 00:25:24,492
He's on his way. We need to get
that phone back, like, rapido.

348
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:25,993
- One more thing, Linc.
- Come on, Pretty!

349
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,170
Stall them!

350
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:32,891
She said, it's like they were
giving us until midnight,

351
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:36,263
- but she was sitting at 3:00 a.m.
- What the hell does that mean?

352
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:38,552
I don't know.
Maybe they're near a clock or something.

353
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:42,390
That's all I got.
Listen, I got to go. It's up to you.

354
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,233
Leave him alone, huh?

355
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:16,803
Lechero!

356
00:26:18,346 --> 00:26:19,870
There's something
you should know.

357
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:21,463
What?

358
00:26:33,497 --> 00:26:35,232
I think that barber
might have...

359
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,770
Uh... cut me?

360
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:46,683
Hmm. No. No. My mistake. I...

361
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:51,523
In fact, that there might just be
the best shave I have ever seen.

362
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:54,542
Boy, you look like
you need one today.

363
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,091
I might just do that.

364
00:26:56,276 --> 00:26:59,011
Can't be walking around,
looking all, uh, bhuttu.

365
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,293
Butu.

366
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:13,501
¿Que paso, jefe?

367
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:43,941
Who is this?

368
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:53,502
Find out everything you
can about this number.

369
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:58,000
Yo!

370
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:02,313
Don't move.

371
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,822
I want to know what the hell
you're doing to James Whistler.

372
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:06,331
I'm doing nothing
to James Whistler.

373
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,041
Listen, we're on the same team,
all right?

374
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,643
Take it easy. Just...

375
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:13,413
Put the knife away.
Put the knife away.

376
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,662
Put... the knife away.

377
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,302
We're not on the same team.

378
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:21,701
You want your boy out of Sona,
right? Right?

379
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:22,641
Of course.

380
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:25,213
Well, I'm one of the guys
who's going to break him out.

381
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,312
No. I talked to him this morning.
He has a lawyer.

382
00:28:29,347 --> 00:28:31,211
I don't know what he's told you,
or who he is.

383
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:33,233
- I know who he is.
- Right. A fisherman

384
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:34,970
that people want out so badly

385
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,423
they're willing to kidnap
my son to get him.

386
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:43,651
Listen, you need to talk to him.
You need to talk to him.

387
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,502
Where to, my friend?

388
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:55,333
I'm looking for a statue, a monument.
Uh, Santa, Santa Rita.

389
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:58,020
- The lady of the lost causes.
- Yeah, that's it.

390
00:28:58,157 --> 00:29:01,090
The red light district.
You looking to party?

391
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:02,073
Yeah.

392
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:15,871
- You all right?
- What do you want?

393
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,552
Let you know you don't
have to watch your back.

394
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:21,192
Make sure I don't
have to watch mine.

395
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,311
My head was a free
ticket out of here.

396
00:29:23,918 --> 00:29:27,312
I don't begrudge anyone who did what
they had to do to try and get it.

397
00:29:27,697 --> 00:29:28,962
Besides...

398
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:36,411
...you never know when you'll
need a friend in this place.

399
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:41,442
Where are you from?

400
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:45,553
Boardman, Ohio.

401
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,612
- Kalbarri.
- Australia. Good fishing.

402
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:51,951
- You've been?
- Passed through.

403
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:54,633
Small world.

404
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:57,911
What the hell are
you doing in Panama?

405
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:01,792
I'm not really in the mood.

406
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,253
You're that cop, are you?

407
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:08,730
You know,
I was looking at that Scofield.

408
00:30:08,748 --> 00:30:11,031
I was trying to figure why he
looked so bloody familiar.

409
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:12,762
Then, just now,
hearing your voice,

410
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:15,100
I remember watching the press
when that first happened.

411
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:16,950
And now you're in
here together.

412
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:18,322
Small world.

413
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:24,843
You trying to get him out of here?
Extradition or what?

414
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,573
I'm not really in that
line of work anymore.

415
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:32,441
- What's he all about?
- Scofield. I mean, is he dangerous?

416
00:30:34,578 --> 00:30:36,082
What's it to you?

417
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:38,402
Just curious...

418
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:41,411
as to what kind of
chap I'm dealing with.

419
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,343
I guess that depends on why
you'd be dealing with him.

420
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:48,210
Like I said...

421
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,990
- you never know when you'll...
- Need a friend.

422
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:52,972
Yeah.

423
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:56,073
See, one thing about
Scofield is that,

424
00:30:56,177 --> 00:30:59,570
for those that he cares about,
he'll do just about anything.

425
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,682
But he'll screw you three
ways to Sunday if he doesn't.

426
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,143
I can guess which
side you ended up on.

427
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:09,140
Well...

428
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:14,753
Thanks for the chat.

429
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,492
You know,
I really just came by...

430
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,411
No, you came by 'cause you wanted
to find out more about Scofield,

431
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:23,581
but that's cool.
We're squared away.

432
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:37,132
There. She is there.

433
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:40,132
That the only thing about
Saint Rita in this town?

434
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:43,282
That I do not know, my friend.

435
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,580
Excuse me? Is there a clock around here?
A clock, uh...

436
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:04,992
No. No comprendo.

437
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,081
Excuse me?
Have you seen these people?

438
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:11,762
- No, senor.
- Huh? No?

439
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:17,530
Clock.

440
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:20,291
Clock. Clock.

441
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,901
She said, it's like they were
giving us until midnight.

442
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:32,500
Give us till 12.

443
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,402
But she was sitting
at 3:00 a.m.

444
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,520
Three...

445
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:42,432
Sara.

446
00:32:58,327 --> 00:32:59,172
Dad!

447
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:12,922
LJ!

448
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:14,653
LJ!

449
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,930
LJ! Sara!

450
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:36,813
Hello?

451
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:39,450
They made a move.
Burrows made a move.

452
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,712
When?

453
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:49,181
It was the right place.
I just couldn't get to it in time.

454
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,582
Did you see them?
Do they look all right?

455
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,403
As far as I could tell, yeah.

456
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,583
You can keep that.

457
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:59,271
Keep it as a souvenir and give it
to Sara when this is all done.

458
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:04,892
Michael, we can do this.

459
00:34:04,938 --> 00:34:07,232
They wouldn't have gone to all
this trouble to put you in here

460
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:08,721
if it wasn't
possible to get out.

461
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:11,040
We can do this.

462
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:13,242
We can do it.

463
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,112
I think we need to talk.

464
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:44,991
Your friend,
the one in the picture,

465
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:46,703
you say she's the
reason you're here?

466
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:49,142
Then we have
something in common.

467
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:54,331
The woman your brother met on
the outside, her name is Sofia.

468
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,112
She's the reason I'm here.

469
00:34:58,907 --> 00:35:01,553
Well, unless this Sofia is
being held at gunpoint,

470
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:04,760
we got nothing in common.
But maybe you can start by telling me

471
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:06,641
why the Company's so
interested in you.

472
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:07,911
What company?

473
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:12,812
I don't have time for games.

474
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:20,943
Okay, okay, look. Look,
I've been splitting time between here

475
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,021
and the Pacific Northwest
running charters.

476
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,953
- Fishing?
- Fishing, sightseeing--

477
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,831
whatever was paying
the bloody rent.

478
00:35:27,018 --> 00:35:29,993
Now, about a year ago, I took a guy out.
He was some sort of naturalist.

479
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:32,421
He was, uh... he was taking
water samples, measurements.

480
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,041
- What for?
- I don't know.

481
00:35:34,328 --> 00:35:36,322
I didn't really care as
long as the check cleared,

482
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:38,030
but here's the thing.
A few months later,

483
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:40,600
I get a call from somebody wanting
to know where I took the guy.

484
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:42,850
And I told them I
couldn't remember.

485
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,003
But then these, um...

486
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:47,863
then these government types,

487
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:50,271
they started showing up at
my flat asking questions,

488
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:51,962
and I didn't know what to do.

489
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:54,703
So I got low,
I came down to Panama,

490
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:57,480
and I moved in with
Sofia full time. Until...

491
00:35:57,627 --> 00:35:58,893
Until the fight at the bar.

492
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:02,201
Yeah, and then I end up here,
where those same people show up

493
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:04,651
at visitation saying
they're going to get me out.

494
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:08,102
And when they do, I'm to take them to
the same place that I took that guy.

495
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:11,403
That's why I need the book your
brother copped. It's my trip log.

496
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:13,970
I write notes in the margins,
you know, coordinates, landmarks.

497
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,002
I need to retrace my steps and find
that location. I don't have a choice.

498
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:18,480
That's a really
interesting story,

499
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:20,603
but if that book's as
valuable as you say it is,

500
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:22,590
maybe I should hold onto
it for a little while,

501
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,340
make sure they hold up
their end of the deal.

502
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:26,912
- You don't get this, do you?
- I need time to be able to...

503
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:29,793
The only thing I'm responsible
for is getting you out of here.

504
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,973
Whatever's between you and
them is between you and them.

505
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,140
I'm sorry.

506
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:38,171
All right.

507
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,642
Do you have any idea how
we're going to do this?

508
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:44,110
All I keep hearing is how no
one gets out of this place.

509
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:48,213
I think I've heard
that one before.

510
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:54,472
The sugarcane's so sweet.

511
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:56,923
The mangoes' so sweet,
the women so...

512
00:36:57,528 --> 00:37:00,031
Well, if it isn't
the entertainer.

513
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:02,602
- How about a joke for us, boy?
- Not now, fellas, I got to get...

514
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:04,461
Why don't you do a little
dance for us, huh?

515
00:37:04,496 --> 00:37:07,273
How about a little jig, huh?
Maybe you need an extra hand?

516
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:12,861
- You got me.
- Yeah, that's right.

517
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:16,831
I do get you, boy. You might've fooled
him, but you're not fooling me.

518
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:33,763
- Excuse me, boss.
- I asked you for privacy.

519
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:37,300
Just came in here to, to...
thank you

520
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:40,182
for giving me a hand up in here,
but if it's all the same,

521
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:42,532
I'd just like to be
relieved of my duties.

522
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,032
- What are you talking about?
- There's some, um...

523
00:37:45,637 --> 00:37:49,851
loyalty issues going on,
and I do not want to end up

524
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,310
torn between my fidelity to you

525
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:54,293
and the reality of having
to keep my nose clean.

526
00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:57,291
I've been around long enough to know
that when the dominoes start falling,

527
00:37:57,326 --> 00:37:59,973
it's the new guy that gets
blamed for bumping the table.

528
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:03,531
You better stop spinning
and start talking straight.

529
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:06,221
No! I ain't no rat.

530
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:10,293
I'm not asking you to be...
a rat.

531
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,972
I'm asking you to
be a friend, huh?

532
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:18,090
- As I've been with you.
- Okay.

533
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,823
I was walking earlier,
and I heard some voices talking about,

534
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,033
"To hell with Lechero.
I want my cut."

535
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:31,900
Now, I couldn't tell who it was,
but when I got around the corner,

536
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:35,662
I recognized the faces-- the very
same faces I've seen in this room.

537
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,310
Now, I got nothing
to gain here, okay?

538
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:42,653
I'm a nobody with no
hope of being anyone.

539
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:49,851
But those that surround you have
everything to gain if you fall.

540
00:38:54,556 --> 00:38:56,812
I hope this makes us even.

541
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,512
But what I've given you...

542
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:02,950
can't be repaid with one favor.

543
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:12,503
So I deny your request,
and you're going to stay on as my ears.

544
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:17,381
You'll report back to me everything
you hear when I'm not around.

545
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:58,763
- How've you been, Michael?
- Better than some, apparently.

546
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:00,793
You know, it's interesting how

547
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,223
you don't seem rattled at all
by our current accommodations.

548
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,252
Could it be because maybe you're not
planning on being in them much longer?

549
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,970
It's like I told you before, Alex,
this is the end of the line...

550
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,480
- for both of us.
- How about this?

551
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,021
You stop me when I'm wrong.

552
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:16,382
The Company wanted you
here in Panama alive,

553
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:18,882
but framed for murder,
and then for some strange reason,

554
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:21,400
you seemed to really care about
the fate of this Whistler guy,

555
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:24,182
and I got to tell you something,
he's really curious about you, too.

556
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:26,690
Let's see, what special talents
do you have that the Company

557
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,623
might make the decision that you're
worth more to them alive than dead?

558
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,912
What do you say there, Mike?
Am I getting warm yet?

559
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:34,870
I think you better pop another pill,
'cause that's crazy.

560
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,982
Oh, so you don't mind if
I kill him? Whistler?

561
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,552
I think the question is,
"What would the Company mind?"

562
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:44,463
The question is,
"What would they do to you?"

563
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:46,362
To the ones you love?

564
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,122
Be careful, Alex.

565
00:40:52,605 --> 00:41:52,281
- Yeah?
- Busy day?

566
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:56,931
- Not as busy as I'd hoped.
- Look, you had to try.

567
00:41:57,065 --> 00:41:59,760
I probably would've done the
same thing myself if I were you.

568
00:42:00,415 --> 00:42:02,392
But let's be perfectly clear.

569
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:05,363
You're never going to try
anything like that again.

570
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:07,703
I understand.

571
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:11,121
Yeah, but just to make
sure that you do,

572
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:13,432
I left you a little
something in the garage.

573
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:15,311
It's by the trash.
