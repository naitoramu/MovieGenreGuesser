It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther
Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.

16

King of the Britons,
defeater of the Saxons.

17

Sovereign of all England!

00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,922
I am, and this is my
trusty servant, Patsy.

20
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,801
We have ridden the length of
the land in search of knights

21
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,307
who will join me in
my court at Camelot.

22
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,851
I must speak with
your lord and master.

23
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,603
What? Ridden on a horse?

24
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,771
Yes.

25
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,018
You're using coconuts!

26
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,144
What?

27
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,151
You've got two
empty halves of coconut,

28
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,148
and you're
banging them together.

29
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:19,157
So? We have ridden since the snows
of winter covered this land.

30
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,405
Through the Kingdom of Mercia.

31
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,282
Where did you get the coconuts?

32
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,537
We found them.

33
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,870
Found them? In Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.

34
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,663
What do you mean?

35
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,998
Well, this is a temperate zone.

36
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,459
The swallow may fly
south with the sun,

37
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,822
or the house
martin or the plover

38
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,970
may seek warmer
climes in winter,

39
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,215
yet these are not
strangers to our land.

40
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,593
Are you suggesting
coconuts migrate?

41
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,095
Not at all.
They could be carried.

42
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,099
What? A swallow
carrying a coconut?

43
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,058
It could grip it by the husk.

44
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,728
It's not a question
of where he grips it.

45
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,231
It's a simple
question of weight ratio.

46
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,865
A five-ounce bird could not
carry a one-pound coconut.

47
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,787
It doesn't matter.
Go tell your master

48
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,911

Camelot is here.

50

Please! Am I right?

52
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,304
I'm not interested.

53
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,469
GUARD 2: It could be carried
by an African swallow.

54
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,430
GUARD 1: Oh, yes!
An African swallow, maybe.

55
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,804
Not a European swallow.
That's my point.

56
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,184
I agree with that.

57
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:32,609
Will you ask your master if he
wants to join my court at Camelot?

58
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,613
But then, of course, African
swallows are non-migratory.

59
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,235
GUARD 2: Oh, yes.

60
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,903
They couldn't bring
a coconut, anyway.

61
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,162
GUARD 3: Wait a minute! Supposing
two swallows carried it together?

62
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,949
GUARD 4: No, they'd
have to have it on a line.

63
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,496

use a strand of creeper.

were called Dennis.

woman," but from behind...

King? Very nice.

120
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,339
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!

121
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,173
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates

122
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,255

differences in our society!

Who are the Britons?

132
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,190
We all are. We're all Britons.
And I am your king.

133
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,278
Didn't know we had a king.

134
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,110
I thought we were
an autonomous collective.

135
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,072

living in a dictatorship.

in which the working class...

142

143
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,388
We don't have a lord. What?

144
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,637
I told you. We're an
anarcho-syndicalist commune.

145
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,270
We take turns to act as a sort of
executive officer for the week.

146
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,346
Yes.

147
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,897
But all
the decisions of that officer

148
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,941
are ratified at
a biweekly meeting.

149
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,017
Yes, I see.

150
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,320
By a majority in
the case of internal affairs.

151
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,396
Be quiet!

152
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,607
By a two-thirds
majority in the case of...

153
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,904
Be quiet!
I order you to be quiet.

154
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,411
"Order."
Who does he think he is?

155
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,745
I am your king!

156
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,121
I didn't vote for you.

157
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,994
You don't vote for kings.

158
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,709
How did you become king then?

159
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,250
The Lady of the Lake,
her arm clad

160
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,206
in the purest
shimmering samite,

161
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,419
held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water,

162
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,466
signifying,
by divine providence,

163
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,924
that I, Arthur,
was to carry Excalibur.

164
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,971
That is why I'm your king!

165
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,020
Listen. Strange women
lying in ponds,

166
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,563
distributing swords,
is no basis

167
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,938
for a system of government.
Supreme executive power

168
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,270
derives from
a mandate from the masses.

169
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,613
Not from some
farcical aquatic ceremony.

170
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,780
Be quiet!

171
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,985
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power

172
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,661
'cause some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

173
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,954
Shut up!

174
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,998
If I went around
saying I was an emperor

175
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,201
because some
moistened bint had lobbed

176
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,332
a scimitar at me,
they'd put me away!

177
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,455
Will you shut up?

178
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,540
See the violence

01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,967
Did you say "shrubberies"?

1064
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,430
Yes.

1065
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,558
Shrubberies are my trade.
I am a shrubber.

1066
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:09,235
My name is Roger the Shrubber. I
arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

1067
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:11,065
Ni!

1068
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:12,233
No!

1069
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,200
Knights of Ni, we have
brought you your shrubbery.

1070
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,366
May we go?

1071
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,610
It is a good shrubbery.

1072
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,912
I like
the laurels particularly.

1073
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,157
But there is one small problem.

1074
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,824
What is that?

1075
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:28,879
We are now no longer
the knights who say "Ni."

1076
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,121
Shh! Shh!

1077
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,173
We are now the knights who say,

1078
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,799
"Ekke Ekke Ekke
Ptang Zoo Boing"!

1079
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,798
Therefore,
we must give you a test.

1080
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,510
What is this test, knights who
until recently said "Ni"?

1081
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,391
Firstly, you must find

1082
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,848
another shrubbery!

1083
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,484
Not another shrubbery!

1084
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:55,314
Then you must bring it here
beside this shrubbery.

1085
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:57,195
Higher, so you get
the two-level effect

1086
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,075
with a path going
down the middle.

1087
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,198
OTHERS: A path! A path!

1088
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,407
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies,

1089
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,081
you must cut down the
mightiest tree in the forest

1090
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:12,001
with a herring!

1091
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,921
We shall do no such thing.

1092
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,252
Oh, please.

1093
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:19,463
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

1095
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,091
Don't say that word. What word?

1096
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,176
I cannot tell. Suffice to say,

1097
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,979
it's one of the words
the knights of Ni cannot hear.

1098
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,978
How can we not say the word if
you don't tell us what it is?

1099
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,058
He did it again.

1100
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,184
What? "Ls"?

1101
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,815
No, not "is"! You wouldn't get
very far in life not saying "is."

1102
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,399
