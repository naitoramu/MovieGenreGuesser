1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,535
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,495
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,457
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,588
<i>But I couldn't honor that commitment
and honor the promise</i>

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,340
<i>I made to the mother of my son.</i>

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,342
<i>So I asked the best man I know
to help.</i>

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:19,722
<i>His name is John Diggle and he is
the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,349
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,102
Pollard. She's using last night's
disaster as a pretext

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,560
to introduce her anti-vigilante
legislation to the council.

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,271
I'm invoking chapter nine
of the city charter.

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,652
That would convert
Councilwoman Pollard's bill

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,404
to a citywide referendum.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,484
What do you want?

15
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,785
To operate without interference.

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,371
So you can keep killing people.

17
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,619
You don't seem to know that
this is a war.

18
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,998
The intel that you gave me on my son,
Joe, panned out...

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,290
<i>So I'm heading to Calgary.</i>

20
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,829
Good luck, Slade.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,314
Ms. Pollard, Captain wanted you to
see the latest COMPSTAT.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,186
Thanks, Lieutenant.

23
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,691
Sniper!

24
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,916
Officer down. Code three.

25
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,627
Officer down.

26
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,430
Well, I'm just glad no one
was seriously hurt.

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,765
How do you want to handle this?

28
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,691
I'd like you to
issue a statement on my behalf.

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,938
On your behalf?

30
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,029
I have an old friend in town
that needs my help

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,858
and I might not be back in the office
for a few hours.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,822
<i>Do we have any idea who the shooter
was targeting?</i>

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,901
We're working on it.

34
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,871
Good. Be the Mayor until I get back.

35
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,489
For real?

36
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,120
No. It's a figure of speech.

37
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,377
Just don't make any laws while
I'm out of the office, okay?

38
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:11,746
Fine.

39
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,800
And don't worry about the shooter.
We're gonna nail his ass.

40
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,376
I know you will.

41
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,798
Sorry. That was work.

42
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,429
Don't apologize.

43
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,186
I appreciate the meeting.

44
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,139
You helped me find my son.

45
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,815
The least I can do is
help you find Joe.

46
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,855
He doesn't go by that name anymore.

47
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,902
He changed his name?

48
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,405
It was his mother's idea.

49
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,869
Her maiden name.
He goes by "Kane" now.

50
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,904
What happened to him?

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,286
I tracked him to Calgary,
but by then he had gone.

52
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,040
So, I followed him to Ibiza,

53
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,792
and then Mombasa.

54
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,169
Mombasa?

55
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,295
The kid took after his father.

56
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,256
While we were stuck on Lian Yu,

57
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,472
he went down and joined
the Australian Intelligence Service.

58
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,562
And a week ago, in Kasnia,

59
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,059
a mission went south.

60
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,272
He was dealing in arms,
some locals caught him.

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,688
Supposedly, he didn't
have a fair trial and now he's...

62
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,196
Serving a life sentence.

63
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,277
Like a rat in a cage.

64
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,369
Okay, Slade, what do you need?

65
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,713
I need you to help me find my son.

66
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,422
Last we met, you told me
that I couldn't live in two worlds.

67
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,545
I'm not asking you to
come back in.

68
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,434
Strangely enough,
what I need is diplomacy,

69
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,562
which means I don't want Green Arrow,

70
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,605
I need Oliver Queen.

71
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,932
For what?

72
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,481
Can I ask you just to trust me
on this one, kid?

73
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,401
I've organized transport to Kasnia.

74
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,695
Wheels up at 2200.

75
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,242
I'll understand if you don't want
to join me.

76
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,121
But if you do, I'll meet you
out front at 2100.

77
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,330
Okay, kid?

78
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,555
Okay, bring that stuff over here.

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,180
Sorry.

80
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,233
Hey, don't worry.

81
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,152
It's only tent poles.

82
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,315
It's not like we're gonna
stick around long enough to use them.

83
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,865
Why'd you say that?

84
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,449
You're always leaving. I can't
believe we even made it this far.

85
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,535
Listen, you know
that I work for Australian Airlines

86
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,665
and I have to travel.

87
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,375
But I promise you,

88
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,794
this weekend, it's just about
you and me.

89
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,256
Father and son. Out in the wild.

90
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,177
Come on. Go find some flat land,
and pitch a tent.

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,901
Got him.

92
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,569
Well, I didn't get him, get him,
but I've identified him.

93
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,863
- Identified who?
- Our sniper.

94
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,190
I thought your T-Spheres could
track his visor.

95
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,650
Well, that was then.

96
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,911
This is apparently now.
He must have hacked the tracer.

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,204
Or got a new visor.

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,202
It's not like they sell 'em
at Wal-Mart, Felicity.

99
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,750
Guys, update time. I think
our vigilante's back in town.

100
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,918
He's the shooter?

101
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,582
I saw him coming out
of the sniper's nest.

102
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,289
CSU's here.

103
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,333
I don't know how much evidence
we'll be able to pull.

104
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,883
<i>Why don't we work with what we have?</i>

105
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,134
Mainly, the Vigilante seemed to be
targeting Councilwoman Pollard.

106
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,589
"Seemed to be" being
the operative word.

107
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,970
Well, Pollard's the one who's
championing the anti-vigilante bills.

108
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,347
Seems like a guy named "Vigilante"
wouldn't like her much.

109
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,427
<i>Yeah. But martyr her?</i>

110
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,309
That'd get this bill passed faster

111
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,435
than you could say "obstruction."

112
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,522
If it passes, I'm gonna
have to consider arresting myself.

113
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,568
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

114
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,570
You're not SCPD.

115
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,152
No, he's not. And this is not a
federal case.

116
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,074
Still doesn't explain what
John Diggle,

117
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,282
who works personal security for
the mayor, is doing at a crime scene.

118
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,708
I have relevant experience, and

119
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,286
the mayor thought this could use
a fresh set of eyes.

120
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,004
What type of experience?

121
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,582
Sniper.

122
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,251
I don't recall reading that in your
military file.

123
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,304
I'm sorry, tell me again, why you're
reviewing my service jacket?

124
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,761
Mayor Queen didn't
mention he was under investigation?

125
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,433
Of course he did,
it has nothing to do with this.

126
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,431
But you've been working with him
for the past six years.

127
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,846
Which makes us overdue for a chat.

128
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,608
I can wait for a subpoena
if you prefer.

129
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,935
No. I'm an open book.

130
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,232
Step into my office.

131
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,315
Uh-uh.

132
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,816
Private conversation.

133
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,198
Hey, William.

134
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,283
Hi.

135
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,079
How are those
quadratic equations going?

136
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,580
I hate them.

137
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,249
Yeah, those were the days.

138
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,043
Where's your dad?

139
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,172
In his room.

140
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,927
Huh.

141
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,178
Do you remember when our biggest
problem in life

142
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,725
was solving a quadratic equation?

143
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:17,927
Mmm-mmm.

144
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,139
I mean, I never really worried
about them, but no.

145
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,980
Well, now, we have metas crashing
bachelorette parties, so...

146
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,523
Wow. Slade invited you on
a romantic getaway?

147
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,857
Something like that.

148
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,738
Where? Don't say Aruba.
That's our spot.

149
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,743
Kasnia.

150
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,991
Wow!

151
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,414
His son is in some trouble.

152
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,457
The kind of trouble you need
to get in more trouble to fix it?

153
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,503
Well, Slade says that
he has a diplomatic solution

154
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,297
that requires my name
and not me in a mask.

155
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,465
I'm worried that If I don't go,

156
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,167
he will take
a more aggressive approach.

157
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,009
So the empty bag,
is that second thoughts?

158
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,887
Or can't decide what T-shirt to pack?

159
00:07:58,937 --> 00:07:59,927
Because I'm out.

160
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,646
I made a promise to my son and

161
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,939
I'm out.

162
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,687
It sounds like you made a
promise to Slade, too.

163
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,435
You think I should go?

164
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,270
It's not like you're going back to
your old life.

165
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,781
I wanted you to tell me
not to go.

166
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,526
Look, Slade is not
my favorite person, but...

167
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,404
I mean, it's not about Slade.

168
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,657
It's about his son.

169
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,085
If you don't go, you're just gonna
beat yourself up about it.

170
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,754
If, when, it veers from diplomacy,
and I have to break

171
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,255
my promise to William, I will beat
myself up over that too.

172
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,085
- Then tell William what you're doing.
- What?

173
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,716
Spare him the details of,
you know, Slade being Slade

174
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,975
and tell him that you are
helping a friend.

175
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,094
He'll understand that.

176
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,439
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

177
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,899
He's his father's son.

178
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,540
How long is this flight?

179
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,171
It's about 12 hours.

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,181
Thanks for coming, kid.

181
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,593
Let's go get your boy.

182
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,200
SCPD!

183
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,621
<i>Hey!</i>

184
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,882
Stay down.

185
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,771
It's you.

186
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,632
Got your 9-1-1. Is everything okay?

187
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,261
Look at her face.
That is not an "okay" face.

188
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,798
Dinah?

189
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,599
Vigilante made another move on
Councilwoman Pollard tonight.

190
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,097
I almost got him.

191
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,355
It's cool, D.
We'll nail that bastard.

192
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,065
I hit him with my cry.

193
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,149
I shattered his visor
and he took off his mask.

194
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,279
I saw his face.

195
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,654
Can you ID him?

196
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,198
His name is Vincent Sobel.

197
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,378
He's my old partner.

198
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,664
I'm sorry. When you say partner,

199
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,500
do you mean partner,
or do you mean, "partner"?

200
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,584
Both.

201
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,918
Now I'm confused.

202
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,879
Dinah, I thought you said
your partner died in the line.

203
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,975
He was shot in the head
right in front of me.

204
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,355
No!

205
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,317
Okay, well, I know you believe
you saw what you saw tonight,

206
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,400
but it was night, probably dark.

207
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,951
It was him, Felicity.

208
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,203
It was Vincent. I know it.

209
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,581
I know it sounds crazy.

210
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,291
Dinah, this doesn't change anything.

211
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,332
We have to find him before he hurts
anyone else.

212
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,413
I know.

213
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,379
I know. Where are you
with the shell casing John found?

214
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,210
The casing
appears to be magnetized.

215
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,294
Bullets aren't magnetic.

216
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,595
They can be if they are stored
in an environment

217
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,013
with a strong magnetic field.

218
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,516
You think it's something
you can trace?

219
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,726
I like your optimism.

220
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,770
It's not optimism, Felicity.

221
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,184
It's faith.

222
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,940
Dinah said that you had a chat
with our FBI BFF?

223
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,359
Oh, yes. She's tough,

224
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,239
but I pushed back pretty hard.

225
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,319
Can we put that to bed?

226
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,741
Good.

227
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,490
Hello?

228
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,710
Special Agent Watson...

229
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,754
Yes, sure. I can come by tomorrow,
no problem.

230
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,414
All right, see you then.

231
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,671
Definitely not put to bed.

232
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,471
So where's your point of contact?

233
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,673
I don't know.

234
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,554
His name's Nylander.

235
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,014
A foreign associate of mine
from back in the service days.

236
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,767
He was a bit of a jackarse
and never on time.

237
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,641
<i>He's not that bad.</i>

238
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,690
Slade Wilson.

239
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,104
<i>The Terminator.</i>

240
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,231
I haven't heard that name in a while.

241
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,075
So, you're running later than usual.

242
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,577
Yeah, I was with a girl.

243
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,237
Forget about it. Look at you.

244
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,827
Mirakuru did you wonders.

245
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,376
Now what? You're not sensitive
about that shit, are you?

246
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,124
You were quite the madman, I hear.

247
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,881
You promised me something.

248
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,249
Did you bring it?

249
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,135
Or did I waste my time traveling
7,000 miles

250
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,337
for you to screw with me?

251
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,046
Truth be told,

252
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,925
I'm glad you got your marbles back.

253
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,345
So who's this?

254
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,273
He's a friend of mine.
Don't worry about him.

255
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,392
With you, I always worry.

256
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,853
This should work.

257
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,154
Thank you.

258
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,406
That's it? Just thank you?

259
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,654
No extravagant dinner? No pints?

260
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,493
Maybe next time,

261
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,867
when my son's not
rotting in a third world prison.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,491
He's lucky to have you as a father.

263
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,494
My son wouldn't be in this mess,

264
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,246
if anybody else was his father.

265
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,998
Just be careful, comrade.

266
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,547
Your boy was snooping around
some private-op mercenaries.

267
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,219
Some not-so-nice guys.

268
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,676
Under certain circumstances,

269
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,761
I'm not so nice a guy.

270
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,105
Yeah, not so big in the decoration,
are you?

271
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,861
I'm less enthusiastic for people
wasting my time.

272
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,941
Okay.

273
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,618
You're seeing Oliver Queen again.

274
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,947
Yeah. These new prescription glasses
are really working wonders.

275
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,910
Just a little FBI interrogation
humor, you know.

276
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,038
You are Mr. Queen's alibi

277
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,872
for certain evenings where
the Green Arrow is active.

278
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,956
If you say so.

279
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,551
My point is, are you prepared to
testify under oath,

280
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,253
under the pains and penalties
of perjury,

281
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,679
in support of those alibis?

282
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,005
Yeah. Absolutely.

283
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,049
100%.

284
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,592
Super ready.

285
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,353
Everything all right?

286
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,101
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,571
Yeah. I'm just late for
a coffee date.

288
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,824
- So, I'd like to...
- Go.

289
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,359
Go.

290
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,992
Thank you. This was pleasant.

291
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,495
I call this play Liberty Watch.

292
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,256
A famous American mayor comes
to small war-torn Kasnia,

293
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,718
to fight for the release of a man
who has been wrongfully accused.

294
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,215
This is very clever.

295
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,843
<i>Like I said,
it's a "diplomatic solution."</i>

296
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,017
Well, Slade, still. I don't think
that they're gonna free your son,

297
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,311
just because I give him a photo op.

298
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,309
No. The photo op is just
to gain entry.

299
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,978
Of course, they'll need a reason
to release him.

300
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,061
And here are 50,000.

301
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,443
Assuming this works,

302
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,190
where do we meet?

303
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,568
When you pick up Joe,

304
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,489
go straight to the airport.

305
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,659
Here is an alias passport for him

306
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,326
and tickets for you both

307
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,866
to London.

308
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,714
You're not even gonna see him?

309
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,134
I need you to promise me

310
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,090
that you won't tell him I helped.

311
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,176
No. I'm not gonna lie to your son.

312
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,848
It's better this way.

313
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,138
For him or for you?

314
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,724
Wait, are you...

315
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,941
Are you afraid that he's gonna
see you as Deathstroke

316
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,602
and not the man you were? The...

317
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,189
The man I think you are now.

318
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,775
I gave up my right to be his father

319
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,573
when I stepped out of the light

320
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,162
into shadows

321
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,744
and became this monster.

322
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,039
Your son will forgive you

323
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,329
the way that my son forgave me.

324
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,048
Joe knew that I was coming
to look for him

325
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,167
so he contacted his mother

326
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,129
and she sent me a message

327
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,339
to stay away.

328
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,637
You got your second chance, kid.

329
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,936
And I'm happy for you.

330
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,398
Some fathers aren't that lucky.

331
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,447
So tell me this is not the freshest
fish that somebody's caught for you.

332
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,039
I don't even like fish.

333
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,329
Not all fish are the same.

334
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,118
Trust me, kid.

335
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,584
Are you really a pilot?

336
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,419
Of course, I am.

337
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,754
Stop lying.

338
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,007
Why are you being like this?

339
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,512
We never get free trips.

340
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,015
My friend Nick's dad flies
for Ferris Air.

341
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,267
They get free trips all the time.

342
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,604
- Here, honey, keep up.
- Okay.

343
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,658
Unfortunately, I work
for a cheaper airline

344
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,582
that doesn't allow for
free vacations.

345
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,793
Whatever. I'm not hungry.

346
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,384
Don't walk too far.

347
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,182
This place used to house
MRI machines.

348
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,268
We are in the right place.
That's all that matters.

349
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,773
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

350
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,153
How was it with Watson?

351
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,443
Terrifying.

352
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,069
We knew she was planning
a case against Oliver,

353
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,823
but I'm starting to think her net
is widening to include us.

354
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,487
She hasn't contacted me yet.

355
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,117
Wait, why hasn't she?

356
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,539
How about we not worry about this

357
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,709
while we're in the lair
of a psycho-killer?

358
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,161
- Sorry.
<i>- Here.</i>

359
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,342
There's enough ordinance here
for a small war.

360
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,629
You don't need this many bullets
for one councilwoman.

361
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,717
When you called Vince
a psycho-killer, you weren't wrong.

362
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,731
Mr. Queen...

363
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,271
Thank you for taking the time.

364
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,356
It is not every day I meet celebrity.

365
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,653
I'm not famous.

366
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,984
I saw you on news once.

367
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,493
You punched man with camera.

368
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,200
Yup, I sure did.

369
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,534
They also say you are quite good
with bow and arrow.

370
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,711
Oh, don't believe everything
that you see on TV.

371
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,044
Okay, okay.

372
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,383
I understand you are
with organization in hopes to...

373
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,506
To request the release
of one of your prisoners.

374
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,754
Kane Wolfman.

375
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,349
I wish you come earlier.

376
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,571
What're you doing back here?

377
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,613
Where is my son?

378
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,289
There was a...
A fight in the prison yard

379
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,716
that Joe tried to break up.

380
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,637
Someone pushed,
and he hit his head...

381
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,299
He's gone.

382
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,937
He never knew.

383
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,566
Never knew what?

384
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:50,989
That I loved him.

385
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,745
I'm sure he did, Slade.

386
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,330
I don't remember the last time

387
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,164
I told him...

388
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,666
Well, you were his father.

389
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,459
Trust me, he knew.

390
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,017
I should have come with you
to the prison.

391
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,475
I know it wouldn't have
made any difference, but,

392
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,690
at least I could have seen him...

393
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,190
Say goodbye.

394
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,982
Well, you still can.

395
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,660
You can still say goodbye.

396
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,714
Joe! Good catch.

397
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,707
Come on.

398
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,792
We are not here to mope around.

399
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,258
Excuse me,

400
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,228
could you take a photo of
my son and I?

401
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,304
Sure.

402
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,194
I'm Slade.

403
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,274
Darryl. Nice to meet you.

404
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,359
This is my son, Joe.

405
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,785
- Hey, Joe.
- Nice to meet you.

406
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,750
Don't burn yourself out, Dinah.

407
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,429
We need you
for the long haul, remember?

408
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,721
There's no long haul.
We're putting this bastard down.

409
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,053
Remember, this bastard was
your partner and your boyfriend.

410
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,933
I don't need you
to remind me of that, thanks.

411
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,516
No, you don't need me
to remind you of that.

412
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,272
But you do need someone
to point out the fact

413
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,570
that perhaps a part of you
should be happy to have him back.

414
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,817
John, when Vince died, I did
my absolute best to kill myself.

415
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,285
I became somebody
I didn't even recognize.

416
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,863
To avenge somebody

417
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,448
who I don't even recognize anymore.

418
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,828
Somebody who kills innocent people.

419
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,830
You and Vince went through
something horrific.

420
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,661
You some did things you regret.

421
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,872
Maybe there's a part of you
that's putting that on him.

422
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,377
John, he's a psychopath.

423
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,800
It doesn't change the fact that
he's someone who needs help, Dinah.

424
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,627
Just like you did.

425
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,475
Sorry to interrupt, but we've got
two new problems.

426
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,723
Pollard's headed over
to do a sit-down with Channel 52

427
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,645
to talk about
the anti-vigilante referendum.

428
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,223
Wait, no, that station is not secure.

429
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,649
SCPD cannot protect her there.

430
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,271
That's why I said
we've got a problem.

431
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,478
- What's the second one?
- Agent Watson's subpoenaed me.

432
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,313
I gotta go right?

433
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,945
Yeah. That's usually what
a subpoena means. You have to go.

434
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,276
Well, I'm gonna head
to the news station,

435
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,361
see if I can get Pollard
some extra protection.

436
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:37,118
- Dinah, if Vince tries anything...
- I know, John, I got it.

437
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,496
Mr. Queen, I was not expecting
a return visit.

438
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,548
Warden, this is
Kane Wolfman's father.

439
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,213
He wishes to see his son's body.

440
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,049
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

441
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,342
Why?

442
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,014
You said he passed only days ago.

443
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,562
- Yes, but...
- Warden. Where's the body?

444
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,393
It is no longer in my possession.

445
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,570
Where is my son's body?

446
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,940
Hey. Easy. Easy.

447
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,110
He's lying.

448
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,663
Do you want me to contact
Liberty Watch?

449
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,703
Do you want me to cause
an international incident?

450
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,000
Because I'm prepared to do both.

451
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,043
The situation is complicated.

452
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,540
- Well, un-complicate it.
- Hey.

453
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,332
Trust me on this one.

454
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,593
Don't make this man angry.

455
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,512
They're called the Jackals.

456
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,349
The men your son investigated.

457
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,064
When they discovered his arrest,
which was merely him being

458
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,812
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

459
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,235
they broke into prison.
Take him.

460
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,938
Why did they take him?

461
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:57,449
Torture. Your son is spy.
In his head, secrets worth millions.

462
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,078
They threatened reprisal on my family
if I spoke about it.

463
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,497
Slade. Slade.

464
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,955
When the Jackals took my son, they
didn't count on who his father was.

465
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,308
Okay. Every single person
in that line is ID'd twice.

466
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,976
You got it? I don't care
if it's your mother.

467
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,928
And I want two officers
at every emergency exit

468
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,184
and I need somebody
to move this car.

469
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,234
Lieutenant Drake.
Good to see you again.

470
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,861
All right. We're nearly ready to move
on the news station.

471
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:40,991
Dinah's already on site.

472
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,655
Copy.

473
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:44,991
Emailing Oliver?

474
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,245
Yeah, I'm just sending Oliver
some info he asked me for.

475
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,751
You know, for his adventures
with Slade.

476
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,712
Are you having as much trouble with
Oliver working with Slade as I am?

477
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,792
No.

478
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,298
Having a lot more.

479
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,016
Rationally, I know that it was the
Mirakuru that made him a jerk, but...

480
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,139
But he wasn't on Mirakuru
when he left us on Lian Yu.

481
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,219
Exactly.

482
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,806
It's ironic that Oliver has more
honor than the man he's helping.

483
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,516
Ironic isn't the word I would use.

484
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,567
<i>Guys, we've got a problem.</i>

485
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,019
If I had a nickel for every time
I heard that...

486
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,447
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
stand down. Okay? Do not come here.

487
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,819
Dinah, we're not standing down.

488
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,991
We are not leaving you
out there alone.

489
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,319
I'm not alone.

490
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,409
<i>Agent Watson is here.
And she brought friends.</i>

491
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,365
She's hoping
the Green Arrow will show up.

492
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,830
But you guys stay put, okay?
I got this.

493
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,843
I asked Felicity for any intel
she could find on the Jackals.

494
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,763
She hacked the databases of every
major intelligence agency

495
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,839
in the world.

496
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,641
- And what did she find?
- Nothing.

497
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,389
These guys are ghosts.

498
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,645
That's no help.

499
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,768
This is.

500
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,599
Using closed circuits cameras
in the prison

501
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,355
and surrounding areas,
she got their escape route,

502
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,233
the license plates and then
using keyhole satellite technology...

503
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,814
She tracked them to one location.

504
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:58,898
Yes. She did.

505
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,984
She's brilliant. How did you get her?

506
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,907
I ask myself that every day.

507
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,866
What's in there for me?

508
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,581
Nothing.

509
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,708
I promised you. Your only part
in this was talking.

510
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,380
Circumstances have changed.

511
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,541
Not for you.

512
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,922
You've got your feet
planted in one world.

513
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,594
- And you should keep them there.
- Slade!

514
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,672
These Jackals are the best
of the worst.

515
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,882
All right?
They're stone-cold killers.

516
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,392
And what do you think I am?

517
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,015
I think that you're outnumbered.

518
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,640
And quite frankly, I think
that you're out of practice

519
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,896
and I am not letting you
do this alone.

520
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,413
Alone is what I do best, kid.

521
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,285
Go ahead.

522
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,623
Tell me the truth.

523
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,798
Not bad.

524
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,857
I have to go to the bathroom.

525
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,564
I'll be back soon.

526
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,954
You are Xien Ming, an agent
for the Ministry of Defense,

527
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,583
People's Republic.

528
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,507
I'm looking for an agent
who you black-bagged.

529
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:40,966
Called Yao Fei.

530
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,971
You have 10 seconds
to tell me where he is.

531
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,797
Purgatory.

532
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,780
Hey. He's with me.

533
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,616
Excuse me. He's with me.
Let him through.

534
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,124
You guys can make sure that perimeter
is secure over on the side there.

535
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,543
I thought I told you to stand down.

536
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,962
Don't worry.
I left the hoodie at home.

537
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,040
Well, then, what are you doing here,
John? I told you I got it.

538
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,294
But I realized, you're not exactly
in your right head.

539
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,129
My head is fine.

540
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,465
Thank you. Your little pep talk
really got through to me.

541
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,759
Dinah, you're a lousy liar.

542
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,186
He didn't always make bullets.

543
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,771
Vince.

544
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,034
He used to make this matchbox art,

545
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,989
with a tiny little paper rose
on the inside.

546
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,709
He made me one the morning
Sonos found out we were undercover.

547
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,258
There is nothing left of that man
anymore, John.

548
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,630
Dinah, earlier this year,
when he attacked Oliver's limo,

549
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,429
he had the chance to kill you,
and he didn't.

550
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,596
- Your point?
- My point is

551
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,720
that maybe there's something
left of the man you used to love.

552
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,385
If there isn't,

553
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,271
I'm going to put him down.

554
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,941
And this time, he'll stay dead.

555
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,277
- Dinah, will you just...
- You better get out of here,

556
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,941
before Watson sees you.

557
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,484
Three. Two.

558
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,196
Good evening. I'm Jane Wood.

559
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,826
Sitting tonight
with Miss Emily Pollard.

560
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,708
- Welcome, Councilwoman Pollard.
- It's my pleasure.

561
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,747
<i>And we're going to hear thoughts
on the anti-vigilante referendum.</i>

562
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,456
Status?

563
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,833
Pretty quiet, Lieutenant.

564
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,298
The place is locked tight.
He's not getting in here.

565
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,190
What we need is legislation
to deter others

566
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,938
from joining this vigilante movement
in the future.

567
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,903
We need to take those vigilantes
off the streets.

568
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,692
You don't think they serve a role?

569
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,115
Cops serve that role.

570
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,443
The department's been full of
corrupt cops in the past.

571
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,202
And on top of that,
we're shorthanded.

572
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,325
All I know, Lieutenant,

573
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,328
is if people take the law
into their own hands,

574
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,996
we've got anarchy.

575
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,584
<i>John, can we have the lights
back up, please?</i>

576
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,664
Guys, check the power!

577
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,815
Don't move and it'll be quick.

578
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,018
Killing me won't prevent
the referendum from passing.

579
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,816
If anything, it'll make sure it does.

580
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,068
But there will be one less
corrupt politician.

581
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,777
Run!

582
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,031
Let's talk, Vince.

583
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,033
Just talk.

584
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,284
<i>Freeze!</i>

585
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,832
Get down on the floor.

586
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,422
- You have three seconds.
- Easy.

587
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,960
One. Two.

588
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,511
- Put the gun down.
- Three.

589
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,722
Call an ambulance.

590
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,141
Do it now!

591
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,786
How?

592
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,292
You're not the only one
dark matter did something to.

593
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,681
Everything heals now.

594
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,176
I thought you were dead.

595
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,689
You let me believe it
for four years, Vince.

596
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,434
I'm sorry. I couldn't let myself...

597
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,518
Be human?

598
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:10,728
Distracted.

599
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,231
Distracted? From what?

600
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,486
My mission.

601
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,953
We were cops for 10 years.

602
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,080
What did we ever accomplish?

603
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,449
A lot.

604
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,825
Not enough.

605
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,541
Not nearly enough.

606
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,797
This is the only way.

607
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,262
You've lost your mind.

608
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,423
I'm not the only one wearing a mask.

609
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,761
The police are coming.

610
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,513
And the FBI.

611
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,393
You should go.

612
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,864
<i>Black Canary, what's happening?</i>

613
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,322
- We're getting reports that...
- Pollard's safe. She's secure.

614
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,489
What about Vigilante?

615
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,201
He got away.

616
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:52,288
Hey, buddy.

617
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,254
I just wanna check in.
Is this a bad time?

618
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,547
It's never a bad time.

619
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,046
Are you coming home?

620
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,430
As a matter of fact, I am.

621
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,258
I wish you were here already.

622
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,810
Raisa's been making me eat granola
all weekend.

623
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,935
Raisa knows her stuff.
Granola's good for you.

624
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,976
Were you able to help your friend?

625
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:18,564
No, I wasn't.

626
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,859
I really hope he finds his son.

627
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:23,986
Yeah.

628
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,863
I do, too.

629
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,870
<i>Is there anything else you can do
for him?</i>

630
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,622
War.

631
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,711
Who's in charge?

632
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,543
Stop it, stop.

633
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,845
Damn it, Slade. You're going to ruin
my new shoes.

634
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,185
And I just bought them, brother.

635
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,053
Nylander.

636
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,062
This man is a legend.

637
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,060
So no pulling triggers...

638
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,145
Yet.

639
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,410
Truce? Let me explain.

640
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,296
I knew you'd be involved, Nylander.

641
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,917
But you're too stupid to run
this organization.

642
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,755
So, where's the boss?

643
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:52,093
You know, I had really hoped
prison would be your dead end.

644
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,969
But no.

645
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,056
You just had to keep on coming,

646
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,140
didn't you?

647
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,069
We've got a great thing
going here, Slade.

648
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,945
Lots of killing. Lots of money.

649
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:09,949
And your son, what he knows?
Priceless.

650
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,738
You like burning bridges.

651
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,709
So says the man who nearly
burnt down a whole city.

652
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,377
Be smarter than that, comrade.

653
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,970
Where is my son?

654
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,393
Why do you ask?

655
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,474
Hmm?

656
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,815
Do you wish to join him?

657
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,658
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah.

658
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,036
Just close this up.

659
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,675
Busy night.

660
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,053
Yeah.

661
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,940
Guess we're lucky you and your agents
were there to provide backup.

662
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,065
Councilwoman Pollard says she was
saved by the new Black Canary.

663
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,941
Mmm. Yeah, I heard that.

664
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,313
Helluva thing.

665
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,775
Pollard's saved by one
of the vigilantes she's gunning for.

666
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,028
From what I understand,
it didn't change her position.

667
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,864
What about you?

668
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,500
I try to stay out of politics.

669
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,666
No, I mean where were you tonight?

670
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,839
What do you mean? I was right there.

671
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,259
Not when the lights went out.
When it went dark, you were gone.

672
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,466
And the Black Canary was there.

673
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,548
You think I'm the Black Canary?

674
00:39:56,102 --> 00:40:00,642
I think a lot of things.
But I focus on what I can prove.

675
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,059
Have a good night.

676
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:57,903
I'm curious, Slade.

677
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,659
What was your plan?

678
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,991
Kill us all and save your boy?

679
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,620
Kind of reductive, no?

680
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,746
I like to keep things simple.

681
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,087
Things rarely are, brother.

682
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,920
Well, this is.

683
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,927
I will join the Jackals

684
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,719
as long as you let my boy go.

685
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,938
It's like I said.

686
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,687
Things aren't so simple.

687
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,022
We need your son.

688
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,577
After all, he's our boss.

689
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,120
Hello, Father.

690
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,915
It's been a long time.
