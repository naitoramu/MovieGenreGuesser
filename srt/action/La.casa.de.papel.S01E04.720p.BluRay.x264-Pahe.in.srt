1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:06,121
What happened?

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,721
They blew up a mint vault.

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,401
with the latest printed plates.

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:14,441
It's essential that the police
have no idea what we're doing.

5
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:16,161
What do they want?
- Time

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,321
- They won't come out.
- How do you know?

7
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:21,321
They opened the vault,
but they didn't wanted the money.

8
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,441
They waited for the police.

9
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,801
They fired.

10
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:28,241
They dropped two bags, casually open,

11
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:29,961
dropping the bills down the street.

12
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:33,521
They pretended to be cornered
to win two days of negotiation.

13
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,681
What better plan than to get out of there
with the eight million?

14
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,321
They print their own unmarked money.

15
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:46,001
- We're locked up and
we don't know how long this can last.

16
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,361
As long as you don't try to fool me...

17
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,801
everything will be fine.

18
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,641
I love you, Mónica. I want you
to continue with your pregnancy.

19
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,281
And that we form a family
if we get out of here.

20
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,321
If we get out of here?
There is a way.

21
00:00:57,561 --> 00:01:00,041
Guide the police in the assault.
I have a mobile.

22
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,281
In my office, in my coat.
- I'll go.

23
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,481
Sit down!

24
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,641
Come out.

25
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,521
I don't think it's a good idea for you to abort.

26
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:11,281
- What are you doing, Denver?

27
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,721
Kill her.

28
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,041
Get on your knees.

29
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,881
Say you removed the body. I hide.

30
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,081
There's not a drop of blood.
Shoot me here.

31
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:34,281
We said no victims.
- He had a phone.

32
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:35,961
What did you want? A spanking?

33
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:37,801
- Scare the shit out of her, not kill her.

34
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:39,321
- What's going on here?

35
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,641
Berlín had a hostage executed.
- Who was it?

36
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:43,601
Your son.

37
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,521
It's here, isn't it?

38
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,121
Paula? Paula, darling. Where are you?

39
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,201
I'm Raquel Murillo's mother.
I cannot locate her.

40
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,281
Excuse me, Inspector.
I have your mother on the phone.

41
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,601
What a mess you' re having, huh?

42
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,561
Escort the gentleman, please.

43
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,281
Son, did you kill that woman?

44
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:18,841
- I can't breathe.
- Dad, what's wrong with you?

45
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:21,881
My husband... my ex-husband
had taken my daughter and...

46
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:24,841
He's got a restraining order
for mistreatment.

47
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,481
I feel the emotion and the helplessness
of having someone to help you.

48
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,721
Someone... Who's going to help me?
- Me.

49
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,761
Forgive me. I don't know how...

50
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,281
Thank you.

51
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,881
Raquel...

52
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,881
Do you know why I left the mine?
Because I was claustrophobic.

53
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,081
I couldn't stand being stuck in that hole.

54
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,281
Moscú! What are you doing?

55
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,641
Everybody down on the ground!

56
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,761
- Hold it right there.
- Dad!

57
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:56,161
- Cover your face.
- Let me out.

58
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:58,121
- They're opening the doors.
- Record it!

59
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,521
A shot. I don't see their faces.

60
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,761
- It's my fault.
- I didn't kill her.

61
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,641
I've got her hidden away.

62
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,721
Put on your masks and hoods
and get out on the roof,

63
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,281
without doing any signs or nonsense.

64
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,321
Now, Dad.

65
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:12,761
You didn't kill the girl, did you?

66
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,121
He ordered me to kill her
and I shot her.

67
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,361
I couldn't do anything else.
- You're talking about Mónica.

68
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:19,481
You killed Mónica!
Fucking hell!

69
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:21,001
- Get on your knees.
- What?

70
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:22,441
Snipers, for fuck's sake!

71
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,921
Let them think we're hostages.
Hands on your head.

72
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,881
- They kneel them to execute them.

73
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,881
- Everybody down on the ground!

74
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,801
Cóndor 3. One Dalí points to another.
I request instructions.

75
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,241
I'm waiting for authorization.

76
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,161
Still on your knees.
- Instructions?

77
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:39,361
Give me the green light.

78
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,961
I have a shot at the kidnapper.

79
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,281
What the fuck are you doing?

80
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,721
There's snipers, for fuck's sake.
Get on your knees.

81
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:47,841
- They're being targeted.

82
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,001
- Give me the green light!
- They're going to execute you.

83
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:51,801
- They'll shoot.
- Request to open fire.

84
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:54,761
- Let's open fire.
- They will kill them.

85
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:56,841
Green light.

86
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,681
Cóndor three, open fire.

87
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,881
Oh, good! Okay, Mr. Torres. All right.

88
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,041
But now we're changing series, okay?

89
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,441
We changed the letter, okay?

90
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,441
Another country, yes.
You didn't reject me.

91
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,881
Helsinki! Go down, hurry.

92
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,761
You killed her, motherfuckers.

93
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,841
Water, please. Water.

94
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,041
Thank you. Arturo, hold on.

95
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,161
Alcohol, alcohol.

96
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:05,241
Don't remove your hand...

97
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:09,201
- Raquel.
- "Ex-employees of the factory

98
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:12,441
they revealed to us the identity
of the person wounded by the police.

99
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,241
This is Arturo Román,
general manager of the factory,

100
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,721
who's just been wounded by police forces,

101
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,761
while he was on the roof with the robbers.

102
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,921
The events occurred
after 32 hours of kidnapping."

103
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,481
I need to talk to my wife, please.

104
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:36,161
I need to talk to my wife.

105
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,481
"They say that when we're at death's gates

106
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,401
we can finally see our life clearly.

107
00:07:43,481 --> 00:07:46,281
And Arturo Román,
bleeding to death on a table,

108
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:50,321
was expecting just that:
the clairvoyance of death.

109
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,601
Find out once and for all
who was the love of his life.

110
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:00,361
Laura, with whom he shared
14 years in holy matrimony,

111
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,521
or Mónica, his secretary and lover
with whom he returned to youth?

112
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,241
Unfortunately, the only certainty
Arturo had at the time

113
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:14,561
was that if they didn't take off the bullet,
he'd kick the bucket without solving the riddle.

114
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,761
And, frankly, our first-aid courses

115
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,041
didn't guarantee anything."

116
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,361
Inferior vena cava.

117
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:24,881
Renal right.

118
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:26,801
Left.

119
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:28,441
Mesenteric.

120
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,961
Pulmonary right.

121
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,201
Left.

122
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,641
This is the heart.

123
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:35,361
Cava.

124
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,961
Right Subclavian

125
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:39,521
and left.

126
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:41,281
Brachial.

127
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:43,721
Humeral.

128
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:46,961
Internal jugular.

129
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:48,721
External jugular.

130
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:51,961
And in red the main arteries.

131
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:53,321
Stop it, stop it.

132
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,321
Let's see.

133
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:58,441
You want us to learn
medicine with two markers?

134
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,081
If anyone gets shot,
he won't be able to go to the hospital.

135
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,601
You'll manage inside.

136
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:04,401
It'll be a bloody suicide.

137
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,201
- Shut the fuck up.
- Lock us in that mousetrap, okay.

138
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:09,201
It's a different matter to kill us.
- Denver.

139
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,001
We're asking you to learn
how to take out a bullet.

140
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,521
Don't start with your epic of the suburbs.

141
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,921
- It's not difficult. You take the tweezers,
you take out the bullet without fucking anything else.

142
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,521
- That's it.
- Nothing but a shot.

143
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,681
If I get shot, you take me to the hospital.

144
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:23,921
The answer is no.

145
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:28,401
I'd rather be lame and free
than healthy and in a cell.

146
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,641
No one's coming out.

147
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,881
Each one is a clue and a thread to pull.

148
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,841
If anyone resigns, this is the right time.

149
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,601
He stays during the robbery and then leaves.

150
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,081
Will the talk last long?

151
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,041
I'll keep my dick like Helsinki's.

152
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,881
- Hey! What do you say about my willy?

153
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:51,921
You want to see my willy?
- That's enough.

154
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,321
Please...

155
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,121
Get dressed.

156
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,521
Please have someone else stand here.
- Willy.

157
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,841
Let's go.

158
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,521
You don't? No, no, no...
Well, here we are.

159
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,801
- Well...
- Come on, Nairobi.

160
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,161
Nothing's going on, is it?

161
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:08,361
But what a sexy girl!

162
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,881
You go on.
- Oops! Okay.

163
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,081
Let's see what you learned.

164
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,761
Well, here's the carotid...
- Uh-huh.

165
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,321
"And so, playing doctor,

166
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,681
I discovered that Nairobi was more
interesting than it seemed.

167
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,961
...the little heart.

168
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:26,481
The aorta...

169
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,881
"And though no one
knew anything about anyone,

170
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,041
I never suspected Nairobi had a son.

171
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,441
Or a daughter.

172
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:37,441
And that seemed to indicate
the scar from her C-section."

173
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,841
What are you doing?
Hey! What are you doing?

174
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,081
- Where are you going?
- What's going on?

175
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,601
What are you looking at?
- Easy, huh?

176
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:44,601
No, no.
You're gonna eat the marker.

177
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,481
- What's going on?
- She's a bit of a dyke.

178
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,401
I don't know what the fuck she' s looking at.

179
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,521
Dyke, you. That you had
your bean melting like a sugar cube.

180
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,321
- My bean melting, I'm going to...
- Hey!

181
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,081
"And that's where our friendship began."

182
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:17,281
Raquel, Interior on the phone.
What do I tell them? Raquel?

183
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:18,841
Raquel! What do I tell them?

184
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,041
What?

185
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:22,561
- They'll ask who gave the order.
- I gave the order.

186
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:26,841
Tell them... the one injured is a hostage.

187
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,601
And hang up the fucking phone!
- He looked like a robber.

188
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,521
I asked for a green light. I insisted.

189
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:34,161
Inspector, I'm taking responsibility with you.

190
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,281
Inspector, the ambulance is ready.

191
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,361
Let's talk to the kidnapper.

192
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,161
- Preparing communication with the kidnapper.

193
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,601
- A decision had to be made.

194
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,001
It seemed like they were going
to execute them and we didn't have time.

195
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,121
Quiet, please!

196
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,361
Profesor?

197
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:23,161
You fired on the hostages.

198
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,761
There's one between life and death.
I guess that's why you call.

199
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,961
I've got the ambulance for the wounded man.
- No one is going to get out of here.

200
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,921
He's bleeding out.
Because of the bullet fired by you.

201
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,401
Will you let him die?

202
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,761
Let a medical team come in.

203
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,161
Profesor, listen...

204
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:49,281
I know it was my mistake,

205
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,521
but if a hostage dies,
it'll be the same for you as for me.

206
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,521
Because I assure you
that in less than five minutes

207
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:59,441
all public opinion will know

208
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,961
that he died because you wouldn't
let us come in and save his life.

209
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,321
Two surgeons, a nurse and surgical supplies.

210
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,001
Let me know when they get here.

211
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,321
Thank you.

212
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:22,761
I must also ask you something.

213
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:25,921
He wants to talk to his wife.

214
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:27,841
Of course.

215
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,161
Fucking hell.

216
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,481
Find Mr. Román's wife.

217
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,321
How long before we have the medical team?

218
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:37,921
- By helicopter from La Paz,
10 or 15 minutes.

219
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,601
Bring them in. Now!

220
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:40,721
Okay.

221
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:46,801
Excuse me, can you drive?

222
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,401
- Yeah, yeah..
- I need to go out, take a ride.

223
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:51,761
- Yes.
- Thank you.

224
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,401
Hey, Raquel.

225
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:00,841
What's going on?

226
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,361
I have to think.

227
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:15,721
Start.

228
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:26,721
Don't look at me like that.
I will not leave you alone.

229
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:49,881
Where the hell is she?

230
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:52,961
The motherfucker got away!

231
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,601
Let's see.

232
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,801
Go, go.

233
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:08,761
There we are.

234
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,561
Tell me, daughter.
Will you come to sleep tonight?

235
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,561
- I don't know, Mom.
- Why? Is something wrong?

236
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:25,321
Mom, I'm...

237
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,841
I made a very serious mistake at work.

238
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,001
- Daughter, your job is very difficult.

239
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:36,001
Go on, tell me about it,
because nothing seems so serious.

240
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,681
within five minutes of telling it.

241
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:42,201
- I was drinking some wine with...

242
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,921
- That's fine with me.
With whom? Do I know him?

243
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,561
- No, Mom. I don't even know him.

244
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:53,641
The fact is, when I got back to the tent,
there was a very serious situation,

245
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,601
of risk, in the roof of the factory and...

246
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:01,081
I thought one of the hostages
was in danger, so I gave...

247
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,241
order to shoot.

248
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,481
And the shot was taken by an innocent man.

249
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,961
- Yes, yes. I saw it on TV, daughter.

250
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:13,921
And now I don't know what to do.
I don't know whether to call his wife,

251
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:18,801
give a press release, resign...
I don't know what to do, Mom.

252
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,361
- To begin with, take it easy
and don't blame yourself.

253
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:26,001
Aren't they there with masks and guns,

254
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,841
locked up, all stirred up?

255
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:31,561
You just wanted to protect
the hostages, didn't you?

256
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,801
What if you saved someone's life?

257
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:38,761
You wouldn't be calling me
on the phone right now, would you?

258
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:43,561
Well, I wouldn't have known in passing

259
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:46,481
that you're meeting strangers to drink beer.

260
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:50,681
- For God's sake. I'm not meeting strangers.

261
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,001
- Did you kiss?

262
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,281
- How can I kiss him? If I don't know him.

263
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:56,841
- Bah... Knowing him, what a nonsense.

264
00:18:58,481 --> 00:19:00,041
The lovely thing is the crush.

265
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:06,161
Daughter, we have so little time
in this life...

266
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:10,121
- Well, Mom, that's not the point now.

267
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,441
I'm in a critical work situation.

268
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,801
- Well, then fuck that job of yours.

269
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,401
Why don't you ask them
to put you to stamp passports

270
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,281
so you can enjoy yourself a little?

271
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:21,081
Or do you think that in the future

272
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,921
you'll be holding hands with
the kidnapper in a nursing home?

273
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,041
Well, no, daughter, no.

274
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:28,401
But, maybe, with that stranger...

275
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:33,241
Yeah, laugh at me,
but I know what I'm saying.

276
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,441
I've been a widow for 20 years and...

277
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,281
Time doesn't stop, daughter.

278
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:43,281
And it doesn't go back either, you know?

279
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,961
- Entering the perimeter.
- I'll think about it, mother.

280
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,001
And you, if I don't make it,
go to bed, okay?

281
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,241
- Okay.

282
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,801
- Hey, and you go to bed with someone, too.

283
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:35,601
Mónica.

284
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,441
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?

285
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,441
I wasn't feeling well.

286
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,641
I think it's the meds
that didn't sit me very well.

287
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,641
Medicines?

288
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,721
That will do, the drugs.
That's what it's going to be.

289
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,761
Oh, my God, she' s boiling like a coffee pot.

290
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,841
We've got to get her
out of here running like hell.

291
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,321
I'll help you. Wait.

292
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,481
Can you leave me alone for a moment?

293
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,561
Please.

294
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:20,921
How do you see her?

295
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,201
- I think she's under the weather.

296
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,001
I see her very badly.

297
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:32,401
If we don't get that bullet
out of her, she's gonna peg out.

298
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,161
- Dad, take it easy.

299
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,721
She' s gonna be fine.

300
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:39,281
Why the fuck did you shoot her?

301
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:44,801
- Because Berlín was going to kill her.

302
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:46,921
I couldn't do anything else.

303
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,801
- Son of a bitch.

304
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:54,641
If he wants to kill someone
he can pull the trigger, not you.

305
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,281
We're here to steal, aren't we?

306
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:58,801
Not to kill someone.

307
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,001
Or save lives.

308
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:01,801
Fuck, we're bastards.

309
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:03,801
It's up to us...
- Dad, relax.

310
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,561
It's okay.

311
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,241
Mónica, are you done yet?

312
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:15,761
Yes.

313
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:30,281
- Let's go.
- Raquel, wait a minute.

314
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:33,481
I want to talk to you.

315
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,961
I want to go undercover with the medical team.

316
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:38,921
Someone will come in, but not you.

317
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:40,481
- Oh, sure.

318
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:42,561
There's always someone better
for everything, isn't there?

319
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,801
Raquel, I'm a firearms expert.

320
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:55,001
I can get in there.

321
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,761
At a glance I know how many they have,

322
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,441
what they are
and whether they're fake or not.

323
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:01,881
We can find out who the robbers are.

324
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:06,161
- You're right.

325
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,121
You'll come with me
and you' Il cover the doctors.

326
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,761
And now I'll tell you what we'll do.

327
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:14,401
I heard a gunshot before.

328
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:15,921
The police.

329
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:17,561
They shot a hostage.

330
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:20,441
A hostage?
- Yes.

331
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:22,881
Who's that?

332
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:26,601
Who's that?

333
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:30,561
Who did the police shoot?

334
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:33,601
The head of the factory.

335
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,161
Arturo?

336
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,241
Did the police kill Arturo?

337
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,481
No. He didn't kill him.

338
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:43,921
Is he all right?
- Yes.

339
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:45,281
Is he alive?

340
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:47,921
Is Arturo all right?
- It's okay. Yes.

341
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,121
Are you sure?
- Sure.

342
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:52,161
Is he all right?
- A surgeon is coming in.

343
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,361
With his team.

344
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,121
You'll have surgery
and you'll be saved, okay?

345
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:56,361
Are they going to do the surgery?
- Yes.

346
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,601
You have to tell him I'm alive.

347
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:02,801
To Arturo. You have to tell him.

348
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,561
Do you hear me?
- No one here will say anything to anyone.

349
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:09,161
Because you're gonna be fine
and so will he, okay?

350
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,081
Let's go. Let's see that wound.

351
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,121
Relax.

352
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,641
It's just that he thinks it was all his fault.

353
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,481
I picked up the phone
because he asked for it.

354
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,201
And now I'm dead because of him.

355
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:22,641
You must tell him I'm alive.

356
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,401
And his son too.

357
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:33,201
Are you pregnant?

358
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:39,961
All right.

359
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,521
Congratulations.

360
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,841
Give me a pen, please.
- Okay.

361
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:52,601
When?

362
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:55,561
Thank you.

363
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,281
Ángel!

364
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:09,201
I want you to know
that I've decided to come in.

365
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:11,561
I'll take advantage of the medical intervention.

366
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:14,521
I welcome these decisions you make
for an ambulance ride.

367
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,641
But my presence is only in response
to the government's wish

368
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:20,561
that there's no violent outcome.

369
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:21,721
- Oh, wow.

370
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,641
What a pacifist
has suddenly become that one of the CNI.

371
00:25:25,361 --> 00:25:27,601
Wasn't he the one who wanted to come in
yesterday with the tanks?

372
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:30,161
I wanted to surprise them.
Get this finished as soon as possible.

373
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:32,721
But now the priority is zero victims.

374
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,881
So my advice is to negotiate and wait.

375
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,441
It must be so fucked up to be here all day

376
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,641
believing himself to be more than anyone else,
without making a single decision, right?

377
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:45,561
The fellow member of the hostage crisis.

378
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,561
Inspector, I'm not going to go on the attack

379
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,481
because I understand that at a certain age

380
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,001
hormones take over in there.

381
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,001
I know that from my mother.

382
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,001
- Where are you going?

383
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:59,201
- As you can imagine,
I have to report all this, don't I?

384
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,561
Oh, of course.

385
00:26:04,841 --> 00:26:07,881
So far the kidnappers are always ahead of us.

386
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:09,201
They had it all figured out.

387
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:10,921
Minus this shot.

388
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,761
It's the first thing that
gets out of their plan.

389
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,401
And we have to take advantage of it.

390
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:19,361
The only way we can get in here
without being detected by their cameras

391
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,361
is to advance through this tube in the subsoil.

392
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:23,721
Which leads directly to the basements.

393
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,201
It's the ventilation nozzle.

394
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:28,041
- It's seven months old,
to release heat from the press.

395
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,481
The work is in progress.

396
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,761
They probably don't know about it.

397
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:34,121
I need two of your men to come through here.

398
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:37,481
Officer García Lobo,
here, and I'll go with him.

399
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,761
- Okay. The sub-inspector Rubio

400
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:42,561
will accompany the two surgeons
and enter as a nurse.

401
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:44,201
18:09.

402
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:45,601
All on time.

403
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:47,681
At 18:15, the medical team will be in.

404
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:49,841
According to the chief of internal medicine

405
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,881
the surgery won't last more than 30 minutes.

406
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:55,521
But they can extend it exactly until 19:00.

407
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:57,361
The departure of the doctors

408
00:26:57,561 --> 00:27:00,361
will concentrate a greater number
of kidnappers to watch them.

409
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:03,801
At this moment, Suárez and Lobo
will enter through the subsoil.

410
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:07,641
They'll enter through
the basement chest dressed in red overalls

411
00:27:07,881 --> 00:27:10,121
and masks of Dalí.
They will infiltrate with the hostages.

412
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:13,361
We will succeed
if we operate with clock precision.

413
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:15,121
Inspector!

414
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:18,201
- Arturo Román's wife.
- One moment, please.

415
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,161
Suárez, go.

416
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:23,521
Take care of the doctors.
And be careful.

417
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,001
- We prepare operative!

418
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:28,561
What happened? Is my husband all right?

419
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,121
Your husband is conscious and stabilized.

420
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,761
He has been shot down by mistake.

421
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:36,121
- Shot down? What do you mean, shot down?
- He is wounded, but alive.

422
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,001
Relax.

423
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:39,201
Relax

424
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,201
The kidnappers allow us a surgical team

425
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,001
and he's going to undergo surgery immediately.

426
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,401
- Excuse me, but...
I wasn't even listening, I'm sorry.

427
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:49,841
- It's okay.

428
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,401
Everything's gonna be okay.

429
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:54,041
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you

430
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,361
- Can you talk to him right now?
- Yes.

431
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,241
Put this on.

432
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,561
Almansa, record it!

433
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,401
Hello?

434
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,441
Profesor, there's Arturo Román's wife.

435
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:10,241
Okay.

436
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,241
That bullet needs to be taken out now.

437
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:19,881
You do it, Dad.

438
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:22,081
You have colder blood.

439
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,761
Where's the kit the Profesor gave us?

440
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,721
There's a scalpel.
- Berlín has it.

441
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:32,441
Fucking hell.

442
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,881
I don't think it's a good idea
to ask him, do you?

443
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:38,241
The surgeons! Go steal their instruments.

444
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:39,281
- Run!
- Okay.

445
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,601
Hold on! Hold on!

446
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:42,201
Give him the note, please.

447
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,881
Now I'm gonna wash your wound, okay?

448
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,321
It's all right.
You're gonna be all right, okay?

449
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:08,761
Arturo. Arturo!

450
00:29:11,241 --> 00:29:12,601
What's your wife's name?

451
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:15,681
Laura.

452
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,201
That's a pretty name.
Well, you're going to talk to Laura.

453
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:21,801
Wives are good for these moments.

454
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,921
They're comforting.

455
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,721
No one remembers his wife
when he is stoned to death

456
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,201
at the door of the disco, but

457
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:34,841
if you have a problem, an accident

458
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:37,001
or merely fear...

459
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:38,841
things change.

460
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:46,201
You' re not thinking about
your secretary now?

461
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:48,561
Yes?

462
00:29:50,561 --> 00:29:51,521
No, I'm not.

463
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:53,841
But who can remember now lovers

464
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:56,881
with children who could be abortions...

465
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:00,081
Or just nothing.
- Spare me the speech, will you?

466
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:01,521
Listen to me.

467
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:04,161
If you say something weird,
I'll put a deathblow in you

468
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,961
and your wife listens to it in a minute.

469
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:07,321
Can you imagine?

470
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:18,841
Inspector!

471
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:20,561
They're turning on a phone.

472
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,041
That phone needs to be bugged.

473
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,241
I want to see the selfie and main cameras.

474
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,761
There, there.

475
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:30,161
Oh, hi, sweetie.

476
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:32,881
Arturo, darling, how are you?

477
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:34,881
All right, all right. I'm fine.

478
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,761
The shot was clean.
- There is no image.

479
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:38,761
Neither selfie nor principal cam.

480
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,001
They've been plugged.

481
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:42,361
They're gonna let some surgeons in now.

482
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:45,401
I know, I know.

483
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,321
Look, I've been...

484
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,281
I've been thinking about you and...

485
00:30:51,201 --> 00:30:52,721
And in everything we've done wrong.

486
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,481
Don't think about it, honey. Not now.

487
00:30:55,081 --> 00:30:56,041
Not now.

488
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:57,881
Besides, it's my fault.

489
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:01,441
I know we're not fine.

490
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,281
That we haven't been well in a while.

491
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:05,401
I've neglected you and the boys.

492
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:06,881
I've been selfish.

493
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,601
I promise you all that will change,
you hear me?

494
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,601
I promise you it's gonna change.

495
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:15,881
You've been saying for ten years
that you want to see

496
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:17,281
your sister in Australia.

497
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,961
To take advantage of the opportunity
for children to learn English.

498
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:23,361
And meet the kangaroos.

499
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:27,281
Well, that's the first thing we'll do
when we get out.

500
00:31:27,841 --> 00:31:29,201
I owe you.

501
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,081
I'm gonna do it for you.

502
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,161
For how much I love you.

503
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,921
All the years wasted chasing...

504
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:41,921
Thinking that the only important thing
was money and position.

505
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:44,241
When all that matters is you.

506
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:46,721
It's always been you.

507
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:50,241
Since the day I met you.

508
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:55,081
I swear to you, there are times that...

509
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,841
That I try to remember that day...

510
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,561
And I wonder
what the hell you saw in me, Mónica.

511
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:07,681
Laura.

512
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:16,161
Now just think about getting out of there.

513
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:20,841
Just think about it.

514
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:22,801
I love you.

515
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,561
I love you, my darling.

516
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:33,361
Are you okay?

517
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:35,561
Calm down.

518
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:39,441
- You really tread the boards, Arturo.

519
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:43,881
Your secretary in the familiy way...

520
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:48,681
Laurita waiting for you
in the 4x4 with the children.

521
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:52,041
You, surrounded by money,
are a legend.

522
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:55,241
- Berlín!

523
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:57,321
The doctors are out there!

524
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,201
- You're gonna have to excuse me.

525
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,681
- Does everyone know what to do?
- They know!

526
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:10,881
Of course they know!

527
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,321
Are you ready?

528
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,001
Well, they're ready.

529
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:16,321
Mercedes!

530
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:18,881
Are you ready?

531
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,041
- Yes, sir.
- I want her out of here.

532
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:24,281
Río, take her to an office.

533
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:28,721
Nairobi

534
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,281
- We put on the masks!

535
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:36,721
And with me! Rock and roll!

536
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:51,881
Come on in.

537
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:02,961
Leave everything on the floor.

538
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:05,761
Close the doors.

539
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,561
Advance.

540
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,361
Hands on your head and legs open.

541
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:29,681
We're going to frisk you.

542
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:40,721
- Almansa, escort the gentleman, please.

543
00:34:58,121 --> 00:34:59,121
Listen to me carefully.

544
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:01,881
One of the paramedics is an undercover cop.

545
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:04,081
Which one?
- The one with the glasses.

546
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:05,801
You know what to do.

547
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,961
Perfectly.
- Let's do it. Berlín!

548
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:11,361
It's got to be a hell of a goldsmith job.

549
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:13,201
I know.

550
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,481
Gentlemen!

551
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,321
The one with the glasses is the cop.

552
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,721
They'll come in.

553
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,561
I don't know if during an assault,
an emergency.

554
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,201
Whether it will be the one from the Red Cross
or the one from the pizzas,

555
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,561
but what's clear

556
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:32,441
is that they're gonna try
to infiltrate someone.

557
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,881
And that will be our chance

558
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:38,161
to try to put them on a Trojan horse.

559
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:39,601
Do you know what it is?

560
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,521
I don't know, but the rhyme is easy.
- No!

561
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,161
The Trojan horse...
- Got anal intercourse!

562
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:48,641
Shut the fuck up and stay focused!

563
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:49,841
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:53,201
I apologize.

565
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:57,881
The Greeks were at war with the Trojans.

566
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:02,361
One day the Trojans found
at the gates of their city

567
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:05,521
a wooden horse.
A huge wooden horse!

568
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:09,881
And carried away by their vanity they thought

569
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,241
it was a surrender gift from the Greeks.

570
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:12,881
So they opened the doors...

571
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:14,361
and they put it inside.

572
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,721
What they didn't know was
that that horse was hollow.

573
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:20,681
And replete with Greek warriors.

574
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:26,081
That night the Trojans lost the war.

575
00:36:30,161 --> 00:36:32,361
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

576
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:39,721
When they try to get in

577
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:43,321
and think that they' re winning the battle...

578
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:03,801
Put the metal objects in that tray.

579
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:05,921
Glasses.

580
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:07,481
Watches.

581
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:08,921
If you have weapons...

582
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:11,801
Microphones.
I also advise you to deposit them.

583
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,361
We're going to track
any kind of radio frequency.

584
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,561
Take your shoes off too.

585
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,081
Please.

586
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,521
And now lie down.

587
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,161
Get on the ground.

588
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:29,601
That's it.

589
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,081
Cockroach way.

590
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,041
On your feet.

591
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:05,961
Put your shoes on.

592
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:12,841
Take only the glasses.

593
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,641
You' re going to need them.

594
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:20,001
Welcome back.
Take your things and come with me.

595
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,681
- Thank you.

596
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,161
What?

597
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:32,001
Sometimes people like you are on TV.

598
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:34,481
Like me what?

599
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,241
Robbers.

600
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:39,121
But you don't fit in very well.

601
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:40,961
It looks like this isn't your thing.

602
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:42,441
Why is that?

603
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:45,521
The way you pick up your rifle.

604
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,441
I thought you were the ambassador's daughter
and not Rambo's.

605
00:39:55,881 --> 00:39:57,881
Well, my father always wanted to have a son.

606
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:02,241
and since I've been five years old,
he's been leading me to shoot.

607
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:03,841
Shooting?

608
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,161
To what?

609
00:40:05,761 --> 00:40:07,041
To the carnival sticks?

610
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,241
Wild boar, red deer,

611
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:11,881
antelope...

612
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:16,041
But what my father would like
is to hunt ecologists.

613
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,801
But I don't like guns.

614
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:27,921
Once, in Norwich,

615
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:32,401
a friend of my father's had his rifle shot.

616
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:35,641
I saw it all.

617
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,001
Shot in the back, people screaming...

618
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,441
It's like when...

619
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:48,441
you see an accident on the road
and it gets engraved the...

620
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:50,721
the bloodstain.

621
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:56,441
Well...

622
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:03,361
It's unloaded, okay?

623
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,601
Don't be afraid.

624
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,641
How do you see it, Doctor?

625
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:23,961
Will I get out of this?

626
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,081
The bullet is lodged

627
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:28,721
on the collarbone.

628
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,041
There's no interest in vital organs

629
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,601
and there's no bone splinters either.

630
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,561
Nobody's gonna die.

631
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,041
- Do your thing.

632
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,441
"Denver didn't have time for diagnostics."

633
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:47,361
Anesthesia.

634
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:48,881
"Mónica was bleeding to death.

635
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:52,041
If he didn't steal the scalpels soon,

636
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:55,281
to have spared his life
wouldn't have done any good."

637
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,801
What anesthesia are you going to give him?

638
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:59,441
Total sedation is preferable
in case of setbacks.

639
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:00,681
- No.

640
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:04,041
Better give him a local anesthesia, huh?

641
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:07,001
so my friend Arturo and I can talk.

642
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:08,401
during the intervention,

643
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:09,641
eh, Arturito?

644
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:19,401
- Take it easy, take it easy.

645
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:39,681
What's that watch for?

646
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:42,361
It's to control the duration
of local anesthesia,

647
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:43,521
Twenty-five minutes.

648
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:46,121
If there were any inconvenience
during the intervention,

649
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:47,881
we should give him another dose.

650
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,761
Put the watch on the screen.

651
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:57,681
"That operation was scheduled

652
00:42:58,121 --> 00:43:01,081
and it had to last exactly
the 25 minutes ordered by

653
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:02,201
the inspector.

654
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,401
That countdown would leave
two policemen with Dalí masks.

655
00:43:05,561 --> 00:43:06,881
inside the factory

656
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:08,401
or if it went wrong,

657
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,121
two corpses in the ventilation ducts."

658
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,201
Drop the fucking rifle.

659
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:19,881
It's unloaded, let it go
before it pisses me off.

660
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:23,161
- The bullet from the breech.

661
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,241
Suárez, do you copy?

662
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:33,521
Tube's clear.

663
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,321
We're advancing towards the target.

664
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:50,121
Turn around and put your hands
on the back of your head.

665
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,161
Let's go!

666
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,761
- Let's go!

667
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:01,281
Let's go.

668
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:03,321
What's going on?

669
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:04,561
You're not so tough anymore, huh?

670
00:44:05,201 --> 00:44:06,881
Come on, damn it, come on!

671
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:08,721
Shoot,

672
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,481
you stupid little bitch.

673
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:11,561
On your knees!

674
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:14,481
Scalpel.

675
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,121
- Stop it, I'll deliver the weapons here.

676
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,161
Scalpel.

677
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:28,081
- You've crowned yourself before, eh, Arturo?

678
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:30,161
Changing your wife's name.

679
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,041
Of course, it's normal.

680
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:37,961
Fornicating in the mornings with Mónica,

681
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,961
spending afternoons with Laura...

682
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,681
It's normal for you to get confused.

683
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,801
But I love them both.

684
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:48,401
That's the truth.

685
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:52,361
When you're in my situation,
it's very easy to judge.

686
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,561
Everybody thinks you're a scoundrel,

687
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:57,761
a son of a bitch.

688
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:01,121
God forbid I should make moral judgments.

689
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:17,521
I can understand everything.

690
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:21,401
You can talk to me

691
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:23,881
quietly of anything.

692
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:26,841
But I'm really a miserable man,

693
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,121
a poor man who's in love with two women

694
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:35,481
and that he doesn't have enough guts

695
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:37,241
to choose one.

696
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:54,641
Why the fuck did you do that?

697
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,201
I don't know, I'm sorry.

698
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,121
I'm sorry.

699
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:04,481
Get on the ground!

700
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:21,841
You're 11 meters from the entrance.

701
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:23,321
Received.

702
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:24,441
We continue.

703
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:32,481
- Fucking little posh girl,
motherfucker.

704
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:35,081
- I'm sorry.
- Shut the fuck up!

705
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:36,761
Don't tell me about your life, okay?

706
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:39,681
I'm not the fucking friend
of the outcasts, is that clear?

707
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,361
If you're begging friendship
from the one who kidnapped you,

708
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:44,561
is that you're so fucked up.

709
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,521
You know what...?

710
00:47:04,761 --> 00:47:07,001
That I'm only six weeks pregnant

711
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:10,281
and I care more
about the kid's life than mine?

712
00:47:10,921 --> 00:47:12,841
It takes more than an infection

713
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:16,401
for children not to go out and eat the world.

714
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:18,601
Hey, what's your name?

715
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:22,321
Moscú, they call me Moscú.

716
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:24,041
Hey, Moscú,

717
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:26,601
and how is it...

718
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:28,641
about...?

719
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:30,561
Well, about being a father.

720
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,001
Being a father...

721
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,881
Well, look, being a father

722
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:42,721
it's like if suddenly falls over you

723
00:47:43,321 --> 00:47:46,361
a chariot of problems and also for life.

724
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:51,361
I mean, to be worried the rest of your days.

725
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:55,281
First, baby colds.

726
00:47:55,641 --> 00:47:58,441
That's every weekend in the ER

727
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:00,081
instead of going out for drinks.

728
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:01,841
I don't care, I don't drink.

729
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:03,441
Well, it's worse for you

730
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:06,321
because you don't know
how good a Pacharán feels

731
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:09,361
when you leave him there
asleep in his cradle.

732
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,001
And then school.

733
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:14,721
The fear

734
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:17,121
that we parents have that...

735
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:21,001
that your son will not be the fool
and punching bag of his class,

736
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:22,881
what they call now bullying.

737
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:24,721
What happens is that in my case...

738
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,921
it was my son who punched.

739
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:31,601
Every now and then he was expelled.

740
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,601
I don't know how many schools
we went through...

741
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:38,681
And then his mother,
the poor thing, who had her trade...

742
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:40,081
Well, poor thing...

743
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:43,921
She left me alone, lying there like...

744
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,681
In front line

745
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:49,041
because after all, all you want is

746
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,201
that he' s normal,

747
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:56,001
that he doesn't stay in the corner
smoking junk

748
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:58,521
instead of going to high school.

749
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:03,121
But being a father...

750
00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:05,281
It's okay.

751
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,361
It's very...

752
00:49:07,441 --> 00:49:08,761
Hey, no, no!

753
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:09,961
Mónica, do not sleep!

754
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:11,641
Look at me, look at me!

755
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:12,921
Do not sleep, honey.

756
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:14,081
Come on, look at me!

757
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,241
- That's it.
- What's going on?

758
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:16,721
- What's going on?
- Nothing, it's fine.

759
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:18,721
- Yes?
- You have very high fever.

760
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:19,921
No, don't stop looking at me.

761
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,561
All right, look at me, that's it.

762
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:23,801
I bring everything.

763
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:31,881
Five minutes to get the doctors out.

764
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,001
I got it.

765
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,001
- I've got it.

766
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:45,721
Thank you.

767
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:49,801
And now you sew.

768
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,281
Me?

769
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:54,521
Yeah, you.

770
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:56,241
You're a nurse, aren't you?

771
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,481
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:01,641
Well then.

773
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:05,161
- It's local anesthesia.

774
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:08,641
We put it in the wound
and pain-free in a moment.

775
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,841
I'm coming.

776
00:50:24,561 --> 00:50:26,241
- Come on, let me, I'll do it.

777
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:28,561
Keep an eye on the pulse.

778
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:29,681
Okay.

779
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,001
Come on, let's go...

780
00:50:33,641 --> 00:50:35,121
That's it, that's it.

781
00:50:36,001 --> 00:50:37,521
You know what I'm gonna do when...?

782
00:50:37,841 --> 00:50:38,881
When I get out of here?

783
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,481
I'm going to study online.

784
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:44,121
- You haven't studied in your life.

785
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:46,601
- I'm not telling you I'm going
to do medicine, but...

786
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:49,641
Yeah, pick up where I left off, you know?

787
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,961
This one's gonna hurt
a little bit more, okay?

788
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:53,161
Look, look.

789
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:55,281
Well...

790
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:56,681
Okay, that's it.

791
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:57,841
- That's it.
- That's it.

792
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:01,361
Now in five minutes it takes effect and...

793
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:03,641
And we start opening, okay?

794
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,201
Let's go. Okay.

795
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:14,801
You're two meters from the entrance.

796
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:16,121
We visualize target.

797
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:39,921
Wait,

798
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:41,401
I feel a little sick.

799
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:42,641
I think I'm gonna throw up.

800
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:44,881
Are you a nurse, a dancer
or what the hell is wrong with you?

801
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:46,081
I'm a nurse,

802
00:51:46,721 --> 00:51:49,201
but I'm not used to
working surrounded by guns.

803
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:50,321
- Well, that's enough.

804
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:51,481
I sew,

805
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:54,761
but I want everyone to be quiet, please.

806
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:56,201
- Come on, let's go.

807
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:00,961
Tweezers.

808
00:52:08,161 --> 00:52:10,281
- The Profesor wants to talk to you.
- All right.

809
00:52:10,481 --> 00:52:12,521
Take the nurse to the bathroom
so he can throw up.

810
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:15,641
If he doesn't, you stick his head
in the toilet until he does.

811
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:16,721
Until he does.

812
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:19,201
Goodbye, Arturo.

813
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:20,961
- Go.

814
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:22,641
Let's go.

815
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:24,161
Let's go.

816
00:52:30,401 --> 00:52:32,881
They're transmitting in shortwave
and ciphered, so they're coming in,

817
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:34,001
but I don't know which way.

818
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:35,361
Hearing, active plan b.

819
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:37,321
Activate it and get the medical team out now.

820
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:38,721
Now.

821
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:51,801
My love, be strong.

822
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:52,921
I'm fine.

823
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:54,001
I love you.

824
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:55,321
Mónica.

825
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:10,801
What the fuck do you want?

826
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:12,041
How should I know?

827
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:13,201
I've seen that before and...

828
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:15,601
And it's caught my eye.

829
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:17,961
I didn't know what it was.

830
00:53:18,841 --> 00:53:19,801
Oh, I'm sorry.

831
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:21,601
Okay, sorry.

832
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,841
See you later.

833
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,321
What are you doing?

834
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:33,801
Do you want to leave?
I don't want to talk.

835
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:45,601
How old is...

836
00:53:47,121 --> 00:53:48,081
your son?

837
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:53,721
Seven.

838
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:56,041
He's seven.

839
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:57,841
Where is he?

840
00:53:58,241 --> 00:53:59,201
With his father?

841
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:00,801
Not with his father.

842
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,441
He's never been with his father.

843
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:03,921
There's no word from his father.

844
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:11,481
What's his name?

845
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:15,641
Axel.

846
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:17,881
His name is Axel.

847
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:21,001
It means "axe."

848
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:22,961
Axe. Yes.

849
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:25,401
Because it's an axe,

850
00:54:27,361 --> 00:54:28,321
like his mother.

851
00:54:32,361 --> 00:54:34,121
That kid's a survivor, you know?

852
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,201
He's survived everything.

853
00:54:37,121 --> 00:54:39,841
It's like a cork in the middle of the sea

854
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:41,361
that don't sink.

855
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,241
That's the way he is.

856
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:47,161
At the age of three...

857
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:49,881
I had to take it from my mother's house

858
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:51,641
because her husband gave him anise liqueur

859
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:56,121
when I wasn't there because
he didn't like the baby crying.

860
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:58,961
So I took him.

861
00:54:59,361 --> 00:55:01,441
Just the two of us,
not needing any family at all.

862
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:03,881
Him and me.

863
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:07,081
We were fucking great.

864
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:14,121
But I screwed up.

865
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:22,081
One day...

866
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:26,361
I had to go get some pills to sell.

867
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:29,081
and...

868
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:32,081
And I left him alone.

869
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:36,361
Five minutes,

870
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:38,601
it was gonna be five minutes, huh?

871
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:40,401
And he messed it up

872
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:43,401
with the fucking Spiderman.

873
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:44,561
Fucking Spiderman!

874
00:55:47,201 --> 00:55:49,081
Because he wanted
to be a superhero, he said.

875
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,681
He climbed everything.

876
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:53,241
He climbed in a way
that you couldn't believe it.

877
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,081
And he went out the terrace
through the window.

878
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:07,441
Then there he grabbed a chair,
climbed into the chair.

879
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:09,201
and he started, "Mommy!

880
00:56:09,761 --> 00:56:10,721
Mommy!"

881
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:13,881
Three and a half years old.

882
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:17,961
Of course, five minutes later

883
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:21,921
I had a police patrol there,

884
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:23,281
the fire brigade...

885
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:25,801
Everybody.

886
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:30,001
I got caught with the pills,

887
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,241
with a background,

888
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:34,521
without a job.

889
00:56:35,841 --> 00:56:36,801
To the gaol.

890
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:41,761
Then my boy started going
from family to family,

891
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:42,881
from hand to hand.

892
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:45,641
And nothing for me.

893
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,001
Nothing, huh?

894
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:49,081
They didn't leave me one visit,

895
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:50,801
not one phone call.

896
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,201
Not a thing.

897
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:53,841
Then I got out of jail...

898
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:55,561
and nothing.

899
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:57,361
They didn't give him to me.

900
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:01,161
Did you see him again?

901
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:02,721
They don't let me.

902
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:05,361
But at least

903
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:07,681
I know where he is, huh?

904
00:57:08,521 --> 00:57:10,081
Yes?
- He' s in the Canary Islands.

905
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,601
He's with a family that owns a hotel.

906
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:14,761
He' s fine.

907
00:57:17,121 --> 00:57:18,081
Are you gonna go after him?

908
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:20,041
I'm going to take him...

909
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:22,841
and that's it.

910
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:24,881
To the other side of the world.

911
00:57:25,761 --> 00:57:27,081
Let me tell you something,

912
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:29,121
in this heist

913
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:32,081
I'm not gonna fuck it up.
Not me, not anyone,

914
00:57:33,121 --> 00:57:35,201
because if someone
misses the point completely

915
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:36,921
I destroy his life.

916
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:46,201
Of all the plans people have around here,

917
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:47,641
yours...

918
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,361
is the best.

919
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:54,401
And I'll tell you something else...

920
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:00,081
Do you like tequila?

921
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,401
It's 4:03 am.

922
00:59:17,081 --> 00:59:18,561
Tomorrow there's class at first hour.

923
00:59:21,281 --> 00:59:22,321
Plastic explosive.

924
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:23,841
Sorry.

925
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:27,521
It would be nice if you
were rested for class.

926
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:29,441
We are sleepless.
- To bed.

927
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:31,521
All three of us?
- Each to his own.

928
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,001
Those pajamas look good on you, Profesor.

929
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:35,561
Now.

930
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:38,761
Now.

931
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:47,001
And you with the lights.

932
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:49,961
This guy's makes me horny,
he makes me horny.

933
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:51,641
He makes me horny!

934
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:52,881
Well, you don't show a thing.

935
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:54,041
Do I show?

936
00:59:54,161 --> 00:59:55,481
A lot.
- Well, let him notice it.

937
00:59:56,321 --> 00:59:57,521
I feel dizzy, kid!

938
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:14,041
"Deputy Inspector Ángel knew
in a thousandth of a second.

939
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:15,681
that they had lost another battle.

940
01:00:15,961 --> 01:00:18,401
Those sinister masks meant
that they were going to throw

941
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:19,801
two men to the lions.

942
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:22,281
Also that the guy who devised that heist

943
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:25,161
had more intelligence
and more imagination than the police,

944
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,721
the NIC and the Intervention Unit,

945
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:30,081
and when they get ahead of you like this,

946
01:00:31,081 --> 01:00:32,121
it's time to run."

947
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:33,761
We have to leave now.

948
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,881
Miss, please, we're done here.

949
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,281
Can we go, please?

950
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:43,041
- Yes.
- Yes?

951
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:44,161
Quietly.

952
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:47,401
You' re following me.

953
01:00:52,921 --> 01:00:54,401
- Doctor, doctor!

954
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:57,081
Wait a moment.

955
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:58,441
One minute 30 seconds.

956
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:02,921
There are frequency inhibitors.

957
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:05,401
Suárez, do you copy?

958
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,721
They've put in frequency inhibitors.

959
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,681
I think we're gonna lose communication.

960
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:10,961
Do you copy?

961
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:15,241
There are inhibitors.

962
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:16,521
We're losing communication.

963
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:17,761
Suárez...

964
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:19,641
How was the intervention?

965
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:23,761
Fine, but we'd have to be back in 24 hours.

966
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:27,881
I appreciate the interest,
but for the post-op

967
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,881
we have people sufficiently prepared.

968
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:34,881
Is my friend the nurse feeling better now?

969
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,001
Yes, yes, thank you.

970
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:37,041
I'm glad to hear it.

971
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:40,081
Forgive me for not accompanying you,
but I leave you in good hands.

972
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:41,761
Good-bye.

973
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:42,841
- Good-bye.
- Goodbye.

974
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:57,161
- Send our greetings to the outside!

975
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,281
Did you tell Arturo I'm okay?

976
01:02:06,481 --> 01:02:07,441
Huh?

977
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:09,681
Did you tell Arturo I'm alive?

978
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:11,721
Yes...

979
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:14,041
I didn't tell him.
- Did you tell him or not?

980
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:15,161
I gave him the note.

981
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:22,561
And what did he say?

982
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:25,681
Fuck, he's gone crazy.

983
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:27,321
He's gone crazy, what's he gonna say?

984
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:28,401
That...
- Go on.

985
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:29,521
That...

986
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:32,041
That he loves you very much...
- And what else?

987
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,001
He said that...

988
01:02:34,761 --> 01:02:36,001
That when you get out of this,

989
01:02:36,921 --> 01:02:38,161
he takes you to Australia.

990
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,001
To Australia?

991
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:43,681
Yes, it is.

992
01:02:44,201 --> 01:02:45,161
I don't see it.

993
01:02:45,801 --> 01:02:48,601
He also said he doesn't know
what you saw in him to notice him.

994
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:51,281
To Australia?
- Yes, Australia.

995
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,361
It's his wife's dream destiny.

996
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:58,961
Besides, Arturo knows I'm afraid of planes.

997
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,001
She came in, didn't she?

998
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:04,281
Did his wife go in with the doctors?

999
01:03:05,921 --> 01:03:06,961
Was Laura here?

1000
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,161
No.

1001
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:09,241
Yes.

1002
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:10,401
He told her on the phone.

1003
01:03:26,921 --> 01:03:28,601
- Suárez!
- Command post, do you copy?

1004
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:31,801
Command post, do you copy?

1005
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:34,961
Oh, shit.

1006
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,921
Inspector, the surgeons are coming out.

1007
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:52,001
Don't stop.

1008
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:54,161
Don't stop.

1009
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:01,641
Run, run now.

1010
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:02,761
Run now.

1011
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:03,841
Run now!

1012
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:04,921
Let's go!

1013
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:06,681
Come on, get out!

1014
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:07,961
Ángel comes running.

1015
01:04:08,161 --> 01:04:09,121
Something's happened.

1016
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:12,801
Abort!

1017
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:14,321
The masks have been changed.

1018
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:15,401
They're not about Dalís.

1019
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:16,641
They go straight to the slaughterhouse.

1020
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:17,801
- What?

1021
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:22,481
Attention, abort entry.

1022
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:23,881
Suárez, do you copy?

1023
01:04:29,681 --> 01:04:30,721
Target achieved.

1024
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:33,801
We proceed to remove
the lid and we are already inside.

1025
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:40,961
What are you doing?

1026
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:42,481
One bullet.

1027
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:44,041
A gunshot wound.

1028
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:56,041
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1029
01:04:56,201 --> 01:04:57,161
Oh, Moscú!

1030
01:04:57,281 --> 01:04:58,841
You're making a slaugther!

1031
01:04:59,001 --> 01:04:59,961
Give it to me!

1032
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:02,121
"Then something unexpected happened."
- Leave it to me.

1033
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:05,201
"Nairobi put all its effort
and meticulousness to the service

1034
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:06,281
of the common good.

1035
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:10,561
Instead of ratting them out,
he helped them save Mónica' s life."

1036
01:05:10,761 --> 01:05:12,241
I'm gonna get some air.

1037
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:13,481
"Or at least her leg."

1038
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:15,281
You bastards!

1039
01:05:15,441 --> 01:05:17,481
"She didn't come here to kill anyone."

1040
01:05:17,641 --> 01:05:18,601
Fuck, come on!

1041
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:19,761
"And as I told you before,

1042
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:23,081
she wasn't willing for anything
to screw up the Profesor's plan."

1043
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:46,681
Suárez, do you copy?

1044
01:05:47,161 --> 01:05:48,521
The masks have changed.

1045
01:05:50,201 --> 01:05:51,241
There's interference.

1046
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,721
Command post, do you copy?
I can't hear you.

1047
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:56,041
They're not wearing the Dalí mask!

1048
01:05:56,481 --> 01:05:58,001
It's a fucking suicide.

1049
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,561
Attention, do you copy?

1050
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:02,921
Abort entry, repeat, abort entry!

1051
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:05,201
We proceed
to draw weapons and we're in.

1052
01:06:13,161 --> 01:06:14,121
Abort entry!

1053
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:15,161
Abort entry!

1054
01:06:17,201 --> 01:06:18,161
That's an order!

1055
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:20,081
The masks have changed.

1056
01:06:20,361 --> 01:06:21,561
They don't wear Dalí masks.

1057
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,001
Attention, do you copy?

1058
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:25,441
Abort entry!

1059
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:43,401
I have breached
the first rule of the plan.

1060
01:06:43,561 --> 01:06:44,521
I killed a hostage.

1061
01:06:47,361 --> 01:06:48,921
But do you like men?

1062
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:50,081
Don't women?

1063
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:03,681
You'd rather save Alison Parker
than eight students?

1064
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:04,761
Yeah, I'm sure.

1065
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:06,601
I didn't expect this answer from you.

1066
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:22,481
I think it's time to have a reflection,

1067
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:23,561
back to the source.

1068
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,481
That car is a loose end.

1069
01:07:31,641 --> 01:07:33,241
Tell me why you wiped the fingerprints.

1070
01:07:41,761 --> 01:07:45,561
They're the ones who are afraid now.

1071
01:07:58,321 --> 01:07:59,281
Hey, you!
