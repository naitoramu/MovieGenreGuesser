1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,686
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,882
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,851
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,008
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,767
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,763
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,522
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,001
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,395
We would like to serve
notice to the defense,

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,508
pursuant to Rule of
Criminal Procedure 15.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,406
I would like a conversation with you
before you seek the death penalty.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,245
Moira, what don't I know?

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,490
There are some things
that must never be spoken of.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,883
He's beaten me twice,
and I don't know how to stop him.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,471
Who are you?

16
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:56,509
Once you know, your life
will never be the same.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,610
Sara?

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,887
Yeah, Dad, college is great.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,169
No. Me and my new roommate
totally hit it off.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,970
We're like besties.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,481
Okay. Yeah, Dad,
I gotta get back to Chem Lab.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,526
Yes. It looks like I got
a long night ahead of me.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,889
- Get off the...
- Okay. Love you, Dad. Bye.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,847
Ollie, you are trouble.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,684
How is Detective Lance?

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,685
He's clueless, as usual.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,007
Guess I was thirsty.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,129
Did you hear that?

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,011
One, two, three...

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,009
It's getting closer.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,841
That's not very scientific.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,884
And what would you know about science,
Mr. Ivy-League-Dropout?

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,441
I happen to know a lot about science.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,570
I know of fermentation.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,566
I know biology.

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,805
Laurel's gonna kill me.
She's so gonna kill me.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,247
Your sister will never know.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,561
- Come here.
- Ha, ha.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,090
Okay, that one was really close.

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,004
Sara...

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,561
we're gonna be fine.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,331
Oliver...

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,607
- Oliver!
- Sara!

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,605
Help!

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,409
Help!

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,762
Sara!

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,287
Oliver!

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,363
Can't sleep?

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,249
I don't do well with my eyes closed.

50
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,606
Thanks for letting me stay here. I know
you got a lot going on with your mom.

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,928
Thea's mostly staying at her boyfriend's...

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,161
so don't worry about anyone
finding out that you're back.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,322
Thanks for understanding.

54
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,921
I don't understand.

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,807
Not a day goes by
that your family doesn't miss you.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,243
Yeah? How do you know?

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,490
Because I missed you.

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,402
Probably they won't be as happy
to see me as you think.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,011
How can you say that?

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,001
I know how hard it is to come home
when you've been gone for so long.

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,243
I'm guessing my father and Laurel
weren't too happy to see you.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,930
No.

63
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,167
No, not at first.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,844
I wasn't sure if you and she
ever got back together.

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,809
We tried.

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,691
It was too much.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,207
Yeah, some things, you know,
just better left in the past.

68
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,208
I'm done waiting for Mr.
Queen. Let's get started.

69
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,690
Sorry I'm late. There's
an old friend in town.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,647
I just finished explaining to
your mother and sister...

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,451
that Ms. Lance will be sitting
second chair for the prosecution.

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,446
This is a conflict of interest. Ms. Lance
practically grew up in the Queen house.

73
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,841
I think you're overstating matters.

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,362
We'll see when I move
to conflict Ms. Lance off this case.

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,210
Maybe there won't be a case much longer.

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,202
I come here not just with Ms. Lance
but also a plea offer.

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,370
Life, with a possibility of parole.

78
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,811
Heh. No. We are not pleading out.
Mrs. Queen is innocent.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,844
She aided and abetted 503 homicides.

80
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,731
Under duress from a homicidal maniac
named Malcolm Merlyn.

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,566
She also withdrew from the criminal
conspiracy prior to its execution.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,085
Five minutes prior.

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,722
With Malcolm Merlyn dead, the jury
is going to wanna blame someone.

84
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,400
She doesn't take the deal, then
she is facing the death penalty.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,084
Sounds a lot like blackmail.

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,846
Try reality. And here's some more.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,637
We've subpoenaed over a
decade's worth of phone

88
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,150
messages, phone records,
letters and e-mails.

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,724
I'm willing to bet I find something
that crushes your duress defense to powder.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,445
Mr. Donner...

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,046
if you don't mind,
I'd like a few days to consider your offer.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,210
Of course.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,931
Excuse me.

94
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,250
I'll be right back.

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,166
Laurel?

96
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,202
I'll meet you at the car.

97
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,447
You're prosecuting my mother?

98
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,802
I didn't ask for this case. I was assigned.

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,406
- So say no.
- It's a new job, Oliver.

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,045
I don't have a lot of pull.

101
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,966
And what pull I do have, I used to get
that plea bargain for your mother.

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,202
This was your idea?

103
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,561
Life in prison?

104
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,961
The DA is serious
about the death penalty, Ollie.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,810
We both know what it's like
to lose someone.

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,847
So think about it,
and save your mother's life.

107
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,324
Are you okay?

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,687
In case I wasn't clear last week...

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,922
I'm done answering that question.

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,131
Help!

111
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,721
Help!

112
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,042
Over here!

113
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,925
Sara?

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,411
Sara.

115
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,244
You okay?

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,563
- How'd everything go with your mother?
- I ran into your sister.

117
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,165
She's working on the case.

118
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,601
- You didn't tell her?
- No.

119
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,929
I know a little something
about keeping secrets.

120
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,211
And respecting them, even though I don't
totally understand why you're keeping yours.

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,204
Is this...?

122
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,767
Is it because of what happened
on the island?

123
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,765
No.

124
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,410
After.

125
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,602
There were things that I did...

126
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,762
things that I had to do to survive.

127
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,364
Things that there's no forgiveness for.

128
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,245
Well, that's the thing about forgiveness.

129
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,604
You can't get it until you ask for it.

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,406
Merlyn?

131
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,611
Who are you?

132
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,246
Just a warrior, like you.

133
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,443
Why are you dressed
like Malcolm Merlyn?

134
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,406
Huh? Who sent you?

135
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,482
I remember the first time I saw this hood.

136
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,051
Shado was wearing it.

137
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,328
This is quite the setup that you got here.

138
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,006
Launching your one-man war for Starling.

139
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,009
I'm not one man.

140
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,610
These are my friends.
This is John Diggle and Felicity Smoak.

141
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,406
- Guys, this is Sara.
- Welcome home, Sara.

142
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,562
I was happy to hear
you're not dead anymore.

143
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,008
I mean, I didn't know you
before you didn't die the first time.

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,527
- I'm still glad you're alive.
- You're cute.

145
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,760
We just had an uninvited guest
in the Queen mansion.

146
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,206
Trained.

147
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,561
Highly skilled.

148
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,410
And he was dressed like Merlyn.

149
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,186
Well, last I checked
Malcolm Merlyn was dead,

150
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:55,872
courtesy of an arrow
jammed through his heart.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,527
It wasn't him. It was a follower,
an underling bent on revenge.

152
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,003
Whoever it was, he knows who I am.

153
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,875
Gee, eeh, didn't get
you a bag of dirt.

154
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,428
I found it in the house.
Copycat Merlyn tracked it in.

155
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,841
I want you to analyze it.
Hopefully, it will lead me right to him.

156
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,783
Then what?

157
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:13,168
If this pretender wants to
follow Malcolm Merlyn so badly...

158
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,441
he can follow him right into a grave.

159
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,847
Sara, we'll find this guy.

160
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,922
I don't want you to.

161
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,924
- What do you mean?
- He wasn't after you, Ollie.

162
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,281
He's after me.

163
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,521
Who is he?

164
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,724
He's called Al Ow-Al. The First.

165
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,122
And he's a member of the
League of Assassins.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,163
Wait, wait. League of Assassins?
I thought they were a myth.

167
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,920
What's the League of Assassins?

168
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:45,912
And please, don't say it's a
league made up of assassins.

169
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,765
It was an urban legend. I heard about
them in Afghanistan from a tribal leader.

170
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,566
He claimed there was
an ancient sect of assassins...

171
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,082
deadly warriors that killed
and vanished like ghosts.

172
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,201
Thought he was smoking
what he was selling.

173
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,481
I tried to tell you, Ollie,
but you wouldn't listen.

174
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
That's where you've been
the past four years.

175
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,167
That's where you learned to fight.

176
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,165
You're one of them.

177
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,001
After the freighter, a member of the league
rescued me, took me in...

178
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,288
and brought me to Nanda Parbat.

179
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,882
They remade me into what I am.

180
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,128
And I swore them my allegiance.

181
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,010
Why are they kicking down doors
trying to find you now?

182
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,484
Because I left.

183
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,604
And there's only one way
that you leave the league.

184
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,003
Is that why you didn't
wanna see your family?

185
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,531
A year ago, I was in Guyana.

186
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,520
I was sent there for a man named Suarez.

187
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,324
He was a local diplomat.

188
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,282
And I slit his throat in his bed.

189
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,563
And his kids...

190
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,846
They found his body in the morning.

191
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,287
I'm a murderer, Ollie.

192
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,844
You think that my family
will be happy to see me?

193
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,771
I have to go to Iron Heights.

194
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,040
Felicity, I need you to find this Al Ow-Al.

195
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,171
Thank you. Thank you.

196
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,725
What were you doing out there?

197
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,327
The boat that I was on,
we got caught in a storm, and...

198
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,008
- Come.
- Wait. Wait, wait.

199
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,361
Wait.

200
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,804
Robert Queen. Robert Queen, it
was his boat. And they're rich.

201
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,440
He'll pay you whatever you want. Please.

202
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,282
Who are these people?

203
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,005
Please, no!

204
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,325
Please, don't. No, you've made a mistake.

205
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,806
Please let me out.

206
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,884
Wait, why won't you let me...?
No! Please come back!

207
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,849
Let me out!

208
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,120
You cannot be serious.

209
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,521
- What's going on here?
- She wants to take the deal.

210
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,715
Mom, if this is about
the death penalty...

211
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,874
I've been explaining
this to your mother.

212
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,649
Even if we ever get to sentencing,
you were acting under duress.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,003
I have everything I need
to keep them from sentencing you to death.

214
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,567
The death penalty doesn't scare me, Jean.

215
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,366
- Mom, then why aren't you fighting?
- I have my reasons.

216
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,443
- Name one.
- Because I'm tired of fighting.

217
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,323
I am not confident that
I can win over a jury.

218
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,164
And I'm not altogether certain
that I deserve to.

219
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,408
- I think that was actually three.
- Thea...

220
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,041
But, no, seriously,
you're just ready to give up?

221
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,205
Just take your medicine
and spend the rest of your life in here?

222
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,209
We still need you.

223
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,164
I still need you.

224
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,725
I can't take this.

225
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,684
Growing up...

226
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,002
I didn't think that
there were secrets kept between us.

227
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,961
Last year I learned different.

228
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,565
And I've gotten pretty good at knowing
when you're hiding something from me.

229
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,691
So, Mom...

230
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,369
what are you hiding now?

231
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,650
Help your sister come to terms
with my choice, because it's made.

232
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,407
I'm sorry if I upset you before.

233
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,206
We all joined clubs we wish we hadn't.

234
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,522
Took me a year
to get out of that gym membership.

235
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,205
Heh.

236
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,489
- Thank you.
- For what?

237
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Not making me feel like what I am.

238
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,250
Oliver's lucky to have you both as friends.

239
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,370
He hasn't always
had the best luck in that area.

240
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,928
- How'd it go with your mother?
- Not well.

241
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,313
Have you found somebody
for me to hit yet?

242
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:31,068
Could be.

243
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,964
The spectral analysis
of the dirt from your

244
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,791
house had trace amounts
of aldicarb in there.

245
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,160
- What?
- It's a pesticide.

246
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,045
Starling City used to have
its own aldicarb plant...

247
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,368
but, per the EPA it was
shut down three years ago.

248
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,046
- What's it being used for now?
- Nothing. It's abandoned.

249
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,926
But my guess is it's the home base
to one League of Assassins assassin.

250
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,929
He will kill you.

251
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,681
Like you, I am not that easy to get rid of.

252
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
This is my fight.

253
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,829
He made it my fight when
he came into my house.

254
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,001
And when he threatened somebody
that I care about.

255
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,243
Arrows.

256
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,126
Such an ineffective projectile.

257
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,527
I find it strange anyone still fears them.

258
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,327
I'll show you why
if you don't leave Sara Lance alone.

259
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,561
That's your only warning.

260
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,087
And it would be effective...

261
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,971
were you to pose a threat to me.

262
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,209
You barely defeated Malcolm Merlyn...

263
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,449
at nearly the cost of your own life.

264
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,043
What hope would you have
against the man who trained him?

265
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,043
It helps that I didn't come alone.

266
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,324
The child of Ra's Al
Ghul awaits your return.

267
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,040
- I am not going back.
- That's not your choice.

268
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,841
I have orders to return you...

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,490
alive or dead.

270
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,284
You're not going to kill me.

271
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,211
You overestimate your importance.

272
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,290
Regardless, you're coming back with us.

273
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,169
Us?

274
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,766
Like you, I did not come alone.

275
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,240
If you will not return willingly...

276
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,922
you will stay to bury your family.

277
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,481
You're not even flinching when he...

278
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,281
Pain and I came to a little understanding
a few years back.

279
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,490
Done.

280
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,721
The League of Assassins.

281
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,684
Why wouldn't she tell me
what happened to her all those years?

282
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,044
Probably the same reason why you didn't
tell us what happened to you on the island.

283
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,128
We need to protect the Lances.
I'll take Laurel.

284
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,991
What can I do?

285
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:05,148
Nothing. You're hurt and
you need to stay here.

286
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,170
- What about my father?
- I'll go talk to Detective Lance.

287
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,601
Tell him he needs to get out
of town for a couple of days.

288
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,683
Please don't tell him about me.

289
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,042
I can keep a secret. Just ask him.

290
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,891
You three are quite the team.

291
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,967
We have our moments.

292
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,044
Get up.

293
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,446
Wait, wait, no.

294
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,729
No, no, no.

295
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,400
- The more you struggle...
- Please, no!

296
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,049
- The more it will hurt.
- No! Please! Please.

297
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,685
Wait.

298
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,127
Let her go.

299
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,681
You don't give me orders.

300
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,769
I know. That would be the Captain.

301
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,009
But he works for me. Doesn't he?

302
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,682
Help me, please.

303
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,369
Come on.

304
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,887
Laurel, listen, it's your father again.

305
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,448
I know you're still mad at me after what I
said when you got pulled over last week...

306
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,684
but it's not right, us not talking.
So please, just...

307
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,325
Just call me, okay?

308
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,451
Detective Lance, I knew you'd be getting home
around now, because your shift has ended.

309
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,758
Which I knew because I kinda
pinged your cell phone.

310
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:40,834
Ms. Smoak.

311
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,082
You have cockroaches,
and they mean business.

312
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,071
Since when did you start
making house calls?

313
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,184
Since you're in danger.

314
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,887
- I'm not afraid of cockroaches.
- Yes, you're in real danger.

315
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,402
You need to get out of town
for a couple days.

316
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,370
Listen, I'm in danger
every time I put on this uniform.

317
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,210
So, you're gonna have
to be a little more specific.

318
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,366
There's an organization
called the League of

319
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,793
Assassins, and three of its
members are targeting you.

320
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,392
That sounded a little
less crazy in my head.

321
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,417
I doubt it.

322
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,124
Malcolm Merlyn was apparently a member.

323
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
That should give you seome sort of an idea
about the type of people we're dealing with.

324
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,089
Okay, I'll bite.

325
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,246
What'd I do to piss him off?

326
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,883
That, um...

327
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,690
is a very long story. You just...

328
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,649
You need to trust me.

329
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,362
You're not safe here in Starling City.

330
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,801
Ms. Smoak, nobody's safe, ok?
Especially not us cops.

331
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,843
We get shot at for a living.

332
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,691
And my shift, it just ended.

333
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,765
- Detective Lance.
- Good night.

334
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,890
- You need to listen to me.
- Good night, Ms. Smoak.

335
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,168
So I guess this means
you're not leaving town?

336
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,090
Evening.

337
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,143
I should have said this
earlier, but it's not

338
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,434
appropriate for us to be
discussing your mother's case.

339
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,002
Actually I was in the neighbourhood,
so I thought I'd swing by,

340
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:58,467
see if I can give you a ride home
and maybe get a bite to eat.

341
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,131
It's been a long day.
I don't need a longer night of you...

342
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,602
trying to talk me out
of your mother's plea agreement.

343
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,565
Laurel...

344
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,171
I promise...

345
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,404
this has nothing to do
with my mother's case.

346
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,002
You've had a rough couple of weeks.

347
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,210
You're really gonna tell me
you couldn't use a friend?

348
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,164
Come on.

349
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,085
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

350
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,727
Badly. He either didn't believe me
or didn't take me seriously.

351
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,367
In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have
led with "League of Assassins."

352
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,170
What do we do now?

353
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,036
What are you doing?
Oliver told you to stay put.

354
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:44,026
I thought you didn't want your father
to know that you're still alive.

355
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,242
I don't, but it's better
than him not being.

356
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,290
- Where do you think you're going?
- With you.

357
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,369
I'm not gonna let you go out
there without any backup.

358
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,727
Digg, you may be a three tour
Special Forces veteran...

359
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,845
but I was trained by the
people that make the

360
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,835
Special Forces look like
a kindergarten class.

361
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,089
So step aside or get put down.

362
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,250
It's your funeral, Sara.

363
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,530
Wouldn't be my first.

364
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,770
No, no, it can't be. It can't be Sara.

365
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,760
It's me. It's Sara.

366
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,689
Daddy, it's okay.

367
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,765
Sara?

368
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,130
Sara?

369
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,730
Sara.

370
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,050
You speak Chinese now?

371
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,687
Picked up a couple of things
over the past few years.

372
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,325
Yes.

373
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,683
Why didn't you let us know
that you were alive?

374
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,368
Your mother and I, we...

375
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,162
We missed you. And your sister did too.
You know that, right?

376
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,691
I know you got divorced.

377
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,325
Yeah.

378
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,088
But it wasn't your fault.

379
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,409
- It was on me.
- Because of me.

380
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,304
I'm sorry.

381
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,305
It's alright, none of that matters now.
You know why? Because you're home.

382
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,891
You're home.

383
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,970
Are you in trouble?

384
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,646
Huh?

385
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,804
No, Dad.

386
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,011
You are.

387
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,967
You sent Felicity Smoak to warn me
to leave town.

388
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,722
You know the Arrow.

389
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,328
You're the girl in the mask.

390
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,762
You've been kicking the crap
out of creeps in the Glades.

391
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,811
You've been home for weeks.

392
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,891
Tell me something.

393
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,914
If these assassins, if they
hadn't shown up, would

394
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:27,740
you have ever let us know
that you were alive?

395
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,284
No.

396
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,563
Felicity said that these guys
were part of a league or something.

397
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,954
What do they want with you?

398
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:43,715
What all the assassins want:
To terminate their objective.

399
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,009
- Oh, this is crazy.
- Dad...

400
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,480
- We have to go.
- No. You're not going anywhere.

401
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,490
Not till you sit down and you tell me
exactly what you've gotten yourself into.

402
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,129
You are an amazing cop.
And you're strong and decent and honest.

403
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,250
But these men, they will cut you down
before you can lift a finger.

404
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,604
Now, please, come with me.

405
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,725
I'm afraid it's not much...

406
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,930
but it's home.

407
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,840
Why did you lock the door?

408
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,970
No, no. No, no, it's not because...

409
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,210
It's just a habit. My shipmates
aren't exactly the nicest bunch.

410
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,886
Please come in. Have a seat.

411
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,970
My name is Ivo.

412
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,727
Dr. Anthony Ivo.

413
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,450
And you are?

414
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,126
Sara.

415
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,049
Nice to meet you, Sara.

416
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,010
Why do you keep those people
down there in those cells?

417
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,491
It's my work.

418
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,327
- I need them.
- What work?

419
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,603
I am going to save the human race, Sara.

420
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,084
Maybe you can help me.

421
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,080
I noticed you didn't
have a drink at dinner.

422
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,487
No, I didn't.

423
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,327
So will you now admit that you
and my father overreacted last week...

424
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,682
when you thought
I was becoming a drunk?

425
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,884
I am prepared to admit
that I care about you.

426
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,368
Is that why you insisted on walking me
to my door?

427
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,846
You know me.

428
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,963
I just wanted to make sure you were safe.

429
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,003
This is safe.

430
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,651
We shouldn't.

431
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,688
Then why did you come all the way up here?

432
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,108
I'm really sorry if I was
sending the wrong message.

433
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,133
No.

434
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,482
No. No, I got the message.

435
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,811
I get it loud and clear every day.

436
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,969
Run.

437
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,685
Run. Run away from Laurel.

438
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,087
Run as fast as you can.

439
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,402
- Laurel, come on.
- Sara...

440
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,326
She got on the Gambit with you.

441
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,080
My father, he... He climbed into a bottle.

442
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,365
My mother, she... she climbed
into her car and she drove away.

443
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,483
And then Tommy...

444
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,410
What is so wrong with me
that everybody leaves?

445
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,049
I will never leave you.

446
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,368
Until you do.

447
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,488
I thought I locked that.

448
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,043
Stay here.

449
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,724
Ollie?

450
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,130
Anything?

451
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,931
All good.

452
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,050
I have to go.

453
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,482
- Listen, I'm sorry about what I said...
- Don't be.

454
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,288
Just stay here.

455
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,286
Felicity, Al Ow-Al was at Laurel's place.

456
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,442
What? Is she okay?

457
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,350
She's fine. Looks like he
moved on before we got there.

458
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,636
But if Laurel's
not his target...

459
00:32:20,661 --> 00:32:23,307
He's after Lance. And
I need a location now.

460
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,811
Well, I can't believe I didn't think
to look for you up here.

461
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,964
It's a good vantage point.
You can see the whole city.

462
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,806
Like a bird on a wire.

463
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,641
Where I was,
they have you choose a new name.

464
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,081
I chose Ta-er Sah-fer.

465
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,727
It's Arabic for "canary."

466
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,210
I bought you that canary when you were 10.

467
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,641
I was as far from home as you can get...

468
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,525
but I never forgot where I came from.

469
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,404
You know how they say the
first thing you forget

470
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:02,309
about somebody when they're
gone is their voice.

471
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,408
You can remember their face
and the way they move...

472
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,131
but you can't hold on
to the way they sound.

473
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,766
I never forgot your voice, Dad.

474
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,441
Sweetie.

475
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,886
But we're out of time.

476
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,529
So this is where
you wanted your father to die.

477
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,082
What the hell, Sara? Who are these guys?

478
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,567
Associates of your daughter, Officer Lance.

479
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,609
She always did have the worst taste
in friends.

480
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,888
Did you really think we
could not find you here?

481
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,525
No.

482
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,329
- I knew you would.
- Now!

483
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
You should be mindful of your surroundings.

484
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,401
Guns are a coward's weapon.
What are you without your sidearm?

485
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,364
A guy with a spare.

486
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,444
You think because you are the beloved...

487
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,130
you will be granted your freedom?

488
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,089
There's only one freedom.

489
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,641
Let me grant you yours.

490
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,288
- You don't have to do this. It's over!
- Not yet.

491
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,273
Sara, baby, don't.

492
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:10,633
Tell Ra's Al Ghul that
my family is off-limits.

493
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,041
His quarrel is with me.

494
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,445
I'm sorry you saw that.

495
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,205
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

496
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,210
I think you're a survivor.

497
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,051
I think you're one of the bravest people
I've ever known.

498
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,643
You're my daughter.

499
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,042
It's time for you to come back home.

500
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,403
- I can't.
- Why not?

501
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,368
They are never gonna stop looking for me.

502
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,643
I'll protect you. We'll protect you.
Tell her it's safe to stay.

503
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,085
Dad, if they hurt you or Laurel or Mom,
then I really would die.

504
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,051
- But they need to know.
- They can't. They can't, Daddy.

505
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,322
- Why not?
- You know why.

506
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,563
I came back to make sure
that my family was safe, and you are.

507
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,889
But if they knew I was alive,
Laurel and Mom...

508
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,483
they would never stop looking for me,
and that could get them both killed.

509
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,570
I can't let you go.

510
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,122
I can't let you go.

511
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,726
I'm fine. Dad, I have to...

512
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,166
I have to go.

513
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,441
I love you.

514
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,602
Keep them safe.

515
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,206
Detective.

516
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,410
She's right.

517
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,281
You have to keep her secret.

518
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,450
It's already the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

519
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,088
How do you live like this?

520
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,644
I never mind getting a visit from my
children, but I know why you're here.

521
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,201
- We just have one more thing to say.
- Oliver, we've already been through this.

522
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,445
- I am not going to change my mind.
- This is about me changing mine.

523
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,643
Because I thought that you didn't wanna
go to trial over a secret.

524
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,085
Then I caught up with an old friend
and watched as she struggled...

525
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,171
to tell her family hers
because she was afraid...

526
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,245
that they wouldn't love her
if they knew the truth.

527
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,687
Whatever you are worried about,
it will not make us love you any less.

528
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,650
- But you don't know.
- Who do you think you raised?

529
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,322
You've taught us to be strong.

530
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,081
That we could overcome
any obstacle that we faced.

531
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,850
To fight.

532
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,044
Do you really think
that we are gonna scare that easily?

533
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,487
Whatever comes out...

534
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,688
- you won't lose us.
- Ever.

535
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,725
Well...

536
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,362
I'll instruct Jean to reject Mr.
Donner's offer.

537
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,931
Hey.

538
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,491
Dad.

539
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,603
I know I owe you a phone call.

540
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,241
I have a lot of work.
Can we do this another time?

541
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,766
I just had to see you, Laurel.

542
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,929
Did something happen? Are you okay?

543
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,485
One day, honey,
when you have a daughter of your own...

544
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,072
you'll understand that
being a parent, it means

545
00:38:58,097 --> 00:39:00,545
you just never stop worrying
about your children.

546
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,930
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

547
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,085
I've had a really long week, and I'm tired.

548
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,611
Are you all right?

549
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,925
I don't know.

550
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,684
I wish that there was something.

551
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,283
A sign that it gets better.

552
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,124
It does, honey.

553
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,360
It gets better.

554
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,206
How do you know?

555
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,281
I wish I could tell you, sweetie.

556
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,247
I wish I could tell you.

557
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,565
Where's Sara?

558
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,924
She left.

559
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,401
- You cool with that?
- I didn't have much of a choice.

560
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,961
An old friend gave this to me.

561
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,084
He said I would know
when it was the right time to drink it.

562
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,689
- And now is the right time?
- I'm not sure.

563
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,203
But I need a drink.

564
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,927
Mm.

565
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,486
- So you were right.
- Yeah, I usually am, Oliver.

566
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,249
About what specifically?

567
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,649
No matter how hard I
try, Diggle, my past...

568
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,646
it doesn't wanna stay buried.

569
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,167
I don't wanna try so hard anymore.

570
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,006
The five years that I was gone...

571
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,804
I wasn't always on the island.

572
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,080
How are you...?

573
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,970
Prisoners do not speak.
