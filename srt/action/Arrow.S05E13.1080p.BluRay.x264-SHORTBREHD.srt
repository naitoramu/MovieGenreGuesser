1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,796
<i>My name is
Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,214
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,884
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,270
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,726
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,687
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,022
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,438
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,398
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,032
- You want to help?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,740
- Stay off the streets.
- It's my city, too.

12
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,329
I came here to work with the guy
who killed Damien Darhk.

13
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,786
- So, you ex-Navy, right?
- Dishonorably discharged.

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,670
- Reason?
- Because I screwed up. Again.

15
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,622
That's my life, man.

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,633
I'm wearing this suit again
because I think it's a path to redemption.

17
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,294
And it could be for you, too.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,555
Look, finding a new Black Canary
isn't just about reviewing resumes.

19
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,057
<i>Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.</i>

20
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,310
She's a kickass woman
who appears out of nowhere

21
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,560
<i>and saves crime victims.</i>

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,720
She even has a cry.

23
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,185
<i>Our Tina is trying
to avenge her former partner.</i>

24
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,150
How do you keep living with so much pain?

25
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,155
I can tell you
it helps to not be alone.

26
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,567
My real name is Dinah. Dinah Drake.

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,141
I've got something!

28
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,731
Well, not "something" something,
but something.

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,523
That's good work.

30
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,901
Didn't know they taught bo staff
at the Central City Police Academy.

31
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,865
They don't. My first undercover assignment

32
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,372
was with a street gang
called the Pilgrims.

33
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,873
They liked to mess around with it.

34
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,539
- I'm gonna head home.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,123
You found a place to stay already?

36
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,206
No, I'm, uh, just staying
where you guys put me up.

37
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,000
HIVE? That's not a home.
It's barely livable.

38
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,465
It's fine. I don't need much.

39
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,884
See you, man.

40
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,883
What've you guys got?

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,894
Well, I have been working on a location
for Claybourne's mistress.

42
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,851
Prometheus' mother, we find her...

43
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,015
We find the name for this son of a bitch.

44
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,526
Unfortunately, the son of a bitch's
father went dark

45
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,732
after he met with the pointy head
of an arrow four years ago,

46
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,363
and Mommy went off the grid.

47
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,899
- Why would she do that?
- Probably because she knows

48
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,910
that he turned into
a serial-killing psychopath nutjob.

49
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,080
Point being, I have been looking for her
for the past three months,

50
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,412
but whatever witness protection program
she put herself into, it is damn good.

51
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,919
- What changed in three months?
- I've had a breakthrough.

52
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,421
I've narrowed her new home
down to Illinois.

53
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,675
L just need a couple more days
to narrow that down into an address.

54
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,505
- That's fantastic work.
- Thank you.

55
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,390
Curtis is coming in,
he's gonna help with the search.

56
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,186
It's really nice to have you back.

57
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,942
Well, I could say the same to you.

58
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,321
I mean, Hub City and Russia?
You're really racking up those miles.

59
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,605
Lot to catch up on.

60
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,275
Yeah, like you and Susan Williams?

61
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:18,957
People talk, Ollie.
And, uh, some people vomit a little.

62
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,620
Thea, you're kind of insulting someone
that I'm getting pretty serious about.

63
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,460
Did I mention people vomit a little?

64
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,716
You don't like Susan
because of how she does her job.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,502
She's good at her job
and she's a good person.

66
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,587
So, there.

67
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,173
Uh-huh.

68
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,187
Quentin!

69
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,186
Hey.

70
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,310
- Oh, so good to see you.
- You, too.

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,564
God, I saw your interview with
the dragon lady. You nailed it.

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,732
Uh, that's his girlfriend
you're talking about there.

73
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,784
Yes. Uh, don't remind me.

74
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,159
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,335
Are you prosecuting him for something?

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,504
Actually, Quentin was just introducing us.

77
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,753
I'm the new Deputy Mayor's assistant.

78
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,217
I, uh, never should've left.

79
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,178
Well, uh, talking of leaving,

80
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,513
I got to get across town
for an alderman meeting.

81
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:20,935
You need me to come with?

82
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,690
Nice try, but those regulatory forms
are not gonna fill themselves out.

83
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,242
I'm just saying that maybe you could
get Susan Williams to back off.

84
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,161
Bottom line, I'm not comfortable
leveraging a personal relationship

85
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,420
for political gain.

86
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,379
The media's right, man.
You're not much of a politician.

87
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,215
As it is, I'm not comfortable
covering up the circumstances

88
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,050
behind the death of Detective Malone.

89
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,052
- So, maybe if Susan...
- Mr. Mayor!

90
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,216
There's a shooter in the building.

91
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,051
We need to get you to a secure location.

92
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,058
<i>LAURA". Rene Ramirez, you are a dead man.</i>

93
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,523
Zoe's gonna totally kill you
if you guys are late to the game.

94
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,109
What?

95
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,031
No way we'll be late, not the way I drive.

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,032
Ooh.

97
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,406
Ooh, okay.

98
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,581
Whoa, what do you think you're doing?

99
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,037
<i>Stadium's in the Glades, babe.</i>

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,874
In, like, the worst part
of the worst part of town.

101
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,622
I brought it with me last time I took Zoe.

102
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,091
So, you're admitting you broke the rule?

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,801
Kind of what I do, babe.

104
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,463
The only reason I agreed
to let you keep that thing in the house

105
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,677
was because you said we needed it
for home protection.

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,343
- Right, but...
- As in, stays in the home.

107
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,646
Now, hurry up. You guys are gonna be late.

108
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,806
I thought we were going as a family.

109
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,855
I have a headache.

110
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,318
Oh, yeah? You taking something stronger
than Aspirin for the headache?

111
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,692
You got something
you wanna say to me, Rene?

112
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,951
Guess I do.

113
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,863
Using again?

114
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,875
We cleared the building.

115
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,506
- Shooter isn't here.
- Alert SCPD and ACU.

116
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,793
Drop a five-block net around City Hall.
Let's get ambulances here immediately.

117
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,632
And has anyone seen my sister?

118
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,799
- Ollie.
- Hey, are you all right? Are you okay?

119
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,406
You're gonna be okay.

120
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,405
Just catch that son of a bitch.

121
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,365
Yeah. Go on.

122
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,712
How many casualties?

123
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,879
There's five dead, 24 injured,
and eight in critical condition.

124
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,342
Bastard was wearing Kevlar,

125
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,634
but I think one of my shots
winged his shoulder with a nine-mil slug.

126
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,056
Might be a good idea
to alert all emergency rooms.

127
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,098
- Do it.
- What were you doing with a gun in here?

128
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,767
Judging by how I tagged the guy,
I got to go with saving people's lives.

129
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,196
Your security detail said the shooter
dropped his primary weapon.

130
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,107
- We need to get it before the police do.
- I took care of it.

131
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,574
This is military-grade hardware.

132
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,240
AR-15 assault weapon.
Fires 5.56 NATO rounds.

133
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,915
It's an M16.
It's literally the same gun as an M16.

134
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,001
Seems like some of Tobias Church's
ordnance got into the wrong hand.

135
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,710
Wronger hands. So...

136
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,298
Not necessarily. It's an AR-15.
It's available on the open market.

137
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,883
In fact, it's the most popular gun
in America.

138
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,092
Land of the free,
home of the incredibly stupid.

139
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,727
We are not having this conversation
now or ever, guys.

140
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,600
- Where are we with the gun?
- Nowhere.

141
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,185
It hasn't been used in any prior crime.

142
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,275
Fingerprints.
Shooter wasn't wearing gloves.

143
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,936
AFIS didn't kick back anything.

144
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,149
I don't think he's ever
been in the system.

145
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,985
Or he was smart enough
to have himself erased from it.

146
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,365
Security cameras.

147
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
He knew how to avoid them.

148
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,787
And before he opened fire,
he upgraded to a ski mask.

149
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,164
That looks like a utility jumpsuit.

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,408
Forefather Repair,
it went belly-up six years ago.

151
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,667
I ran through the employee list,

152
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,625
but I think our shooter
just bought a uniform off the Internet.

153
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,164
So he could walk into City Hall.

154
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,921
This guy's real good at
covering his tracks, whoever he is.

155
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,459
So, who is he?

156
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,505
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,967
Yeah, that's the guy. Run him through
the system for me, would you?

158
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,181
Hey. This is where you've been.

159
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,271
Good thing I got a look at the shooter
before he put his ski mask on.

160
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,691
I let that son of a bitch
walk right past me.

161
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,352
Hey, you couldn't've known, hoss.

162
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,986
I've been police most of my adult life.

163
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,318
I should've been able
to spot that guy 1,000 yards out.

164
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,983
Hey, don't go there, man, all right?

165
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,694
What happened wasn't your fault.

166
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,662
I heard you got a few shots off.

167
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,289
Yeah, and I would've put him down, too,
if he wasn't wearing body armor.

168
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,200
Listen, weren't you
dishonorably discharged?

169
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,868
Not for my aim, hoss.

170
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,043
My point is it's illegal for someone
such as yourself to carry a firearm.

171
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,958
But it's pretty easy to buy one, though.

172
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,711
Wow.

173
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,722
Am I using again?

174
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,600
How could you even ask me
something like that?

175
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,690
Actually, I've been working up the nerve
to ask you for a while now.

176
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,026
Ever since I found this
taped behind your dresser drawer.

177
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,203
You searched our bedroom?

178
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,081
Yeah, 'cause it looks like
my wife's a freaking junkie!

179
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
I just...

180
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,165
I just don't get it.

181
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,091
We got out, Laura.

182
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,547
We got out of the Glades,

183
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,213
and here you are,
bringing it back into our home.

184
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,516
You are the last person
who can get on their high horse.

185
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,019
No matter what I've done,
I've never done drugs

186
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,100
and I've never done it
in our baby girl's home!

187
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,435
Screw you, Rene.

188
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,391
We're gonna be late for the game.

189
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,896
<i>He'!-</i>

190
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,565
Hey, sweetheart.

191
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,481
I'm sorry, Dada and Mommy
were just talking.

192
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,153
You were fighting.

193
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,443
No, we're just talking loudly.

194
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,113
Daddy's just disappointed that
Mommy's not coming with us to the game.

195
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,959
Go get your coat, honey.
It's gonna be cold tonight.

196
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,927
I'm throwing this away.

197
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,173
When I get home,
either there's no more drugs in this house

198
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,051
or there's no more you in this house.

199
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,434
Two of the victims
who were in critical condition

200
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,977
just passed away on the table.

201
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,769
Who?

202
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,773
Kyle in Commerce,
and Paula in Accounting.

203
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,153
Oh...

204
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,075
I need phone numbers
for their next of kin.

205
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,910
I've already emailed them to you.

206
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,959
Look, you are gonna find whoever did this.

207
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,996
I know. I have to.
Before he does it again.

208
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,712
What makes you so sure
this isn't just a one-time thing?

209
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,343
If it was a one-time thing,
he wouldn't have concealed his identity

210
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,549
and he wouldn't have fled the scene.
He's...

211
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,267
Uh, Adrian?

212
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,472
What are you doing?

213
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,103
Can you talk some sense into him, please?

214
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,559
Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife, Doris.

215
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,395
- Hi.
- He's gonna get himself killed.

216
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,777
I'm tougher than I look,
and I need to be in the office.

217
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,062
You need to be in bed, Adrian.

218
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,981
- You were shot.
- I'm fine.

219
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,774
You look like you're about to pass out.

220
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:17,447
Hey, listen, come on, buddy.
Take a seat, at least. Please.

221
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,119
What do we know?

222
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,334
We don't know much.

223
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,250
It was a single shooter.
AR-15 assault rifle.

224
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,260
And it doesn't appear
that I was his primary target

225
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,798
because he just
blasted his way through City Hall.

226
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,014
If he wasn't going after you,
then there's a larger agenda here.

227
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,264
AR-15's are the Bertinelli family's
weapon of choice.

228
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,440
Over 90% of the hits they were
involved in last year used them.

229
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,397
Why would the Bertinellis
target City Hall?

230
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,654
Because your office
oversees the Anti-Crime Unit.

231
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,690
And it is a softer target.

232
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,823
All right, we're gonna look into it
under one condition.

233
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,991
You listen to your wife and you stay here.
Let yourself get better.

234
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,409
Fair?

235
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,374
Fair.

236
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,873
Just stop this guy.

237
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,964
<i>Whoever he is,
he's not in the system.</i>

238
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,892
What if instead of tracking him,
we track the assault weapon?

239
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,054
Rifle. And Oliver took it.
Said he was following up a lead.

240
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,598
There's no gun ownership database
for me to go through, anyway.

241
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,983
Yeah, why wouldn't we want
something like that?

242
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,644
So the government
doesn't know our business, hoss.

243
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,153
Guys, can we please... Just not right now.

244
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,189
I don't have any problem
with your right to bear arms,

245
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,074
so long as it doesn't conflict
with my right to, you know, live.

246
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,406
Are you kidding me?
Look at what we do, man.

247
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,912
Our whole life is violence.

248
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,072
I'm not talking about what we do
to protect the city.

249
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,741
I'm talking about the fact that,
as a black man,

250
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,751
I am three times more likely
to be killed by a gun than you.

251
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,833
- He's got a point, Rene.
- Seriously?

252
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,039
You were a cop, man.

253
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,004
And cops would kind of like it if there
were less people out there with guns.

254
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,259
Not this cop.

255
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,674
I mean, people have a right
to protect themselves.

256
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,297
Dinah Drake.

257
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,014
Hi.

258
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,894
You guys are really serious about
this recruitment drive you got going, huh?

259
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,772
Dinah and I tried to get more information
on the shooting out of ESU.

260
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,931
We struck out.

261
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,567
We started trying to track the shooter
by using the gun,

262
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,775
but then we got a little distracted,
again, with our gun control debate.

263
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,780
- Gun violence debate.
- Here we go again.

264
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,108
- Guys, stop.
- Actually, this could be cathartic,

265
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,276
in light of what's happened...

266
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,411
No, I mean, "Stop, I have something" stop.

267
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,409
What've you got?

268
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,537
- Wait. That...
- That doesn't make sense.

269
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:33,757
This is the AR-15 assault rifle that was
used in the attack on City Hall!

270
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,217
Which one of your guys did it?

271
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,970
You're crazy. None of my guys would...

272
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,551
Your guys used this exact weapon!

273
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,513
Yeah, but why would we shoot up
the mayor's office?

274
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,969
The ACU.

275
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,515
We'd have to be crazier than you
to go to war with Anti-Crime.

276
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,067
And if any of my guys went off
the reservation like that, I'd know it.

277
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,940
And that man would be dead.

278
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,574
Now, are you gonna let me down,
or shoot me?

279
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,994
Don't move!

280
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,131
L just did you a favor.
One less criminal on the street.

281
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,792
Cold-blooded murder. You're the criminal!

282
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:24,843
I'm you. The only difference between us
is I use a more efficient weapon.

283
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,105
Arrow?

284
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,684
- Go.
- I've got the name of our shooter.

285
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,853
- Who is he?
- Well, that's the thing.

286
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,772
He's a 44-year-old systems analyst
with no criminal record.

287
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,113
He's absolutely nobody.

288
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:54,705
James Edlund. Husband and father
of two daughters, ages nine and 11.

289
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,251
Until 16 months ago.

290
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,586
What happened 16 months ago?

291
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,045
Crosspoint Mall shooting.

292
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,012
<i>Coming to you live at the mass
shooting at Crosspoint Mall today.</i>

293
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,348
<i>Edlund lost his whole family.</i>

294
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,431
<i>Online, Edlund was a pretty vocal
proponent of the SCGR.</i>

295
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,893
- What's that?
- It's the Star City Gun Registry.

296
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,559
The previous city leadership shot it down.

297
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,068
No pun intended.

298
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,608
So, City Hall doesn't pass a gun law,

299
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,900
this guy loses his whole family
and then takes revenge.

300
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,739
Where is he now?

301
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,613
That's the thing.
After the funeral, he quit his job

302
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,826
and his house is in foreclosure.

303
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,832
He's between the cracks now.

304
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,618
Well, I mean, he's somewhere.

305
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,129
Ollie, I can't hold them off any longer.

306
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,708
Okay. Quentin,
we have to make a statement.

307
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,172
Share the Edlund information with the SCPD

308
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,259
and then we hit the streets
and we find this guy!

309
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,468
- Eighteen people, by the way.
- What?

310
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:54,265
The mall shooting. 18 people killed,
12 injured. One's a quadriplegic now.

311
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,682
Look, I know where you're going with this,

312
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,442
but the Feds had an assault weapons
ban for years and it did nothing.

313
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,148
- Actually, it did...
- Sorry, hoss,

314
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,444
but if the bad guys got guns,
then I'm strapping up, too.

315
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,032
Go, go! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo! Go, go! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

316
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,620
- Yeah! Did you have fun, peanut?
- So awesome. Thanks, Daddy.

317
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,874
Of course.

318
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
Daddy?

319
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,295
Everything's fine, sweetheart. Um...

320
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,128
Go get your PJs on and get ready for bed.
I'm gonna go check on Mommy, all right?

321
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,603
At this time, our thoughts and our prayers

322
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:42,820
are with the injured
and the loved ones of the fallen.

323
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,485
This office is working tirelessly
with the SCPD and the Anti-Crime Unit

324
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,870
to make sure that Mr. Edlund,

325
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,955
the perpetrator
of this heinous act of violence,

326
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:00,963
is apprehended
and swiftly brought to justice.

327
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,666
I will be taking questions now.

328
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,254
Do you have any comment on rumors
that this shooting was in retaliation

329
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,515
for the preceding administration's failure
to pass a gun control ordinance?

330
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:14,428
Mr. Edlund is
a clearly disturbed individual,

331
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,315
but I can't comment
on his motivations at this time.

332
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,851
What is your administration's position
on the Star City Gun Registry?

333
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,026
That we will be looking into it further.

334
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,532
What's your administration's
position on gun control?

335
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,195
Er...

336
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,368
We're gonna examine all sides of that.

337
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,532
What is your personal opinion?

338
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,327
That it's complicated.

339
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,213
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but seven of your
staffers are dead

340
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,544
and others severely injured.

341
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,256
Don't you think you owe them
a response beyond "it's complicated"?

342
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,011
I do, I owe it to them.

343
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,058
I don't owe it
to any of you.

344
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,519
We're done here. Thank you.

345
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,100
Okay, well, that probably
could have gone better.

346
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,695
- Vultures. All of them.
- No, I appreciate that, Quentin,

347
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,402
but they're right.
I don't know how to deal with this.

348
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,818
You are dealing with this.
And Edlund, we will find...

349
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,236
And then what? He goes to jail.

350
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:18,537
Seven people that we lost are still dead.

351
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,005
My mission has always been
to save this city,

352
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,508
and my first instinct has almost
always been to use violence.

353
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,835
You didn't bring this on.

354
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,754
I know. I know.

355
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,885
It's a violent world and sometimes
it only responds to violence,

356
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:41,807
but we cannot dismiss the idea that we
are just feeding into a vicious cycle.

357
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,694
You ask me, this is a problem
that the Green Arrow can't solve.

358
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,818
<i>I mean, sure, you can find him,
you probably will.</i>

359
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,282
But this...

360
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,791
This is bigger than one nut-bar
with a bag full of guns.

361
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
He's right.

362
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,004
The solution here is not with you
as the Green Arrow,

363
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,459
it's with you as the mayor.

364
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,215
I just showed the entire city

365
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,676
that I don't know how to
handle this as the mayor.

366
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,178
So you try again,

367
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,555
and if that doesn't work,
damn it, you try again.

368
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,893
Nobody said being mayor of this city
was ever gonna be easy, Oliver.

369
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,148
We need a list.

370
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,985
Every alderman, councilman
and community leader

371
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,021
that was involved
in the previous gun-control ordinance,

372
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,191
I want them in here,
I want to meet with them today.

373
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,244
We're not gonna solve this right away.

374
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,156
Are you sure that you wanna
open that can of worms?

375
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,996
L just mean that gun control
is a big political third rail, so...

376
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,711
- Thea, come on.
- Thea, I understand.

377
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,883
This shouldn't be about politics.

378
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,805
This should be about safety and security.
Everyone's safety and security.

379
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,715
Whether they own a gun or not.

380
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,385
- Now, let's get to work.
- Okay.

381
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,157
Councilwoman, thank you very much
for meeting with me.

382
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,664
Well, from what I hear,
you've been making the rounds.

383
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,994
Well...

384
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,660
For someone without
a lot of political capital,

385
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,251
you're certainly making an
interesting choice as to how to spend it.

386
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,041
I have seven dead staffers
who wouldn't find it interesting at all.

387
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,051
And it's a terrible thing
that happened here.

388
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,711
It is terrible.

389
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,049
- Police make any progress locating Edlund?
- No, unfortunately.

390
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,014
But they're fairly confident
that he targeted City Hall

391
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,679
because of our inability
to enact the SCGR.

392
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,898
You implying I'm somehow
responsible for what happened?

393
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:52,312
No. But, Councilwoman,
you did kill the ordinance.

394
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,313
You really have been making the rounds.

395
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,734
Yes. I'm against any registry
that gives the government

396
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,904
the opportunity to keep tabs
on specific sectors of the population.

397
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,164
The DMV keeps a list of driver's licenses.

398
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,041
It's not a constitutional right
to drive a car, Mr. Mayor.

399
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,703
You know, people such as yourself
oppose limitations

400
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,587
on things like abortion,
freedom of speech.

401
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,420
Why is the Second Amendment
somehow less important in your eyes

402
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,300
than the other nine in the Bill of Rights?

403
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:19,430
Because people are dying, Councilwoman.
Right here in this building!

404
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:25,937
And there are limitations
on abortion and freedom of speech.

405
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,640
Both of my parents are dead.

406
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,443
My friend Tommy was...

407
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,571
He was one of the 503
killed in the Undertaking.

408
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,941
Laurel Lance was my friend.

409
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,284
Nobody respects the rights
of someone to protect themselves

410
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,409
and the people that they care for,
more than me.

411
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,836
But everything in life
comes with limitations. Everything.

412
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,504
Why are you telling me this?

413
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,758
Because you and I
are gonna sit in this office

414
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,635
until we figure out
a reasonable set of limitations

415
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,796
that respects everyone's rights.

416
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:08,270
Are you hungry?
Should I order something in?

417
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,481
We might be here a while.

418
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,529
- I don't know anything! I don't...
- Get up! Get up!

419
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,989
I know you've seen this scumbag.
He lives in this neighborhood!

420
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,499
I don't know everybody, dude! I don't!

421
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,257
Another dead end?

422
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,094
Let's just call it a long shot.

423
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,014
I'd be taking out my frustrations
on these lowlifes at this point.

424
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,520
Yeah, it happens.

425
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,937
Let's call it a night, huh?

426
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,395
Get you back to your not-so-homey home.

427
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,184
Seriously, John, it's fine.

428
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,771
Then, I just don't know why
you don't want better for yourself.

429
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,946
There was one place I kind of liked.

430
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,371
It's a studio apartment off Canal.

431
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,667
It had this nice little backyard garden.

432
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,921
I went to go fill out a lease application.
I don't know.

433
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,206
But what?

434
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,384
Nothing. It's stupid.

435
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,559
It asked questions, okay? It asked
questions about the last three years.

436
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,054
Jobs and residencies, that sort of thing.

437
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,565
Yeah, and I guess there was no box
to check for "vendetta." Right?

438
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,727
- Yeah, not so much, no.
- Yeah.

439
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,772
And it's not even just that. I...

440
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,984
You know, just forget it. It's so stupid.

441
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,824
Dinah, I work with Oliver Queen.

442
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,447
Please, try me.

443
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,287
Applying for an apartment is...

444
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,923
It's something normal people do.

445
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,761
I haven't had normal in a very long time.

446
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,345
I don't know
who I'm supposed to be anymore.

447
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,936
I remember I felt that way the first time
I was discharged from Special Services.

448
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:22,693
But, Dinah, I realized that I don't
have to be anybody. I'm already me.

449
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,738
I guess I had to give myself
permission to get back to that.

450
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,448
And how do you do that, exactly?

451
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,870
It starts with the little things.

452
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,459
Like a small studio apartment
with a garden.

453
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,704
Yeah.

454
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,464
Let's get out of here.

455
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,470
You got something?

456
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,304
- Nothing but strikeouts. You?
- Same.

457
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,101
Isn't Rene back yet?

458
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,516
Nope. Why?

459
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,271
You wanna go a couple more rounds at him?

460
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,103
Why don't you like us talking about this?

461
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,984
L just don't like you guys
arguing while I'm trying to work.

462
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,817
Why not? There's nothing wrong
with a little healthy debate, Felicity.

463
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,731
It's not healthy
if it doesn't accomplish anything,

464
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,276
and it's not going to accomplish anything.

465
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,831
Actually, I disagree.

466
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,785
Not about the part of it
not accomplishing anything,

467
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,329
but this idea that it's not healthy.

468
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,673
We used to talk about things
as a society, you know.

469
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,964
We'd debate and we would argue

470
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,345
and we would still
respect each other after.

471
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,723
Yeah. Somewhere along the line,
that just became...

472
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,341
- Rude.
- Rude. Yeah.

473
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,057
- It became impolitic to talk politics.
- Hmm.

474
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,017
Can't help but wonder that
maybe that's why

475
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:38,726
our country is the way it is today.

476
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,893
- Got something?
- Maybe.

477
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,193
Name of a support group
Edlund used to be a part of.

478
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,358
Maybe somebody there still knows
how to get in contact with him.

479
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,868
Text Rene the address
and have him meet me there.

480
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,152
Yeah.

481
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,122
I didn't care. It was just a necklace.

482
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,585
But, Steve,
he got in front of the man and...

483
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,956
Every time I close my eyes,
I see the gun.

484
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,332
Every time.

485
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,885
<i>It gets better, Monica.
We get better.</i>

486
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,014
I'm afraid we're out of time for today,
but get some coffee on the way out,

487
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,550
and I sprung for
the good donuts this week.

488
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,343
Thank you.

489
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,066
Hey, man.

490
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,398
Name's Rene Ramirez,
I work for the Deputy Mayor.

491
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,905
- This is my assistant.
- In his dreams. Er...

492
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,741
I mean, yeah, kind of.

493
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,531
Can we ask you some questions
about James Edlund?

494
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,284
Participation in this group
is confidential.

495
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,789
You know what Edlund did?

496
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,747
I watched the mayor's press conference
and I wish I could help,

497
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,880
but you have to understand,
I take confidentiality seriously.

498
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,588
Sir, confidentiality doesn't apply when
there's the possibility of future harm.

499
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,179
Hey, we just want to find this guy
before anyone else gets hurt.

500
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,511
- Why aren't the police doing this?
- Don't worry.

501
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,760
We'll make sure the information
gets to the right people.

502
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,892
I heard he was staying with a friend.

503
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,561
Let me see if I can get you the address.

504
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,603
Felicity said you wanted me here.

505
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,444
Was it 'cause you wanted me
to hear that woman's story?

506
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,946
No. But since you did...

507
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,278
Doesn't change how I feel, man.

508
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,290
Guns save lives. Period.

509
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:23,836
<i>- You just want to think that.
- No, that's what I know.</i>

510
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:28,500
'Cause if I had my gun,
my wife would still be alive.

511
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,425
Here you go.
I don't know if it's still good.

512
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,339
Thank you.

513
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,895
I didn't even know you were married.

514
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,600
Not something I like to talk about.
Let's call this in.

515
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,658
Let go! Let...

516
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,984
Get away...

517
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,788
Back off. Your bitch wife here
owes me for her last high.

518
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,917
- Rene.
- Yeah, okay. Okay, fine. How much?

519
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,377
Money's right there in the safe.

520
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,084
Let me hook you up.

521
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,625
- $500.
- No problem.

522
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,181
- Zoe?

523
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,808
Zoe, get back in your room!

524
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,863
Daddy!

525
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,201
- Daddy!
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

526
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,211
Are you all right? Are you okay? Huh?

527
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,796
Mommy!

528
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,213
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

529
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,728
Clear.

530
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,022
But Edlund was here. Look.

531
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,065
This is his family.

532
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:22,071
Yo, check it out. Floor plan.

533
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,791
He planned out his attacks.

534
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,254
Yeah, but this, this doesn't
match City Hail. This is...

535
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,210
Oh, damn.

536
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,087
I know what he's gonna hit next.

537
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,595
Lam still failing to understand
why a simple registry would...

538
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,348
Okay, first of all,
registries are never simple.

539
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,811
They're bureaucracies, tying up
Second Amendment rights in red tape,

540
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,813
you know, and it's not just
the owners who'll be affected.

541
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,771
It's the sellers who're gonna see
a substantial decline in their businesses.

542
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,776
Well, I don't think that it's unre...

543
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,356
Excuse me.

544
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,111
- Yeah.
- Rene and Curtis found Edlund's crib

545
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,245
and a plan to shoot up Starling General.

546
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,248
Assemble the team, tell Lance
to bring in the ACU. I'm on my way.

547
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,951
I have to go.

548
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,463
- I thought we're staying till we're done.
- I'm terribly sorry, but I have to go.

549
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,469
We're in position. Northeast corner.

550
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,060
I'm on the southwest.

551
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,606
Overwatch?

552
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,316
No sign of the bastard.

553
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,652
But remember, he's good
at avoiding security cameras.

554
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,908
Hey, don't! Don't!
Get out of here. Go, go.

555
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,538
Mommy.

556
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,335
- Don't do this.
- Get back.

557
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:59,426
You had another chance
to shoot me at City Hall.

558
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,508
You didn't do it.

559
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,850
Because you need me
to enact the Star City Gun Registry.

560
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,311
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

561
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:16,394
You wanna punish the city
because we failed to protect your family.

562
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,486
But... Hey, hey!

563
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,158
Mr. Edlund...

564
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,370
I... I checked.

565
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,376
The man who killed your family,

566
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,206
he acquired those guns illegally.

567
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,547
There's nothing that we could've done.
No... No...

568
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,715
No registry would've
helped us protect them.

569
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,549
I know.

570
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,643
I was supposed to protect them.

571
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:54,772
Isn't that a man's job?
To protect his family?

572
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,025
Isn't that why we have guns?

573
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,945
<i>My wife and daughters were innocent.</i>

574
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,865
- I can understand why you're angry.
- We're all angry!

575
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,411
We're all so angry all the time.

576
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,577
So, why shouldn't I use this?

577
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,244
Why shouldn't I kill everyone?
Put us all out of our damn misery!

578
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,584
Mr. Edlund, that's not your call to make.

579
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:26,047
Yeah, I mean, people are angry
and we're hurting and we're lashing out

580
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,513
and I can understand that it feels
like it's getting worse every day,

581
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,894
but what you're doing is not the answer!

582
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,684
The people that you hurt,

583
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,817
the seven people that are dead,

584
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,238
my friend, they were innocent, too.

585
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:49,910
You're right.

586
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,617
And I deserve to be punished.

587
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,253
Hey, hey, hey. Look, James,

588
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,297
you got to think about
your wife and your daughters.

589
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,333
Lam thinking about them.

590
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,798
I know that you want this pain to go away,

591
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,383
and I know that you wanna
be with your family again,

592
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,347
but if you want them to live on,

593
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,478
it has to be through you.

594
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,891
That's the only way.

595
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,155
James, give me the gun.

596
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,315
Please.

597
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,681
When you ran out on me last night,
you neglected to mention

598
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,517
that it was to go
help people at a hospital.

599
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,976
I'm forgetful that way.

600
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,140
Shooter in custody?

601
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,560
DA Chase says that he is
gonna plead guilty to everything.

602
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,570
Councilwoman Pollard,
this is Rene Ramirez.

603
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,606
He works very closely
with Deputy Mayor Lance,

604
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:12,453
and he is a very, very vocal proponent
of gun ownership rights.

605
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,289
Freedom isn't free.
Not even the freedom to bear arms.

606
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:20,498
So, Mr. Ramirez and I got together
and came up with this.

607
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,707
What is this?

608
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,705
Citywide gun control ordinances.

609
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,543
Nothing that makes it harder
to buy or own or carry a gun.

610
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:32,385
It also doesn't prohibit people from
protecting themselves from gun violence.

611
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,724
Okay, I'm gonna back you on this.
If for no other reason

612
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,605
than the optics of fighting this
after what happened are lousy.

613
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,232
There are other reasons,
too, Councilwoman.

614
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,313
But I wanna be
perfectly clear about something.

615
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,354
Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually,

616
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,522
I'm going to extract
a political prize for this.

617
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,861
You can count on that.

618
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,576
Sounds like a yes.

619
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,574
I can live with what you got here.

620
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,203
Good, because living is the whole point.

621
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,421
Just listen...

622
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:13,093
I messed up, I know that,
but Zoe already lost her mother.

623
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,846
"Unsafe environment"?
What's that even mean?

624
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,309
I'm so sorry.

625
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,352
I'm so sorry.

626
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,930
I, um...

627
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,391
Ma'am, I can get counseling.

628
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,443
L just wanna see my daughter.

629
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,901
Please, I just wanna see her.

630
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:35,069
Ma'am, ma'am, please don't do that.
Don't hang up the phone on me.

631
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,538
Ma'am, please. Hello? Hello?

632
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,289
Son of a bitch!

633
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,623
<i>Damien Darhk, the man
behind tonight's siege of Star City,</i>

634
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,134
<i>was killed by the masked vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.</i>

635
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,262
<i>Amateur cell phone video
captured this very moment,</i>

636
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,220
<i>putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.</i>

637
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,929
<i>Before Darhk was killed,</i>

638
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:02,687
<i>the citizens of Star City demonstrated
there is strength in numbers,</i>

639
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,976
<i>as they fought against their attackers
alongside the Green Arrow,</i>

640
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,852
<i>leading Darhk's allies to retreat.</i>

641
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,375
Oh, yo. Can I talk to you for a second?

642
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,839
Yeah. What's up?

643
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,344
I just wanted to apologize for getting
in your face earlier about guns and stuff.

644
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,929
Hoss, do I seem like
I can't handle tough talk?

645
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:47,600
No, but I didn't know about your wife
and your daughter.

646
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,814
I may have done a little googling.

647
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,196
I don't like to talk about it, man.

648
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,989
I mean, Zoe's in a foster home.

649
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,161
A good one, it looks like.

650
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,332
CPS is right.
She shouldn't be anywhere near me.

651
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,252
I don't agree with that, Rene,

652
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,670
and I have a lawyer friend
who doesn't, either.

653
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,178
How about we get your daughter back?

654
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,264
Hey. Just checking on you.

655
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,059
You, uh, going somewhere?

656
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,063
A studio apartment with a garden.

657
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,477
You applied for the lease.

658
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,733
I got the lease.

659
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,734
Yes. Small steps, huh?

660
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,412
Well, the apartment is not
the only thing I applied for.

661
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,823
- Hmm.
- You're looking at the latest recruit

662
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,457
into the SCPD.

663
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,416
- Congratulations, Detective Drake.
- Thank you.

664
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,001
Well, you did it.
I just gave you a little push.

665
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:58,546
Well, uh, I needed the push.
So, thank you.

666
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,046
Congrats.

667
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,435
Thank you, all, for being here.

668
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,598
In light of what's happened,
I thought it important

669
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:15,191
that we gather as a city
and remember those that we've lost.

670
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,150
<i>After everything that Star City
has endured in the past several years,</i>

671
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,537
it would be easy to become immune

672
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:30,078
or desensitized to the violence
that pervades our lives.

673
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,131
And it would be human to want
to respond to that violence with violence.

674
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,965
When I think of
all the people that I've lost,

675
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,476
I remember the choices that I was forced
to make in light of those tragedies.

676
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,973
Some choices were easy.

677
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,313
But the important choices,
the choices that were worth making,

678
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,525
they were hard.

679
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,984
And hard choices require bravery.

680
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,530
Fortunately, we live
in the home of the brave.

681
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,408
We don't run from hard choices.

682
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:13,169
We rise up and we face tomorrow together.

683
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:19,468
This afternoon, Councilwoman Pollard and I

684
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:25,341
met with the city council to pass
the Star City Firearms Freedom Act,

685
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,176
<i>a policy that respects our freedom</i>

686
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,683
and our lives.

687
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,731
It shows that we can do both.

688
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,530
And now we just have to be
brave enough to do it.
