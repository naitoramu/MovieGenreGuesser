1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:02,824
Previously, on "Arrow"
and "Flash"...

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:03,579
Thanks, mister.

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:04,987
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,536
Barry said that
you need our help.

5
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:10,538
Somebody very
dangerous is after you.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,441
Give her to me and I'll
make your death fast.

7
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:16,611
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

8
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,346
An immortal.

9
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,830
Chay-Ara,
it's me, Khufu.

10
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:22,531
We're drawn to each
other in each life,

11
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,099
and after we die,
we reincarnate.

12
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,701
Do you know who
Vandal Savage is?

13
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,469
In every lifetime,
he hunts us down.

14
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:30,138
We think he's trying
to locate the Staff of Horus.

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,577
I'm never going to become
who I really am unless I let go.

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,146
No!

17
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:41,216
Chay-Ara.

18
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,898
Price Khufu, my son.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,800
What have you come
to offer?

20
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:01,570
Father, we bring
this tribute

21
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:04,439
to the protector to all
we see and know, Horus.

22
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,774
Praise be upon him.

23
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:07,609
It is a fine
offering, Khufu.

24
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,311
At least worthy
of a God.

25
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,480
And yet,
priestess Chay-Ara

26
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:13,815
does not seem to agree.

27
00:01:13,817 --> 00:01:16,551
Your offering is
lovely, my prince.

28
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:18,553
If not a bit naive.

29
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:21,857
Naive?

30
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:25,660
To think that Horus
would be appeased by...

31
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,195
trifles.

32
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:28,663
The portents of his
dissatisfaction

33
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,766
grow with each
passing day.

34
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,235
The celestial rocks used to fall
once a generation;

35
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:35,470
now they strike
with each phase of the moon.

36
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,472
I thought it was your job
to keep Horus in a good mood...

37
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:39,007
Priestess.

38
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,844
Priestess Chay-Ara
only speaks out of concern for all.

39
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:45,714
Otherwise, she would
remain a bit more...

40
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,649
Polite.

41
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,985
We have warned you time
and again of the sky rocks

42
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:52,320
and the threat
they pose to the court

43
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:56,691
of Ramses the Wise.
Dark times are coming, my pharaoh.

44
00:01:56,693 --> 00:02:00,162
Prayers and trifles will
not be enough to stop it.

45
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:05,233
Priestess.

46
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:08,236
You spoke with quite
the tongue in there.

47
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,272
Did I overact?

48
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:13,308
No. I love your tongue.

49
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,186
You ok?

50
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:27,055
Yeah, I'm fine,
I just have a headache.

51
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:29,157
Are you sure?
Usually that's a sign

52
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,660
of your memories
returning.

53
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:33,695
Yeah, I'm sure.

54
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:36,331
I can't remember
anything yet.

55
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:41,570
A bunch of superheroes
in a farmhouse?

56
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:43,572
I feel like I've seen that
in a movie before.

57
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:45,307
We need
a secure location.

58
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:46,875
What's wrong
with S.T.A.R. Labs?

59
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,543
Well, I mean, absolutely nothing
if you forget about

60
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:50,178
the revolving door
you guys installed

61
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,847
so the bad guys can come and go
as they please.

62
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,415
Remind me again
what happened to your old lair,

63
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,050
or the one before that.

64
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:57,285
Well, lair number
one was compromised by the police,

65
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:59,054
and...

66
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,388
I will stop helping.

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,324
Savage only let
Barry and I live

68
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:05,060
because he felt Kendra start to
emerge as Hawkgirl and went after her.

69
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:07,095
He can sense
her and Carter's presence.

70
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,779
We don't need to make it easier on him
by staying in the city limits.

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,666
Bet you wish you were
staying at your mother's place now.

72
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:13,068
We need to find a way

73
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,836
to neutralize
Savage's advantage.

74
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:16,771
Barry, you're late.

75
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:19,407
Sorry. It turns out, it's not easy
finding the ass end of nowhere.

76
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,610
Yeah, for real.
The roaming charges alone

77
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:22,844
are going to bankrupt me.

78
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,153
We're discussing
how to take away

79
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:24,182
Savage's newfound power.

80
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,038
And his magic stick thing.

81
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,183
Yeah, Staff of Horus.

82
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:29,384
Well, it's protected
by some kind of energy field.

83
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:30,485
I couldn't lay
a finger on it.

84
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,254
Maybe you wear
mittens next time.

85
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:34,389
What if we made some sort
of insulated gauntlets...

86
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:36,324
Oh, yeah, yeah, the magnetic shielding
could disrupt the--

87
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:37,559
The staff's magnetic polarity.

88
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:39,094
Well, while
the geek squad works--

89
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,662
Heard that, honey.

90
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:42,297
While they work to get
the staff away from Savage,

91
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,900
we need to know everything
there is to know about him.

92
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:47,903
Well, I googled
reincarnated nut jobs

93
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:49,604
and came up
with nothing.

94
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:51,506
Kendra and I would
be the reincarnated nut jobs.

95
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,008
Savage is
merely immortal.

96
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,677
Merely?
Welcome to the new normal.

97
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,646
Anyone who's been around for 4,000 years
should leave a trail.

98
00:03:57,648 --> 00:03:59,314
I'll check with A.R.G.U.S., see if they
have anything on him.

99
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:01,416
Laurel and I can check police reports
and stuff like that.

100
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:04,119
Good. We need
to find a way to utilize

101
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,798
your new ability.

102
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:05,855
My ability?

103
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,789
It might give us
an advantage.

104
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,391
Yeah, whatever you do,
don't let him train you.

105
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:10,892
I'm sorry,
but when it rains,

106
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:12,694
I can still feel where he shot me
with those arrows.

107
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:13,801
I'll handle her training, then.

108
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:14,730
Yeah.

109
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:16,298
Oliver.

110
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,966
Uh, I need to run
something down.

111
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:21,303
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

112
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:24,205
And what exactly
are you running down?

113
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,740
Don't worry,
it's nothing dangerous.

114
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:27,409
Well, are you ok?

115
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,344
Well, we're up against an
immortal mad man

116
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,879
armed with
a magical staff,

117
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,314
so I do have a few
things on my mind.

118
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,082
Yeah, but you were
acting fine with everything

119
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,850
while we were home,

120
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,519
and now that we're here
in Central City,

121
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,854
you've just been not...you.

122
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:42,891
Well, maybe it's too
bright and sunny for me here.

123
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:45,493
There is something
going on,

124
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,996
and I am going
to tell you all about it.

125
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:51,657
I would just like the chance to know
what I'm dealing with first.

126
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:52,703
Ok.

127
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,048
Ok.

128
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:56,972
Hey!

129
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:59,374
You must be going
through a lot right now.

130
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:01,643
Yeah. You know,
we should talk.

131
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:04,980
Never in the history of romance have
those words ever meant anything good.

132
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:07,015
I just mean we
should probably talk

133
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,137
about everything
that's happened--

134
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:08,993
that's happening.

135
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,019
You know what,

136
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,553
I'm going to suggest
something radical here

137
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,521
and say let's not talk.

138
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,490
Look, you've got a lot
on your plate right now.

139
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,158
And I just don't want to be that piece
of very nutritious broccoli

140
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,194
that you scrape off the plate
to give to the dog.

141
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:20,295
My point being,

142
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:21,863
I don't think you can afford

143
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:24,733
to be distracted
right now.

144
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:26,034
Let's go.

145
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:27,235
Yes.

146
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:28,837
Let's.

147
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,905
Sorry, buddy,
this is private.

148
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,140
Private?

149
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:34,075
Yep.

150
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:40,081
I'm just going to go do some
push-ups over there.

151
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:43,184
Open it.

152
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,754
Why? What's inside?

153
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:49,124
Something we have to track down
in each of our incarnations.

154
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:51,126
Sometimes I find it;
Sometimes you find me

155
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:52,727
and we go look
for it together.

156
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,163
4,000 years, 206 lives.

157
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:57,799
We've seen about every
combination there is.

158
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,811
I don't think
I'm really--

159
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,046
Ready for this.

160
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,947
You say that
in every lifetime.

161
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,951
Look, as you emerge,
as your memories come back to you,

162
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,653
so will other things.

163
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,513
Skills, languages,
pieces of your private life.

164
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,348
Katalavaíneis?

165
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:24,093
Déchomai.

166
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,293
There you go.

167
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,996
This is nuts.

168
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:29,831
It's ok.
I'll help you through it.

169
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,666
Yeah, well, the last
time you helped me,

170
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:33,401
I got pushed
off a building.

171
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:35,003
Yes, and after that,
you, uh, you soared,

172
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,137
if I remember
correctly.

173
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,272
And that is
because anger, fear,

174
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:38,907
adrenaline--those
are the things

175
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,708
that bring out
the warrior within.

176
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,510
Well, according to Savage,
I'm a priestess.

177
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:44,512
The clergy
were warriors.

178
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:46,815
Warrior priests,

179
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,451
and that is the side that you
need to remember.

180
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:52,320
And if I can't?

181
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,622
Well, then, we'll both
probably die.

182
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:57,392
Again.

183
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,201
It's your turn.

184
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:07,869
All right,
let's not be late.

185
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:10,705
You all set?

186
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:12,774
There you go.

187
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:16,177
Oliver?

188
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:18,012
Hi!

189
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:20,515
Uh, hold on one second.

190
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:22,016
What are you doing here?

191
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:24,486
So sorry to just
drop by unannounced.

192
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,287
I came to town
the other day,

193
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,922
and I saw you
with your son.

194
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,057
William.

195
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:30,692
William?

196
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,127
That's a nice name.

197
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,962
Oliver, what are you
doing at my house?

198
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:35,430
I saw you
and William together,

199
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:38,533
and it's difficult
not to wonder,

200
00:07:38,535 --> 00:07:41,302
because he is,
what, nine?

201
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,471
And you know, we had a thing
10 years ago...

202
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:45,093
Ok, let me stop you right there.

203
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:46,142
All right.

204
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,242
William isn't yours.

205
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:50,245
I told you I lost
our baby, Oliver,

206
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:54,449
and I met William's father two months
after moving to Central City.

207
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,717
So...

208
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:57,385
Mom, we're going
to miss the game.

209
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:59,191
Sorry, I have to go.

210
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,060
No, go.

211
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,557
Ok.

212
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,692
Oh, here you are.

213
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,828
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

214
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,730
Wish William good luck for me,
all right?

215
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:11,032
I will.

216
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:23,378
Now's not a good
time, Malcolm.

217
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,113
I've arranged a meeting
with Vandal Savage.

218
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:26,648
You, me,
and the speedster.

219
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,550
What? Wait, why--

220
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:30,418
Because negotiation
is the only way out

221
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,819
of this situation,
Oliver.

222
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,755
Savage is going
to decimate Central City

223
00:08:33,757 --> 00:08:35,723
to get what he wants.

224
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,992
If your child were here,
you would understand.

225
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:40,328
Suit up. I've already
spoke with fleet feet,

226
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,763
he's on his way.

227
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:56,277
Thank you for coming.

228
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,513
I know this is more
than a little crazy.

229
00:08:58,515 --> 00:09:01,649
Yeah, well, your friend
with the creepy ring asked so nicely.

230
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:04,252
Please tell me we're
not going to negotiate with terrorists.

231
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,722
Or, you know, 4,000
year old bad guys.

232
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:09,224
Just think of this more
as a fact-finding mission.

233
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:10,959
Maybe Savage slips up
and gives us something

234
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:12,860
that we can use
to our advantage.

235
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,096
Thea said you were
being a little more humorous lately.

236
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,464
I'm sorry, how do
you know so much

237
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,832
about Savage,
anyway?

238
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,167
I don't know anything
about him,

239
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,535
Mr. Allen. No one does.

240
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,337
That is why
I'm afraid of him.

241
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,607
That's not the only reason
to be afraid of me.

242
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:26,768
I assure you.

243

245
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,146
Thank you for joining me.
What do you want?

246
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,246
What all living
things want--

247
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:43,522
not to die.

248
00:09:43,523 --> 00:09:45,389
I thought that wasn't a problem
for you.

249
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,558
Only if I take the lifeforce
from Prince Khufu

250
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,126
and Priestess Chay-Ara.

251
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,062
Kendra and Carter.

252
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:53,498
The three of us are locked
in a vicious circle

253
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,067
played out over
thousands of years.

254
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,436
None of your concern.

255
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:01,239
We've made it
our concern.

256
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,847
Robin of Locksley.

257
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:12,683
I taught him how
to use a bow.

258
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:15,920
He taught me how
to not feel pain.

259
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:17,889
I'm the enemy
you can't defeat.

260
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,892
The only way for you and yours
to live through this

261
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:23,928
is to render onto me
what is mine.

262
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,330
Turn over Prince Khufu
and Princess Chay-Ara

263
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,132
within 24 hours,

264
00:10:28,134 --> 00:10:30,067
or I will lay waste
to this city,

265
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:34,105
killing everyone
that you hold dear.

266
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:36,841
And after that, I will
travel to your home,

267
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,476
and do the same thing there.

268
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:39,777
All right,
I'm just curious--

269
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,212
did you rehearse
that speech

270
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,380
in a mirror
this morning,

271
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:43,981
or this all
just off the cuff?

272
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,320
Why would you
risk the lives

273
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:52,857
of your friends and family
for two strangers?

274
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:55,860
206 times I have killed him.

275
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:58,195
What hubris possesses you

276
00:10:58,197 --> 00:11:01,666
that makes you think that you can
prevent me from doing so again?

277
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,634
Not hubris.

278
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:05,336
Hope.

279
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:08,272
I came to this meeting
out of curiosity.

280
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,308
It is now sated.

281
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,511
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara to
Jurgens Industrial in twenty-four hours

282
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,013
or I will see you
dead and buried

283
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:18,683
under the bodies
of your loved ones.

284
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:25,489
We're not giving up
Kendra and Carter.

285
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:26,991
That's not
your decision to make.

286
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:28,626
This is a cycle
that has played out

287
00:11:28,628 --> 00:11:30,194
for the last 4,000 years.

288
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,996
Savage may be immortal,
but he isn't a God.

289
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:33,431
No, but he's
the next best thing.

290
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,321
Oliver!

291
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,601
What?!

292
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,335
You better be certain
that your stubbornness

293
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:39,170
does not get
my daughter killed.

294
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,705
Because if that happens,

295
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,640
I will come for you.

296
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:44,675
And in a way that will
make you beg

297
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:47,478
for the likes
of Vandal Savage.

298
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:49,747
24 hours.

299
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,182
Until what?

300
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,517
Until we are supposed
to hand you and Carter

301
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,785
over to Savage, or--

302
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:56,386
Savage lays waste
to Central City.

303
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,489
Yeah.

304
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,391
We've been through this before.
1887, the Huang he floods,

305
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:01,826
Savage killed nearly
two million people

306
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,294
to get to us.
And he did.

307
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,729
We weren't helping you then.
We are now.

308
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:07,098
We have 24 hours to come up
with a workable plan.

309
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,933
No, this is insane.

310
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,002
My life isn't worth millions
of people's lives.

311
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,269
Kendra.

312
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,196
I'll talk to her.

313
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,006
Yeah.

314
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,206
Hey, I got this.

315
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,108
I said,
I'll talk to her.

316
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,709
Hey, here's an idea--

317
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:21,579
why don't we just toss him
over to Vandal Savage?

318
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:23,114
Where were you?

319
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,382
Hey.

320
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:26,450
You missed the whole,
save the city

321
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,719
or turn my girlfriend over t
 an immortal psychopath briefing.

322
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:31,522
Yeah, sorry.
Um, dude, last night, I, um,

323
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,724
I ghosted.

324
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:35,135
No.

325
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,761
Yeah, I think
I'm going--

326
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:36,961
Don't say it.

327
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:38,062
I think I'm going
to time jump.

328
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:40,031
I just told you
not to say it!

329
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,233
I'm sorry. I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

330
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:44,502
The first rule of time travel is you
don't talk about time travel!

331
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,971
Because by having this conversation,
we're screwing history!

332
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:48,739
Look, I know that time travel
has consequences.

333
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:50,541
I mean, the last
time you vibed--

334
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,309
Well, I'm not vibing
anything right now.

335
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,445
Okay, um, all right,
look, don't panic.

336
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:56,747
A., you don't know that you
time jumped for a bad reason.

337
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,516
It could have been
a good one, right?

338
00:12:58,518 --> 00:12:59,917
B., now that you know
you time jumped,

339
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,986
you might not
do it, right?

340
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,855
So knowing the future might
change the present,

341
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:07,992
which might
change the future.

342
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,160
What?

343
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,228
My head hurts.

344
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,030
Chay-Ara--sorry, Kendra--

345
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,732
you shouldn't run off.
We don't know is Savage is--

346
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:16,233
Do we ever
kill ourselves?

347
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,735
Excuse me?

348
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,537
In our prior lives.

349
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,405
Savage has to kill us in order
to live forever.

350
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:24,608
Do we ever kill ourselves in order
to deny him that?

351
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,110
You know,
in our past lives,

352
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:27,812
I'm typically the one
that makes the plans,

353
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:29,447
and I'm starting
to think

354
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:30,948
this is probably why.

355
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,118
Everyone in there
is willing to die to protect us.

356
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,121
You don't think
that's a little bit insane?

357
00:13:37,123 --> 00:13:38,389
No.

358
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:39,890
I think it's noble.

359
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:42,259
I think it's what makes
them all heroes.

360
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:43,994
Yeah, well, heroes or not,

361
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:46,130
I'm not letting anyone
die for me.

362
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:48,065
Then don't.

363
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:51,068
Be the person,
the woman,

364
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,739
the warrior you were
meant to be.

365
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,441
The one you always
have been.

366
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:02,079
Come at me.

367
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,197
What?

368
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,015
Hit me.

369
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,816
Or...try to.

370
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:07,384
Yeah, well, as much
as I'd like to do that,

371
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,186
I'm really not
in the mood right now.

372
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:11,088
Oh, really? Well,
I'll just tell Savage

373
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,623
to come back
when you are.

374
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,262
Ow!

375
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:21,232
Again.

376
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:32,076
Again.

377
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,513
Ahh! Ahh!

378
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,551
Good.

379
00:14:40,553 --> 00:14:42,820
Do you feel that?

380
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:44,221
The rage?

381
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,056
That's the key,
Kendra.

382
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,458
It's the only way
of finding

383
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,183
the warrior within.

384
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:48,994
Hey.

385
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:52,196
Sorry
to interrupt...

386
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,231
The weirdness.
Um, John,

387
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,466
Laurel,
and Thea are back,

388
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:57,168
and they've
got something.

389
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,036
Where are
Oliver and Barry?

390
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:01,205
Oliver's back in secret-keeping
mode, apparently.

391
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,506
Barry, I don't know.
Caitlin and Cisco

392
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:03,941
are working
on the anti-staff gauntlets.

393
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:06,110
What do you guys have?

394
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:09,580
Beta Max. Aww, what,
did you guys get this off of eBay?

395
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:11,148
Lyla hooked us up.

396
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,349
Yeah, well, it's going
to take a while to play

397
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,717
since we live
in a digital world now.

398
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,820
The tape came from
a conspiracy theory group

399
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:17,655
that's interested
in Savage.

400
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,456
Pentagon had a file
on Savage back in '86,

401
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,025
but it's all been
heavily redacted.

402
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:22,259
Got it.

403
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,028
Is this on?

404
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,063
I hope so.

405
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:28,599
My name is
Dr. Aldus Boardman.

406
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:30,935
I'm a professor at
St. Roch University.

407
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:34,705
The date is
April 8th, 1975.

408
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:37,041
I don't think anyone
else knows this,

409
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:40,244
and those that do,
don't believe.

410
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:42,713
He's a myth.
An urban legend.

411
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:46,483
He has been compared
to Machiavelli and Nostradamus.

412
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:49,520
He's gone by many names,
but I know him as Vandal Savage,

413
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:51,755
and he will be
the death of the world.

414
00:15:51,757 --> 00:15:55,092
But I believe there is a way
to stop him.

415
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:59,597
Savage is an immortal,
Egyptian priest.

416
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,098
His long life
is a result

417
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,933
of an unearthly
calamity.

418
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:06,704
I believe that any object
associated with this calamity

419
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:10,774
should be able to undo its effects
and kill him.

420
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:13,477
And I suspect that our
precious, fragile world

421
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:17,982
may one day depend
upon us doing so.

422
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,650
Well, that's the understatement
of the year.

423
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,919
Or, you know,
the last 4,000 years.

424
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,487
Do you have any idea
what he meant by these objects?

425
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,189
This calamity?

426
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:26,824
No, I--I don't
recall a calamity.

427
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,626
The staff.

428
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:29,410
Staff of Horus?

429
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:30,295
Yes.

430
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:31,962
I think the staff
belonged to Savage

431
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:33,297
back in
ancient Egypt.

432
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,832
You remember?

433
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,700
It's a hunch.

434
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:39,703
And if Professor Boardman's
guess is right,

435
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:41,739
that staff has
helped me kill Savage.

436
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,275
Ok, someone needs to inform
Oliver and Barry.

437
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,113
Ok, here you go.
I gene sequenced

438
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:51,081
the hair strand with the blood
sample you gave me.

439
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,050
Still not sure what it has
to do with Damian Darhk,

440
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,520
but the Y chromosomes match.

441
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:59,924
Are you ok?

442
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:01,892
Thanks for this,
it's a big help.

443
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,527
Yeah, well--

444
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,386
Barry.

445
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,063
Yeah?

446
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:07,631
Don't tell anyone about this.

447
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:11,435
All right, I'd like to know
what's going on here.

448
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:12,381
Felicity...

449
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:13,571
Yes, I tracked you down.

450
00:17:13,572 --> 00:17:15,673
I find people for a living.
Actually, I don't get paid, but--

451
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,041
what was that?

452
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:19,176
What was what?

453
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:20,744
You just super-speeded
something into your pocket.

454
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:23,380
Oh, um, no, nothing.

455
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:25,182
Um, well,
actually, it's, um,

456
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:27,051
it's something Oliver wanted me
to track down.

457
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,619
It's, uh, it's about
Damian Darhk--

458
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:30,233
I want to see it.

459
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:30,689
Why?

460
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,690
Because you don't
want me to see it.

461
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,591
I'm sorry, Oliver
specifically asked me--

462
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:35,290
Show me.

463
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:36,661
Ok...

464
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:38,562
I don't know what
the big deal is.

465
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:40,864
It's just a DNA test.

466
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:45,369
No, it's not.

467
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,747
Honey, why don't you
finish that inside?

468
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:58,682
Mom, the Flash hasn't
saved the city yet.

469
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:00,050
Now, honey.

470
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:05,322
Can we talk?

471
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:06,423
Look, I don't know
what you're trying

472
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:07,758
to accomplish here, Oliver.

473
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,259
I know, Samantha.

474
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,998
I know that William
is my son.

475
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:18,335
Ok...

476
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,536
Why didn't you
tell me?

477
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,573
Ok, just keep
your voice down.

478
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:24,274
Your mother told me not to.

479
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:25,676
What?!

480
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:27,444
She offered me
a million dollars

481
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,713
to tell you that I miscarried.

482
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:32,383
My mother was
a complicated person,

483
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:33,917
but she would
never do that.

484
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,723
Wait here.

485
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,533
Here.

486
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:54,304
I never cashed it.

487
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:56,073
I didn't need
her money to know

488
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:58,008
I didn't want her anywhere
near my child.

489
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,177
Or me anywhere near him.

490
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,379
So what, he can be
just like his dad?

491
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:06,016
Punching out paparazzi
and getting young girls knocked up?

492
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:07,851
Samantha, I'm not
that person anymore.

493
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:10,287
I know, I know.
You're--you're running for mayor,

494
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,989
your mother was killed.

495
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,991
Your friend Tommy,
you're a different person now.

496
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:15,726
But can you
really tell me

497
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:18,062
that your life
is any less crazy?

498
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,963
Can you honestly
say that William isn't better off

499
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:22,666
with your world
kept away from his?

500
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:25,469
No, you're right,
I'm being selfish.

501
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,738
But I want an opportunity
to get to know my son,

502
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,140
and I think that a young boy
deserves the opportunity

503
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:31,909
to get to know
his father.

504
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:33,744
He's happy.

505
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,813
He's--he's
well-adjusted.

506
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:38,615
I don't want to run the risk of him
getting sucked into your orbit.

507
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:41,018
That can't happen.
Which means...

508
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,253
That he can't know
that you're his father.

509
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:44,688
And nobody else can.

510
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,423
I don't care
if that sounds harsh.

511
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,292
I'm his mother, and I
will do whatever--

512
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:51,128
whatever I feel I have
to do to protect him.

513
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,764
Samantha, there is
someone in my life now.

514
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:56,834
Please, don't make me
keep this from her.

515
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:59,203
Oliver, you will
if you want

516
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,871
a relationship
with my son.

517
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:02,873
These are
my conditions.

518
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,942
You've already asked
the world of me,

519
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,111
I'm just asking for
the same in return.

520
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,457
Everyone's
waiting for you.

521
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,726
Sorry, just something
I had to take care of.

522
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:23,329
So I guess you're off
the secret-keeping wagon.

523
00:20:23,331 --> 00:20:24,215
That's not it.

524
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,766
Then what is it?

525
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,969
I think Damian Darhk has someone
operating in Central City.

526
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,171
So I sent Barry
to run down a lead.

527
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:34,941
This kind of lead?

528
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:39,378
He didn't know
what he was giving me.

529
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,163
But I run enough tests
on your blood

530
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:43,149
to recognize your
DNA sequence anywhere.

531
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:44,884
Felicity,
you don't...

532
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:46,652
You had to run
a paternity test, didn't you?

533
00:20:49,924 --> 00:20:51,958
Look, Felicity...

534
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,693
Stop.

535
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,429
I cannot hear another lie.

536
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:59,165
It's more complicated
than that.

537
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,733
God, Oliver,

538
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,635
you are the only person
on this planet

539
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,071
who considers
the truth complicated.

540
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:08,541
Just to be clear, I don't care that
you have a child.

541
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,309
I can't believe that
you have a child

542
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,811
that you didn't
tell me about.

543
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,579
I care that you
lied to me just now.

544
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:16,782
You know that my whole world
just exploded?

545
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:18,851
And I think that
I'm entitled to a...

546
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:22,321
A minute to process that
by myself.

547
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,256
You somehow managed
to go to CCPD

548
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:26,592
and track down Barry.
You didn't keep it to yourself;

549
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:29,362
you kept it from me.
When were you planning on telling me?

550
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:32,898
I don't know.

551
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:36,235
If you loved me,

552
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:38,971
if you trusted me,

553
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:41,674
telling me this
wouldn't be such a burden--

554
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,142
it would be
a relief.

555
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:47,546
But you don't
trust me.

556
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,982
You never will.

557
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:53,319
And how can I be with someone who
doesn't trust me?

558
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:01,060
Felicity...

559
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:03,896
Are you guys ok?

560
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:06,232
Oliver?
What happened?

561
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:08,034
Nothing. I'm fine.

562
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,903
Uh, are you sure?
I mean, you don't seem fine.

563
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,838
You seem out of it.

564
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,407
Is everyone inside?

565
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:16,942
Yeah.

566
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,946
Coming up on
Savage's deadline.

567
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:22,548
Where's Felicity?

568
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,883
Are the gauntlets
working?

569
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,651
They have to be,
we're out of time.

570
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,119
I think they'll work.
That staff's going to go

571
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:29,855
from "can't touch this"
to "invisible touch."

572
00:22:29,857 --> 00:22:33,259
Savage doesn't know
Kendra has access to her full abilities,

573
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,760
which makes you
our Ace in the hole.

574
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:36,062
We're going to put you up
against Savage;

575
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,496
you attack with
the element of surprise.

576
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:39,098
I will lay down
the cover fire.

577
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,964
Barry, you speed in, and--

578
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:40,867
Snatch the staff, I got it.

579
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,469
Where
do you need us?

580
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,905
This me, Barry, Kendra
and Carter. We've got it.

581
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:46,586
Ollie!

582
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,274
No, we're not risking

583
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,909
any more lives tonight
than we have to.

584
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:54,413
Suit up.

585
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,691
You brought them.
And dressed

586
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,460
for the occasion,
I see.

587
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:08,994
We're only doing this
because two lives

588
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,863
aren't worth two cities.

589
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:15,101
Well, in that case, you are wiser than
I gave you credit for.

590
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:18,170
It's been
a lifetime.

591
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:20,539
Still wearing those

592
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,408
ridiculous
outfits, I see.

593
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,812
You don't need
to be here for this.

594
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:29,682
The culling has
a tendency to be...

595
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:32,952
Unsightly.

596
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,321
Your new friends
betrayed you.

597
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:37,123
Just do what
you're going to do.

598
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:41,660
It's wonderful to see you again,
my love.

599
00:23:41,662 --> 00:23:43,762
I will never be your love.

600
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:46,332
I know.

601
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:49,969
That always
makes this...

602
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,272
Easier.

603
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:55,741
Chay-Ara...

604
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:58,544
Parting is such
sweet sorrow.

605
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,591
Now, Kendra!

606
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:25,104
Carter!

607
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,176
Ahhh!

608
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,889
I've got it!

609
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:46,192
The gauntlets
aren't working!

610
00:24:49,163 --> 00:24:51,263
You got to let go, Barry!

611
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,932
No, I'm not
leaving you.

612
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:56,101
You're fast enough
to get away, go!

613
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,503
Ollie, no.

614
00:24:57,505 --> 00:25:00,539
Run, Barry. Run.

615
00:25:42,984 --> 00:25:44,883
Thank you for coming.

616
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:47,686
I know this is more
than a little crazy.

617
00:25:53,898 --> 00:25:56,545
I came to this meeting
out of curiosity.

618
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:58,278
It is now sated.

619
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,880
Bring Khufu and Chay-Ara
to Jurgens Industrial

620
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:03,016
in 24 hours,
or I will see you

621
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:06,886
dead and buried under the bodies
of your loved ones.

622
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,127
Barry, you all right?

623
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:23,236
We need to brief
the team.

624
00:26:23,238 --> 00:26:25,038
Come up with some type of
counter attack.

625
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,174
It's not going to work.

626
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:29,442
What?

627
00:26:29,444 --> 00:26:31,344
Oof, nothing.
All right, never mind,

628
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:32,545
I shouldn't have said anything.

629
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:33,841
Barry, what's going on?

630
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:34,715
Ok, look,

631
00:26:34,716 --> 00:26:36,116
this isn't going
to make any sense to you,

632
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:38,818
but I--all right,
so I traveled back in time

633
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,587
from when we tried
to take out Savage.

634
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:42,322
I mean, later,
when we tried

635
00:26:42,324 --> 00:26:44,257
to take him down in the future,

636
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:45,992
and it doesn't work.

637
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:48,228
You're right, that doesn't
make sense to me.

638
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,963
My world is
stranger than yours.

639
00:26:49,965 --> 00:26:51,764
Well, maybe we use that
to our advantage.

640
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:55,969
You say that whatever do against
Savage doesn't work?

641
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:58,338
Then we come up
with a new plan.

642
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,039
No. No, no, no.
Ok, look, you can't.

643
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,341
You--when I mess with time,

644
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,343
it just,
it doesn't end well.

645
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:05,645
But what you're telling me is
that it already doesn't end well.

646
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:08,948
Barry, people in our line of work,
we don't get second chances.

647
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,650
We need
to take this one.

648
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:12,285
All right,
I hope you're right.

649
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:14,654
All right, let's start with
what went wrong.

650
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:18,024
You did. When we
go up against Savage,

651
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:20,360
your head's not in the game.
You're not yourself.

652
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:21,961
Why not?

653
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:22,612
Oliver...

654
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:23,364
Barry!

655
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:25,765
Why not?

656
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,600
Ok, are you planning
on giving me

657
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,669
a hair sample
to run forensics on

658
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,137
in the near future?

659
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,739
Yeah...

660
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:34,340
Well, I did.

661
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:36,809
And you were pretty shaken
after the fact.

662
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:38,011
And then Felicity
found out,

663
00:27:38,013 --> 00:27:40,013
and you guys
had a pretty big fight,

664
00:27:40,015 --> 00:27:41,881
and it sounded like it was over
between you two.

665
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:43,249
What was the fight about?

666
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:49,822
I'm pretty sure
you're someone's father, Oliver.

667
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:55,061
So when we go up
against Savage,

668
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:56,663
you're not focused.

669
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:58,431
And then, Kendra can't
access her powers,

670
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,066
and then the tech
they're developing

671
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,035
to counteract Savage's staff
does not work,

672
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:03,570
and...

673
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:07,273
Everyone dies,
Oliver.

674
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:09,142
This time they won't.

675
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:12,145
This time we do
things differently.

676
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:18,318
How are they coming?

677
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,854
For my first pair of anti-Gandalf
magic staff gloves,

678
00:28:21,856 --> 00:28:23,156
pretty good, I think.

679
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,591
Just double
and triple check, ok?

680
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:26,292
I'm a little worried
about them not working.

681
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:27,594
Based on what?

682
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:30,263
Call it a gut instinct.

683
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:33,066
Also, I need you
to talk to Kendra.

684
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:36,603
Oh, I get it. You shoot arrows,
you give love tips,

685
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:38,204
it's like you're Cupid
or something.

686
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:39,839
What Carter is doing
with her isn't working.

687
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,641
We need her power
to fight Savage,

688
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:43,776
and we need her
to be able to use it reliably.

689
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:46,613
Carter's a jerk.
But he's supposed to be with her,

690
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:48,248
'cause destiny says
they're supposed to be together,

691
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,149
and he's supposed
to be her soul mate,

692
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:51,884
so I'm not even sure
what I can say--

693
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,053
We need to do something,
Cisco. We need to reach her.

694
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:56,923
Egyptian reincarnation
is not in my wheelhouse.

695
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,758
What Kendra
is going through

696
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,060
is about accepting
who she really is.

697
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:02,428
Who better to
help her do that

698
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,265
than a guy who is clearly
in love with her?

699
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:11,638
I don't know if we're at
the L-bomb stage yet.

700
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,306
I'll talk to her.

701
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:15,475
You don't think that's
a little bit insane?

702
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:17,076
No, I think
it's noble.

703
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,678
I think it's what makes them
all heroes.

704
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,146
Yeah, that's nice.

705
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:21,848
I'm going to talk to Kendra
for a minute, He-Man.

706
00:29:23,618 --> 00:29:26,686
Talk, man. Thanks.

707
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:30,857
We should talk.

708
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:34,160
I thought you were the one that said
we should wait till this was all over.

709
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:35,595
Oh, this isn't
that talk.

710
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:37,563
This is the "trying
to help you sprout wings" talk.

711
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:40,066
Yeah, well,
according to Carter,

712
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:41,601
I'm a warrior priestess,

713
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:43,503
and rage is the key
to rediscovering myself.

714
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,171
Yeah, I'm not surprised
Mr. Agro thinks that,

715
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,106
but I think he's got this whole
thing twisted.

716
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:50,276
Instead of focusing on the warrior,
focus on the priestess,

717
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:52,011
and the nurturer,

718
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:54,547
the good-hearted
person inside of you.

719
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:57,150
How do you know I was
so good hearted 4,000 years ago?

720
00:29:57,152 --> 00:29:59,852
Because I know you,
Kendra.

721
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:01,321
Some things
don't change.

722
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:03,122
I think you're
resisting what

723
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:04,757
Carter's trying to teach you
because it means

724
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,394
remembering who you
were, and that is somebody else.

725
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:11,030
Somebody who loves him.

726
00:30:13,535 --> 00:30:16,803
Ever since I emerged,

727
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,505
I've been remembering
our first life,

728
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:21,708
in Egypt. But I've
been telling Carter

729
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,510
I can't remember
anything, because--

730
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:28,047
because I don't want to accept that
I'm some reincarnated

731
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:30,950
Egyptian warrior priestess.

732
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:35,555
Ok. Yeah, that's
pretty heavy.

733
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:39,025
But it's also
pretty amazing.

734
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:41,461
I've been through this,
you know I have.

735
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:45,098
And what you're going through right
now, this is a gift.

736
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,368
It's a miracle that most people
don't even get to experience.

737
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,137
Yeah, well, it feels
like a nightmare.

738
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,306
Yeah, but that--
that is a choice.

739
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:55,875
You can choose the other thing
to remember who you are,

740
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:58,344
or who you were.

741
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:00,947
Close your eyes.

742
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:03,216
Just close your eyes.

743
00:31:04,953 --> 00:31:07,186
Let yourself.

744
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:10,423
Let yourself remember.

745
00:31:15,864 --> 00:31:18,531
Hey, hey, hey, wait.

746
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:21,100
Stay a little
longer.

747
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:23,236
I can't.

748
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:26,839
Hath-Set and I need
to make another offering to Horus.

749
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:30,676
The augers have said
more sky rocks will be falling soon.

750
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:33,579
Well, I hear
he covets you.

751
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:36,482
How fortunate I know
the man who can handle him.

752
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:38,284
Prince Khufu.

753
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:42,288
What a surprise
to find you here.

754
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,690
In Chay-Ara's bed chamber.

755
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:47,627
Surely you must know
that the clergy

756
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,929
is forbidden to lie
with royalty.

757
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,198
Get out.

758
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,567
The penalty for such
a transgression

759
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:55,935
is death.

760
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:59,572
I said, get out.

761
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,276
I'm not afraid
of your father.

762
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:05,611
Soon the sky rocks will
decimate this kingdom

763
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:07,780
and end his rule.

764
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:09,148
But first...

765
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,819
I shall know Chay-Ara
as you have known her.

766
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:15,288
Ahh!

767
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,792
Ahh!

768
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:29,969
Oh!

769
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:30,937
It'll be all right.

770
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:32,438
Look behind you.

771
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,906
Ohh!

772
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:42,281
The sky rocks have
come to do their work.

773
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:48,020
And my hate will be
everlasting.

774
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,990
My enmity will never die.

775
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:55,328
And I'll follow you
from this life to the next,

776
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,197
and to the next
and to the next.

777
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,832
Horus...

778
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:01,701
Your children need you now.

779
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:04,136
They need your protection.

780
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,472
Shroud us in your wings.

781
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,040
I will wait...

782
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:11,043
for eternity.

783
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,880
Come back to me.

784
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,414
No!

785
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:33,332
What?

786
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:35,434
What happened?

787
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:38,738
I think I know
how to beat Vandal Savage.

788
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,174
Oliver, you were right.

789
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,410
I don't know how you knew,
but you were right--

790
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:50,200
the gauntlets won't work,
they're missing a critical element.

791
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:51,009
How do you know?

792
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,324
Because I remembered.

793
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:54,271
I remember how
Savage killed us the first time,

794
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:56,239
back in Egypt.

795
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,675
I've never been able
to remember our first death.

796
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:00,877
Well, these sky
rocks--meteors--

797
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:03,418
they fell and they completely destroyed
the royal palace.

798
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,485
During the Middle Kingdom,

799
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,530
Egypt experienced a high
level of meteor activity.

800
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,652
I know stuff.

801
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:10,887
Which is one of the many reasons
we love you so much,

802
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:13,290
but also doesn't
seem to help us stop Savage.

803
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:16,026
It's the calamity Professor Boardman
was referencing.

804
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:18,261
The meteors,
they had a glow about them.

805
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:21,464
And Savage's staff had two gemstones
with the exact same glow.

806
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:23,567
Yeah, the gemstones
might be made up

807
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:25,302
of the same element
as the meteorite.

808
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:27,003
The Egyptians would use
meteorite in their craftsmanship.

809
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,872
And the minerals
glow in proximity to each other.

810
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:30,307
Like Sankara Stones.

811
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,741
Oh, wait,
the Indiana Jones reference

812
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:33,577
is the only thing
I understood.

813
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,846
Two pieces of the same
meteorite, like an nth metal...

814
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:38,281
that is the key
to counter-acting the staff.

815
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:40,717
Believe it or not, this isn't actually
the craziest thing I've heard today.

816
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,786
There's a sample of the meteorite
from the Middle Kingdom

817
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,989
at the Keystone City Museum of
Natural... History.

818
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:47,591
Hopefully I got
the right one.

819
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:49,059
I could synthesize
the compatible isotope

820
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:50,627
out of this and coat
the gauntlets with it.

821
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:52,262
Ok. Do it.

822
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,297
Savage doesn't know
that Kendra has gained

823
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,532
access to all of her abilities.

824
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:57,033
It makes you
our Ace in the hole.

825
00:34:57,035 --> 00:34:58,368
Where do you
need us?

826
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,471
Suit up.

827
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,577
Ollie...

828
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,945
Everyone's in position.

829
00:35:08,947 --> 00:35:10,313
All right.

830
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:11,948
Are you sure about this?

831
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,951
About changing
the future?

832
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:18,355
Barry, what can happen here

833
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,757
that is worse than
what already did?

834
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:24,628
If I knew that,
I wouldn't be so worried.

835
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,397
Let's do it.

836
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:33,103
It's wonderful to see
you again, my love.

837
00:35:33,105 --> 00:35:35,138
I will never be your love.

838
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,774
I know.

839
00:35:37,776 --> 00:35:42,746
That always makes
this easier.

840
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:47,550
Chay-Ara...

841
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:50,420
Parting is such
sweet sorrow.

842
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:54,424
Ahh!

843
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:56,927
Now, Kendra!

844
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,961
Get clear!

845
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,368
The gauntlets are working.

846
00:36:39,972 --> 00:36:42,072
No, no, no, Oliver,
get yourself to safety!

847
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,673
We're not leaving each other!

848
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:02,330
Did we do it?

849
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:04,833
Is he gone?

850
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:06,901
Yeah, it looks like.

851
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:08,336
I knew you
could do it.

852
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:11,539
I'm having
the strangest deja vu.

853
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:15,210
You're not the only one.

854
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,494
So how do you feel

855
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:25,261
now that Savage
is pushing daisies?

856
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,263
Does this mean you guys
are the immortal ones now

857
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:28,864
and he's the one
who gets reincarnated?

858
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:30,366
'Cause that would suck.

859
00:37:30,368 --> 00:37:32,635
I just sprouted
wings a few days ago,

860
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,970
and I'm just trying
to wrap my head around that.

861
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:36,405
He does raise
a good point, though.

862
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:38,941
Savage is gone
for good now, right?

863
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:40,442
I don't know.

864
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:42,411
We never
defeated him before.

865
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:44,446
But we're free.

866
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:46,215
Ugh, get a room.

867
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:47,983
You finally have the rest of your lives
in front of you.

868
00:37:47,985 --> 00:37:49,251
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?

869
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:50,586
Carter says in
our past lives,

870
00:37:50,588 --> 00:37:52,087
we used
to help people.

871
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,256
And after everything
you guys have done for me,

872
00:37:54,258 --> 00:37:56,125
I think I should
give that a try.

873
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:59,461
You make it sound like
this try is happening somewhere else?

874
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:01,597
In our prior incarnation,
we used to live in St. Roch,

875
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,433
and we really liked it there.

876
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:07,336
Could Cisco and I
have a moment?

877
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,771
Of course.

878
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:12,474
Here we go.

879
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:14,343
Cisco...

880
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:15,177
I'm really sorry.

881
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:17,380
You know what,
it's fine. It's cool.

882
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:18,981
It's actually kind of
a classic story--

883
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,250
boy meets girl,
boy gets girl,

884
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:23,585
girl sprouts wings and flies away
with her reincarnated soul mate.

885
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:27,122
The only part I don't get is you
don't even really seem to like him.

886
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,892
It's kind of
a complicated relationship.

887
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:31,727
Hmm.

888
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:34,496
Like most 4,000 year
old relationships are, I guess.

889
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:37,066
A week ago,
I was a barista

890
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,500
and I really
didn't have a plan

891
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:40,002
for what I was going
to do with my life.

892
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:41,770
And now you do?

893
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,239
Well, at least
I know I want to find out.

894
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:49,678
Ok.

895
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,814
I made you something.

896
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:54,149
To remember me by,
I guess.

897
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:55,951
I made it out
of the nth medal

898
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:57,786
Barry got
from the meteorite.

899
00:38:57,788 --> 00:39:00,556
It's got a micro GPS
chip embedded in it.

900
00:39:00,558 --> 00:39:02,391
So if you're ever
in trouble,

901
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:03,892
I'll come find you.

902
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:13,936
What was that for?

903
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:16,372
For being you.

904
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:18,007
Thank you, Cisco.

905
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:22,544
Well, you did it,
Barry.

906
00:39:22,546 --> 00:39:24,580
Everyone's alive.
Our guardian angel.

907
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:28,017
That's what you told me I could be
when I told you about my powers.

908
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,885
Meant it then
and I know it now.

909
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:32,521
Hey, Oliver, um,

910
00:39:32,523 --> 00:39:35,691
we need to have a difficult
conversation, I think.

911
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,393
About my son?

912
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:39,928
God, it feels
weird to say that.

913
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,197
Less about your son
and more about

914
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,666
whether or not you're going
to tell Felicity about him.

915
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:46,902
I don't think that's any
of your business.

916
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:48,504
You know what, yeah, you're right,
it's not really my business,

917
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:51,774
except I told you, when I mess with time,
time messes back.

918
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:54,443
And we've already changed
how things turned out with Savage,

919
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:56,412
and I'm worried
about temporal backlash.

920
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:59,448
Wait, you think that the timeline
cares about what I tell my girlfriend?

921
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,383
What are you going to tell her?
Well, you're right

922
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:03,385
when you say that
the rules keep changing

923
00:40:03,387 --> 00:40:04,620
and that the lives
that we lead,

924
00:40:04,622 --> 00:40:07,189
they make us feel...
powerless.

925
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:09,224
And it makes me
wonder if...

926
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:11,560
if William wouldn't
be better off

927
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:13,629
with my world kept
separate from his.

928
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:16,532
Look, Oliver, take it from someone who
didn't get to grow up with his father--

929
00:40:16,534 --> 00:40:18,400
I think the best thing
for William

930
00:40:18,402 --> 00:40:20,869
is for you to be
a part of his life.

931
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,383
Thanks, Barry.

932
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:24,364
Yeah.

933
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:27,943
I'm not really
a hugger.

934
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:30,045
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

935
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,547
But the thing is,
I am fast enough

936
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:32,815
to just hug you
without you knowing,

937
00:40:32,817 --> 00:40:35,784
so you might as well let me.

938
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:38,387
Yeah. Thanks.

939
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:40,222
Wasn't so bad, right?

940
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:44,526
These are my
conditions, Oliver.

941
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:46,662
You've already asked
me for the world;

942
00:40:46,664 --> 00:40:49,998
I am just asking for
the same in return.

943
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:59,308
Ok.

944
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,444
I won't tell anyone.

945
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:05,180
Even Felicity.

946
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:07,483
Felicity, that's a nice name.

947
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:09,985
She is
a nice person.

948
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:12,221
She's the best.

949
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:17,259
William is in his room.

950
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:21,163
You're just a friend
of mommy's, ok?

951
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:27,736
Hey, William.

952
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,805
Hello.

953
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:31,840
You like the Flash?

954
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,744
Can I tell you
a secret?

955
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,846
I've actually
met the Flash.

956
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:41,884
What's he like? Is he cool?

957
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:43,886
Yeah, he's cool.

958
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:48,190
He's--he's one
of the best guys that I know.

959
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:50,425
I'm Oliver.

960
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,094
I'm a friend
of your mom's.

961
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:54,530
We've known each
other a long time.

962
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,999
Want to play action figures?

963
00:41:57,001 --> 00:42:00,435
Sure, sure.

964
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,138
William, I'd
love to come by

965
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,506
every once
in a while

966
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:06,041
and say hello.

967
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:08,177
Would that be
all right with you?

968
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:10,846
It's Captain Cold.
He's a bad guy.

969
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:12,681
Yes, he is.

970
00:42:12,683 --> 00:42:16,051
The Flash is going to have to be very
fast to catch him.

971
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:18,487
He will. He's
the fastest man alive.

972
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,255
Oh!
Gotcha.

973
00:42:22,393 --> 00:42:26,094
Oh, what a mess.

974
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:29,131
Well, we have to clean
this place up.

975
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:32,167
Unless you're ready
to tell me what

976
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:34,403
you said you'd tell me.

977
00:42:34,405 --> 00:42:36,104
Felicity, um...

978
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:37,906
Oliver...

979
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:40,442
We have a life together.

980
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:42,911
Right? We're a team.

981
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:44,680
Ow.

982
00:42:44,682 --> 00:42:46,949
If something
is bothering you

983
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,684
and I don't
know about it,

984
00:42:48,686 --> 00:42:50,452
I can't help you fix it.

985
00:42:50,454 --> 00:42:52,788
I can't be
a good teammate.

986
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,090
I love you,

987
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:59,328
and that makes me
want to be the best teammate ever.

988
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,231
Not in a Lance Armstrong
performance enhancing drugs kind of way.

989
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:05,422
More like...More positive
sports analogy I would use

990
00:43:05,446 --> 00:43:07,462
if I knew anything about sports.

991
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,774
What had you acting so strange
when we got to Central City?

992
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:16,545
It doesn't matter,
it's over.

993
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:19,114
And I am back
in Star City,

994
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:21,250
with you.

995
00:43:22,419 --> 00:43:25,087
Come here.

996
00:43:36,808 --> 00:43:39,644
Your hate will be
everlasting.

997
00:43:39,645 --> 00:43:42,980
Your enmity will never die.

998
00:43:42,982 --> 00:43:45,382
It will follow them
from this life

999
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:47,451
into the next,

1000
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:49,951
and the next...
And the next.

1001
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:52,720
You owe me one, buddy.

1003
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:21,352
Greg!
Move your head.
