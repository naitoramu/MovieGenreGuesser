I'm not exactly
hearing a denial.

11

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,599
I'll pass.

Still kicking ass, I see.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,756
I heard you were
back in town.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,672
And I heard you traded
in your leather

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,830
for a power suit.

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,151
Well, that suit
didn't really fit.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
Seems the entire city
has turned against you.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,034
Just reminded me that there's
only one person I can trust...

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,679
myself.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,752
It's too bad
about Diaz.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,115
What, that he didn't
die sooner?

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,351
I couldn't agree more,

39
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,599
but at least he introduced
us before he did.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,036
As much as I'm enjoying
this little reunion,

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,793
why don't you tell me
why you're here?

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,473
I'm looking
for a partner.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,710
You got a job?

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,234

particular set of skills.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,713
Ugh.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,032
<i>Who was that?</i>

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,316
No one.

49

You still good
with locks?

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,797
Hey, Laurel.
It's me again.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,270
I just had a craving
for French fries,

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,636
milk shakes,
and really cold fruit.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,677
Are you in?

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,536
Look. I know this is
probably gonna get buried

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
between the many, many,
many, many messages

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,936
I have already left you,
but I'm just trying to

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,830
make sure you are OK,
so if you could call me back, please.

58
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,840
Still trying to
get in touch with Laurel?

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,714
Yeah. It's taking an alarming
<i>swingers</i> amount of time.

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,359
Not proud,
and my go-to way to find her

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,496
would be Archer,
but that is taking

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,671
an annoyingly long time to get back online,
so...

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,150
she doesn't want
to be found, Felicity.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,471
Her whole life has been
flipped upside down.

65
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,394
I know what that's
like. Just...

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,757
Speaking of, are you
sure that you are OK

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,559
now that you know that
your sister's evil

68
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,109
and tried to kill you?

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,759
Too soon?

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,957
Need to focus on
finding her

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,919
and The Ninth Circle and stopping
whatever they have planned.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,799
Well, lucky for you,
your wife is incredibly resourceful.

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,480
So I made a cheat
sheet on your new lead.

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,480
Emiko's bullet led me to
Andrew Thornton's rifle,

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,936
which led me to 12
different shell companies,

76
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,633
which led me
to the buyer.

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,001
And it's not weird that she
hasn't found the buyer herself

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,316
with the resources of The
Ninth Circle at her disposal?

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,073
OK. Well, not to
toot my own horn,

80
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,710
but Emiko is more of <i>the Karate kid,</i>
Hilary Swank version,

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,040
and I am more of the <i>Mr. Robot</i>
version but prettier.

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,351
Have you considered that
Emiko probably made up

83
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,397
the whole
"finding my mother's killer" thing?

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,360
I know that she's lied about
basically everything else,

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,960
but i... I just have
a sixth sense

86
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,192
that she's not
lying about this one,

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,112
so if John and I can find
the killer first,

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,637
then we can leverage that against
Emiko and The Ninth Circle

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,936
and stop whatever
they have planned.

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,474
Well, I have a sense
that a road trip

91
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,439
with John is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,954
Bring Rene with you
for backup.

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,552
Rene... Has
a school thing with Zoe.

94
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,199
Speaking of which,
will you just...

95
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,656
will you take it easy
for me, please?

96
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,478
Oh, who? Me?
Um, you know what?

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,914
I really wish I could,
but I have

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,992
a really intense
Netflix binge

99
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,799
that I have
scheduled way back,

100
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,576
and I also am going to eat
everything in the fridge,

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,831
so it's gonna get
pretty crazy in here.

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,798
- Precious cargo.
- I know.

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,360
<i>Disarmed.</i>

104
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,994
Is he still
following us?

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,753
I don't see him.

106
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,399
I think we finally
lost the son of a...

107
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,358
oh! Uh!

108
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,837
Spoke too soon.

109
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,593

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,712
Trying to shake

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,439
What's the status

121
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,514
Dinah gave us

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't work

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,435
We're clear.
Let's go.

125
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,714
Finishing this.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,434
You'll get us
both killed.

133
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,400
A manhunt? Don't you think
that's a little harsh?

134
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,432
- Laurel killed someone.
- Allegedly.

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,954
Her DNA and fingerprints
were found

136
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,520
all over the scene.

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,896
Laurel is smart.
You really think that

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,115
she'd leave evidence
behind

139
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,475
if she really did
kill the guy?

140
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,789
She had a pretty
strong motive.

141
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,936
Hernandez's death
was imperative

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,110
in her winning
her case.

143
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,736
She hasn't killed anyone since she's
been the D.A. why would she start now?

144
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,353
You've seen how hard
she's worked,

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
how much she's changed.

146
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,349
Except she obviously
hasn't.

147
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
Look. I know she's
your friend,

148
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,936
and for a while,
I actually thought

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,416
the two of us were doing
good work together, too,

150
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,194
but the truth is
Laurel is Black Siren.

151
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,670
She is a ruthless murderer,
and we are all fooling

152
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,096
ourselves thinking she is anything
like the real Laurel Lance.

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,476
We should be helping
her, not hunting her.

154
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,119
Laurel is a criminal,

155
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,192
and we are going to
bring her to justice,

156
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,511
something we should have
done a long time ago.

157
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,800
Pinky Santorini.

158
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,792
It's quite the operation
you've got here.

159
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,360
What are you
talking about?

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,432
I own a dry-cleaning
business.

161
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,274
Please. I haven't had
a problem in 22 years.

162
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,477
Well, it looks like
you have a problem now.

163
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,513
Thanks for playing.

164
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,917
Time for our payday.

165
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,758
Feels good
to be back.

166
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,799
Hey. Are you OK?
Your message made it

167
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,234
sound like the bunker
was on fire.

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,993
Laurel didn't kill
Gustavo Hernandez.

169
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,753
- Emiko did.
- What are you talking about?

170
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,479
This is his
toxicology report.

171
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,176
There were traces
of hydrogen cyanide found

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,317
in his blood, which is
the go-to poison

173
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
of The Ninth Circle.

174
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
The SCPD had no reason
to trace it back to them.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,736
Emiko framed Laurel
because Laurel told

176
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,753
Oliver her secret. Boom.

177
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,360
Well, it still doesn't
change anything.

178
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,056
Of course it does.
Did you hear what I just said?

179
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Even if Laurel didn't
kill Hernandez,

180
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,199
she's back to being
Black Siren.

181
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,136
There was just a robbery
at pinky's dry cleaner.

182
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,310
What'd they steal,
bubbles?

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,352
Pinky's is run
by Walter Santorini.

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,840
He's a money launderer
for the mob.

185
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,195
They took
over 100 grand.

186
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,595
- Whoa.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

187
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,176
<i>Maybe she needs the money because
she's planning on leaving town again.</i>

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,520
<i>She also now
has a partner.</i>

189
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,656
Well, there has to be
an explanation.

190
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,160
Santorini's actually
part of a case

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,360
Laurel and I had been working
for the last few months,

192
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,039
a case which is now
nonexistent thanks

193
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
to this last
little stunt.

194
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,115
So she's using her D.A.
resources to identify targets.

195
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,998
That's clever.

196
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,790
Bad. Very bad.

197
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,376
OK. This is the database
of all the cases

198
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,656
currently being investigated by
the district attorney's office.

199
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,830
Please hold.

200
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,256
Yeah. Looks like Laurel's
been accessing it

201
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,033
through a series
of rerouted ip addresses.

202
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,360
Does that mean
we can track her?

203
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,776
I mean, it means I could
probably talk to her,

204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,076
and then I can convince her

205
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,958
not to do this whole
Black Siren backslide

206
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
or whatever this is.

207
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,918
Well, even if
you could,

208
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,832
damage is
already done.

209
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,150
It was a good chat.
I really love our chats.

210
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,040
Felicity tell you how
she tracked the rifle

211
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,480
to this apartment?

212
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,836
Just call her a genius
and leave it at that.

213
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,355
- Gonna check upstairs.
- Copy that.

214
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,915
- Oliver, I found some...
<i>- Nothing!</i>

215
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,191
You.

216
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,760
New outfit.

217
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,354
You think an Arrow
is gonna stop me?

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,480
I think a tranq
Arrow will.

219
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,074
Do you know him?

220
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,256
He's one of
the Longbow Hunters.

221
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,398
What are they doing mixed up
in Emiko's mother's murder?

222
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,994
That's a good question.

223
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,837
<i>Don't hang up,
and I mean that.</i>

224
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,997
<i>Literally, you will not be able
to exit my window.</i>

225
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,436
You really can't
take a hint, can you?

226
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,830
<i>Look. I know that Emiko killed
Gustavo Hernandez.</i>

227
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,879
Ooh! Congratulations,
detective Felicity.

228
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,416
<i>It's only a matter of time
until Oliver stops her,</i>

229
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,456
<i>so whatever bad and evil
plan that you have brewing,</i>

230
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,836
<i>it's not too late for you to
not go over to the dark side.</i>

231
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Oliver's sister did
me a favor

232
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,239
because I was really
sick and tired

233
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,437
of pretending to be
somebody I'm not.

234
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,840
Plus, no one believed
it anyway.

235
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
I did. Look.
What happened to you wasn't fair.

236
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,597
You were accused of murder,
you lost your job,

237
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,760
Dinah didn't have
your back.

238
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,560
I get it.
You got a bucket load of bad news,

239
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,917
but you are not Black Siren,
not anymore.

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,639
<i>It's funny. I used to
believe that, too.</i>

241
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,439
Think of all the good you've done,
Laurel.

242
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,715
Think about honoring
Quentin.

243
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,032
<i>Quentin is dead.
Nobody cares about Quentin.</i>

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,520
<i>He only wanted
his daughter back.</i>

245
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,920
That is not true.

246
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,119
<i>You've done a lot
of good as the D.A.,</i>

247
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,432
<i>not to mention you were there
for me when I needed a friend.</i>

248
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,496
<i>I'm not willing to let you
just throw that all away</i>

249
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,954
<i>and forget about it.</i>

250
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,077
Look. I'm really sorry
if you thought

251
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,992
we had a real friendship,

252
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>but it was all
just an act,</i>

253
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,680
and don't you dare
try and stop me.

254
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,591
Stopping those bombs
prompted Galaxy One

255
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,512
to put their
master plan in motion,

256
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,751
expanding Archer's
influence into Star City

257
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,878
and making sure they take
out any and all opposition.

258
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,350
Starting
with the canaries.

259
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,637
How many have we
lost?

260
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,359
I'm waiting
on a body count

261
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,397
from Roy, William,
and Connor,

262
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,315
but they've already confirmed
10 dead and 5 missing.

263
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,399
It's not your fault.

264
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,279
But it's my
responsibility.

265
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,236
Oh, thank goodness
you two are safe.

266
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah. Um, could have taken
creepy mask guy off the board

267
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,272
except someone got
in my way.

268
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,079
Zoe made the right call.

269
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,953
We've lost enough blood
already as it is.

270
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,696
And until we know what
the hell is going on,

271
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
we need to lay low.

272
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,712
And do what,
nothing?

273
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,271
What we do is
mourn our dead.

274
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,114
Then we figure out a plan that
won't cost us any more lives.

275
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,318
You're right.
Galaxy One has us

276
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,073
outmanned and outgunned.

277
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,816
We need to find another
way to even the odds.

278
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,629
Galaxy One just decimated
the entire canary network.

279
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,440
You want to even the odds,
you get out there

280
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,199
and you fight
the hell back.

281
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,272
If you don't,
we're all dead.

282
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,954
Psst.

283
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,077
Unh!

284
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,277
I really missed
our girls' nights out.

285
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,034
- Me, too.
- Like taking candy.

286
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,271
From a filthy rich baby.

287
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,630
That's got to be $10
million worth of diamonds.

288
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,030
It's too bad
it doesn't belong to you.

289
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,160
And what?
Are you gonna stop us?

290
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,039
Don't do this, Laurel.

291
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,715
Oh, I thought
you'd be happy.

292
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,871
You were right
about me all along.

293
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,874
Oh, and it's too bad that you
don't have your cry anymore.

294
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,078
But I still have mine.

295
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,514
Phew. What an entrance.

296
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,256
Oh, and feel free
to tell Laurel's new friend

297
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,936
that it's a bad idea
to leave vault schematics

298
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,191
just hanging
around her lair.

299
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,196
What are you
doing here?

300
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,760
<i>Yeah.
Same question.</i>

301
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,296
Aren't you supposed to be on your
little spaceship or something?

302
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,516
I took a break
to clean up your mess.

303
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,592
What is this, some
kind of intervention?

304
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,911
I know you're not
my sister,

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,593
but in another world
or another life,

306
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,797
you could have been,

307
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,519
and my father
believed in you.

308
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,910
Well, he was wrong,

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,277
but you're right
about one thing.

310
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,999
You're not my sister.

311
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,353
Stay the hell
away from me.

312
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,555
You didn't go back
to the bunker.

313
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,438
We always go
back to the bunker.

314
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,432
I had work to do.

315
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,056
I know I should have
told you about Sara.

316
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,230
It would have
been nice.

317
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,515
And what was that device?

318
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,472
I modified o.G.
Laurel's old collar.

319
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,354
- Same tech, new look.
- It was impressive.

320
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,274
Felicity, we are the only team
sanctioned to work with SCPD.

321
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,114
Please remember it doesn't mean
any vigilante gets a free pass.

322
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,176
In my defense,
if anyone's gonna get through to Laurel,

323
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,920
it's her sister...
well, not her real sister,

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,576
but the face of her sister...
you know what I mean.

325
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,432
You cannot seriously
think she's still

326
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,280
capable of redemption
after what we just saw.

327
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,976
That is harsh,
especially coming from the person

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,216
who wrongly accused
her of murder.

329
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,232
So you're saying what
Laurel's doing is my fault?

330
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,595
Our fault. Maybe
if we had been

331
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
a better support
system to her.

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,878
Laurel did not become
Black Siren because

333
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,360
we were bad friends,
Felicity.

334
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,159
That is a choice she made
on her own.

335
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,799
It is not some
inevitable consequence

336
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,075
of something we did.

337
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,216
Everything that has happened
since she has been fired

338
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,276
is on her!

339
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,416
I think you're being
hard on her

340
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,715
because you feel guilty.

341
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,440
And I think you need
to drop the blinders.

342
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,436
This is Laurel's
new gal pal...

343
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,989
Aviva Metula,
former Mossad agent

344
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,799
turned master thief.

345
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,111
<i>She now goes by
the name shadow thief.</i>

346
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,276
Very on the nose.

347
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,635
She used to work
with Diaz,

348
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,496
which means she probably
used to work with Laurel.

349
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,136
It looks like shadow thief
has really leveled up

350
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,879
her bad guy game
since her Diaz days.

351
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,280
There's no more
petty heists.

352
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,591
It's only a matter of time
before she gets Laurel

353
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,717
mixed up in whatever
she came to town for.

354
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,031
- Then we better find them fast.
- OK.

355
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,873
Felicity must have
figured out I was using

356
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,270
the D.A. database
to find our targets.

357
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,033
Which one was Felicity?

358
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,430
The chatty one.

359
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,878
Here. You need this.

360
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,555
Don't worry. There are
plenty of jobs.

361
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,791
Not if she knows how
I'm finding them.

362
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,554
Maybe it's a good thing.
No offense,

363
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,438
but your jobs are
small potatoes.

364
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,636
What do you mean?

365
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,439
Let's just say that
since our Diaz days

366
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,876
I've met some
new friends,

367
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,838
some very powerful
friends

368
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,833
who pay very well for my
destructive services.

369
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,673
So you're
a terrorist for hire?

370
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,277
I prefer
mercenary with perks,

371
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,272
and I could use
someone like you.

372
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,999
I just want to make sure
that you're

373
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,549
the same ruthless
Black Siren I once knew.

374
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,637
I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't.

375
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,316
Good, because if those
women continue

376
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,040
to be a problem
for us...

377
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,955
You don't have to
worry.

378
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,993
They get in our way again,
I'll kill them myself.

379
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,437
Who hired you to
kill Kazumi Adachi?

380
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,874
Kazumi who?

381
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,633
Wrong answer.

382
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,873
<i>Doesn't matter to us.</i>

383
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,474
How do you want
this to go?

384
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,552
You guys can chop off
all 10 of my fingers,

385
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,359
and it won't matter.

386
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,353
I have no idea
who hired me.

387
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,193
They never contacted
me directly.

388
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,600
Then how'd they
offer you the job?

389
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,798
They directed me
to a drop-off location.

390
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,236
Once I got there,
found a coin.

391
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,913
Was it
an Italian florin?

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,912
No idea.
All I know is

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,753
that it was old.

394
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,593
There was a microchip
inside,

395
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,718
instructions to get
my weapon, the target.

396
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,076
Once the job was completed,

397
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,994
they wired my payment from a
bank account in Switzerland.

398
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,519
A florin,
Swiss bank account.

399
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,080
John, this is Dante.

400
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,232
So what now?
You guys kill me?

401
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,597
Let's go. We got
what we came for.

402
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,073
Well,
I'm having deja vu

403
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,153
in the best way
possible.

404
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,720
Did Dinah read you
the riot act?

405
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,672
Nothing
I can't handle.

406
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,513
You've come a long way
from the I.T. Girl

407
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,239
secretly crushing
on Oliver Queen.

408
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,616
Apparently, it wasn't
much of a secret.

409
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,632
Everybody knew.
Zero poker face,

410
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,336
and I always wondered, you know,
were you flirting with me

411
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,840
all those times
you said I was cute?

412
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,559
Why? Were you into it?

413
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,199
Of course. It's you.

414
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,070
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

415
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,277
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

416
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,079
I just wish it
had gone better.

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,389
Look. Laurel
will come around.

418
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,800
All we have to do
is get her away

419
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,270
from her new bff long enough
to knock some sense into her.

420
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,080
I mean,
that is if you don't have to go back

421
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,839
for any timey-wimey
shenanigans.

422
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,274
Well, every time
I leave the ship,

423
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,750
it basically means the
inmates take over the asylum,

424
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,274
but it's fine.

425
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,397
Want to make sure
that my real sister's name

426
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,073
doesn't get dragged
through the mud,

427
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,879
and, by the way,
why are you so concerned

428
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,155
with saving this Laurel?

429
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,954
I mean,
she's more like our Laurel than you realize.

430
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,714
She helped Oliver get out
of prison the legal way,

431
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,874
and she stopped me from
killing Ricardo Diaz.

432
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,475
Felicity Smoak is
killing people now?

433
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,755
I really have
missed a lot.

434
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,957
The point is,
is that I didn't kill anyone

435
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,793
because Laurel pulled
me back from the edge.

436
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,336
That's what I want to
do for her now,

437
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,875
you know, send her
out a lifeline.

438
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,351
Even if there was a way back for Laurel,
she has to want it.

439
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,352
You can't force
redemption on people.

440
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,955
Oh, that I know.

441
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,096
Well, it's all
theoretical anyway,

442
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,520
Since I have no idea

443
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,200
where shadow thief or Laurel
are operating out of.

444
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,590
Hold that thought.
Dinah just got a location

445
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,637
on shadow thief's
secret hideout.

446
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,792
Turns out... of
course, of course...

447
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,590
it's at a shady warehouse
in a shady part of town.

448
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,319
Is that where Laurel's
been holing up?

449
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,596
That's what Dinah thinks.

450
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,433
Man, it is completely
off the grid.

451
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,920
Dinah wants me to go with her
so she doesn't go in blind.

452
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,553
So we don't go
in blind.

453
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,271
Um, no. Mmm. This is
more of a two-woman job.

454
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,874
Dinah wants to keep it
above board.

455
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,317
No. Got it.
Not invited.

456
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,800
- OK.
- OK.

457
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,712
Call me.

458
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,136
Not to belabor
the point or anything,

459
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,616
but it would have been
really nice to have

460
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,400
white canary here with us...
the flight. Heh!

461
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,480
You know,
since you're both canaries and everything.

462
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,096
- Can we talk about this later?
- Mm-hmm.

463
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,236
Who's here
besides us?

464
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,556
There's only two heat signatures
in the entire building

465
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,074
besides us, and...

466
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,919
they're right
behind this door.

467
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,912
It's got to be shadow
thief and Laurel.

468
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,119
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

469
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,357
Where are they?

470
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,830
- They played us.
- Fake heat signatures?

471
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,992
That is devious
and impressive.

472
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,158
Get down!

473
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,152
Are you OK?

474
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,794
Laurel tried
to kill us.

475
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,354
It turns out we
could have used some

476
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,760
white canary backup
after all.

477
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,797
- Well, you got it now.
- Sorry.

478
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,314
No worries.

479
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,470
Find anything
at the lair?

480
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,358
No, not yet.

481
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,715
They were
sloppy, though.

482
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,200
Probably too fixated
on killing us.

483
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,959
The tech that shadow thief
left behind

484
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,456
will probably give us some
insight on how she operates.

485
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,437
With any luck, that's
how we'll find her.

486
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,034
I'm so sorry.

487
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,191
I really thought
Laurel had changed.

488
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,957
Well, that's all right.
We're just lucky

489
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,474
she's rusty
and messed up.

490
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,712
- Yeah.
- Or maybe it's not luck at all.

491
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,713
I mean, Black Siren's
a lethal, unforgiving killer.

492
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,589
It's rare she fails,
even rarer she doesn't do the job herself.

493
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,513
I'm gonna get some air.
Let me know if you guys find anything.

494
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,032
You know,
maybe if I could have helped more or...

495
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,160
Felicity, you have to
stop blaming yourself.

496
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,960
Laurel had every opportunity
to make the right decision,

497
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,190
and she didn't.

498
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,033
Laurel has not changed.

499
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,477
She is the same monster
who killed Vinnie.

500
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,437
What Laurel did
is unforgiveable,

501
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,477
but she's just
on this path,

502
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,631
and she doesn't know
how to get off of it.

503
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,056
Do you know how many times in my life
I could have gone down the same path,

504
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,356
including killing Laurel
last year, and I didn't?

505
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,830
Yeah, you didn't
because you had us.

506
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,376
I mean,
when Oliver brought you on the team,

507
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,516
you weren't
exactly a Saint.

508
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,990
I was protecting women who
couldn't protect themselves.

509
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,595
Yes, but even in your
darkest of times,

510
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,558
even when you were hell-bent
on killing Laurel,

511
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,074
we still had
your back.

512
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,560
I mean, we gave you
a second chance,

513
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,829
and look where you
are now.

514
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,256
You're... you're captain
of the SCPD,

515
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,634
you're a deputized
vigilante.

516
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,514
I mean, you couldn't
possibly have imagined

517
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,096
that this is where
you would have ended up.

518
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,635
No, that's true, but i...

519
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,394
I'm grateful for Oliver
and for the whole team,

520
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,273
but I don't think
it matters with Laurel.

521
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,591
I don't think she ever even
wanted that kind of support.

522
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,956
Or maybe she wanted
it more than any of us

523
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,157
and didn't realize it
until it was gone.

524
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,594
I appreciate you
wanting payback

525
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,956
for what happened
to the canaries,

526
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,633
but not like this.

527
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,871
Mia, if you go
out there on your own,

528
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,759
chances are you will not
make it back alive.

529
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,116
Galaxy One found all of
your safe houses, Dinah.

530
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,078
<i>They'll find
this one, too.</i>

531
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,736
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for them

532
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,400
to massacre
the rest of us.

533
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,636
Believe me, there is nothing
I would love more than to see

534
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,920
those sons of bitches pay for
what they did to my girls.

535
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So why don't you?

536
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,390
Because I know I
can't do it alone,

537
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,200
and neither can you.

538
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,232
Then come with me.

539
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,600
Instead of hiding
in the shadows,

540
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,672
let's take this fight
to Galaxy One,

541
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,434
make them pay
for blood with blood.

542
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,040
Sometimes,
I don't know who you sound more like...

543
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,032
your mother
or your father.

544
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,917
Do you know why
I started the canaries,

545
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,754
what it represents?

546
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,914
This is more than just
some rebellion group.

547
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,878
It's a support system.

548
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,234
This is a way for women to know
we always have each other's backs

549
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,312
no matter what happens,

550
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,159
whenever we need it most,

551
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,760
something I failed to do
for a friend once,

552
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,354
but ever since
that happened with her,

553
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,999
I made a promise
to myself that I

554
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,551
would never make
that mistake again.

555
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,199
That's why we wear these.

556
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,871
<i>To honor that promise</i>

557
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,630
and the bravery
and the sacrifice

558
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,995
shared with these
amazing women,

559
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,111
who somehow... no matter how many
times they get knocked down...

560
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,510
they always find
the strength

561
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,156
to get back up
and fight again...

562
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,829
And that is exactly what the
surviving canaries are going to do

563
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,630
together, but when
the time is right.

564
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,239
It's too bad
I'm not a canary.

565
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,836
Dante has been pulling the
strings this entire time.

566
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,912
He orchestrates
her mother's murder,

567
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,358
and he sends her
down this path.

568
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,336
Sounds like you're softening
up on your sister again.

569
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,273
I just have a better understanding
of why she's done what she's done.

570
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,552
When Emiko realizes that Dante
has been manipulating her,

571
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,520
it will drive a wedge between
her and The Ninth Circle.

572
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,157
That's how we
stop them.

573
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,233
<i>Thought I might
find you here.</i>

574
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,996
It's pretty brave
of you,

575
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,151
sneaking up on me
from behind.

576
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,311
If you wanted
to kill people,

577
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,437
you wouldn't have gave
them that warning time

578
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,796
before the bomb
went off.

579
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,998
I really miss him.

580
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,753
It looks like
you do, too.

581
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,719
Is this you trying to convince
me that I've changed,

582
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
that I'm more like
your Laurel?

583
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,156
No. Nobody's as good as
the original Laurel Lance,

584
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,953
not even me.

585
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,676
Look.
I don't know what you've heard about me,

586
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,275
but basically,
I had an affair

587
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,397
with my sister's
boyfriend,

588
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,235
I allowed my entire family
to think that I was dead,

589
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,551
and then I became a
league-trained assassin.

590
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,871
Wow. That's impressive.

591
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,600
My point is even
someone with a past

592
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,792
as checkered as mine can
still turn their life around,

593
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,996
can be a hero.

594
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,231
I was being a hero.

595
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,312
I was the D.A.,
I got Oliver out of prison,

596
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,073
and I was the only
one who figured out

597
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,800
that his little sister
was basically the devil,

598
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,155
and they still
turned on me.

599
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,960
So, what, you think
you deserve a medal

600
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,078
for trying to be
good for 5 seconds?

601
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,876
Redemption isn't a destination.
It's a journey.

602
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,871
I wasted years
running away

603
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,673
from all the bad things
that I had done

604
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,594
because I didn't want to face
the pain that I had caused,

605
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,117
because I didn't want
to be that person,

606
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,151
and then I realized the only
way to stop being that person

607
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,152
was to come home
and own up

608
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,152
to the things
that I had done,

609
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,994
and, yeah, it was
painful,

610
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,595
and it took
a really long time,

611
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,230
but it was the only way
to become someone else,

612
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,716
someone better
than who I was.

613
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,433
Well, that's great
for you,

614
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,194
but even if I wanted
to change,

615
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,795
it's a little bit
too late

616
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,031
because this is
who I am.

617
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,477
I was starting to
think you might not show.

618
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,836
I had some business
to take care of.

619
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,516
So what's this weapon
that we're stealing?

620
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,514
Who cares?
All that matters is that we're getting paid.

621
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,960
You ready?

622
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,554
Absolutely.

623
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Manpower
seems thin.

624
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,160
I thought we'd run
into some guards.

625
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,471
Why do you think
we're hitting it now?

626
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,199
I'm gonna check out
the south wing.

627
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,713
- You.
- Don't look surprised.

628
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,110
Your friend's suit is
basically a giant tracker.

629
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,034
And we happen to know somebody
who's very good with a computer.

630
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,680
You brought your
little friend with you.

631
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,955
How typical.

632
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,759
It's not too late,
Laurel.

633
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,876
Don't do this.

634
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,476
That song of yours
is getting a little old.

635
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,273
Laurel!

636
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,115
Ugh. God. You're
here, too?

637
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,536
Do you know what shadow thief is
planning to do with that device?

638
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,711
Yes. Sell it
for a lot of money,

639
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,314
of which I get half.

640
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,357
Who do you think she's
gonna sell it to,

641
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,840
the girl scouts?

642
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,912
That device is gonna be
used to kill people.

643
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,640
Well, that's not really
my concern now, is it?

644
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,870
- Move.
- No.

645
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,475
Seriously? Felicity,
don't you think

646
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,320
you're just a little bit
out of your element?

647
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,598
That is correct.
I know that, but so are you.

648
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,514
Oh, for the love of god,
would you give it up already?

649
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,160
This is who I am!
Do you not see that?

650
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,153
Who I see is someone
that I believe in

651
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,675
and someone that
I really care about.

652
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,274
Felicity,
what are you doing?

653
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,034
<i>Forget living
up to Laurel's legacy,</i>

654
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,591
and forget being who
Lance wanted you to be.

655
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,750
What do you want?

656
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,560
I want you to get
out of my way.

657
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,672
I guess if you're OK
with that device killing people,

658
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,240
you may as well
start with me.

659
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,674
- Me, too.
- And me.

660
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,789
I changed my mind.
The deal's off.

661
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,078
I kind of expected.
Good thing I had a backup plan.

662
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,280
We have to get
out of here.

663
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,816
Look. Is the payload
device big enough

664
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
to clear out
the building?

665
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,296
Yes, but the problem is
we're inside the building.

666
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,856
That's exactly why they
won't be expecting it.

667
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,976
How long do you
need to arm it?

668
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,071
90 seconds. But how
are we gonna get out?

669
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,999
Birds fly, don't they?
Let's buy her some time.

670
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,840
Uh... go. Go.

671
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,432
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

672
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,995
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

673
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,477
- Ohh!
- It's time to go.

674
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,914
Stay close.

675
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,995
Overwatch, now!

676
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,312
Can we never
do that again?

677
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,120
- Is everybody OK?
- You came back for me.

678
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,357
We're only as strong
as we are together,

679
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,399
something I didn't
realize till just now.

680
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,119
We are pretty
badass together.

681
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,715
Yeah. Like a birds
of justice.

682
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,393
Something like that.

683
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,759
Thank you.

684
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,680
To ladies taking
down ladies.

685
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,912
Heh.
And to Laurel.

686
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,639
Thank you
for the assist,

687
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,509
and I am very,
very sorry that I doubted you.

688
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,353
That means a lot.

689
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,639
I just wish we got
shadow thief.

690
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,518
We'll get her
next time.

691
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,638
So does this mean you're
not gonna arrest me?

692
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,473
I don't see
why I would.

693
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,156
This new evidence proves
you didn't kill Hernandez,

694
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,496
and you went undercover
to bring down

695
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
the shadow thief,

696
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,276
so I am as surprised
as anyone.

697
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Thank you.

698
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,477
Now that Laurel Lance,
upstanding citizen,

699
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,438
is back,

700
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,751
everything can go
back to normal.

701
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,231
Actually, it can't.

702
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,789
Say what, now?

703
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,952
I am so tired
of running.

704
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,713
It's time for me
to go home now.

705
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,792
Home?
As in Earth-2 home?

706
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,157
Yeah. Someone
in similar shoes told me

707
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,993
if I wanted to be
one of the good guys

708
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,032
that I needed to
right my wrongs,

709
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,713
and the only way
to do that is to go

710
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,473
back to where
it all started.

711
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,035
Yeah.

712
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,635
<i>Oh. Well, uh...</i>

713
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,634
I'll cheers to that.

714
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,797
- Yeah.
- Ah-ah.

715
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,873
Heh. I think I deserve
two of these.

716
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,077
I mean, come on.
I worked really hard, so there.

717
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,719
Cheers to me.

718
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,438
Oh, no.
It's the SCPD.

719
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,193
OK. Apparently,
criminals don't care

720
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,476
how badly I need
a girls' night.

721
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,631
I have something
for you.

722
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,236
From one canary
to another,

723
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,835
Sara wanted you
to have this.

724
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,353
<i>I can adjust it for you.</i>

725
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,511
Probably get your cry
back if you want it.

726
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,357
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

727
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,276
- Yes, you are welcome.
- Thank you.

728
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,840
No sweat.

729
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,800
Did it all the time when
my sister was pregnant.

730
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,200
Oh. Way to Bury
the lede.

731
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,576
That's how you knew
I was pregnant.

732
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,670
Mm-hmm.

733
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,799
I have something
for you.

734
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,636
It's Laurel's
Black Canary costume.

735
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,474
Yeah. Yeah. I thought
you could use it here,

736
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,158
but, you know,
maybe Earth-2 needs a Black Canary.

737
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,232
You are still planning
on being good, right?

738
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,160
I'm planning
to try, yeah.

739
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,390
Good.

740
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,194
I just really hope
one day I'm

741
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,794
actually worthy
of it.

742
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,879
<i>Welcome home,
Ms. Smoak.</i>

743
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,395
Oh, you're home.

744
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,234
I missed you.

745
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,556
Did you get what
you were looking for?

746
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,031
Yup. I'm exhausted.

747
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,752
Just want to sit
on the couch

748
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,629
and order some food,
and... I don't know...

749
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,234
I'll have whatever
you're craving, OK?

750
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,470
I already ate

751
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,758
after I said
good-bye to Laurel.

752
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,872
So you found Laurel,

753
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,031
but you said good-bye
to her already?

754
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,191
Well, yeah, after we
stopped her

755
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,714
from going
on a killing spree.

756
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,871
- Hmm?
- Dinah and Sara and I.

757
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,758
- Hmm?
- Yeah. That Sara,

758
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,799
and we did it,
super easy, you know.

759
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,960
It was like
<i>Charlie's Angels</i>

760
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,872
without the feathered
hair and casual sexism.

761
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,633
So that whole
taking it easy thing?

762
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,712
Well, you know I'm
not good at that.

763
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,716
Well, I'm here now,
so I'll take care of you.

764
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,632
Well, you could start
with a foot rub.

765
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,751
Yeah.

766
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,354
Ahh.

767
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,958
We keep this up, people
are gonna start asking

768
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,236
why we keep hanging out
in cemeteries.

769
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,831
I was never very
good at good-byes.

770
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,160
Quentin always saw
the good in me

771
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,675
when... when nobody
else did.

772
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,710
I wish I could tell him
how much it meant to me.

773
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,917
He knew.

774
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,914
He was the first person to make
me feel like I was never alone.

775
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,075
You're not alone,
not anymore.

776
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,193
So much
for plan "a."

777
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,790
Whoa.

778
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,078
But I've seen
you before.

779
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,312
The old Green Arrow
documentary.

780
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,676
- You're...
- A friend of your parents.

781
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,150
You're lucky we got here
when we did.

782
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,390
Dinah sent you
to watch my back.

783
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,472
It's what canaries do.

784
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,995
Give this to Felicity.

785
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,355
You look so much
like her,

786
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,676
and you may not be a canary,

787
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,993
and you still have
a long way to go

788
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,992
to prove that
you're a hero.

789
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,470
Take it from someone who
knows how hard it can be,

790
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,032
and don't screw it up.

791
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,240
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
