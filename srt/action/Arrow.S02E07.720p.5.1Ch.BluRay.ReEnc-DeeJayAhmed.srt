1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,809
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,178
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,348
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,921
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,753
Bu! to do so, [can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:21,764
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,894
I must be something else.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,933
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,441
- This one's no longer of use to us.
- Wait. He could still be useful.

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,048
She's right. Once we get rid of his friends,
we'll need him to lead us to the graves.

11
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,081
You're going back to the island.

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,278
Look, you already lost your dad. Your mom's
still here. I'm sure she'd love to see you.

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:47,289
I'm not going to that prison.
It's the only way I know how to hurt her.

14
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,959
I don't want to hate you.

15
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,562
But I can't.

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:58,529
I didn't think that there were secrets kept
between us. Mom, what are you hiding now?

17
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,974
My name is Moira Dearden Queen.

18
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,635
I am the acting CEO of Queen Consolidated.

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,974
And God forgive me, I
have failed this city.

20
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:17,447
I have been complicit in an undertaking
with one horrible purpose:

21
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,420
To destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

22
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,461
If you reside in the Glades...

23
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,293
please, you need to get out now.

24
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,163
Your lives and the lives of your children
depend on it.

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,263
Please.

26
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,101
Warden says we gotta evacuate.

27
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,105
- Help me get these out of here.
- What about the inmates?

28
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,974
Leave them.

29
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,217
Help!

30
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,045
Yo, man! Come on!

31
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,619
Hey!

32
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,223
Hmm.

33
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,656
Yo, man! Come on!

34
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,295
- Come on!
- Come on, man!

35
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,192
- Over here. Let me out.
- No.

36
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,798
- No. No.
- Unlock it.

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,268
- Too violent.
- Take me.

38
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,132
- Too sloppy. Too stupid.
- Let me out.

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,034
- Get me out of here!
- Too ambitious.

40
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,833
You.

41
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,071
Love your work.

42
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,144
Big future.

43
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,745
Hey, be careful.
There's liable to be aftershocks.

44
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,918
Oh, I'm counting on it.

45
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,018
Come on! Hey!

46
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,246
Hey, you can't go!

47
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,610
- There go the Queens!
- Oliver!

48
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:33,622
Mr. Queen, what are your mother's chances?
Is she on suicide watch?

49
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,660
- What is your mother's condition?
- Mr. Queen, can you give any comment?

50
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,922
It's not fair. They're
not the ones on trial.

51
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,566
That won't stop Jean Loring from using them
as props to drum up sympathy.

52
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,036
You don't seem overly concerned.

53
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,798
She confessed to being an accomplice
on live television.

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,133
She also said that
Malcolm Merlyn coerced her.

55
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,241
You have something, don't you'?

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,745
I thought I was your co-counsel, Adam.
If you're holding a trump card...

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,153
...don't you think maybe
you should share it with me?

58
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:00,636
It's going to be a good trial.

59
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,117
Come on. Let's get inside.

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,494
- You don't have to do this.
- Ivo says we do.

61
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,669
- Your friends are a danger to his men.
- Go. Quick and quiet.

62
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,431
Slade, Shado, run! Unh.

63
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,347
There's no one here.

64
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,290
They must've moved on from their position.

65
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,691
Charges are set. Here's the detonator.
Make sure they have no place to return to.

66
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,687
Go.

67
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,625
And you.

68
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,202
Now you're gonna take us to the graves.
Let's go.

69
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,531
Get him up.

70
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,205
Let's get clear.

71
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,982
- Did you find the detonator?
- Yes.

72
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,378
We were lucky.

73
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,818
I was lucky. You were good.

74
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,686
Either way...

75
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,656
they have Oliver.

76
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,386
I'm going after him.

77
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,862
Not alone.

78
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,498
You can barely walk.

79
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,368
All the more reason not to stay here.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,336
Give them another chance at blowing me up.

81
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,009
- You two okay? Ahem.
- I should be asking you that question.

82
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:40,675
- Yeah, well, I'm fine.
- You look like you have the flu.

83
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,185
Well, if that's true, I shouldn't have
wasted my time getting vaccinated.

84
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,220
Diggle, whatever it is, just go home.

85
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,605
Oliver, listen. I can take
care of things, alright?

86
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,442
No, we'll be fine, all right?
Go rest.

87
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,564
And don't make me call a cop.
There are a few of them around here.

88
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:26,297
I have been complicit in
an undertaking with one horrible purpose:

89
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,059
To destroy the Glades and everyone in it.

90
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,100
And it worked. The Glades were destroyed.

91
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:38,140
Homes and lives were lost.
All because of her actions.

92
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:42,804
True, she had second thoughts, remorse, which
compelled her to deliver this statement.

93
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:47,315
But on behalf of the 503 lives
that were extinguished that day...

94
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,921
I say, Moira Queen,
your remorse comes too late.

95
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,489
For the last five years...

96
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,990
under the threat for my life
and the lives of my family...

97
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:03,291
Why wouldn't those threats silence her'?
Why wouldn't Moira Queen be terrified?

98
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,398
Malcolm Merlyn killed her first husband,
abducted her second.

99
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,940
Why wouldn't she be in fear for her life?
For the lives of her children?

100
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:18,678
What would you do if it were your children
in the crosshairs of a madman's rage?

101
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,095
They say
the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator...

102
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,953
will be turned on right on schedule.

103
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,855
In other news, we have
just received word that both sides...

104
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,156
have now completed their opening
statements in the Moira Queen trial.

105
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,880
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look disgusting.

106
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,366
Yeah, well, I don't feel great, Felicity.

107
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,835
Is there a right way to take that?

108
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,507
- You should go home.
- I am going.

109
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,803
I just need to make arrangements
for a replacement bodyguard.

110
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,278
Did you get the flu shot? Personally,
I never do. I know that I should.

111
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,213
I just-I have this thing about needles.
All pointy things, really.

112
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,318
Ironic, considering who we work with.

113
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,240
Yeah, it's not the flu,
Felicity, it's more like...

114
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:00,265
Dig.

115
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,051
Hello?

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,456
Are you here?

117
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,395
Here. There.

118
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,536
Everywhere.

119
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,663
So how goes our little science project?

120
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,069
Working like you said it would.

121
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,710
Heh. How wonderful.

122
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,213
Uh, so listen, doing the thing was 50,000.

123
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,909
Keeping quiet about it
I'm thinking should be 50 more.

124
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:33,384
Heh. Oh, I want word to spread.

125
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,561
That's kind of the whole
objective, actually.

126
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,227
You see my point?

127
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:46,568
You should know I find post hoc
negotiation distasteful.

128
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,873
Such a shame you won't get to see
what your works have wrought, doctor.

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,176
But soon everyone else will.

130
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,277
And they'll beg for it to end.

131
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,254
That's exactly right...

132
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,950
mend given the extreme interest
in the case from all corners...

133
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,435
What the hell are you doing here?

134
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,463
- I heard you passed out.
- I told Felicity not to call you.

135
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,123
Yeah, but before that, you said "gah" and
"thud," so I didn't take it very seriously.

136
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,452
She was right to call me. Diggle,
you need medical attention.

137
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:19,487
He needs more than that.

138
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,626
When Dig passed out, I sent a sample
of his blood to a chemist I know at QC.

139
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,200
The guy owes me a favor. Long story.
I fixed his parking ticket.

140
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,244
- Huh. I guess it's not that long.
- Felicity.

141
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,709
- Blood sample?
- Yeah.

142
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,742
It came back positive
for trace amounts of Vertigo.

143
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,380
I've never used Vertigo
before in my life.

144
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,645
You were exposed to it somehow.

145
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,083
Vertigo's in play again?

146
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,085
When the Count recovered from his OD
on Vertigo, he was sent to Iron Heights.

147
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,555
That got hit in the quake.

148
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,627
He got out the same way the Dollmaker did?

149
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,159
And just like with the Dollmaker...

150
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,996
prison officials worked overtime
to keep a lid on the escape.

151
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,469
- I know what you're thinking.
- No, you don't.

152
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:01,643
I made a choice not to put an arrow in
this guy. And it was the right choice.

153
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,247
There's no more killing.

154
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:09,984
I worked this up to counteract
the effects of Vertigo. Give it to Diggle.

155
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,103
I need to get back to court. While I'm
gone, just work up whatever you can.

156
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,355
Figure out how Diggle got Vertigo
in his system without his knowledge.

157
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,462
Go.

158
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,832
When was the first time you heard
about this so-called undertaking?

159
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,162
When everyone else did.
When my mother gave the press conference.

160
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,640
- Doesn't seem like you took it too well.
- I was surprised.

161
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,777
Who wouldn't be?

162
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,544
Uh, your mother was immediately
taken into custody...

163
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,345
but I assume you went down
to the precinct to see her?

164
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,518
Actually, I didn't see her
until she was moved.

165
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,216
To the prison?

166
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,363
Do you remember when you visited her?

167
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,657
Not the exact date.

168
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,661
It's okay. I have the visitor log here.

169
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,064
October 9th.

170
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,068
Five months later. Why so long?

171
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,065
Um, I... I...

172
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,407
Are you okay?

173
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:14,249
An answer, please. Why did it take you
five months to visit your mother?

174
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,385
- Your Honor, if I...
- No. I want to hear this.

175
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,190
I needed time.

176
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,422
- I was...
- Angry.

177
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:28,054
So angry, perhaps, that it took you
five months to forgive her?

178
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,031
- It was complicated.
- No.

179
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,934
It's very simple.
You blamed your mother for what she'd done.

180
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,439
So why shouldn't the jury?

181
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:46,111
Your Honor, we have no more questions
for the witness.

182
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,017
Adam.

183
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,625
Where is it?

184
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,799
Come on. Where is it?

185
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,467
The Hozen. Where is it?

186
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,137
- What'?
- The arrowhead.

187
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,209
Every report said it was with these bodies.
You said you and your friends were here.

188
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,242
Now, where is it?

189
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:20,448
Take him outside.
Make him show you where his friends are.

190
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:29,456
- Take us to them.
- I don't know where they are.

191
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,762
- Tell me or you lose your hand.
- Let us suggest another option.

192
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,493
You hand the kid over to us,
and we don't kill you all.

193
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:50,940
Hey, are you okay?

194
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,110
Don't worry about me. I can take it.

195
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,258
It's okay, ifs okay. Relax.

196
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,530
Was that as bad as it seemed?

197
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:19,869
Thea's testimony? It was a setback.

198
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,137
- We were counting on her to...
- Humanize me.

199
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,840
Frankly, yes.
And now we're gonna have to go another way.

200
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:31,386
- No. No, I told you, I won't testify...
- I know you did, but now you have to.

201
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,557
She's right, Mom.

202
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,988
Jean, can you give us a minute?

203
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,629
Yeah.

204
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,193
I know what you're going to say.

205
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,041
But if I testify, it
will destroy our family.

206
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:51,389
And if your lawyer's right,
you don't have a choice.

207
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:57,246
Mom, secrets are what put you
in this situation. Secrets and lies.

208
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,579
And now it is time to
give the truth its day.

209
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,805
I don't want us to lose sight of the
other major event in court today.

210
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,090
Was there any indication
of Adam Donner being ill?

211
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,823
No, there was very little warning
before Mr. Donner collapsed to the ground.

212
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,183
I've spoken to several people who were
in the courtroom with me, and a couple...

213
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,365
How you feeling?

214
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,235
- Fine.
- You have a lousy poker face, Diggle.

215
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,433
- Did he take the antidote?
- Didn't work.

216
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,085
Count must've futzed
with his recipe.

217
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,064
Heard what happened
with Donner at the court.

218
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,740
And with Thea.

219
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,111
How is she?

220
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,910
It'll be fine.

221
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,547
Your poker face isn't much better
than mine, Oliver.

222
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,291
- Hello, Starling City.
- Felicity.

223
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,290
Miss me?

224
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,957
Many of you have noticed that
you're not feeling quite like yourselves.

225
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,323
He's taken over all the
local station feeds.

226
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,423
Track his signal.

227
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,767
Like our good assistant district attorney
here. You might recognize him...

228
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,239
from his work
in the ongoing Moira Queen trial.

229
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,434
Hi, Adam.

230
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,103
- What do you want?
- I want what you want.

231
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,146
- For you to feel better.
- Go to hell.

232
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:12,654
I do think you want the pain to end.
And I can do that.

233
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,453
With Vertigo. It's what
all your bodies crave.

234
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:21,665
Fortunately, the power
of relief is right here.

235
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,805
All you have to do is
go to your friendly

236
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,191
neighborhood Vertigo dealer
and request the cure.

237
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,396
Simple supply and demand at work.

238
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,976
Now, tell me you want this, and it's yours.

239
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:38,115
All that pain will just disappear.

240
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,950
Say it.

241
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,511
Say you want it.

242
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,952
I want it.

243
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,704
You see? A simple solution.

244
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,966
I'm Count Vertigo, and I approve this high.

245
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,042
What do we do now?

246
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,273
We find him...

247
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,210
and we shut him down.

248
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,856
Where'd he broadcast from?

249
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,057
He bounced the signal off
a S.T.A.R. Labs satellite.

250
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,921
Could've sent that
transmissionn from Markovia.

251
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,568
He would want to stay local. Scrub the
footage, frame by frame if you have to.

252
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,188
There is something on here that
gives us a clue to where he is.

253
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:36,396
If he dosed the whole city...

254
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,295
why are only some
people showing symptoms?

255
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,931
Well, maybe exposure
was selective.

256
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,707
The Count contaminated something certain
people, like you and Donner, consumed.

257
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,110
Bethany Snow, with a special report.

258
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,846
A most dramatic turn.
City officials are urging calm...

259
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,854
hoping to avoid widespread panic.
Deputy Mayor Levitz has enlisted...

260
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,721
The Count has turned Starling
into a city of junkies.

261
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,397
Any leads on where he's holding
ADA Donner?

262
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:05,662
Mm-mm, no. As cold as it sounds,
I've got other concerns. Laurel?

263
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,862
- Adam's trial notes are very thorough.
- They better be.

264
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,143
You're lead counsel now.

265
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:12,397
Ms. Spencer, you're
the district attorney.

266
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,603
Yes, but you're the one
that the jury knows.

267
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,252
- You'll do fine, Laurel.
- I know.

268
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,447
I just found Adam's trump card.

269
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,639
Sorry, I didn't hear you walk up.
I just wanna be left alone.

270
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:46,810
Too bad that's not an option for you,
but maybe I know something that is.

271
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,783
- Hit me.
- What?

272
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,655
You wonder why I used to go out at night
looking to throw down with bad guys.

273
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,490
Part of it was to help the city.

274
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:10,129
And the other part was to help me.

275
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,835
Getting tuned up
by street thugs helped you?

276
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,669
Yeah, well, I gave as good as I got.

277
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,975
When I would throw a punch,
I'd be so angry.

278
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,078
I'd feel this heat rising inside of me.
In my jaw.

279
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,183
In my chest.

280
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,148
In my fists.

281
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,185
But it needed somewhere to go.

282
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,752
Come on.

283
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,125
Thea, you're angry.

284
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,929
At your mother, the DA, yourself maybe.

285
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,938
But that anger is gonna chew up
your insides if you don't let it out.

286
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,641
- I'm not gonna hit you, Roy.
- Try.

287
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,772
Try.

288
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,981
I said hit me, right?
Because that felt like...

289
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,711
That didn't really feel like anything.

290
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,047
Better.

291
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,729
But keep your wrist straight. Don't just
use your arm. Put your entire body into it.

292
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,890
Come on. Again.

293
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,148
At least let me call Lyla.

294
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,885
- All she could do is worry about me.
- I found something.

295
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,531
- I don't see anything.
Because you have to see what Donner does.

296
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,527
His eye caught a reflection.
Can you enhance?

297
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,404
It hurts me that you feel the need to ask.

298
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,436
- What are those, wings?
- It's the city seal.

299
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,238
Starling Municipal
Records Department.

300
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,762
That building has been abandoned
since the city went digital.

301
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,577
Dollars to donuts, that's where
the Count is operating out of.

302
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,741
Not for long.

303
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,289
You shouldn't be here.

304
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,953
- My attorney needs to...
- Moira.

305
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,295
I know I could be disbarred
for speaking with you,

306
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,485
but this isn't
something for lawyers.

307
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,601
This is a family matter.

308
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,646
Jean told me she's calling you
to the stand tomorrow.

309
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,621
- Yes.
- You can't testify.

310
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:56,389
Well, the fact that you don't want me to,
Laurel, is a good indication that I should.

311
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,887
If you take the stand, I
have to cross-examine you.

312
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,153
And I'll have to do it to
the best of my ability.

313
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,933
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

314
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,620
Forget about what this will do
to Oliver and Thea.

315
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,190
It also could undermine your entire case.

316
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,028
So, Moira, please.

317
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,496
Please, don't make me use this.

318
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,704
Everything is at stake for you.

319
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,636
And I don't wanna be the one
to take it all away.

320
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,338
Faster, please.

321
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,710
Faster. We have a city full of customers.

322
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,375
And I mean this literally.

323
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:54,484
I'm afraid my production apparatus is a
little overtaxed with the increased demand.

324
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,322
I can live with it, though.
Can't say the city can.

325
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:03,230
- Go.
- Be still my heart.

326
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,875
Step away from them.

327
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,311
Yes, I heard you developed
an allergy to killing.

328
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,576
- Do it!
- Or what?

329
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:22,911
You'll kill me?

330
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,366
You're really on the no-killing wagon.
Shame.

331
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,271
You're really letting one of life's
true pleasures pass you by.

332
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,512
You said you didn't want to testify.

333
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,052
But you have to.

334
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:03,950
Because of me.

335
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:05,787
- No.
- You have to do damage control.

336
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,125
None of this is your fault.
We're here because of what I did.

337
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,533
Now, you both know the truth,
but you don't know all of it.

338
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,968
- Laurel does.
- What does she have?

339
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,305
You shouldn't have to
find this out in court.

340
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,143
Find out what?

341
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,255
Years ago... It was many years ago.

342
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,726
Your father was engaging in his...

343
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,162
His extramarital activities.

344
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,336
And I had a moment of weakness.

345
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,831
I cheated on him.

346
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,502
With Malcolm Merlyn.

347
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,910
No.

348
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,982
No, I asked you about this.

349
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,091
Last year.

350
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,763
You said
there was nothing between you two.

351
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,710
There wasn't, sweetheart.
It wasn't an affair.

352
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:18,051
It was very brief and
a long time ago.

353
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,864
And despite it,
you remained friends with Mr. Merlyn.

354
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,007
In fact, he frequently
attended parties at your home.

355
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,803
He was my husband's best friend
until Malcolm killed him.

356
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:31,210
And this is why you claim to feel
as though you were in fear for your life...

357
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,046
and the lives of your children.

358
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,740
Well, I think it's a
fairly compelling reason.

359
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,948
Last year, your second husband,

360
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:43,182
Walter Steele, was abducted by Mr.
Merlyn, is that correct?

361
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,350
Yes. So you see...

362
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,395
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter
the same as your first husband?

363
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,724
I convinced Malcolm not to.

364
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,664
And Malcolm listened to you.

365
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,738
Your friend spared Walter's life...

366
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:02,811
and yet you'd have this jury believing
that you and your children were in danger?

367
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,074
- We were. I was afraid...
- Afraid of getting caught.

368
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:12,086
Despite whatever youthful mistakes
I might have made...

369
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,354
Malcolm Merlyn was a dangerous man.

370
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,652
To other people.

371
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:21,923
But the only person who truly posed a
danger to Moira Queen and her family...

372
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,428
was Moira Queen.

373
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,340
Hey.

374
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:49,147
Look, if you wanna
attack me, go right ahead.

375
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,561
But you should know you're not gonna say
anything I haven't already said to myself.

376
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,283
Whoa. I know that that
was difficult for you,

377
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:57,816
and I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

378
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,299
No. No.

379
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,935
I don't understand how you could forgive me
after what I just did in there.

380
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,573
I don't understand how anyone could.

381
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,580
So obviously you three
took the Hozen out of this cave.

382
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,255
Lift him up.

383
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,487
Now, I know he doesn't have it,
which means one of you two does.

384
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,328
Give it to me, and we'll
discuss an exchange.

385
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,661
We don't know what you're talking about.

386
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,498
Give us Oliver,
and we'll leave you alone to look for it.

387
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,173
Anybody else wanna be stupid?

388
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,908
Hey. Hey!

389
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,081
Fine. Take him. Cut him loose.

390
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,680
- Move! Move!
- What are you doing?

391
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,359
We have to keep moving.
They're following us.

392
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,358
We know.

393
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,644
We're continuing
to monitor both of these major stories...

394
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,678
on what has become a significant
news day here in Starling.

395
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:22,139
What can you tell us about...

396
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,720
Oliver's gotta be
pretty wrapped up with his mother.

397
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:28,484
You making progress on how the Counts
getting Vertigo into people's systems?

398
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,151
Not much. Each dot is the home
of somebody with withdrawal symptoms.

399
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,728
It seems pretty random.

400
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,298
That's because it's very random.

401
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:39,293
Okay.

402
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,669
What if people weren't exposed at home?
What if they got dosed at work?

403
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,400
Can you do this
by their employment addresses?

404
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,242
I'm really starting to wonder
what it would take to impress you guys.

405
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,915
Look, it's a trail. A
path through the city.

406
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:55,929
Any place you've been?

407
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:57,977
59th and Dell. That's
where I got my flu shot.

408
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,767
You got your vaccination from
one of those trucks, right?

409
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,276
One of those roving flu trucks?

410
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,418
The route.

411
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,262
It's a flu vaccination tour, a truck sent
out by Starling City Mobile Care.

412
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,991
I got addicted after one injection?
That can happen?

413
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,760
Sure. Try heroin sometime.

414
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,173
- Not "try" try.
- All right, where's the truck now?

415
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,432
Downtown. What do you think?

416
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:20,609
Call Oliver?

417
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:23,466
No, no, he's busy with his family.
I'll go. I'll go.

418
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,707
Yeah, no. That's not happening.

419
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,773
I'll go.

420
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,606
- Felicity, it's too dangerous.
- It could turn out to be nothing.

421
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,779
If it's not, I'll call.

422
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,753
Courtroom drama you just witnessed?

423
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,586
Bethany, no one expected the turn
that testimony took.

424
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:40,457
A revelation that Moira Queen
once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn...

425
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,963
became the sole focus
of the prosecution's cross.

426
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,104
Hello?

427
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:03,114
Anybody home?

428
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,797
Vertigo. Gotcha.

429
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:23,338
Funny, you took the words
right out of my mouth.

430
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,341
- Thea?
- Can we call it a night?

431
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,179
Jury just signaled they
could have a verdict.

432
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,444
The judge will not send them home.
He wants to get this over with.

433
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:40,089
- Line forms behind me.
- A verdict that quickly is bad, isn't it?

434
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,683
I think the two of you
should prepare for the worst.

435
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,297
Excuse me.

436
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,198
- Felicity.
- Oliver.

437
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,474
Is it okay if I call you Oliver?

438
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,968
Surprised to hear from me, right?

439
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,375
Not as surprised as I was.

440
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:11,885
You see, I find this not unattractive blond
getting all up in my business.

441
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,987
And what does she have on her?

442
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,989
A Queen Consolidated ID badge.

443
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:21,894
Now, I think to myself,
"Why does that name ring a bell?"

444
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,228
Oliver Queen.

445
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,400
He tried to buy off me last year.

446
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,537
Just before the Hood
put me in a padded cell.

447
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,238
Ipso facto, Arrow.

448
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,411
- Where are you going?
- Um...

449
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,048
Somethings come up at the office.

450
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,153
- Ollie, the jury.
- I have to go.

451
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,380
Pretty swanky offices.

452
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,117
You can see all the destruction
that your mom caused from up here.

453
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,591
What do you want?

454
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,891
World peace and personal satisfaction.

455
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,296
Though not necessarily in that order.

456
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,773
You poisoned me and put me in a hole.

457
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:41,141
You have no idea
how much I hated you for that.

458
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,437
- Turns out someone else hates you too.
- Who?

459
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:47,641
Heh. Oh, you're going to be surprised
when you find out.

460
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,483
He's a man of means.

461
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,313
Se! me up with my new operation
so I could draw you out.

462
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,286
- To do what?
- This.

463
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,821
- You're gonna have to try harder.
- Done.

464
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,500
Come on.

465
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,317
So now we move on to plan B.

466
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,989
- Oliver, don't. Not for me.
- Quiet, please. I'm threatening.

467
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,459
Lower your bow.

468
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:43,632
Your problem is with me, it's not with her.

469
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:47,538
Then consider this your penalty for making
me go to plan B in the first place.

470
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:07,220
Hey. Hey, hey. Shh, shh, shh.

471
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,389
It's all right. You're safe.

472
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,193
- You were shot.
- Hey.

473
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,505
It's nothing.

474
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,266
- Any news?
- Where have you been?

475
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,001
Something happened
at Queen Consolidated.

476
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,680
And you will see it on the news later.
Don't worry about it.

477
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,180
What would you have done
if there'd been a verdict?

478
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,681
Thea...

479
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,346
I don't know.

480
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,717
Are you okay?

481
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,960
Hey. Jury's back.

482
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,718
Come on.

483
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:18,357
I have received a note
that the jury has arrived at a verdict.

484
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,436
Please publish the verdict.

485
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:30,545
"In the Superior Court of Star County,
State vs. Moira Queen, verdict."

486
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:37,711
On one count of conspiracy in the first
degree, the defendant is found not guilty.

487
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:43,320
On the 503 counts of murder in the first
degree, the defendant is found...

488
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,986
"not guilty."

489
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,226
I don't believe it.

490
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,397
Mom.

491
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:12,149
I love you both so much.

492
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:26,800
A stunning result
as Moira Queen is acquitted of all charges.

493
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:30,439
In a day that's provided a week's worth
of shocks and legal twists...

494
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,098
many had pronounced this case
a done deal.

495
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,279
Congratulations. Is that appropriate?

496
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,505
She should have lost.

497
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,182
Should have been convicted.

498
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,375
Did you want her to be?

499
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,448
I expected her to be.

500
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,888
- Verdict doesn't make sense.
- Still, your mom must be thrilled. Beyond.

501
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:53,289
It's more like shock, I think.

502
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:57,126
They're processing her now.
I just wanted to check in on you.

503
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,461
- And you.
- I'm feeling better.

504
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,196
And with the Vertigo-tainted vaccine...

505
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,807
Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences division...

506
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,376
was able to formulate
a nonaddictive treatment.

507
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,214
Good.

508
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,479
Need to meet my family at home.

509
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,814
So you guys go home, get rest.

510
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,492
- Good night.
- Good night.

511
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,656
Oliver?

512
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,260
- I just wanted to say thank you.
- Yeah.

513
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,335
And I'm sorry.

514
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,931
For what?

515
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,672
I got myself into trouble again,
and you killed him.

516
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,607
You killed again, and I am sorry...

517
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,482
...that I was the one who
put you in a position

518
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,147
where you had to make
that kind of choice.

519
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,779
Felicity.

520
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,523
He had you and he was gonna hurt you.

521
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,022
There was no choice to make.

522
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,142
Why did you do that?

523
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,723
Because you stopped the
Captain from killing me.

524
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,707
Thank you for coming.

525
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,712
- Shado, he doesn't look too good.
- He's not.

526
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,474
- Who's this?
- It's complicated.

527
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:25,552
That Hozen thing they're looking for
is back on the plane.

528
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:28,223
No, I've got it.

529
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,791
There's a Buddhist inscription on one side.
It reminded me of my father.

530
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,793
I'm pretty sure they're not
interested in Buddhism.

531
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,988
What's on the other side?

532
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,429
"30, 31, 75, 12."

533
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,628
Numbers, what?

534
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:44,896
Coordinates.

535
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,300
But to what?

536
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,572
A Kairyu-class Japanese submarine
which ran aground here during World War ll.

537
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,478
What do these guys want
with a 70-year-old sub?

538
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,812
The sub isn't important,
but what's on it...

539
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,516
it'll save the human race.

540
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,084
Will it save him?

541
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:16,171
Well, you survived your own stupidity.
Congratulations.

542
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,264
You know...

543
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:23,608
I needed you to deal with any resistance
that I encountered on the island.

544
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,942
I gotta say,
you've done a fairly lousy job of that.

545
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,387
Congratulations. You're the new captain.

546
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,624
I arrange for the Count
to take out the Arrow.

547
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,792
And all I accomplish is reigniting
the vigilante's killing spree.

548
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,302
Sir, there's been a development.

549
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,925
Brother Cyrus.

550
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,430
How do you feel?

551
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,332
Stronger.

552
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:23,997
Good.

553
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,242
Then you're ready.

554
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,881
Mrs. Queen, how does it feel
to get away with murder?

555
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,677
I want you to go out back.
There's a car waiting for you.

556
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,912
- Did you kill your first husband?
- Just keep going.

557
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,916
Obviously Mrs. Queen is
overjoyed that the jury has

558
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:44,584
ruled that she was acting
under terrible duress.

559
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,923
- Can you give us anything?
- I'm afraid...

560
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,258
- This way, Mrs. Queen.
- Yes.

561
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,575
The freeway will be quicker.

562
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:15,053
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen. I was instructed
not to take you home. Not yet.

563
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,171
Where are we? I don't know this place.

564
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,239
I've got her, sir.

565
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,912
Hello, Moira.

566
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,683
You... You're suppo...
They said you were dead.

567
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,322
There are parts of the world where death
is an illusion. I've been to one.

568
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,083
I learned to be very convincing.

569
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:55,091
But I returned because you needed my help.

570
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,264
- Help?
- With your trial.

571
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,662
You didn't think that jury acquitted you
without a little persuasion?

572
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,773
Dear God.

573
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,274
What do you want, Malcolm?

574
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,617
I still have resources in Starling.

575
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,377
Associates.

576
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:22,450
Heh. Including one in the DA's office.

577
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,622
I followed Mr. Donner's investigation
of you with interest.

578
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,264
The ease with which you
lied about us for years,

579
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,415
it made me wonder
whether you lied to me.

580
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,399
No.

581
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:38,164
It was a matter of a simple surreptitious
genetics test to confirm my suspicions.

582
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:39,899
Don't.

583
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:44,307
Imagine my joy at learning
that Thea is my daughter.
