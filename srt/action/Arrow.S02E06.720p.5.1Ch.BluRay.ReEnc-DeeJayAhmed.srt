1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,891
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,930
After five years on a hellish island...

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,890
I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,008
To save my city.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,728
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,768
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,006
I must be something else.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,441
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,921
As much as I would love
to make this city safer...

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,130
my first obligation is to Queen
Consolidated. And yours is too.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,442
- I did some reading up on Lawton.
- Lyla, listen.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,246
Did you think I wouldn't find out
he killed your brother?

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,447
That you were using me?

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,610
I need to see this guy in a bag.
You of all people should get that.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,130
Long time.
Particularly for Bratva captain, Mr. Queen.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,642
Anatoli Knyazev,
he speaks very highly of you.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,484
He should. I saved his life.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,004
You were supposed to sign this
report at last night's board meeting.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,161
Know why you didn't?

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
Probably because I didn't attend
last night's board meeting.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,643
Where were you?

22
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,715
I have other interests
outside of this company.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,808
- I don't.
- Mr. Queen?

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,645
I thought you were serious
when you said we were partners.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,804
- Isabel, I missed one meeting.
- This week.

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,008
- Last week, it was two meetings.
- Mr. Queen?

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,929
Company-wide revenue is up double digits
since you and I took over...

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,320
- Oliver!
- Yeah?

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,245
I'm sorry to interrupt your...

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,571
Um, I need to talk to you
about your plans for this evening.

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,846
With Mr. Harper.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,045
You'll have to excuse me.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,362
We have work to do. It's important.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,241
So are my evening plans. I'm sorry.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,210
We are going to have to work
on your excuses.

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,089
You're right.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,483
You should be more careful.

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,290
You're completely exposed.

39
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,325
I knew you were there.

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,201
You wanted me to tell you when the
funny-money guys were ready to make a sale?

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,089
- Here we go.
- Not "we."

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,920
Go home. I already have help.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,762
Here's the fake.

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,680
Let's see the real.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,043
You got two right above you.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,049
Another at your six.

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,084
Stay where you are. Don't move.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,288
- I wanna make a citizen's arrest.
- Don't move.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,167
That's it. I'm clear.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,009
Strike Force X to Mockingbird.
We have the prize. We're coming home.

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,364
Who are you people?

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,650
- NSA? CIA?
- My name is Amanda Waller.

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,606
Thought you A.R.G.U.S. guys
were supposed to be more subtle.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,926
For us, this was subtle.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,963
- Then I wanna see Lyla Michaels.
- So do I.

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,761
- Agent Michaels has gone dark.
- Lyla's missing?

57
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,321
- What happened?
- She was running down a lead in Moscow.

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,608
She's missed two of her scheduled call-ins.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,201
- What are you doing about it?
- Speaking to you.

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,648
Even if we knew where in Russia Lyla is...

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,992
my superiors believe
sending in an extraction

62
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,113
team could cause an
international incident.

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,609
As far as they're concerned, she's already
a framed picture on our lobby wall.

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,087
Why are you telling me all this?

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,885
Because I know how you and Oliver Queen
spend your nights.

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,723
And I know your passport is up-to-date.

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,607
It'd help to start with what Lyla was doing
in Moscow in the first place.

68
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,996
Who was this lead she
was tracking down?

69
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,353
A line on the whereabouts
of Floyd Lawton.

70
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,049
Deadshot.

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,084
Lyla was in Russia for me.

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,727
Agent Michaels is an asset
I can't easily replace.

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,568
I know you find her
similarly irreplaceable.

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,201
Bring her home, Mr. Diggle.

75
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,524
Thanks.
It's been a while since I arrested you.

76
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,330
I've forgotten how good it feels.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,367
I was working for him.

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,085
Him who?

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,123
The guy who cost you your shield.

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,842
I'm on his team.

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,883
You are too, right?

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,487
Anybody else having serious déjà vu?

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,843
It's all right, we're letting him go.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,849
It's our mistake.

85
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,202
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,810
Okay, uh, let's just get out of here
before anyone changes their mind.

87
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,124
The potentially catastrophic risk
of turning on this machine...

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,130
far outweigh any scientific gain
that might come from it.

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,365
The people need to understand just how
dangerous technology like this is...

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,808
and the very real possibility
of a cataclysmic event.

91
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,484
Where'd you go? ls everything okay?

92
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,325
Yeah. I just need a few personal days.

93
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,847
- What's going on?
- Have to help a friend.

94
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,166
Who?

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
Lyla Michaels.

96
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,806
It's his spy girlfriend
that works for A.R.G.U.S.

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,726
She went to Russia looking for Deadshot.
For me.

98
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,086
And now she's missing.

99
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,406
Felicity...

100
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,043
I think it's time we visited our Queen
Consolidated subsidiary in Moscow.

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,242
- Yeah.
- Oliver, what are you doing?

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,289
Just need to help a friend.

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,364
- I can't ask you to do that.
- You didn't.

104
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,726
Sara?

105
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,045
My name's Ivo.

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,763
What's your name?

107
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,127
Tommy.

108
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,089
So...

109
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,848
how did you come to be on this island,
Tommy? I assume it wasn't by choice.

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,084
My, uh...

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,247
My boat was shipwrecked here.

112
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,165
And I was the only survivor.

113
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,442
I'm sorry to hear that.

114
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,241
Did you explore the island much?

115
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,563
Some of it.

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,245
Why?

117
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,528
You didn't happen to run across a Japanese
Imperial Navy submarine, did you?

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,367
During World War ll...

119
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,366
every country was trying
to develop the ultimate weapon.

120
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,122
The United States had the Manhattan Project,
of course, the Nazis had Das Uranverein...

121
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,760
and the Japanese, well...

122
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,763
they had Mirakuru.

123
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,885
Stem-cell and genetic therapies.
Decades ahead of their time.

124
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,280
Every war advances the cause of science.

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,644
And the Japanese, they
had developed a serum...

126
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,771
that caused increased strength
and rapid cell regeneration.

127
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,645
- They called it Mirakuru.
- "Miracle."

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,441
Thought they could create an army
of super soldiers.

129
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,010
They were transporting their only supply
via submarine...

130
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,484
when that sub came under heavy fire
by the Allied forces...

131
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,923
and it ran aground in
this chain of islands.

132
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,687
Thanks to you...

133
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,369
we now know it's this island.

134
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,126
You killed my friends.

135
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,845
Which means it's up to you...

136
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,929
to help us find that sub.

137
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,567
Are we forgetting something?

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,525
Where do you think you're going?

139
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,250
Tahiti.

140
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,482
That's funny. The flight manifest says
you're going to Moscow.

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,241
Well, we're gonna stop by there,
you know, after Tahiti.

142
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,610
What kind of partner decides
to interact with our

143
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:16,668
overseas holdings behind
the other ones back?

144
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,368
- It was an oversight.
- Oh.

145
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,042
Well, lucky for our partnership,
I'm a fast packer.

146
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,850
Oliver, her tagging along
does not help matters any.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,809
I will take care of her.

148
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,450
John...

149
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,570
we're gonna bring Lyla back...

150
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,562
wherever she is.

151
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,369
Okay, Mr. Queen.

152
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,171
I've arranged a meeting
with the chief operating officer...

153
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,245
of our Moscow subsidiaries, tomorrow at 10
a.m. Try your hardest not to miss this one.

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,414
You know, I'm not this person
that you seem to think I am.

155
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,109
That depends.

156
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,321
On what?

157
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,047
On if I think you used the corporate jet
for a weekend of fun with your assistant.

158
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,247
Excuse me?

159
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,762
A blond IT girl all of a sudden gets
promoted to be assistant to the CEO.

160
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,611
There are only two ways that happens.
One is nepotism...

161
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,728
and she doesn't look like your cousin.

162
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,769
That is absolutely not happening.

163
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,442
What were her qualifications?
Aside from an abundance of short skirts.

164
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,285
Her skirts aren't that short.

165
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,204
- What was that about?
- Nothing. Everything with Knyazev is set.

166
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,523
You have friends in the Russian mafia?
Color me not-at-all surprised.

167
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,039
You're going straight
to the hotel in a cab.

168
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,304
No, you're leaving me with her?

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,931
Dig and I need to get a drink.

170
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,089
I wouldn't mind a drink.

171
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,365
Miss Loring. I didn't take
you for the club-hopping type.

172
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,803
- Heh. Well, I'm here on business.
- Is everything okay with my mom?

173
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,122
We need to discuss something
about this case.

174
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,576
Your boyfriend, Roy,
was arrested last night.

175
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,834
I know. But it was
actually a misunderstanding.

176
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,645
- He got released... Well, a few
reporters got hold of the story...

177
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,121
and they now know
you're dating a known felon.

178
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,561
Thea, your mother is on trial for her life.

179
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,286
Her whole defense pivots on being seen
as a loving mother...

180
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,331
who did what she had to do to protect
her children, what kind of parent she was.

181
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,842
We need the people to know
that she raised you to make good decisions.

182
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,410
So if you care about your mom...

183
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,683
you're gonna have
to end this relationship immediately.

184
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,042
Oliver Queen? Ha!

185
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,042
My favorite American.

186
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,966
It has been too long.

187
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,287
- John Diggle, this is Anatoli Knyazev.
- Thank you for meeting us.

188
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,927
If Oliver vouches for you,
you're my second favorite American.

189
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,801
First, a toast.

190
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,730
None for me, thanks.

191
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,406
Strength.

192
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,887
Now business.

193
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,360
This is woman you look for, yes?

194
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,808
Picture is from two days ago.
From gulag. Prison.

195
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,121
Lyla was arrested?

196
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,006
Not quite. From what I hear,
she was trying to break in.

197
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,249
- Why?
- I do not know.

198
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,927
But clearly she had issues
breaking back out.

199
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,322
Gulag is worst in Russia.

200
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,924
It's called Koshmar.

201
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,766
"The Nightmare."

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,324
It's full of violent
psychopaths and killers.

203
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,931
And that's just the guards.

204
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,560
Anatoli, we need a way into the gulag
to extract her.

205
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,445
You get in, you get shot
before you get out.

206
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,403
Or end up like your friend.
It is impossible.

207
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,366
The only thing that's impossible is us
leaving this country without this woman.

208
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,763
I like this guy.

209
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,766
We have no word for "optimist" in Russian.

210
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,128
The only way into Koshmar is as prisoner.

211
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,884
Now, I have guard there, owes me favor.
It could work.

212
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,449
I give you one shot in 20.

213
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,650
- Set it up. I'll go.
- No, it has to be me.

214
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,443
No...

215
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,634
Oliver, what if something
happens to you in there?

216
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,411
What happens to me, Felicity,
or Isabel for that matter?

217
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,647
You have to be on the outside,
making the moves.

218
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,928
I'll go inside.

219
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,606
I've got this.

220
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,842
Now, that is a lot of drugs.

221
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,447
Courtesy of Knyazev. I'll have enough
weight to land me into Koshmar.

222
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,241
You need to be wearing this
when they process you.

223
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,483
The guards will take it,
but that's the point.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,686
This is Knyazev's man inside the prison.

225
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,365
A guard.

226
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,010
He'll know where in the gulag
Lyla is being held.

227
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,966
When all hell breaks loose, you need to meet
us at the rendezvous point with Lyla or...

228
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,202
Or I am a permanent Russian.

229
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,806
Just thinking out loud...

230
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,009
but are we sure this is the best plan
we can come up with?

231
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,850
I know Lyla's your friend, but...

232
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,804
Felicity, Lyla isn't my friend.

233
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,165
She was my wife.

234
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,044
Explain that sentence.

235
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,201
Lyla and I met in the Army
back in Afghanistan.

236
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,849
But we didn't stay married long
once we got stateside.

237
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,049
We couldn't figure out a way to stay
married without a war to fight.

238
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,366
So she joined A.R.G.U.S.
and I circled back for my third tour.

239
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,727
I can't leave here without her, Felicity.

240
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,446
I just can't.

241
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,566
Two-minute warning.

242
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,766
Good luck, John.

243
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,284
They have him.

244
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,724
The clock's running.

245
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,010
Hurry up.

246
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,244
What crime fits your punishment?

247
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,488
- Drugs. And you?
- Ah.

248
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,048
I gave speech.
For government corruption.

249
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,281
Right.

250
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,970
It is rare
to see one of your people in Koshmar.

251
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,327
What, American?

252
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,571
- Uh...
- Heh.

253
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,047
Chernokozhiy not popular here.

254
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,768
Shocker.

255
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,442
You think Dig's okay?

256
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,088
I think he's doing the same as he was
when you asked five minutes ago.

257
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,767
They're coming.

258
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,764
They sell us Russian
police truck for cheap.

259
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,562
What'd you say?

260
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,369
"Please."

261
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,686
You know, in Russia there is gulag.

262
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,123
Almost as bad as this.

263
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,291
- Sara...
- Don't say my name.

264
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,167
If they find out we know each other,
they'll kill us both.

265
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,651
I thought you drowned.

266
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,405
When I came up, the boat was gone,
and I thought you were too.

267
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,040
I was floating out there for days
when this ship, they found me.

268
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,565
And they saved me.

269
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,643
Is that why you're helping them?

270
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,201
I don't have a choice.

271
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,006
I need to warn my friends.

272
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,001
You said they were dead.

273
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,845
They're not that easy to kill.

274
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,850
Try not to move.

275
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,890
It smells like puke.

276
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,530
It'll heal your wounds.

277
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,484
You have to go.

278
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,091
Get out of here.

279
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,208
Get to high ground.

280
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,805
I'm not leaving you.

281
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,402
I don't wanna be the reason
something happens to you.

282
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,690
Then we're in agreement,
because I make my own choices.

283
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,846
You're a strong woman.

284
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,723
When I care about someone,
there's nothing I won't do for them.

285
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,050
Another thing we have in common.

286
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,085
It's the burns.
They lower your body temperature.

287
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,761
Here.

288
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,761
- Where you been all night?
- Working.

289
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,251
Oh.

290
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,729
Well, you deserve a break.

291
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,566
Um, actually, I've been thinking.

292
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,722
Maybe we should take some space.

293
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,963
I mean, we work together and live together.

294
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,929
It's kind of getting hard to breathe.

295
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,884
Since when? Oh, wait, does this have to do
with that lawyer lady dropping by?

296
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,402
No, this has to do with the fact that you've
been arrested twice in the last month.

297
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,927
Come on,
I've been trying to stay out of trouble.

298
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,162
My body hasn't had a
scratch on it in weeks.

299
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,246
I mean, excluding the
ones that you put there.

300
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:48,827
And the other night?

301
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,451
Was a misunderstanding.

302
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,290
Roy...

303
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,284
this just isn't working, okay?

304
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,283
Not for me.

305
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,641
Thea, you can't mean that.

306
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,805
I do.

307
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,601
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,044
Those men...

309
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,480
they are vory.

310
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,524
They are in charge.

311
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,160
Is best to stay away.

312
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,124
Got it.

313
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,524
Listen, I'm looking for a guard
named Sergei Pavelski.

314
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,327
Far corner. Over there.

315
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,887
American, you are a suka now.

316
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,010
Are we seriously gonna do this?

317
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,525
I guess so.

318
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,011
Fighting strictly prohibited.

319
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,731
You missed the tour.

320
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,407
What happened to you?

321
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,406
I saw a Russian vehicle
that I simply had to have.

322
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,688
Is that why you came to Russia?
Car shopping?

323
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,882
Oh, I just only ordered one.

324
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,411
One's for me.

325
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,604
What is this?

326
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,728
Cold room.

327
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,047
Six hours for you.

328
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,646
Six hours?
You can't keep me in here that long.

329
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,446
Now seven hours.

330
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,848
Well, that was pretty stupid.

331
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,490
Then again, you never really were
one of the brightest guys.

332
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,166
Deadshot.

333
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,129
Your spine frozen through yet?

334
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,123
Trust me...

335
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,408
my problem here isn't with the cold.

336
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,841
You still haven't forgiven me
for shooting your brother?

337
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,810
- Argh!
- Man, you really hold a grudge.

338
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,482
I know why you're here.

339
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,120
That girl from A.R.G.U.S.

340
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,451
Lyla didn't find a lead on you...

341
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,164
she found you.

342
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,401
Does everyone really think
that Felicity and I are...?

343
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,688
No. Just everyone who works
at Queen Consolidated.

344
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,323
She's just a friend.

345
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,847
You don't seem like the kind of man
who has female friends.

346
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,082
Can I ask you a personal question?

347
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,602
With some vodka in me, I just might answer.

348
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,049
Why does saving my family's company
mean so much to you?

349
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,084
Despite what Sheryl Sandberg might say...

350
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,241
it still isn't that easy
to make it as a woman in business.

351
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,529
I've given up a lot.

352
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,048
Which means, if I don't succeed at
everything, then what was the point?

353
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,801
Hmm.

354
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,446
May I ask you a personal question?

355
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,564
Others have tried and failed.

356
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,042
Why do you try so hard to make me think
you're a lazy idiot?

357
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,326
I know you're not.

358
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,964
Underneath that swagger,
I see you pretty clearly.

359
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,730
Really?

360
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,201
And what do you see?

361
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,124
You're intelligent...

362
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,244
driven...

363
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,365
and lonely.

364
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,363
How do you see that?

365
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,049
Because it's what I see
when I look in the mirror.

366
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,528
We don't have much time.

367
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,328
Let's go, let's go.

368
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,969
Nice seeing you, John.

369
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,047
You speak Russian.

370
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,486
I was raised in Moscow until I was 9.

371
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,450
Then adopted by a family
that took me to America.

372
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,047
Took me years to get rid of my accent.

373
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,365
It isn't easy making friends in grade
school when you sound like Natasha.

374
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,163
I don't have a lot of time.

375
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,645
I'll be quick.

376
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,001
Five minutes. Must hurry.

377
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,130
Remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes
when this is all over.

378
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,009
I don't smoke.

379
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,368
You weren't gonna leave without me,
were you?

380
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,851
I should kill you right now!

381
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,650
You won't.

382
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,491
Why?

383
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,644
Because I'm the only one who knows
where your little girlfriend is.

384
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,525
You're not stupid. You wouldn't put
yourself in here without an exit strategy.

385
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,366
I take you to the girl, you take me out.

386
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,969
I just really have to go. I'm sorry.

387
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,966
Do I strike you as someone
who needs to cuddle?

388
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,363
- Hi.
- Hi.

389
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,885
It's time. Ready?

390
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,568
- Yeah, but...
- I think she can take the night off, don't you?

391
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,406
- Uh...
- Felicity...

392
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,482
What happens in Russia, stays in Russia.

393
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,165
Even when it makes no sense whatsoever.

394
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,765
Guessing, uh, you wanna hold onto that.

395
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,929
This way.

396
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,323
- What were you thinking?
- What?

397
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,245
Almost 64 million women
over the age of consent in Russia...

398
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,606
and you sleep with her.

399
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,209
So we're not doing the
"What happens in Russia, stays in Russia"?

400
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,850
We're still in Russia.

401
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,451
There is nothing money cannot buy
in this country.

402
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,490
Diggle should be heading out with Lyla
in two minutes.

403
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,371
Breaking out of prison is harder
than it looks.

404
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,363
You of all people should know that.

405
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,970
Stay quiet. Follow me.

406
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,483
You'll remember the rest of us?

407
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
Yes?

408
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,689
I promise.

409
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,081
I'll come back.

410
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,484
Come on.

411
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,406
Are we making a swim for it?

412
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,841
No, they'd shoot us
the second we hit the water.

413
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,326
You said your friends, they have
one of the radios from the ship, right?

414
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,970
Yeah.

415
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,963
Look like you know what you're doing there.

416
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,401
The past year,
I've learned things I never expected to.

417
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,971
You and me both.

418
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,721
They won't respond
unless they hear your voice.

419
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,529
Slade?

420
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,643
Come on. Can you hear me?
Can you hear...

421
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,086
- Thank God you're alive.
- Yeah, I'm on the...

422
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,203
- Sara, what are you doing?
- There's only two of them.

423
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,762
They haven't moved from the location
of the mortar attack.

424
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,445
What the hell is going on here?

425
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,841
You just confirmed
that your friends are alive.

426
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,404
Which means they're still a threat.

427
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,324
You know, until we kill them.

428
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,811
You son of a... Unh!

429
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,488
If I say she's in there,
what's keeping you from shooting me?

430
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,724
Honor.

431
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,928
You should try it sometime.

432
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,249
Lyla.

433
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,686
Johnnie.

434
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,410
Ready to go home?

435
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,528
You came for me.

436
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,330
Always have.

437
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,641
Always will.

438
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,084
Deadshot's here. In the prison.

439
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,685
I know.

440
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,005
What's your extraction plan?

441
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,521
It depends. What time is it?

442
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,330
That's it. Let's go. Go, go, go.
Move, move, move.

443
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,567
This way.

444
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,849
I got it. I shut down the phones.
The guards can't call for help.

445
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,966
If your friend and the woman are not here
by now, they will not be here at all.

446
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,648
Much better.

447
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,286
Oliver, get down.

448
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,247
Follow me. Move!

449
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,928
We're clear.

450
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,362
Stop the truck.

451
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,687
Get out.

452
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,523
Get out.

453
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,529
Move, Lawton.

454
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,122
That's the thing about honor, John...

455
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,767
you can't turn it on and off.

456
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,883
I'm just curious.

457
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,121
How is it you think
your brother ended up dead?

458
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,203
You shot at a client that Andy
was protecting and you missed.

459
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,761
I don't miss.

460
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,488
Your brother was the contract.

461
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,290
Who would wanna kill Andy?

462
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,603
Don't know their names, just an alias.

463
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,925
H.I.V.E.

464
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,567
Food for thought, John.
Food for thought.

465
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,770
Are we going to discuss
what happened last night?

466
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,763
Why would we?

467
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,281
No reason.

468
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,363
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.

469
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,007
Thank you.

470
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,762
You had my back.

471
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,130
And now you know what it feels like.

472
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,843
What are you...? What are you doing here?

473
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,241
Good question.

474
00:37:26,266 --> 00:37:29,508
I've gotten a lot of calls from prison,
but never from my girlfriend's mother.

475
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,332
It occurred to me that
I've never been given

476
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:34,904
the opportunity to meet
the man in your life.

477
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,123
I don't know if she told you,
but your daughter kind of dumped me.

478
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,567
And what you should know
is that she did it for me.

479
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,683
Jean told me she came to see you.

480
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,365
I told her she shouldn't have.

481
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,929
- Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
- Look, us being together...

482
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,681
it can hurt her case.

483
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:59,043
Thea, your social life is not going to be
the determining factor in my trial.

484
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,044
Sweetheart, what you've had to endure
this last year...

485
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,522
is more than most people go through
in two lifetimes.

486
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,721
But you've not only survived,
you've flourished.

487
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,731
I think a lot of that has to do with Roy.

488
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,601
So as your mother,
I forbid you not to see him.

489
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,611
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha.

490
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,730
I have to admit, this is not how I
anticipated my trip to Russia ending.

491
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,609
You just feel lucky
we made it out of there alive.

492
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,408
Thank you.
Not just for coming for me.

493
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,682
For doing what you had to once you did.

494
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,160
You mean working with Deadshot?

495
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,764
You know, me and Carly broke up
because I couldn't love her...

496
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,524
and hate him at the same time.

497
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,686
I'm honored to be the exception.

498
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,924
Lyla, you were always the exception.

499
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,360
I have a debrief with A.R.G.U.S. at 0800.

500
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,091
No, no. Let Waller stew.

501
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,928
Stay for breakfast.

502
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,245
Throw in your blueberry pancakes
and you may be able to convince me.

503
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,602
Can you deliver this to Isabel's office,
please?

504
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,285
Why her?

505
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,802
I mean, besides the obvious
leggy-model reason.

506
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,571
It just kind of happened.

507
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,480
It didn't mean anything.

508
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,481
Hey.

509
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,326
Because of the life that I lead...

510
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,283
I just think that it's better to not...

511
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,851
be with someone
that I could really care about.

512
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,161
Well, I think...

513
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,491
I think you deserve better than her.

514
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,767
We have their location.
This one's no longer of use to us.

515
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,647
Let's see how good you are...

516
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,849
at removing a bullet from your head.

517
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,686
Wait.

518
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,167
He could still be useful.

519
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,962
She's right.

520
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,567
Once we get rid of his friends,
we'll need him to lead us to the graves.

521
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,405
Sometimes I wonder
who gives the orders here, you...

522
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,927
or your little bouzin.

523
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,809
You're going back to the island.

524
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,047
Oliver.
