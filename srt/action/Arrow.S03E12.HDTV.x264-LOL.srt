every so often
on the 911 calls.

you were looking for her.

No.

I don't see how.

Some of this stuff
goes back decades.

There is plenty of
evidence against Brick,

but there's nothing
the police can make stick.

00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:04,939
So this is what Brick has
reduced us to--

something in Brick's M.O.

a couple doors for us to kick down.

I could change the Glades

not that I generally
believe in hell,

I will make an exception.

advocating,

as much trouble

finding Brick
as we've had.

Brick's men have
been busy.

They're cutting down

of satellite line of sight,

292
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,966

how to find somebody.

the cell towers were down,

294
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,670
the how was Brick's
crew communicating?

At the diner, his men,
they were--

They were using walkies.

297
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:40,476
Do you think that
you could--

298
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:43,212
I don't know--use
those signals to locate Brick?

299

You haven't been
down here that much.

300
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,148
If they're communicating
via radio,

301
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,483
they'll be on the FRS,

302
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:50,653
somewhere between
462 and 467 megahertz.

303
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,621
If I send out
a frequency burst,

304
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:55,191
I should be able
to triangulate their location.

40 feet north

322
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,573
of your current position.

323
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:18,941
It should drop you off
in the east wing.

324
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,743
There are only
two sentries there now.

325
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,111
Roy: Got it!

326
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:29,785
If you see anyone,
kill them!

327
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,784
You want to get me?

328
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,758
Roy, are you there?

329
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,393
Laurel, can you
hear me?

330
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,432
This is what we do
when we get you in our sights!

331
00:17:16,434 --> 00:17:18,267
Modulated voice:
Daniel Brickwell.

332
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:20,603
What the hell are
you supposed to be?

333
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,915
We need to talk.

334
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,703
Somebody please tell me
how this is happening again.

335
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:44,171
Daniel Brickwell.

336
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,676
It seems we have
a common interest.

337
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:50,278
You know that Brickwell
killed your wife.

338
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,481
Her name was Rebecca.

339
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,149
Since my death,

340
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:57,618
maintaining my usual
network of associates

341
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,888
has become--heh--
shall we say, problematic,

342
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,524
but the fact that you
were able to locate Mr. Brickwell

343
00:18:03,526 --> 00:18:05,993
despite the fact that
he has gone to ground

344
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:08,229
demonstrates
your group's capacity.

345
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:11,966
You followed us.
We led you right to him.

346
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,702
And I saved your
lives in the bargain.

347
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:19,040
So why not continue
our association?

348
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:24,712
You want us
to team up with you?

349
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:27,281
I guess the question
before you is

350
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:29,016
whether your scorn
for me outweighs your need

351
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,718
to see Mr. Brickwell
dealt with.

352
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,453
You mean killed.

353
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:38,192
You have
your options.

354
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,994
Weigh them.

355
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:46,801
Cheers, guys!
Ha ha ha!

356
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:52,740
[Sighs]

357
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,275
You stole my idea.

358
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:57,378
I was gonna lean here
and wish my problems away.

359
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,880
That obvious, huh?

360
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:01,816
So what are your
problems?

361
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,617
They're not problems
exactly.

362
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,986
More like
weighing options.

363
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,455
What about you?

364
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,823
Brick's tax collectors
giving you trouble?

365
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,792
No. It's Malcolm,
but it's probably

366
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:13,561
the last thing you
want to think about right now.

367
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,162
You'd be surprised.

368
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:18,632
He found out who
murdered his wife.

369
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:20,034
He's fixated
on finding the guy

370
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:21,736
and killing him.

371
00:19:21,738 --> 00:19:23,037
Don't take this
the wrong way,

372
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,538
but isn't killing people
exactly what

373
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,173
Malcolm Merlyn does?

374
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:29,076
Yes, but he also
protects people.

375
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:30,411
During the siege,
he was the only one

376
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,413
who made me
a top priority.

377
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:36,016
He saved my life.

378
00:19:36,018 --> 00:19:37,485
I didn't know.

379
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:41,355
Despite everything
Malcolm was or is,

380
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:44,058
it means something that
he was there

381
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,926
when I needed him
the most.

382
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,795
Even after everything
he's done,

383
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:50,197
he cares about people.

384
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,300
Even all the terrifying
things he's done

385
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:57,071
it was because he thought that
he was helping the Glades.

386
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:01,876
So what's on your mind?

387
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:05,079
Anything I can
help you with?

388
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:09,483
Believe it or not,
you already have.

389
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:12,787
Felicity: How can you even
be arguing for this right now?

390
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:15,022
Because I am actually
paying attention.

391
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:17,858
Brick has the Glades
under siege.

392
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,193
He has the police
running scared,

393
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:21,128
he has us outnumbered
and outgunned,

394
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,898
and I am not saying
let's give Malcolm

395
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,299
a glass case of his own.

396
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:27,868
All I am saying is
let's use him.

397
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,304
The same way that
he wants to use us.

398
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:31,906
To point him like
a loaded gun

399
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:33,908
at Brick.

400
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,042
Exactly.

401
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:38,312
Well, A, I'm not
ok with that,

402
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:40,448
and, B, even if I was,
there has to be

403
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,749
a better way to go
about doing it

404
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,350
than to get in bed
with Malcolm Merlyn.

405
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,820
Roy: There isn't.

406
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,321
Oliver is gone,

407
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:49,757
and there's only so much
the 4 of us can do.

408
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:50,958
I just found this out,

409
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,160
but the night
of the siege,

410
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,262
Malcolm saved
Thea's life.

411
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:57,865
He didn't have
an ulterior motive,

412
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,700
he didn't have
an agenda.

413
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:02,570
He just wanted to protect
what he cared about.

414
00:21:02,572 --> 00:21:05,039
He cares about this city.

415
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,342
He just went about it
in a completely unimaginable way.

416
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:10,277
So just like Thea
did the night of the siege,

417
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,645
we need him.

418
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,581
I can't think
of a world or a universe

419
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,917
or a plain of existence
where Oliver would agree

420
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,118
to any of this.

421
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,753
Well, Oliver isn't
here anymore,

422
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:23,724
so we need to stop
pretending like he is.

423
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:26,660
We need to make decisions
of our own.

424
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,896
I genuinely have
no idea how else

425
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,564
we're supposed
to stop Brick.

426
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,600
And I genuinely don't know
how we live with ourselves

427
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:33,901
if we go about
doing it this way!

428
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:35,803
So how does
this work?

429
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,538
Do we vote?

430
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:53,354
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

431
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,623
It has.

432
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,658
Guilty.

433
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,326
I guess that means
no then.

434
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:01,128
You were expecting
something different, Merlyn?

435
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,465
That you'd have some
measure of common sense? Yes.

we'd throw in with you?

precious city, yes.

Well, that's the thing.

Once we let the ends
justify the means,

that's just
the first step.

I don't know.

483
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:45,426
That is what you will
have to discover,

484
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:50,030
but it will be whatever
you hold most precious.

485
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:11,894
Thea: Going out?

486
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,095
How did you get
in here?

487
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:14,864
I had
a good teacher.

488
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:17,233
If you've come to tell me
what a horrible person I am,

489
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:21,537
I'm afraid you'll have to
wait in a very long line.

490
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,673
Actually, I'm here
to do the opposite.

491
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:26,976
Told Roy about that night at
the train station,

492
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:29,045
how you saved my life.

493
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:30,713
You're my daughter.

494
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:34,083
You protected me,
risked your life for me

495
00:25:34,085 --> 00:25:36,052
just like my mother did.

496
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:40,056
Thea, I know you want to believe
there's more to me than a killer,

497
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:42,158
but the fact is,
there's not.

498
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,464
That man died
with his wife.

499
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:06,082
[Knocking]

500
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,853
What happened
to your face?

501
00:26:10,855 --> 00:26:12,788
Is it all there?

502
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,924
Yeah. 50,000
in hundreds.

503
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,962
You went after
Kendrick Weller.

504
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:21,364
Hey. What--

505
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,232
what did you do?

506
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:27,003
You killed him,
and now you're running?

507
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:31,540
We can--we can
cover this up.

508
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:33,910
I can't stay here.

509
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:36,012
I can't pretend to be
something that I'm not.

510
00:26:36,014 --> 00:26:37,280
Your son needs you,
Malcolm.

511
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:39,148
Not like this.

512
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,950
Killing him did nothing.

513
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:43,119
It didn't bring her back.

514
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:47,189
It didn't cleanse
this anger.

515
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,824
I've heard about a place

516
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:52,395
where anger can be forged
into something else.

517
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:53,829
Daddy?

518
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,134
Tommy, hey.

519
00:26:58,136 --> 00:26:59,302
What are you doing up?

520
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:00,403
Look. Go back to sleep.

521
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:01,971
I miss mommy.

522
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:03,739
Tommy, I have to go away
for a little while.

523
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,207
You can't leave.

524
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,609
You said you'd always
be there.

525
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:09,045
I know, but you have
to be strong now.

526
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,947
I'm going somewhere
where I can learn

527
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,049
how to make sure
that no one

528
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:15,718
will ever hurt us again.

529
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,153
Come here.

530
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:23,159
Laurel: How'd
Merlyn take it?

531
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,861
I think he just felt
inconvenienced.

532
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,296
We made the right
choice, right,

533
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:29,966
by refusing
Merlyn's help?

534
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:31,534
I don't know if we
made the right choice, Laurel,

535
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:34,170
but we definitely
did the right thing.

536
00:27:34,172 --> 00:27:36,138
Roy: And how many people
are gonna die tonight because of it?

537
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,740
We made
a decision, Roy.

538
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:39,542
I know, and I know
that I was outvoted,

539
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:41,677
but that doesn't change the fact
that we're outmanned.

540
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,213
What if it doesn't?
Roy's right.

541
00:27:44,215 --> 00:27:45,982
We need the support
out there,

542
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:48,351
but Merlyn--he's not
the only person in town.

543
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:50,052
Who else is there?

544
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:51,654
The town.

545
00:27:51,656 --> 00:27:53,896
Dispatcher: Emergency services
are currently unavailable.

546
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:57,193
Hi.

547
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:00,062
You've been busy.

548
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,263
Ted, I was--

549
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:02,765
I said you weren't ready.

550
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,266
Guess you weren't
listening,

551
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,668
or are you gonna tell me
that masked blond

552
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,037
that I seen on the news
isn't you?

553
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,572
It's complicated.

554
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:12,375
I couldn't wait.

555
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:15,011
I didn't come here
to argue with you.

556
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:16,612
What did you
come here for?

557
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:25,187
That a Monte Cristo?
Those will kill you a lot quicker

558
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:26,455
than being
in this neighborhood.

559
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:28,424
Abercrombie!

560
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,893
Where the hell
have you been?

561
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:32,128
I saw Sara
last night.

562
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,696
Why didn't you tell
me she was back?

563
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:37,166
We need to talk
about that after.

564
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:38,434
After what?

565
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,443
Felicity: Feels like recess and
we're about to fight the school bully.

566
00:28:47,445 --> 00:28:49,111
Looks quiet.

567
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:51,680
For now.

568
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,716
You ready?

569
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:56,085
It's ok to say
you're scared.

570
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,054
Ok. I'm scared.

571
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,056
Is what we're
doing crazy?

572
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,290
I've learned it's
better to ask that question

573
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:02,892
when I'm not wearing
a mask.

574
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:04,460
There's never been
an armed occupation in history

575
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:06,429
that wasn't
overthrown by force.

576
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:08,464
An all-out assault
on Brick.

577
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,533
That's the only way
to end this.

578
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:12,635
Then let's end this

579
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:14,837
one way

580
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,506
or the other.

581
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:18,874
Let's go.

582
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:34,290
Ha ha ha!

583
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:37,193
My two favorite
trick-or-treaters.

584
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,761
Well, look at that.

585
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:40,996
Didn't anybody tell you
Halloween was 3 months ago?

586
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,698
Daniel Brickwell...

587
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,600
You have failed
this city.

588
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,603
And you seem to have
failed in your maths.

589
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:49,171
Can't you see there's
a lot more of us

590
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:50,606
than there is of you?

591
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:55,010
Sin: Guess again,
Brick-head.

592
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,487
Is this little parade
supposed to mean something?

593
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:06,055
I'll tell you
what it means.

594
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:07,456
It means the population
of the Glades

595
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,358
is gonna plummet
severely.

596
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:12,828
Get them!

597
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:15,331
[Shouting]

598
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,433
[Shouting]

599
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:41,578
And which costume
are you supposed to be?

600
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,313
Wildcat.

601
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:57,461
Is that all you got?

602
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:11,141
I've learned you can
survive a bullet

603
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:13,477
but not one that's
put through you head.

604
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:30,260
You're gonna be fine.

605
00:31:34,499 --> 00:31:36,433
Really?

606
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:38,668
How many more
of you masks are there?

607
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:49,813
It's ok.

608
00:31:54,585 --> 00:31:56,787
It's good thing you fight
better than you lie.

609
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:07,297
Oliver?

610
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:15,872
This is for Rebecca.

611
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:18,775
What?

612
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:21,211
You don't even know
her name, do you?

613
00:32:26,017 --> 00:32:29,286
Is this the weapon
you used to murder my wife?

614
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:32,389
Everybody I dropped
was with that piece.

615
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:35,992
She was a good person,
decent, kind.

616
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:38,895
She ran the clinic
right here in the Glades.

617
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:41,164
Brunette? Ha ha ha!

618
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,466
Yeah. Now I remember.

619
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:46,670
She was my first,
my initiation

620
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:48,705
into the Orchid Bay
Butchers.

621
00:32:48,707 --> 00:32:50,207
Heh heh heh.

622
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,876
You murdered her because
you wanted into a gang?

623
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:54,244
No.

624
00:32:57,682 --> 00:33:00,016
Because she was weak!

625
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:03,520
Because she was crying,
begging me not to kill her,

626
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,188
but you won't get
that from me,

627
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,423
so come on!

628
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,824
Finish it!

629
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:12,229
Oliver: Don't do it!

630
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:15,765
You are too late.

631
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,601
Drop the gun.

632
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,336
No more death.

633
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:20,503
That's easy for you
to say.

634
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:22,072
You just returned
from the grave.

635
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:24,174
Killing him won't
balance the scales.

636
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:27,010
When you have killed
503 people,

637
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:28,245
including your own son,

638
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:30,413
you tend not to worry
about scales,

639
00:33:30,415 --> 00:33:33,149
and don't tell me
it won't stop the pain

640
00:33:33,151 --> 00:33:34,684
and it won't
bring her back

641
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:37,354
because you don't
understand!

642
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:42,259
If I had taken care
of him back then,

643
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,261

sorry for what the city
has had to endure

in my absence,

is lying at my feet.

Maybe you could be
a little more specific.

00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,030
For letting us believe
you were dead

for weeks

783
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:38,801
or for abandoning
every principle you claim to have

for almost a month,

789
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,321
I allowed myself
to fantasize,

790
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:02,859
to dream that maybe,
just maybe

791
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,062
Merlyn was wrong,

792
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,630
that you were alive

793
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,198
and that you would
come back

794
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,499
and that when you did

795
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,068
you would be different,

796
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,136
that almost dying
would give you

797
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,205
a new perspective
on life,

798
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:20,009
that you would just
do things differently.

799
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:23,346
Things between us,
you mean.

800
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,214
Before you left,

801
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,583
the last thing
you said to me...

802
00:41:30,053 --> 00:41:32,188
was that you loved me.

803
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,359
Now you're back,

804
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,027
and the first thing
you tell me

805
