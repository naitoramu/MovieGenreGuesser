1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,320
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,927
Tonight, we rise all as one
and take back this city.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,647
Slade's got 20 guys just like him,
and we have no way to stop him.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,326
Mirakuru, we're gonna
use it to make a cure.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,923
Slade promised me City Hall.
And he delivered.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,327
I understand he made you a promise too.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,165
There is still one person who has to die.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,322
- There's too many of them. We can't fight.
- We're not going to.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,844
Laurel?

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,690
Laurel?

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,806
Laurel!

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,404
You killed me?

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,404
Let me return the favor.

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,130
- You can't kill me.
- You're not invincible.

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,324
Close enough.

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,045
Laurel!

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,244
Oliver.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,240
Are you okay?

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,648
The tunnel collapsed.

20
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,521
I'm trapped.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,324
And it's...

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,403
It's getting really hard to breathe.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,562
You are gonna be okay.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,769
I need you to tell me
everything that you see.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,402
Rocks, and water and...

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,161
And your bow.

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,368
Do you see my quiver?

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,007
No.

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,166
Wait. Yeah. Yes, I have it. I have it.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,170
- How many arrows are in it?
- There's a bunch of them.

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,224
There should be one with
a metallic head that's

32
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,754
bigger than the rest of them.
You see it?

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,604
Why do I need this?

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,686
Because it's an explosive arrow.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,289
And you're gonna fire it.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,280
Do you wanna save me
some time and energy...

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,801
and tell me where I can find
Felicity Smoak?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,130
I have been aching to put a bullet
in her smug little face...

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,286
ever since the day...

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,811
Oh, I really thought the airbags
were gonna go off.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,325
Thanks for the help. Any word from Oliver?

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,806
Dig?

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,243
- What do you think? Hit her again?
- Go, go, go!

44
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,486
Get down! Get down!

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,937
Reports are coming from
all over the city.

46
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,592
Starling General is preparing
for possible casualties.

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,041
- Power is out south of Harbor Boulevard.
- Governor.

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,962
Governor. Sending in the National Guard at
this point will only cause mass hysteria.

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,966
Trust me and my police force.
We have this situation under control.

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,170
- Mr. Mayor.
- DA Spencer.

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,001
What is going on? There are men in masks
tearing through the city.

52
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,520
Yes, I know. And we're doing everything we
can. The S.C.P.D. have already mobilized.

53
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,371
No. The police force,
they're not equipped to handle this.

54
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,763
You don't understand. I have never
seen anything like this before.

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,561
These men in masks, it's...
It's like they're not human.

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,491
Not human?
Kate, do you even hear yourself?

57
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,205
Look, I know you're scared
but you need to pull yourself together.

58
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,449
Starling City needs both of us
thinking clearly right now.

59
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,170
How are you so calm?

60
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,290
Officials are
urging all citizens to stay inside...

61
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,441
and off the streets.

62
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,442
Because I know
we're going to get through this.

63
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,844
And when we do, Starling City will
be stronger and better for it.

64
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,090
Can I count on you?

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,125
I need you with me on this.

66
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,761
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,327
Then let's save the city together.

68
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,968
Are you far enough away from the debris
to avoid the blast?

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,440
I don't know.

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,644
What if I can't shoot that far?

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,804
The bow is a hybrid compound, Laurel.
It's gonna do all the work for you.

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,327
All I need you to do...

73
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,482
is just aim at the middle of the debris.

74
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,086
Take a deep breath.

75
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,288
Center your feet.

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,482
Left hand on the bow.

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,762
Place the arrow on the drawstring.

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,641
Okay, okay, okay.

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,005
All right?

80
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,483
I want you to pull back
on the drawstring...

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,764
and keep your left arm straight.

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,407
Okay?

83
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,927
I'm gonna count to three...

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,366
and then you just let go.

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,928
You can do this.

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,569
One, two...

87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,961
three.

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,604
Nice shot.

89
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,281
- Dig, are you there?
- Go, go!

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,726
Yeah, Oliver, we hear you.

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,769
We're coming up.

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,521
Sara's gone.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,051
Slade must have taken her.

94
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,890
- What's that?
- It's sonar.

95
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,880
I was monitoring the Amazo.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,006
She's moving.

97
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,442
We have one torpedo left, right?

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,002
Can you rig it to fire in a straight line?

99
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,401
I'm discovering capacity to do many things
I never thought I would do.

100
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,560
I need you to get the sub close enough
to the freighter that I can swim over.

101
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,648
Well, then what do you need torpedo for?

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,766
If Sara and I aren't back in an hour...

103
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,083
you're gonna sink the Amazo.

104
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,846
Freeze.

105
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,565
Who are you?

106
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,445
I'm her father.

107
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,091
- Dad.
- Laurel. Oh, thank God.

108
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,481
Are you safe?

109
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,764
I am now. I'm with the Arrow.

110
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,048
Well, that's... That's good.

111
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,164
Now, listen, something tells me
he's got work to do.

112
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,607
- I want you off the streets.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,001
Laurel, please, keep low.
Keep out of sight, alright?

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,004
Dad, I know.
You don't have to worry about me.

115
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,203
- You okay?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,372
You?

117
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,230
Isabel attacked Dig so
I hit her with the van.

118
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,805
Slade's army.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,427
He has at least 50 men
out there, all like him.

120
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:30,665
They're everywhere.

121
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,047
- We need to stop them.
- We might have a way.

122
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,046
S.T.A.R. Labs called. They have a cure.
There's a courier en route.

123
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,321
Where is it?

124
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,611
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Felicity Smoak. Where are you?

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,564
Fourth Street, I think.

126
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,131
I don't know what happened.

127
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Some guy in a hockey mask came out of nowhere
and attacked my car. Please help me.

128
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,177
Stay where you are.

129
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,467
I don't think I could
move if I wanted to.

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,726
I think my leg's broken.

131
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,523
You should go.

132
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,475
Laurel, I'm not leaving you
out here in the middle of this.

133
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,171
The precinct is in the other direction.
I'll be fine.

134
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,404
Laurel, no.

135
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,324
I don't need you right now.

136
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,851
Everyone else does.

137
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,528
So go.

138
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,925
Go save the city.

139
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,007
Hey, are you still there?

140
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,242
Yeah, I'm here. I pinged your phone.

141
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,363
We're on our way.

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,124
Please, hurry.

143
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,362
Find him.

144
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,729
In the last five minutes, S.C.P.D.
has had over

145
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,947
200 reports of masked
men attacking the city.

146
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,883
I should've gone with Laurel.
Made sure she got to the precinct.

147
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,362
She'll be with her father. She'll be fine.
She will, Oliver.

148
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,642
All right, we are 10 meters away
from the freighter.

149
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,608
Still, this is sumashedshiy crazy.

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,922
You cannot even be certain
that Wilson has her.

151
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,650
You're a good man, Anatoli.

152
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,641
If this is goodbye, be safe.

153
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,650
- I will see you soon. You and Sara.
- I meant what I said.

154
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,603
If we're not back in an hour, you sink
the freighter and get yourself home.

155
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,528
I think maybe I prefer Bahamas.

156
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,285
Oliver.

157
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,327
I don't know if we will
see each other again.

158
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,602
But know that you have
made friend for life.

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,164
If there is anything you need,
it does not matter what...

160
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,925
you have only to ask.

161
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,447
Prochnost, my friend.

162
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,364
I also teach you to speak Russian.

163
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,444
Crazy...

164
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,141
Listen up.

165
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,864
We're gonna establish a
perimeter with checkpoints

166
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,253
at Fifth and Adams,
Second and Kingsley.

167
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,408
- We gotta create a safe zone.
- Who the hell are these guys?

168
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,887
These guys are the enemy.

169
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,129
They're attacking innocents at random,
creating mayhem and chaos.

170
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,044
- We need to put them down.
- Lieutenant.

171
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,812
Now!

172
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:33,797
Listen to me, these guys,
have you seen them? Huh?

173
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,505
You see these guys?
They do not go down.

174
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,067
We gotta call in the
National Guard.

175
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,885
That's a call for the mayor.
And he hasn't made that yet.

176
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,610
And he won't.

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,729
Mayor Blood let this happen.

178
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,886
- What?
- Trust me.

179
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,487
Blood's behind this.

180
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,001
Look, even if I believe you,
I don't have that kind of authority.

181
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,528
Well, in an emergency, the chief of
police does, so get him on the line.

182
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,721
The chief's dead.

183
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,650
Well, there's only one more guy
we could call.

184
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,245
You're not gonna like it.

185
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,087
- The vigilante.
- The Arrow.

186
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,406
Lieutenant, I know
he's breaking the law.

187
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,906
But what we're up against
is not about the law.

188
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,089
It's about survival.
We got masks tearing our city to pieces.

189
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,011
And we're gonna need a mask to stop them.

190
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,807
Make the call.

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,248
- Okay, let's do it.
- One more thing.

192
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,969
You know more about what's going on
over everyone else I got.

193
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,691
I need you making decisions
and leading these men.

194
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,849
Detective.

195
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,410
No!

196
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,529
Follow me. I can get you to safety.

197
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,604
Sara.

198
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,490
We lost contact
with our reporter on the streets.

199
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,967
But we have over two dozen
confirmed sightings...

200
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,721
of masked men attacking
numerous municipal locations.

201
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,481
Officials are asking that you stay indoors
while they try to get...

202
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,685
Wait. Stop.

203
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,763
- No, no, no.
- Enough!

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,480
- This isn't part of the plan.
- Sebastian?

205
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,850
I am mayor of Starling City
and I order you to let her go.

206
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,847
No.

207
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,924
I don't take orders from you.

208
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,571
No.

209
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,371
Let's go. Come on!

210
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,964
Any word from Thea?

211
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,328
Is she safe?

212
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,165
She decided to leave Starling
before the attack started.

213
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,402
Just over two miles to the bridge
and the courier.

214
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,644
It's for you.

215
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,885
What is it, detective?

216
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,088
- How can we help?
- We?

217
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,811
Starling City Police force
is standing with you on this one.

218
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,883
We need help containing the soldiers.

219
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,209
We're working something and it may
stop them, but we need more time.

220
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,001
We can do that.
Whatever you're doing, good luck.

221
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,248
For all our sakes.

222
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,603
This is the street that
feeds into the bridge.

223
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,045
Floor it.

224
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,884
Hold on!

225
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,644
Dig?

226
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,165
- Diggle?
- Yeah, yeah.

227
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,802
- Ah. Yeah.
- Is she breathing?

228
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,603
Felicity? Yeah, yeah.

229
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,888
- We have to get out of here.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

230
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,204
Thea.

231
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,845
I'm not here to hurt you.

232
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,645
Why should I believe you?

233
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,963
You're a murderer.

234
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,166
A terrorist and psychopath.

235
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,681
I don't expect you to understand
what I've done.

236
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,565
Not now.

237
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,724
Not without more time to explain.

238
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,450
How are you even alive?

239
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,689
- Why are you here?
- I heard what happened to your mother.

240
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,161
I needed to make sure you were all right.

241
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,924
I needed to see my daughter.

242
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,202
I am not your daughter.

243
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,408
You're nothing to me.

244
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,848
And I want nothing from you.
Do you understand?

245
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,762
Yes. But right now, you need my help.

246
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,245
My protection. You have no idea,
Thea, how dangerous it is out there.

247
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,724
The city is falling.
At least let me take you to safety.

248
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,607
They say Nero sang...

249
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,769
as he watched Rome burn.

250
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,685
Now I understand why.

251
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,964
If only Shado were here to witness this.

252
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,087
- Who's Shado?
- What the hell is going on?

253
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,808
One of your juiced-up jackboots
just killed my entire office staff...

254
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,645
and snapped the
district-attorney's neck.

255
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,803
- And?
- "And"?

256
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,327
And I never agreed to this.

257
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,924
- You were supposed to call off your dogs.
- That was your plan, Mr. Blood, not mine.

258
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,603
We had a deal.

259
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,847
And do you feel
that I've not lived up to my end of it?

260
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,162
Those are innocent people.

261
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,528
Dying out there.

262
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,322
- You do not need to kill them.
- Yes, I do!

263
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,563
I made a promise to someone once,
and I will uphold it.

264
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,207
So this really is all about you
just trying to hurt Oliver Queen.

265
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,763
I vowed to him
that I would take away everything...

266
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,762
and everyone he loves.

267
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,170
- And he loves this city.
- But this city...

268
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,283
it's mine too.

269
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,807
Not anymore.

270
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,808
As of tomorrow night,
it'll be nothing but rubble, ash and death.

271
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,209
A land only good for one thing.

272
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,211
Graves.

273
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,410
Sara.

274
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,287
Where have you been?

275
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,401
It doesn't matter.

276
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,090
Why did you come back?

277
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,770
I don't know.
There isn't anything here for me.

278
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,208
Your family's here.

279
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,880
You don't know, Laurel, about me.

280
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,771
About who I am and who I've become.

281
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,203
I know you're a hero.

282
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,285
I'm not a hero, Laurel.

283
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,127
I am the furthest thing from it.

284
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,285
I am Ta-er Al-Sahfer. That was my new name.

285
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,807
Because the woman that I was...

286
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,043
the girl that I was...

287
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,641
was gone.

288
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,489
I'm not gonna pretend that
I've been through anything that you have.

289
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,964
One thing that I've learned in the
past year is that these things...

290
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,287
they don't break us.

291
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,645
They make us who we are.

292
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,722
And what I am...

293
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,568
is irredeemable.

294
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,843
What was that word you said before?

295
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,128
Ta-er Al-Sahfer.

296
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,365
What does that mean?

297
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,161
It means "the Canary."

298
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,160
If you're so far gone...

299
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,365
and so irredeemable...

300
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,843
then why would they know you
by such a beautiful name?

301
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,362
Ollie. Ollie. Ollie. Thank God.
Ollie. Ollie. Ollie.

302
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,806
- Come with me.
- Okay.

303
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,883
All right. Stay with me.

304
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,328
The sub is right alongside the freighter.
You just need to swim. Okay?

305
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,404
Okay. What are you doing?

306
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,211
- I can't leave yet.
- Ollie, come on.

307
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,203
- The cure.
- No.

308
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,328
I can't... I can't leave Slade behind.

309
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,086
I'm not just gonna...
Not just gonna write him off.

310
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,080
We injected him with the Mirakuru,
but it was me, all right?

311
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,044
I chose you over Shado.

312
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,010
Ollie, I just wanna go home.

313
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,722
I just wanna see my family, Ollie.
Please, I don't wanna die. Please, Ollie.

314
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,002
Come on, please.

315
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,891
I need to do this. I
need to save my friend.

316
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,082
I need to at least try.

317
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,725
Get to the sub.

318
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,649
Get safe.

319
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,927
Not without you.

320
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,043
- Sara.
- Come on.

321
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,690
It's Dad.

322
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,409
- Hello?
- Laurel, baby, where are you?

323
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,961
55th and Alfred. There
are a few roadblocks.

324
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,090
- But you're okay?
- Yeah. Sara's with me.

325
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,121
Uh, right. Okay. Listen. Stay there.
Both of you. I'm on my way.

326
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,965
- I can walk now.
- Where is he?

327
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,249
His cell-phone GPS says
he should be within a 500-foot radius.

328
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,005
I'll call him.

329
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,927
- Hey. Where are you?
- We're here. Where are you?

330
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,489
- Honk your horn.
- Cool. Hold on.

331
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,006
Wait, I can see your feet.

332
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,650
You're right outside my car.

333
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,765
That's not us.

334
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,685
Oh, no.

335
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,170
It's gone.

336
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,811
The situation has intensified
as officials struggle to contain...

337
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,566
this historic assault gripping our city.

338
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,611
Mr. Wilson. Is this
what you're looking for?

339
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,201
Yes, it is.

340
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,964
We just got off the phone
with Cisco at S.T.A.R. Labs.

341
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,963
The cure they sent us was all they had.

342
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,920
They used all the Mirakuru
that we gave them.

343
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,650
So they can't make more.

344
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,481
We can't stop Slade's men without the cure.

345
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,321
- We'll find another way.
- There is no other way.

346
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,324
Foundry's been compromised.
We need to get Roy out of there.

347
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,250
I'm on it.

348
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,926
I didn't know, Felicity.

349
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,245
Five years ago, I was a completely
different person, and I had...

350
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,002
no idea that something
like this was even...

351
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,245
possible. I couldn't have imagined.

352
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,207
When you and Diggle
brought me back to Starling City...

353
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,330
I made a vow to myself
that I would never let anything...

354
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,768
like the Undertaking happen again.

355
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,641
- What's happening now is not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

356
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,770
I have failed this city.

357
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,169
Yao Fei.

358
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,727
Shado. Tommy. My father. My mother.

359
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,286
All that I have ever wanted to do
is honor those people.

360
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,686
You honor the dead by fighting.

361
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,601
And you are not done fighting.

362
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,808
Malcolm Merlyn. The Count.

363
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,686
The Clock King. The Triad.
Everyone who has tried to hurt this city...

364
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,968
you stopped them.

365
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,603
And you will stop Slade.

366
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,970
- I don't know how.
- Neither do I.

367
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,322
But I do know two things.

368
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,651
You are not alone.

369
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,650
And I believe in you.

370
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,164
Where's Dad? He should be here by now.

371
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,163
We should get to a better vantage point.

372
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,125
Please, anybody!

373
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,011
- Please help!
- Stay here.

374
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,889
No!

375
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,170
Someone help!

376
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,771
Please help!

377
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,808
Someone help! Please!

378
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,167
Are you okay?

379
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,130
My daughter is still inside.
I couldn't get to her.

380
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,009
- Aah!
- Don't. It's too dangerous.

381
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,645
- Laurel.
- Dad.

382
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,922
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

383
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,889
I'm okay.

384
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,728
Dad... Watch out Dad. Dad.

385
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,009
Delta Charlie 52 to Central. Copy.

386
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,885
Delta Charlie 52 to Central. Copy.

387
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,884
Delta Charlie 52 to Central.
Please copy me now.

388
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,568
- Delta Charlie 52 to Central...
- Dad. Dad.

389
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,810
It's okay.

390
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,807
She's fine.

391
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,251
Right here. Here you go, your daughter.

392
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,921
Who was that?

393
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,447
That's the Canary.

394
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,329
Thea, please. Come with me.

395
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,841
I don't want anything to do with you.

396
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,366
I don't even see you.

397
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,209
Stay behind me.

398
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,721
You're out of arrows.

399
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,882
You're not.

400
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,040
Oliver.

401
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,729
This is your phone.

402
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,720
- What do you want?
- The same thing you do, Oliver.

403
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,924
- To save this city before it's too late.
- It's already too late.

404
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,811
You were right about Slade Wilson.

405
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,002
I should have listened to you.

406
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,283
- But I'm here now and I can help you.
- Why should I trust you?

407
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,809
Because, Oliver, I have the Mirakuru cure.

408
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,683
How much venom do we have
to keep him under?

409
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,206
Two hours, maybe.

410
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,645
Let's go.

411
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,531
Hey.

412
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,207
I need you to stay with Roy.

413
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,204
Okay.

414
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,328
Oliver. John.

415
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,006
Maybe this is obvious.
But are we sure this isn't a trap?

416
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,644
- No.
- I'm just saying...

417
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,202
if you guys don't come back alive,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

418
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,650
As a young boy,
I was plagued by nightmares.

419
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,764
Every night, I'd wake up in a cold sweat
frightened and alone.

420
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,325
It was my father's face that haunted me.

421
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,250
And this is how I saw him.

422
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,604
The embodiment of desperation and despair.

423
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,209
I made this mask to conquer my fears.

424
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,520
And to remind myself why I fight...

425
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,245
every day...

426
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,842
to give this city's
most desperate a chance.

427
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,125
All I've ever wanted to do
was help people, Oliver.

428
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,601
Help me believe.

429
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,289
- Where's the cure?
- Slade Wilson will not rest...

430
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,200
until he honors the promise
that he made you.

431
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,603
I won't be so easy to kill
once we level the playing field.

432
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,450
He's not interested in killing you.

433
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,724
Not until he's taken away everything
and everyone you love.

434
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,766
After he murdered my mother...

435
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,886
he said one more person had to die.

436
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,804
Whoever you love the most.

437
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,402
I hope you can beat him with this.

438
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,645
For all our sakes.

439
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,037
And when this is
over, I promise you,

440
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:53,348
I will do everything in my power
to rebuild Starling City.

441
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,927
And I won't just make it what it was.
I will make it better.

442
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,647
- Like I always planned.
- You really think...

443
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,367
after everything that's happened...

444
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,690
after what you've done...

445
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,763
that they'll still let you be mayor?

446
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,524
Why not?

447
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,369
No one knows that I've done anything
except try to save this city.

448
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,528
And if you tell anyone about my mask,
I will tell them about yours.

449
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,045
Do what you have to, Sebastian.

450
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,451
All right, sweetheart. I
gotta get back to it.

451
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,649
Hey. You guys okay?

452
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,960
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

453
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,201
You won't believe it.

454
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,842
A blond in a mask ran out of a burning
building with a kid in her arms.

455
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,368
It was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
That woman's a hero.

456
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,484
You gave it to him, didn't you?

457
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,209
I did what I felt was necessary.

458
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,481
Don't worry. I'll tell Slade.

459
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,090
Does he still have the cure?

460
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,971
No.

461
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,090
- Slade, you betrayed...
- Goodbye, Mr. Blood.

462
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,927
I loved this city.

463
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,047
Why does every secret formula
have to be color?

464
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,407
What ever happened
to good old-fashioned clear?

465
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,724
Alright, so if we inject one
of Slade's soldiers with this...

466
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:03,912
According to S.T.A.R. Labs...

467
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,362
- it will counteract the effects.
- Assuming they got the recipe right.

468
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,200
- We need to test it.
- We can't.

469
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,807
- Treat Roy like some kind of lab rat?
- Felicity.

470
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,122
What if it doesn't work?
What if it kills him?

471
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,609
- What if he wakes up and kills us?
- We need to know. One way or the other.

472
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,923
- Go lock the other door.
- Okay.

473
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,849
So where does Ivo keep his safe?

474
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,681
It's, uh, by his books.

475
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,284
Oliver.

476
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,009
What are you looking for, kid?

477
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,850
This?

478
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,523
Detective Lance.

479
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,324
Yeah.

480
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,209
What's going on?

481
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,081
What is it?

482
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,806
We are watching
live footage of an Army convoy...

483
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,328
arriving on the outskirts of the city
to restore order.

484
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,006
Looks like the cavalry's here. Finally.

485
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,846
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

486
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,801
They're taking up positions
at the bridges and tunnels.

487
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,403
Those are the only ways into the city.
- Yeah. And the only ways out.

488
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,167
A buddy of mine in military intelligence
once told me the Army isn't always the Army.

489
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,802
But it's clearly the military.
The trucks. The uniforms.

490
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,566
Except the nearest Army base is at Monument
point, which is 300 miles from here.

491
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,411
So how could they mobilize
to Starling City so fast?

492
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,925
Okay. So if that isn't the Army,
who the hell are they?

493
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,483
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,324
I can't.

495
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,047
It's Lance.

496
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,369
- Detective.
- You near him?

497
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,324
- Yes.
- You near a TV?

498
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,329
- Yes.
- Turn it on.

499
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,210
- How did you get this number?
- Amanda. What are you doing?

500
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,925
Not sure what you mean, Oliver.

501
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,687
Amanda, the troops taking up position
at the city's exits, they're not Army.

502
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,287
They're A.R.G.U.S. Those are your men.
So you tell me what you're up to.

503
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,607
Amanda.

504
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,686
Slade's followers
are a clear-and-present danger.

505
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,925
I cannot allow them to escape the city.
They need to be contained.

506
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,531
By any means necessary.

507
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,007
You can't.

508
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,841
There's a drone en route carrying
six GBU-43/B bombs.

509
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,162
Enough firepower to level the city.

510
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,807
There are over half a million people
in this city.

511
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,840
Five hundred, seventy-six thousand.
None of whom deserve to die.

512
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,367
But I have to think about the people
in every city.

513
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,730
You once told me that Mirakuru
made a man virtually unstoppable.

514
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,930
What could happen to this country,
this world...

515
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,367
if I don't end this here and now?

516
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,369
Listen to me.

517
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,483
I have the cure.
I can stop Slade and his men.

518
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,644
I can't take the chance
you'll fail, Oliver.

519
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,364
Amanda, I just need more time.

520
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,010
I'm sorry.

521
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,811
You have until dawn...

522
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,725
then Starling City is a crater.

523
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,565
If you're gonna use that,
you'll wanna click the safety off.

524
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,889
I'll shoot you. I will.

525
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,761
I can see it in your eyes.

526
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,601
My eyes.

527
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,128
They're just like mine.

528
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,126
Both of them filled with pain and anger...

529
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,284
because those we loved
were ripped from us.

530
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,923
I lost my name, my wife.

531
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,807
- Tommy.
- Shut up.

532
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,724
You're all I have left in this world.

533
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,726
And you've lost everything too, Thea.

534
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,000
But you still have a father.

535
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,761
You still have...
