1
00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:02,235
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,265
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,132
I have returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:08,235
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:09,769
But my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:12,005
I had to become
someone else.

7
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:14,507
I had to become
something else.

8
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,978
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,113
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:22,682
I want to know what I'm doing here.
Where's Waller?

11
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:26,019
Your job is to infiltrate
the area, and report back.

12
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:30,957
The media
has been calling them a Ghost.

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,392
They're like nothing
we'd ever seen before.

14
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:33,493
We need the Arrow.

15
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:34,794
I'm the one
who controls--

16
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,062
now what do you
people call them?

17
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,297
The Ghosts?

18
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:37,966
I'm Damian Darhk.

19
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,799
Mass murder?

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,367
Killing innocents?
I didn't sign up for this.

21
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,035
You signed up
to follow my instructions.

22
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:43,336
And if I don't
help you?

23
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:44,704
You don't
have a choice.

24
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:46,706
Six months ago,
the Arrow died,

25
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,275
but what he stood for didn't.

26
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:50,210
I am declaring
my intention

27
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:53,013
to fight for this city.

28
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,717
I want a code name.

29
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,319
What?!

30
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:34,187
Everyone's got a code name;
You even got a new one.

31
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,655
I want a code name.

32
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:37,590
Find the bomb,
and then we'll talk.

33
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:39,859
I'm scanning
frequency signatures.

34
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,628
I just know we're not
going to talk about it.

35
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,929
John, you've got a runner.

36
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,265
I'm on it.

37
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:49,669
Got it. The Ghost frequency of choice
is on the ground level.

38
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,271
Ten'll get you twenty
it's the bomb.

39
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:53,106
I don't mean that
it's the bomb,

40
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:55,208
like it's good,
like it's da bomb!

41
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,409
I mean like
it's the explosives.

42
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:58,778
Got it. Ground floor.

43
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,256
You better move it.
The signal strength I'm reading,

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,758
they can blow the treatment plant
from Central City.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,701
It's done. Get Diggle
down here to handle the dismantling.

46
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,536
You know, it seems like
he could use a code name, too.

47
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,032
Just get him
down here.

48
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:29,033

50
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,795
Well, saving
the city's water supply,

51
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:38,000
that's an honest
night's--morning's work.

52
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,600
Hmm.

53
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:41,302
Yeah, but no matter what
we do to these ghosts,

54
00:02:41,304 --> 00:02:42,603
they keep coming.

55
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,105
We still did
a good job tonight.

56
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:45,473
Yeah, not good enough.

57
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,708
Can I talk to you
for a second?

58
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:50,845
Kind of felt like you were out there
for blood tonight.

59
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:53,447
Look, you haven't been dealing with
these ghosts as long as we have.

60
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:55,650
If I go easy on them,
things are going

61
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,752
to end bad really fast.
I'm worried

62
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,921
that if you keep going the way
that you're going,

63
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:02,123
you're going to put one of them
down permanently.

64
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,593
I know where
the line is, ok?

65
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:08,296
And look, it's almost 9:00.
Mrs. Danforth and Madison

66
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,164
are going to be
at our house in like an hour,

67
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,633
so I have time
for one of your lectures

68
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:15,803
or a shower.
I pick shower.

69
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,974
Is everything ok?

70
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,909
You look nice.

71
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,512
It's my first day back
at Palmer Tech.

72
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:27,181
I get to be bossy today,
because I am the boss

73
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:29,150
of a multi-billion
dollar corporation.

74
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,052
I know I should be nervous,
I know, but I'm not.

75
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:32,820
I'm actually really excited.

76
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,655
You should be
excited.

77
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,023
That's why
I got you the...

78
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,525
first day
as a boss fern.

79
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,893
Aww.

80
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,861
And...

81
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:43,698
Packed your lunch.

82
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,633
Who are you?

83
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,169
Who are you?

84
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:49,337
Ahh!

85
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,838
Answer me!

86
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,910
All right.

87
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,181
What?!

88
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:41,689
Come on.

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,227
Madison,
how's school?

90
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,662
It's good.
I graduate in May

91
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,296
with a degree
in ancient philosophy.

92
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,898
Ancient philosophy?

93
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
Um, what happened
to your dream

94
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:54,435
of being J.T.'s
back-up dancer?

95
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:55,770
Oh, that's still
plan B, obviously.

96
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,873
It is so lovely
to see you two.

97
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,241
Really,
it's been far too long.

98
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:01,909
Well, Thea and I were
glad you got in touch.

99
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:05,079
Yeah, we were,
um, a little surprised, though.

100
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:07,882
Well, I admit that reconnecting with
the son and daughter

101
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:09,650
of one of my
dearest friends

102
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:12,953
is not...the only reason that I
wanted to see you.

103
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,422
And here comes the crazy.

104
00:05:14,424 --> 00:05:16,691
Last week,
like the rest of the city,

105
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:17,901
I saw the Green
Arrow's broadcast.

106
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,291
And it hit me--

107
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:21,532
if that man could take
up the Arrow's mantle,

108
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,164
I could take up
your mother's.

109
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,566
Um, how?

110
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,334
By running
for mayor.

111
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,904
See, I told you--crazy.

112
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:32,073
No one's opposing
me, obviously,

113
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,808
but there will
still need to be an election.

114
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,409
There's a very good reason
that no one else is running.

115
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,445
The last three mayors
have been killed.

116
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:40,114
To say nothing of the city's
leadership last week.

117
00:05:40,116 --> 00:05:42,183
Which is exactly why we need a mayor
more than ever.

118
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:44,452
I want
to step forward.

119
00:05:44,454 --> 00:05:46,153
And I'm asking
for your support.

120
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
Wow.

121
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,635
You guys look bigger
than you did

122
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:04,105
when you were
on my computer screen.

123
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:07,174
Perhaps we should begin
with this quarter's financials.

124
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:10,211
Thank you. Uh...

125
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:11,846
Ok.

126
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,814
I know I don't have
a business degree,

127
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,783
or an accounting
degree or an MBA,

128
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,686
but this looks
very, very bad.

129
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:21,989
These are hard times
for everyone in Star City.

130
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:24,458
This company's not immune.
Fortunately, Mr. Holt

131
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,127
had devised us a way out.

132
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,194
Oh, goody.

133
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:29,663
Um, hello.

134
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:32,867
I'm actually not a member
of the board.

135
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:35,336
I work in the design
innovations department.

136
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:37,538
Tell Miss Smoak
about your algorithm.

137
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,607
It's, uh, pretty
simple, actually.

138
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,208
I use specialized A.I.
to determine

139
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,777
maximum profits,
which can be derived

140
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,846
with a minimum amount
of workforce deduction.

141
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:49,383
Sorry. I probably
could have explained that better.

142
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,318
No, I got the jist.
You came up with a list

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,521
of people that
you'd like me to fire.

144
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,790
Workforce reduction has
a nicer sound to it.

145
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,626
It just kind of rolls
off the tongue. Ahem.

146
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,161
Well, the only thing
we'll be reducing

147
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,062
is all of your bonuses
to start.

148
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:03,531
We've already
been down that road

149
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,733
and exhausted all other
avenues, Miss Smoak.

150
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,134
I didn't come back
to this company

151
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,303
to put the people
who work here out of work.

152
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,173
I came here to protect
Ray Palmer's legacy.

153
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,375
And if we do not
dramatically reduce our costs

154
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:18,746
or increase our profits, there won't be
a legacy to protect.

155
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,184
Am I the only one that has
a bad feeling about this?

156
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:25,019
I mean, signing up
to be mayor of this town

157
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,854
is like asking to be
part of "the Titanic."

158
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,889
Well, you heard me
try to talk her out of running.

159
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,158
I'm pretty sure
that got covered up

160
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,360
by telling her we'd be
at her big announcement.

161
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,699
Thank you.

162
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:42,203
Thank you all so much.

163
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:43,637
For the past six months,

164
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,973
the mayor's office
at city hall has stood vacant,

165
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,710
waiting for someone to step forward
on behalf of Star City.

166
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,612
And today, I am here
with all of you

167
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:55,082
to tell you that
I am stepping forward.

168
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,420
Two years ago,

169
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,590
I lost my good friend
Moira Queen,

170
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:05,392
who was also
a candidate for mayor.

171
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,761
And I remain inspired
by her kind heart,

172
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:09,997
and her selfless
devotion to this city.

173
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:18,030
Shots came from up there.

174
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,347
No, no, you protect
Jessica, I've got this.

175
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:32,119
The shots are just
a distraction!

176
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,321
There's no ghosts up here!

177
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:39,126
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait--
you're not in her detail.

178
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,405
Get back to the atrium!
Oliver, how...

179
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,841
Um, self-defense
classes.

180
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:40,816
She announcers
her candidacy,

181
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,317
and two seconds later,
someone's trying to kill her?

182
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:44,186
That must be a record,
even for our city.

183
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:45,787
She's not dropping out of the race,
so this isn't over.

184
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,689
My father has a protective
detail on her.

185
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,224
Yeah, but even with protection
at the announcement,

186
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,126
she didn't seem
to be too safe.

187
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:53,362
Is it just me, or is the shooting
of a potential city leader

188
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:54,730
feeling a little ghosty?

189
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,565
This guy wasn't wearing
a mask, so...

190
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,767
There was something else
different about him.

191
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,737
He left behind evidence.

192
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,240
Fingerprints.

193
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:06,708
How'd you get the owner
to part with his windshield?

194
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,577
I bought his truck.
It's one of the benefits

195
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,112
of your girlfriend
inheriting

196
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:11,913
a multi-billion dollar
conglomerate.

197
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,082
We have money now.

198
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:16,752
I don't exactly think
that was money well spent.

199
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,254
I don't think these prints
are going to do us any good.

200
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:23,025
What the hell?
I am not an expert,

201
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:25,093
but I think our new friend may have
cut off his fingertips

202
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,195
and played a little bit
of mix and match.

203
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:28,423
I'll keep digging;

204
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,233
Maybe this is an M.O.,
that'll tell us something.

205
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:32,367
In the meantime,
we backstop the SCPD.

206
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:33,096
Thea was right--

207
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,604
Jessica needs more
than the police can offer.

208
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:37,439
She's in protective custody,
and I'm pretty sure my father

209
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:40,075
wouldn't be in favor of us
staking out his precinct.

210
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:40,999
I'll talk to him.

211
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:41,910
Oh, yeah.

212
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,146
That'll definitely
go over well.

213
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:46,148
Mrs. Danforth is under
our protection 24/7

214
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,351
until this nut bar
is in cuffs.

215
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,787
Do you have a minute?

216
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:56,892
Caught your TV debut.

217
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,727
Guess you decided
to stick around.

218
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,762
It's going to be
different this time.

219
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,931
Yeah, yeah, sure, well, 'cause you
got a new name now,

220
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,266
right, with a color.

221
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,601
Green Arrow.

222
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,403
It's catchy.

223
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:10,772
Jessica Danforth
is a friend.

224
00:11:10,774 --> 00:11:12,607
We would like to
help keep her safe.

225
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,109
With everything
the city's facing,

226
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,277
I thought you could
use all the help you could get.

227
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,812
You've been gone.

228
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:18,780
You don't know
what this city's facing.

229
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:20,715
And I'm not saying
it doesn't need saving,

230
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:24,352
but a guy hiding behind a mask
isn't going to get it done.

231
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:27,155
What this city needs
is someone willing

232
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:28,824
to stand up
in the light of day,

233
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,725
not a guy lurking around
in the shadows.

234
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:34,196
You say you're going
to be different this time, huh?

235
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,932
How?

236
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:38,293
Whoa.

237
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,669
You're late.

238
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:50,438
I know. Sorry, I was looking
at the numbers again, and--

239
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,374
Oh, you mean
the numbers of people

240
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:54,843
that your magic downsizing algorithm
is making us fire today.

241
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:57,212
Downsizing? You think I--
you think I--

242
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:58,747
Let's get
one thing straight.

243
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,248
The only person who
is allowed to talk

244
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,050
in sentence fragments
around here is me.

245
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:06,254
I developed my algorithm
to create a value matrix.

246
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:09,057
To argue for company-wide
pay increases, raises.

247
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,294
Mr. Dennis turned it around and
had me use it to figure out who to fire.

248
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:14,529
So this wasn't
your idea?

249
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,398
I was trying to get
people to get paid more,

250
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,300
not paid nothing.

251
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,271
Hi, I'm Carla Groves.

252
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,006
My supervisor asked me
to come see you.

253
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:27,209
Hi. Yes. Um...

254
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,978
I don't know quite
how to say this--

255
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,646
I'm fired.

256
00:13:31,648 --> 00:13:34,216
But clearly you do.

257
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:36,818
As rumors go, downsizing
ones tend to go viral.

258
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,853
I am very sorry.

259
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:41,223
I didn't come back here to put
people out of work.

260
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,925
But I am hoping
that by losing a few jobs,

261
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:45,627
I can save
many, many more.

262
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,031
That looks like
a little more than a few.

263
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:52,434
Yes.

264
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,736
The company is
going through a difficult time.

265
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,305
I know. And when we heard
you were coming back,

266
00:13:57,307 --> 00:14:01,009
we thought things were
going to get a lot better.

267
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,678
Guess we were wrong.

268
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:11,820
I'm still hungry.

269
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,122
Is it wrong
that I'm still hungry?

270
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:15,624
John?

271
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:19,327
Shift changes
in 10 minutes.

272
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:22,497
You know, for the past week,
you've been pretty intense.

273
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,633
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

274
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:27,002
And don't tell me
it's because Oliver's back.

275
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:28,803
Well, I'm not happy
Oliver's back.

276
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:31,339
Yeah, you weren't exactly
subtle about that.

277
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:34,009
Just
let it go, Laurel.

278
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:37,412
No. Because we don't
keep secrets, remember?

279
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:40,382
John.

280
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:43,018
What's going on?

281
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,355
Remember last week, when Oliver was
telling us about Darhk?

282
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:49,791
He said he had
a hive of followers.

283
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:54,029
An organization called H.I.V.E.
killed my brother.

284
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,531
I didn't know.

285
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,368
Do you think
it's some kind of coincidence?

286
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,172
No. I've been looking
into this organization for two years now.

287
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:07,108
All dead ends.
But what I did manage

288
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,744
to dig up tracks with what we know
about Darhk's ghosts.

289
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:12,781
They're H.I.V.E.

290
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:15,550
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

291
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,685
No.

292
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:18,520
You've been investigating this

293
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,522
for two years
and you haven't told them?

294
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:23,458
It's a family
thing, Laurel.

295
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,327
I would think you, of all people,
would understand

296
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,429
keeping secrets when it comes to
the death of a sibling.

297
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,030
I do.

298
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,700
And because I do,
I can tell you,

299
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:33,535
carrying a burden
like that,

300
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:35,570
it never ends
in any way but bad.

301
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:46,481
That was
quite the show.

302
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:49,851
False machine gun,
impersonating a bodyguard;

303
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,453
you have the flair
for the dramatic, Mr. Machin.

304
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:54,689
I will give you that.

305
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,392
Too bad it was
all for nothing.

306
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:00,595
Half of your fee has been wired
into your account.

307
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,664
This isn't about money for me.

308
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,898
Oh, I know.

309
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,667
You came to me
with promises.

310
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,635
You wanted to impress myself
to my organization,

311
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,504
and you failed.

312
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:12,240
I'm not done yet!

313
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,976
Just...

314
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:17,212
Give me more time.

315
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:19,481
I will make sure
that Jessica Danforth

316
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:22,517
does not run for mayor.

317
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,653
Very well.

318
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:29,124
However,
a word of caution.

319
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:31,426
I'm not sure how Rick Pinzolo
runs his operation,

320
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:33,862
but H.I.V.E. does not believe
in third chances.

321
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:36,131
Good night.

322
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,508
I spoke to Diggle.

323
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,143
No movement
at the precinct.

324
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,778
That's all right.

325
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,212
I may have
some movement here.

326
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,781
I noticed something tacky

327
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:54,190
on the palm print our guy
left on the windshield.

328
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:55,772
Tacky?

329
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,219
Like a residue.

330
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,053
What kind?

331
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:01,289
Cellulose.

332
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,825
Ohh, except this
formulation is special.

333
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,602
The molecular structure's
been patented.

334
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:06,603
By who?

335
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,019
Palmer Technologies.

336
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:09,456
A subsidiary, actually.

337
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,833
Palmer Paper. I had
to shut down the mill

338
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,901
a couple months ago
as a cost cutting measure.

339
00:17:12,903 --> 00:17:15,603
Where's the paper mill?

340
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:25,280
Hey.

341
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:28,716
Stay sharp. He has some sort of
electricity weapon.

342
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:35,323
The man in the photo,
you seen 'em?

343
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:38,526
I don't see much--
I like my sleep.

344
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:42,030
But that guy,
he sees a lot.

345
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:45,834
He deals out of here,
does a lot of business.

346
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,937
Hey! We need to ask you
a few questions.

347
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:50,338
Step off, freak.

348
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,875
Have you seen this guy
here? I want a name.

349
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:56,110
You masks, you think
you're in charge.

350
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:58,213
Yeah, well, maybe you were,
but not anymore.

351
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,848
There are new masks
in charge--

352
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,915
Speedy!

353
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:03,451
Have you seen
this guy here?

354
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:05,220
Do you still want
to use your arm?!

355
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:06,488
Let him go.

356
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,723
Still think
you're in charge?

357
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:11,426
Hey! Get out of here!

358
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,223
I got an ID
on our Mr. Creepy.

359
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:30,293
I thought his fingerprints
were all screwed up.

360
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,762
Mixed up, but I have an obsession
with Jigsaw puzzles.

361
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:34,965
Lonnie Machin.
Part time mob enforcer,

362
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,299
full time crazy pants.

363
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,435
Done jobs for the Bertinellis,
the Triad,

364
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,170
and Rick Pinzolo.

365
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:42,138
We're going
to talk about this.

366
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,773
We're going to have
the conversation

367
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,275
about what
just happened.

368
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,371
What just happened
was that guy had information

369
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,698
and I was trying
to get it out of him.

370
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:48,358
You broke his arm.

371
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:49,847
He was stalling!

372
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,047
He was scared.
Come here.

373
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,115
What are you doing?!

374
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,817
I need to show you
something.

375
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,151
At the water plant, you took
down a ghost.

376
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:56,319
You could have done it
with a very simple

377
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,122
disarmament technique,
like this--

378
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:03,660
But Thea, that's
not what you did.

379
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,665
You went overboard

380
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,500
with a series
of techniques

381
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:14,070
designed to do one
thing--cripple!

382
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:17,674
Oliver...

383
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:28,218
That's enough!
Come on!

384
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,020
That's enough!
Come on!

385
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:33,223
Demonstration's over.

386
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:38,261
Fine, sorry. Sorry.

387
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:41,031
Sorry.

388
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:45,268
After Ra's hurt you--

389
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:50,173
Malcolm warned me
not to take you to Nanda Parbat.

390
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:54,677
He said that when
people go in the pit,

391
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,646
they don't
come out the same.

392
00:19:56,648 --> 00:20:00,016
And I didn't tell you, because
I didn't want to worry about you.

393
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,886
You seemed normal, Thea,
and I swear to God,

394
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:04,721
I thought everything
was going to be fine.

395
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:09,025
And then you left.

396
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:10,560
So you know what?

397
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:13,063
It doesn't really qualify you
to judge me,

398
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:15,832
or anyone else!

399
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,670
What's going on?

400
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:23,907
What happened
to Thea in Nanda Parbat?

401
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:27,544
I--I did what
I had to do--

402
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:29,679
save my sister.

403
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:31,014
Oliver, that was
six months ago.

404
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,049
Why is the pit only
affecting her now?

405
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:37,187
It's probably been
showing up over time, subtly.

406
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:40,190
What do you want
to do about it?

407
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:46,875
You! Hey!
Stand down.

408
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:47,900
I guess you know
what happened to Kenny.

409
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:48,881
Don't move, don't move!

410
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:49,901
Just shut up.

411
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,236
It's a mine field,
all right?

412
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:53,803
That's what
killed your friend.

413
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,472
And who the hell
are you?

414
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:58,374
My name is Oliver Queen.

415
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:01,911
Three years ago, the yacht that
I was on went down in a storm

416
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:05,181
and I washed up here.
I survived.

417
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:07,984
Let's take him to Reiter.
He'll know what to do with him.

418
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,322
Wow, you look like someone

419
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:17,128
who has to fire a whole
mess of people today.

420
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,190
What? Oh, no.

421
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:23,295
I mean, yes,
but this isn't about this.

422
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,463
Not that firing
a dozen people

423
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:26,965
is going to do much
for my mood.

424
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,801
Actually, it's two dozen.
What?!

425
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:33,171
The pages are double-sided.

426
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:35,340
There has to be
another way.

427
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,242
This many intelligent
people in the company,

428
00:21:37,244 --> 00:21:38,843
there has to be
someone who...

429
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:40,979
Miss Smoak,
are you all right?

430
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:43,048
Absolutely.

431
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,783
Uh...

432
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:47,946
It's ok.

433
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,288
What is?

434
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,222
I'm on the list,
aren't I?

435
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:53,458
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

436
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,462
It's ok. I mean, it's one less person
that you have to fire today, right?

437
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:00,165
You know, actually,
this is good news, in a way.

438
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,100
My husband will be thrilled.

439
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,537
This way we can take that trip
that he's been wanting to go on.

440
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:08,173
Of course,
I'll have to drive.

441
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,076
You don't have to try and
make me feel better about this.

442
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:12,510
About what?

443
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:15,347
I sort of fired myself.

444
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,323
Come to visit me
in my confinement?

445
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:27,359
I thought you could
use some company.

446
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,227
And a little "I told you so?"

447
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:31,663
Oh, I, uh, yeah,
I didn't bring it.

448
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:35,333
With that being said,
it's not too late for you to drop out.

449
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:36,351
And send what message?

450
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,104
That on top of the city's
other problems,

451
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,537
we give into terrorism?

452
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,740
The people here deserve better.

453
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:44,409
They deserve someone
to be brave for them.

454
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:46,244
That's what
the Green Arrow's for.

455
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,380
Oh, it's not enough.

456
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:49,981
Yes, the Green Arrow
risked his life

457
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:51,282
to keep the people
of the city safe,

458
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:54,786
but...who inspires them?

459
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:58,056
You know, who works to make sure
that there's a city worth saving?

460
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:00,658
Who's there to make
Star City a place

461
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,427
that my daughter
wants to call home?

462
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:04,429
Where is Madison?

463
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:06,398
Oh, library.
The poor kid had finals,

464
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,199
so I sent her back to school.

465
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,934
Don't worry--

466
00:23:09,936 --> 00:23:11,436
Captain Lance sent her
with more than enough

467
00:23:11,438 --> 00:23:13,037
cops to keep her safe.

468
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,175
Maybe you should
call her.

469
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:39,243
To the man who
took my daughter,

470
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:42,112
please, I am begging you,

471
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:45,950
please, let my baby go.

472
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:48,953
She's all I have.

473
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:51,355
She's my whole world.

474
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:57,161
He killed the officer
escorting her

475
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:58,762
with some
kind of weapon.

476
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:00,097
Shot them
up with 5,000 volts,

477
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,532
slit their throats
for good measure.

478
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:03,667
His name is Lonnie Machin.

479
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,436
Do I even want to know where
you got that Intel?

480
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:07,938
You can't do this alone.
You know that.

481
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,573
Now, two of your guys are down.

482
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,710
Now let us help.

483
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,981
Where's this place?

484
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,516
Over there.

485
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:24,955
Baron, this guy
says he's--

486
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:26,390
Oliver Queen.

487
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:28,292
You don't
recognize him?

488
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:30,227
This man's
a minor celebrity

489
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:32,529
on the other side
of the world.

490
00:24:32,531 --> 00:24:35,466
You're supposed
to be dead.

491
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,302
Nearly was.

492
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:39,803
Thank you for rescuing me.

493
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:41,038
I'm sorry,

494
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,239
but we're not
rescuing you.

495
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,408
First thing you do
once you get home

496
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,076
is tell people what it is
we're doing here.

497
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:48,379
I don't know what
you're doing here.

498
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,148
Be that as it may,
I can't send you home.

499
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,117
Not right now.

500
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:55,119
Good news, though,

501
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:56,987
I have no reason
to kill you.

502
00:24:56,989 --> 00:25:00,224
So what are you
going to do to me?

503
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:01,325
Good question.

504
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:03,494
You've survived
3 years here,

505
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,262
all alone.

506
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:07,598
That requires fortitude,
intelligence--

507
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,068
qualities that are
of use to me.

508
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,073
As it happens, one of my men
stepped on a landmine.

509
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:19,877
How would you
like his job?

510
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:29,430
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

511
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:30,738
What did you do?

512
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,740
Where is Jessica Danforth's
daughter?

513
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,879
Did you catch
the news earlier?

514
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:43,383
Ms. Danforth begging
for her daughter's life.

515
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,951
She'll do anything
to get her back,

516
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:47,186
or not do anything.

517
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:49,455
Like run for mayor.

518
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:51,958
All I have to do
is make a phone call.

519
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,528
Now I see why
Rick Pinzolo banished you.

520
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,766
You're unaware that there are lines
one does not cross.

521
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:06,372
I met one of your ghosts.

522
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:09,275
After I took his tooth,

523
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:12,011
we had an interesting
conversation about H.I.V.E.

524
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:15,281
I wasn't led to believe
you respected lines.

525
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,917
I respect order,
Mr. Machin.

526
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,986
Discipline,
precision.

527
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,455
You are sloppy.

528
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,657
All you represent
is anarchy.

529
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,460
You made a mess.
I suggest you clean it up.

530
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,996
Either way, our relationship
has concluded.

531
00:26:29,998 --> 00:26:33,700
Wait! You can't.

532
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:38,037
You know your hand
is on me.

533
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,309
Clean it up.

534
00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:54,223
To the man
who took my daughter,

535
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,190
please, I am begging you--

536
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:58,893
That's
heartbreaking.

537
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:00,661
Please let my baby go.

538
00:27:00,663 --> 00:27:03,030
Hey.

539
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,300
Are you ok?

540
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:10,971
Just can't stand watching Jessica
go through that.

541
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:13,173
I feel like that's
what my mom

542
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:17,011
felt like when
Slade Wilson abducted me.

543
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,413
That's not what
you asked, though.

544
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:22,182
Um...I'm fine.

545
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:25,019
Well, you could
have fooled me.

546
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:28,756
Thea...

547
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:30,925
What happened to you
on Nanda Parbat?

548
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:33,460
Ollie didn't
tell you?

549
00:27:33,462 --> 00:27:35,229
It's Ollie.

550
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:36,564
Well, I guess
I really am his sister,

551
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:38,632
since I didn't
tell you, either.

552
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:41,335
I just...

553
00:27:41,337 --> 00:27:45,072
Didn't want
to re-live it.

554
00:27:45,074 --> 00:27:47,641
Re-live what?

555
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:50,044
Ra's, he, um...

556
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:56,984
He--
He killed me,

557
00:27:56,986 --> 00:28:00,688
or--or almost did.

558
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,257
Ollie said that
it was pretty bad.

559
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:05,893
And then Ra's

560
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:09,663
offered to use something--
I don't know,

561
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,899
to bring me back.

562
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:14,468
Something he calls
the Lazarus Pit.

563
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,771
Wait, so what's
happening to you now is--

564
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,406
is a side effect

565
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:22,009
from--from this pit?

566
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:25,479
Malcolm tried to warn Ollie,
I guess, but he...

567
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:27,982
Didn't listen.

568
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:31,218
No, of course he didn't.

569
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,188
He would do anything
to save his sister.

570
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:39,326
I swear, if there is
even a scratch on that girl,

571
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,661
so help me--

572
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:42,630
I'm afraid that is
out of my control.

573
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:46,734
Yeah? Well, so am I.
I am out, I am all the way out!

574
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:49,536
Well, I suppose you need a reminder
that Madison Danforth

575
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:53,774
is not the only vulnerable daughter
in this city.

576
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:57,177
You stay the hell
away from my daughter,

577
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,612
you son of a bitch!

578
00:28:59,682 --> 00:29:02,850
Language.

579
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:05,319
What is this?

580
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,121
The location
of the Danforth girl.

581
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:10,624
My sincere threat against your daughter
not withstanding,

582
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,027
this abduction lacks taste.

583
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:14,995
And the next time we meet,

584
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:17,131
and make no mistake,
there will be a next time,

585
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,534
remember to mind your tone.

586
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:28,475
Any news?

587
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,344
Only the bad kind.

588
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:31,979
Hey, we're going
to catch this guy.

589
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,280
Yeah, and when we do,
there's going to be

590
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:34,348
another one
waiting for us,

591
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,150
and another,
and another.

592
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:39,019
It's the most depressing game
of Whack-a-Mole ever.

593
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:41,555
Can't say we didn't know
what we were getting into.

594
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:43,991
Or back into.

595
00:29:43,993 --> 00:29:46,060
When we decided
to stay in Starling--

596
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,862
I mean, hmm, Star City,

597
00:29:48,864 --> 00:29:51,699
I was excited.
I thought it meant a new beginning.

598
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,701
And now, we've only
been back a week.

599
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:56,804
John is still mad at you, Thea's
gone pit crazy,

600
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:59,006
I've spent the last two days putting
people out of work.

601
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:02,042
If you think that
we made a mistake, we didn't.

602
00:30:02,044 --> 00:30:04,445
Nothing worthwhile
ever comes easy.

603
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:07,281
We said that we were
going to do things differently.

604
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:08,849
We just need...time

605
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,251
to figure out how.

606
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:19,526
Captain?

607
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,462
Heavy Heavy Club,
4th and Pierce?

608
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:22,730
What about it?

609
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:24,198
It's where Lonnie Machin

610
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,034
is holding
Jessica Danforth's daughter.

611
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:29,436
You said you're doing
things differently now?

612
00:30:29,438 --> 00:30:31,905
Here's your chance
to prove it.

613
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:43,669
Sorry to leave you hanging.

614
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:46,839
I had a meeting.
It didn't go well.

615
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:50,576
Turns out, I can't sit
at the cool kids' table.

616
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:55,114
When trillions and trillions
of molecules exploded from a pin head,

617
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:57,550
were there rules dictating
how to establish a universe?

618
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,518
No.

619
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:04,823
They found their way
through the chaos.

620
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:06,759
Please! You can
still let me go!

621
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:12,789
Only if you promise
not to tell

622
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,324
anybody about me.

623
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,561
Please!

624
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,933
Pinky swear?

625
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
I changed my mind.

626
00:31:31,842 --> 00:31:34,443
Oh, God!

627
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,412
Oh, the things
I'm about to do to you...

628
00:31:43,954 --> 00:31:45,421
Something wrong
with the front door?

629
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:47,489
Get away
from the girl!

630
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,124
Could you come back
in an hour?

631
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:50,993
We were just
getting started.

632
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:52,795
Oh!

633
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:05,574
Let's get her down.

634
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,342
Felicity.

635
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:10,813
So now a mad man dujour
knows you're working with a Felicity.

636
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:12,381
This is why
I need a code name.

637
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:14,049
We have Madison,
but he split.

638
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:15,784
There's no movement
outside the club.

639
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:17,352
He must still be
in there with you.

640
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,188
She needs
medical attention.

641
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,658
Get her to safety.
We've got this.

642
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,992
Hey.

643
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:25,561
Can you handle this?

644
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:27,296
I'm good.

645
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,728
Speedy!

646
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,875
Speedy, don't!

647
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:23,180
Baby?!

648
00:34:23,183 --> 00:34:24,483
Oh, my baby!

649
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:27,286
Come here, baby!
Mom!

650
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,955
Oh, my baby, my baby.

651
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:31,290
Ok!

652
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,843
Madison.

653
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:35,020
You all right?

654
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:36,688
A few bumps and bruises,

655
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,790
probably the world's
worst case of insomnia.

656
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:41,793
I'm really sorry, but I got an army
of reporters out there

657
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,528
and they want to know if you want
to make a statement.

658
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,863
Yes, I'll be out
in a few minutes.

659
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,198
You don't have
to do that tonight.

660
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,700
Yes, I do, Oliver.

661
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:51,502
I have to tell them
what I've decided.

662
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:54,672
I have to tell them
I'm withdrawing my candidacy.

663
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:59,344
I'm not running for mayor.

664
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:01,312
Come on.

665
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,954
Thank you
for trusting me.

666
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:12,490
You weren't kidding about doing things
differently, were you?

667
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:15,590
Instead of pin cushioning guys,
now you're burning them alive?

668
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,196
Captain--

669
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,196
And you're lucky

670
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,529
Machin is on his way
to Starling General,

671
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:20,031
or I'd be booking you
for murder.

672
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:25,503
Just so you're clear
where we stand with each other.

673
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:38,516
Oh!

674
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,683
This man needs
some water!

675
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:41,728
Did you hear me?

676
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,389
Yeah, I heard.

677
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,989
Get back to work.

678
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:46,924
What are you going to do
when all your workers

679
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:48,893
are dead from heat stroke?

680
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:50,461
Not your concern.

681
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:53,131
Like the man said,

682
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:56,134
get back to work!

683
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,106
Miss Smoak,

684
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:03,541
what's this we're hearing

685
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:05,076
about you halting
the workforce reduction?

686
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:06,377
I thought we agreed--

687
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:07,712
Well, you talked
and I listened.

688
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:09,647
I would hardly
call that an agreement.

689
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:12,183
With that said, I did get around
to firing a few people

690
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,589
they've all been
hired back, B-T-dub.

691
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,763
And one of them reminded me

692
00:36:14,787 --> 00:36:16,956
that Ray Palmer never
would have approved of this.

693
00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:19,090
Ray Palmer is dead.

694
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:21,559
And this company
will be, too, unless--

695
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:23,027
I am going to stop you
right there.

696
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:25,963
I'm sorry, Miss Smoak,
you asked to see...Me.

697
00:36:25,965 --> 00:36:27,799
Um...

698
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,367
I think there's
been a mistake.

699
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:30,935
No, actually,
you have perfect timing.

700
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:33,705
I was just about to tell Mr. Dennis
about your project.

701
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:36,474
After I fired Mr. Holt,
I had the opportunity

702
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:37,809
to review
his active projects.

703
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:39,410
It turns out he is
working on something

704
00:36:39,412 --> 00:36:40,511
that is going
to revolutionize technology

705
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:42,380
and save this company.

706
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:45,750
Neither of which he can do with
a reduced workforce supporting him.

707
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,518
Intriguing.

708
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,787
So what's this
revolutionary technology,

709
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:50,822
Mr. Holt?

710
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:51,684
Um...

711
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,708
Um, that is proprietary.

712
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:58,096
But I can assure you,
it will astonish the world.

713
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:03,434
Our annual shareholders
meeting's in six months.

714
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,104
Present it there.

715
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,005
Astonish us.

716
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,708
Oh, we will.

717
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,914
You don't even have
an idea for some

718
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,783
world astonishing
technology, do you?

719
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:21,018
Nope, but I am betting
that you do.

720
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,821
Pretty bold move,
Miss Smoak.

721
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:27,125
Yeah, well, I'm trying to do things
a little differently.

722
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:35,166
Hello? Hey.

723
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:38,970
How are you?

724
00:37:38,972 --> 00:37:42,039
I guess I was wrong

725
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,242
when I told you
not to worry about me.

726
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:46,344
Right or wrong,
I'm still going to worry.

727
00:37:46,346 --> 00:37:49,347
It's right at the top
of the big brother job description.

728
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:52,850
Thea...
I should have

729
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:57,188
told you about
the Pit immediately.

730
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,191
That was the old me.

731
00:38:00,193 --> 00:38:02,727
And who are you now?

732
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:05,196
Ollie 2.0?

733
00:38:05,198 --> 00:38:08,166
No, I'm more
like...Ollie 1.0

734
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,301
who's trying to do
things differently.

735
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:13,070
Look, whatever you
are going through,

736
00:38:13,072 --> 00:38:15,640
we will get
through it together.

737
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:19,043
I thought Thea could use
some time out of town.

738
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:22,547
A spa getaway.
Clear her head.

739
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:25,349
As long as it's not near
any hot tubs,

740
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:27,652
'cause that's what
got me into this situation.

741
00:38:27,654 --> 00:38:30,054
I think it's
a good idea.

742
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:34,225
Can you and John handle things
while we're away?

743
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:36,027
Yeah, as long as we don't kill
each other first.

744
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,495
Bye.

745
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:40,932
I'm kidding,
by the way.

746
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,433
We'll be fine.

747
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:43,935
Probably.

748
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:46,204
Take care
of her, ok?

749
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:52,276
Yeah, I like a spa
as much as anybody,

750
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:54,912
but I think we both know

751
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:56,280
whatever is going on with me

752
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:59,116
will not be fixed
with a mani-pedi.

753
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:03,120
That's why we're not
going to the spa.

754
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:07,124
We're going
to Nanda Parbat.

755
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,927
Thea, whatever's
going on with you,

756
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:12,530
the League, they'll know
what to do.

757
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:17,201
Why are we not
telling my brother?

758
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:20,771
Because you're not the only reason
for us going to Nanda Parbat.

759
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:30,948
What happened?

760
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,750
The ambulance didn't make it
to Starling General.

761
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:34,652
We tried to get
the paramedics on the radio,

762
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:38,122
and then we got a 911 call
reporting this.

763
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:41,058
Machin, he, um...

764
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,662
I don't really know how to describe
what he did to them.

765
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:53,471
I'm not sure what
that symbol means.

766
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:57,475
It means anarchy.

767
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:01,479
Hello.

768
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:03,314
Hey, I'm out here.

769
00:40:03,316 --> 00:40:05,750
You look happy.

770
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:08,953
Don't tell me you started
enjoying firing people.

771
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:10,388
No more firing.

772
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,190
Good.

773
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:18,262
Figured out
another way.

774
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:21,499
Well, maybe you could
share your secret with me.

775
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:25,102
Doing things differently
is what I promised myself.

776
00:40:25,104 --> 00:40:27,038
You are doing things
differently.

777
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,441
Well, not different
enough, apparently.

778
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:33,377
Both Lance
and Jessica Danforth

779
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:35,112
said something to me

780
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:37,715
about this city
needing something

781
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:39,517
that the Green Arrow
can't offer them.

782
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,619
Decent Sushi
restaurant?

783
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:48,145
Hope.

784
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:51,616
Inspiration.

785
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:54,534
Someone who can do
things in the light,

786
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,669
who isn't afraid...

787
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:02,175
Someone who can
protect himself.

788
00:41:03,745 --> 00:41:06,146
Felicity...

789
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:10,049
I'm going to run for mayor.

790
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,898
Are you sure
you want to do this?

791
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:03,011
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

792
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:20,924
Greg!
Move your head.
