1
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:03,815
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:07,767
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:09,436
survive.

4
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:11,238
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,906
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:15,409
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:18,611
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:21,581
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:25,469
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,314
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:30,401
Felicity, I want you to find out
all you can about that notebook.

12
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:32,403
I'll be driving your mother
around for a few days.

13
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,054
She's not a suspect.

14
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:36,023
Oliver, something's going on
in this city. You know it.

15
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:38,725
Walter, please. You've got
to stop looking into this.

16
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:39,994
It's not safe.

17
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:41,862
Well, accidents tend
to befall people

18
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:44,331
who are too curious.

19
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,784
And he won't be harmed?
It's done.

20
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:49,370
Nor will ever discover your
involvement. You have my word.

21
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:51,262
I'm not sure I'm ready
for the kind of commitment

22
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:52,374
that you're looking for.

23
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,374
You can't be serious.

24
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:54,925
This is me serious,
Laurel.

25
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:04,635
Call Cayman Fidelity.

26
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:06,220
Tell them their
favorite accountant

27
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:09,056
is flying in to make
a special deposit

28
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:12,226
for a special client.

29
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:17,598
That elevator's supposed
to be on a key.

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,733
Go. Check it out.

31
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:51,182
Harold Backman,

32
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:53,517
you have failed
this city.

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,102
I'm only an accountant.

34
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,770
I'm just the money.

35
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:58,305
The money that leads
to extortion,

36
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,107
kidnapping, and drugs.

37
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,244
It's the destruction
of innocent lives!

38
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:06,780
You think you scare me
more than the people I work for?

39
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:09,650
No.

40
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,652
They can deal with you.

41
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,759
Hmm. Let me guess.

42
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:21,178
Some bad guy missing
his fancy new laptop.

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,664
Harold Backman. He's who
Starling City's worst call

44
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,850
when they want to
launder money in the Caymans.

45
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,968
Shouldn't we just
turn this over to,

46
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,720
I don't know, the IRS?

47
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:31,839
We will. Just as soon
as you return the money

48
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,724
to the rightful owners.

49
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:36,110
Well, it sounds like
a very nice idea.

50
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:37,311
Backman's files
are all protected

51
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:39,280
with an asymmetric
encryption algorithm.

52
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,800
Really? So it's gonna
take a while to break in.

53
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:44,451
Days, at least.

54
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,654
Better get started, then.

55
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,711
At the risk of ending up
with an arrow in my eye,

56
00:02:53,713 --> 00:02:55,496
can I ask...

57
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,381
When are you planning
on making peace with Diggle?

58
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,133
He's the one who left,
Felicity.

59
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:00,834
I did everything I could
to stop him.

60
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:02,753
Except apologize.

61
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:05,339
You promised you'd help him track
down Floyd Lawton and then you--

62
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:07,374
Made a choice
that I can life with.

63
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:09,927
If he can't,
then I don't need him.

64
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,712
I need to get back to the club.
Oliver--

65
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:13,314
Let me know
when you break in.

66
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,236
I wish someone would
send me off to the Caymans.

67
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,075
Yes, I know it's been
6 months. But--

68
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:30,497
I am very well aware
of the statistics.

69
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:34,401
But I haven't given up hope
and neither should you.

70
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:37,904
That didn't sound
too good.

71
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:39,406
Oh, it's fine.

72
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:40,925
Who were you talking to?

73
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:43,928
Just the insurance company.

74
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,265
They insist on paying out
Walter's life insurance policy.

75
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:50,751
I know we haven't talked
about Walter in a while,

76
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:53,887
but I--I miss him, too.

77
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,107
It's like losing dad
all over again.

78
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:02,863
You look radiant.

79
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,598
Flatterer.

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,451
I think you're
the last to arrive.

81
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:08,953
How's Tommy?

82
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:10,871
Tommy is Tommy.
How's Oliver?

83
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,623
Still in bed.
It's only noon.

84
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,160
Well, look who
I just found.

85
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:18,412
Get lost trying
to find the house?

86
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:19,830
You say that as if
your driveway's

87
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,281
not longer
than most roads.

88
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:22,416
Can I get anyone
anything else? Frank?

89
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:23,467
We're fine, dear,
thank you.

90
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,136
Oh, excuse me.

91
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:31,842
Hello, Mrs. Queen.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

92
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:35,145
Oh, no, no. Don't be silly, Walter.
Come in, please.

93
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,683
You're here
to see Robert.

94
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,652
Yes. There's just some
papers he needs to sign

95
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:43,270
for the stock offering.

96
00:04:43,272 --> 00:04:44,855
Well, he's in some
private meeting right now,

97
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,306
but you're welcome
to wait for him in his study.

98
00:04:46,308 --> 00:04:47,491
Thank you.

99
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:48,642
Unless you'd like
to help me

100
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,143
get my children
out of the house.

101
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:52,145
You don't have
children, do you, Walter?

102
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:53,747
Not yet, I'm afraid.

103
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:55,749
Well, save yourself
the trouble and don't.

104
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,668
They eventually
all turn into teenagers.

105
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,922
Adam Hunt
was reluctant at first,

106
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:04,425
but was more cooperative
upon being informed

107
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,126
we knew about
his embezzlement.

108
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:08,128
Police communication system
could use an upgrade.

109
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,764
I think Mr. Hunt
can be persuaded

110
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,883
to make an anonymous
donation.

111
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:16,053
Well, that will certainly
cure what ails this city.

112
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,138
What's that, Malcolm?

113
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,058
We're emptying the Atlantic
with a tablespoon.

114
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,111
For years we've been forcing
the city's worst to do what is best,

115
00:05:24,113 --> 00:05:26,146
leverage them to help us
save the city.

116
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:28,014
But it's...not working.

117
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,684
Crime in the Glades
is rising.

118
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,069
The cancer is spreading.

119
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:34,855
We just need to...
Take some more time.

120
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:37,658
Did Rebecca get more time?
Did the man who raped Frank's daughter

121
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,827
give her any quarter?

122
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:43,080
Everyone in this room has lost
something or someone to the Glades.

123
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:46,166
And we have committed
ourselves to fixing it.

124
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:49,503
But what have we truly
accomplished?

125
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:51,588
Nothing.

126
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,507
Maybe it's because
the Glades can't be fixed.

127
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,060
You're saying we should
abandon the project?

128
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,711
Yes.

129
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,564
In favor of a new
undertaking.

130
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,734
Like Ben Tre in Vietnam.

131
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:07,654
The village must be destroyed
before it can be saved.

132
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:10,157
Are you suggesting
we somehow...

133
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:12,058
level the Glades?

134
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,544
Down to the bedrock.

135
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:16,363
Only then can we truly

136
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:19,616
rebuild Starling City
and make it safer for everyone.

137
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:21,502
That's 24 square blocks.

138
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:22,870
And if we did--

139
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,571
and I'm not saying
we should--

140
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:25,789
if we did,

141
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,175
wouldn't suspicion
fall on us?

142
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:29,676
Not if the destruction

143
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:32,129
appears to be caused
by a natural disaster.

144
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,264
You've always had something of
a God complex, Malcolm.

145
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,249
It's part of your charm.

146
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,886
But even you can't create
a natural disaster.

147
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:42,422
Have you ever heard of
Unidac Industries?

148
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:44,441
It's a small company.

149
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:47,761
They have an idea...

150
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:50,898
An idea that will serve
our purposes.

151
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,200
My sources tell me they're
5 years away from prototype.

152
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:57,454
And any undertaking of value
is worthy of patience.

153
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:58,605
And restraint.

154
00:06:58,607 --> 00:06:59,873
One man alone

155
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,107
can't save this city,
Robert,

156
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,743
and we both know that.

157
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:17,090
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns in all the world,

158
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:18,475
she walks into mine.

159
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:21,428
This coffee's terrible,
Oliver.

160
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,398
That's what you get
for ordering coffee in a bar.

161
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:30,237
You look tired.

162
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,389
Too much work?

163
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,140
Too much crying.

164
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:37,327
Tommy broke up with me.

165
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,664
What happened?

166
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,782
I have no idea.

167
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:44,284
Things were good.
They were...

168
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:47,337
Great, and then suddenly
he's packing up his things

169
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,490
and telling me
that it's over.

170
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,826
Did he say anything
to you?

171
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:56,597
No. Tommy and I haven't
talked very much since he quit.

172
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,499
But he'll come around.

173
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,985
It's probably
just cold feet.

174
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,006
Like it was with you.

175
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:09,943
Oliver, you don't sleep with
your girlfriend's sister

176
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:12,846
unless you're looking
to blow the relationship up.

177
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:15,115
If you still want
to be with Tommy,

178
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:18,368
do what
we should have done.

179
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:21,438
Talk to each other

180
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,040
and be honest.

181
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,294
Oliver,
I need to show you what--

182
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:31,331
I just totally walked in
on a thing, didn't I?

183
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry, uh,
who are you?

184
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,668
Nobody. I mean,
I'm not nobody.

185
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,953
I'm someone,
obviously.

186
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:38,922
And so are you.
You're Laurel, right?

187
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:41,642
That Laurel.
Gorgeous Laurel.

188
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:44,261
This is Felicity.
She's setting up my Internet.

189
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:46,647
Router. And I need
to show Oliver

190
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,599
something very important
related to it.

191
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:51,685
I'll let you go, then.

192
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:54,220
Thank you for the coffee...

193
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:56,389
and the advice.

194
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,114
Tell me you got in.

195
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:06,033
Better. I hacked
Cayman Fidelity

196
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,285
and put together a list all the
deposits Backman made last year.

197
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:09,920
Felicity, what good
does that do us

198
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,505
if we don't know
whose money it was?

199
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,340
Look at the biggest deposit
Backman made last year.

200
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:14,407
Bottom page.

201
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,910
$2 million on Decem--

202
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:19,963
December 12.

203
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:21,181
That's...

204
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:22,799
The day Walter
disappeared.

205
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,752
What if one of Backman's clients
was paid 2 million

206
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:26,970
to kidnap Walter?

207
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:30,256
Then we find out
which client it was...

208
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:32,276
And we use them
to find Walter.

209
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:39,718

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

211
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,295
Ok, back-trace the account,
follow the money,

212
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,247
hopefully it will lead us
to whoever kidnapped Walter.

213
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:53,931
After all this time,
do you think Walter might

214
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:54,812
still really be alive?

215
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,139
I don't know.

216
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,607
Got it.

217
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:59,609
Dominic Alonzo.

218
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,278
Yeah.
Name ring a bell?

219
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,347
Alonzo runs the biggest
underground casino in Starling City

220
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,316
when he's not busy
kidnapping.

221
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:10,019
He looks like the kind of lowlife
someone would hire to kidnap Walter.

222
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:11,688
How many arrows do you think
you'll have to put in him

223
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,241
before he gives up Walter's location?
Say a lot?

224
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:15,625
It's not that simple.

225
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:17,410
That casino has
its own private army.

226
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,412
We need to access
Alonzo's computer,

227
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:22,198
but without setting off
any alarms.

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,367
Looks like we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

229
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:27,003
It's too bad there's not
someone else we could call.

230
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,205
That's enough. We can
do this on our own.

231
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:32,759
Well, then... Looks like someone's
going gambling tonight.

232
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:35,228
Those guys would make me
the minute that I walked in there.

233
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,265
Oliver Queen would never be
caught dead in a place like that.

234
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:40,350
I wasn't talking about you.

235
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:41,234
Absolutely not.

236
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,719
I can count cards.

237
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,388
It's all probability theory
and mathematics.

238
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,690
Have you met me?

239
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,491
Bottom line--I know my way
around a casino.

240
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:50,026
Felicity, I'm not
letting you walk--

241
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,561
The reason I joined you
in the first place

242
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,330
was to find Walter,
and for the first time,

243
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:57,167
we have a real chance
of finding him.

244
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:58,835
You have to let me do this.

245
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,575
All right.

246
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:08,712
But we do it my way.

247
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:12,599
Come on.

248
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,919
I'm sorry I had to
pull you away

249
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:17,687
from whoever
you were meeting.

250
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,307
Oh, it's nothing.
Everyone's left already.

251
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,643
Besides, it's my fault for forgetting
to sign the K-5s this morning.

252
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:27,197
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but is everything all right?

253
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,817
Just, uh, taking care
of some odds and ends.

254
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,320
Well, if ever you need
a friendly ear.

255
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,121
You're a good man, Walter.

256
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,752
I thought you'd left.

257
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:51,388
I'm still waiting
for your answer.

258
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,340
How can you even think
of doing this?

259
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:55,642
That place took
your soul, Robert.

260
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:58,929
Doing this won't give it back.

261
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,264
It won't bring back
Rebecca, either.

262
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:12,742
It still feels like
yesterday, that day.

263
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:15,612
When she called my cell
phone for the first time,

264
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:18,114
I remember being annoyed.

265
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:21,651
She knew I was busy,
so I just let it ring.

266
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:26,506
When she called back
a minute later,

267
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:30,660
I shut my phone off.

268
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,596
A little after midnight,
two SCPD officers

269
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,165
showed up in my office.

270
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:40,437
All I remember them
saying was...

271
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:43,523
She'd been shot.

272
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:47,176
Murdered in the Glades.

273
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:53,066
After the cops left, I sat in my
office the rest of the night

274
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:55,452
listening to Rebecca's messages.

275
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,211
She kept calling my name...

276
00:13:05,213 --> 00:13:07,163
Asking for help...

277
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,633
until she was just
struggling to breathe,

278
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:14,004
gasping for air.

279
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,222
I listened to my wife die

280
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:18,341
over and over

281
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,977
and over again.

282
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,065
I can't imagine, Malcolm.

283
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,516
Try.

284
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:29,385
Imagine it was Moira
lying on that pavement,

285
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,721
bleeding, calling your name.

286
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:35,391
And then tell me you wouldn't
be prepared to do what I am.

287
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:47,170
What do you want?

288
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,621
Is that any way
to treat a girl

289
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:52,008
who just walked up
6 flights of stairs?

290
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,077
No, it's not. Where are my manners?
Come on in.

291
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,079
Thank you.

292
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:01,601
Welcome.

293
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,221
Did you do these?

294
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,661
You know, Felicity,

295
00:14:06,686 --> 00:14:08,686
Oliver and I don't need
a relationship counselor.

296
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:12,145
That hasn't been
my experience.

297
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,530
We have a lead
on Walter.

298
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:16,900
I need you to come back
and help us find him.

299
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:18,284
Oliver put you up to this?

300
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,869
No.

301
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:21,771
He doesn't even know
I'm here.

302
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:24,707
Look.

303
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,292
I know Oliver
didn't help you

304
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:27,494
find your
brother's killer

305
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:30,046
and that hurts.
It sucks. But...

306
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:32,832
You gotta know
if it was your life on the line

307
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:36,285
on not just your...
very understandable vendetta,

308
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,304
he would be there
for you.

309
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:39,639
No hesitation.

310
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,074
And I don't want
a partnership

311
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:43,660
with those kind
of qualifications, Felicity.

312
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:48,998
I know Oliver's religiously
against admitting he's wrong.

313
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,469
Truth is, he needs you.

314
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:57,907
Yeah.

315
00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:00,643
And when Oliver
is ready to say that,

316
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,613
he knows where I live.

317
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,002
Sorry for bothering you.

318
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,421
It's no bother.
I hope you find him.

319
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,174
Wow, you really
look like your father.

320
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,144
I never thought so before,

321
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:36,012
but just now
I saw him in you.

322
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:38,681
What are you doing here?

323
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,066
We need to talk.

324
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,335
I said everything
I have to say.

325
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,187
Well, I haven't.
Tommy, I love you,

326
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:46,122
and I think that
you still love me,

327
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,957
so whatever problems
that you think that we have,

328
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:49,909
I know that if we
face them together--

329
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,544
You don't understand.

330
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,829
Then help me understand.

331
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,165
If our relationship
is gonna end, at least

332
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,966
let it end with honesty.

333
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,537
Ok, Laurel.

334
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:04,807
Honestly...

335
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,644
You belong with Oliver.

336
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,713
Excuse me?

337
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:13,516
He's still in love
with you.

338
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:16,553
I have a meeting.

339
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,024
You ready?

340
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,258
I think so.

341
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,852
Just to be clear,

342
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,520
the plan is for me
to get caught counting cards

343
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:37,156
in an underground casino
filled with hardened criminals.

344
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:39,158
So you can get a friendly
warning from Alonzo

345
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,944
and plant a bug
on his office computer.

346
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:45,164
Right. Which will
hopefully lead us to Walter.

347
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,400
That is assuming I get
the friendly warning

348
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:51,537
and not a bullet.

349
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,989
You don't
have to do this.

350
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,074
Yes, I do.

351
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:57,043
Ok. If anything happens,

352
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,845
I'm right outside.

353
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,913
Ok.

354
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:10,223
Password.

355
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,191
Snapdragon.

356
00:17:13,977 --> 00:17:16,062
Password's snapdragon.

357
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:19,866
Password.

358
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,267
Snapdragon.

359
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,721
What do you see?

360
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:45,091
6 armed guards,
2 pit bosses,

361
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,343
and a floor man.

362
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:49,262
No slot machines.
How do you call yourself a casino

363
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:50,596
without any Lucky 7s?

364
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:51,898
Stay focused, please.

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,983
I'll be with you
the entire time.

366
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,818
Thanks.

367
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,238
It feels really good
having you inside me.

368
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,274
And by "you,"
I mean your voice.

369
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:03,576
And by "me," I mean my ear.

370
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:04,927
I'm gonna stop talking
right now.

371
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:06,579
That would be my preference.

372
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:16,989
One stack of High Society,
please.

373
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:26,966
Thank you for stopping by.

374
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:28,634
Of course.

375
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:32,004
Uh, you said
you had news.

376
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,139
I do.

377
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:35,274
It's ready.

378
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:38,945
The Markov device passed its final
beta test this morning.

379
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:41,680
Applied Sciences
is loading it on a truck

380
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:46,202
bound for Starling City
as we speak.

381
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,905
Well...

382
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:52,825
Congratulations
are in order, then.

383
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,526
To both of us.

384
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:57,913
Moira, you may be
surprised to know

385
00:18:57,915 --> 00:19:00,916
that I sometimes
waver in my convictions.

386
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:04,086
But your friendship,
your endless support...

387
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:08,090
always gives me
the strength to carry on.

388
00:19:08,092 --> 00:19:11,894
After all, you and I
will always have a connection.

389
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,982
I'm just sorry that
Robert's not here

390
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:18,317
to celebrate with us.

391
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:23,555
I'm sorry I had to
take him from you.

392
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:28,244
If anyone's to blame
for his death, it's me.

393
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:33,866
To Robert.

394
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,751
To Rebecca.

395
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:38,504
Are you feeling all right?

396
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:42,124
I know tonight was
just another Ted Kord fund-raiser,

397
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:45,911
but you were
surprisingly quiet.

398
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:49,632
Moira, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

399
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,767
Robert, if this
is what I think it is,

400
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,386
I don't want to know
her name. I don't--

401
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:56,939
No, it's about Malcolm.

402
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:59,809
He wants to level the Glades.

403
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:02,478
And how does Malcolm
propose to evacuate

404
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,448
an entire section
of the city?

405
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,817
He doesn't.

406
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:12,872
Robert, that doesn't
sound like you.

407
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,076
Because I'm not the man
you think I am.

408
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:24,216
About a month before
the opening of Steele factory,

409
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:25,784
the one in the Glades,

410
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:28,804
I was approached
by a local councilman.

411
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,806
He wanted money.

412
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,626
Told me that's the way
everything was done in the Glades.

413
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:37,480
I told him I'd never
paid a bribe in my life.

414
00:20:37,482 --> 00:20:39,915
We got into an argument.

415
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:44,636
I didn't want to hurt him.

416
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:47,506
I swear, Moira.

417
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:49,158
But he fell.

418
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,944
Oh, dear God.

419
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,829
Oh, dear God.

420
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:59,502
The work I'm doing
with Malcolm, with the list,

421
00:20:59,504 --> 00:21:00,836
it's my penance, Moira.

422
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,654
What, so you'll atone
for one murder

423
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:05,958
by committing hundreds,
thousands?

424
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,761
Oh...

425
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:10,463
Robert.

426
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,831
You listen to me.

427
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,385
Whatever wrongs
you've committed,

428
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:18,888
whatever mistakes
you've made,

429
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,160
preventing this horror
is your chance to make it right.

430
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,147
Please...

431
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:33,202
Please, Robert, promise me
you won't let this happen.

432
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,167
Oh!

433
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:49,301
Blackjack!

434
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,008
Miss...

435
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,309
Can you come with me?

436
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,544
Is something wrong?

437
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:00,179
Get up.

438
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:03,048
Oh, since you ask
so nicely.

439
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,097
Oh, there's the bathroom.

440
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:09,656
I should have known
the manager's office

441
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:13,325
would be down the hall
and to the right of the bathroom.

442
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:14,726
Mr. Alonzo.

443
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:21,000
Have a seat.

444
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:26,172
What's your name?

445
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:27,923
Megan.

446
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:33,362
Do you know where the term
"86" comes from, Megan?

447
00:22:33,364 --> 00:22:35,514
As it happens, I do.
It's from prohibition.

448
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:38,184
There was a--
an illegal casino,

449
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:40,519
not like this one,

450
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:43,189
located at 86 Bedford
street in New York,

451
00:22:43,191 --> 00:22:46,692
and...God, you know,
I'm just gonna stop talking.

452
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:48,644
Now it means
to ban someone,

453
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:51,530
someone who's cheating.
You're 86'd.

454
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:53,365
Leave your chips and go.

455
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:55,234
Thank you.

456
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,736
Thank you.

457
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:03,325
Oh, yeah, Megan,
one more thing.

458
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:06,045
You see, the thing
about card counters is, uh...

459
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:09,465
sometimes they work...

460
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:12,718
with a partner.

461
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:19,725
You're gonna be really upset
when you meet my partner.

462
00:23:54,661 --> 00:23:57,496
Aah!

463
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:07,373
I heard you never miss.

464
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,007
I don't.

465
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:15,397
Uhh!

466
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,349
Where's Walter Steele?

467
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:19,685
What? What a you
talking about, huh?

468
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:22,354
6 months ago
you had him kidnapped!

469
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:23,906
It was just a job.
I was given a name.

470
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:26,125
I didn't ask
any questions.

471
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:29,044
Last chance.

472
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:30,296
Where is he?

473
00:24:30,298 --> 00:24:32,331
Below ground.

474
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,282
You're lying!

475
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:34,383
I'm not.
I delivered him

476
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,368
and they killed him.

477
00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:39,054
I heard the gunshot.

478
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:41,540
He's dead.

479
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:14,756
Oh, let's see that blouse
in that violet shade.

480
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:17,461
You're
a miracle worker, Thea.

481
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:21,296
Oh, when it comes to shopping,
it's not work, really.

482
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:28,086
Hey. I'm teaching mom
the joys of online clothes shopping.

483
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:31,390
Ollie?

484
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,142
Are you ok?

485
00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:41,299
I need to talk to you both.

486
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:42,984
What is it?

487
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:45,487
It's about Walter.

488
00:25:47,607 --> 00:25:50,459
Did the police
contact you?

489
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:54,913
One of Mr. Diggle's
army buddies

490
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:57,632
works for the FBI now.

491
00:25:57,634 --> 00:25:59,818
And they got news tonight.

492
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,869
No.

493
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:03,622
I'm very sorry.

494
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:05,874
No, no, no, no, no.

495
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:10,212
There must be
some mistake.

496
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:12,497
Who did Mr. Diggle
talk to?

497
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:14,015
Did they find a body?

498
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:16,718
Mom...

499
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,969
Walter's gone.

500
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:19,304
No. This isn't right.

501
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:21,356
Where are you going?
Out.

502
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,724
I need some air.
It's 10:00 at night.

503
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:24,109
Mom, you're in shock.

504
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:27,112
Don't tell me what
or how I feel, Oliver.

505
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:30,181
Why is she acting
like that?

506
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:32,033
Come here.

507
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:44,796
I suspect I know
what this is about.

508
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,032
You and I got in bed
with Malcolm

509
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,552
to cure what ails
this city.

510
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:57,309
But I think you agree,
killing thousands of people

511
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,593
is not the answer.

512
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:00,645
Indeed. If we
were to wage a war

513
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:03,715
with Malcolm Merlyn,
we will lose.

514
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:07,018
My family has already
suffered enough.

515
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,988
And I have no desire
to endanger mine.

516
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,574
Fortunately,
there's another option.

517
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:18,029
6 months ago, Malcolm
started buying up buildings

518
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:19,498
in the Glades

519
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,633
through an offshore company
called Sagittarius.

520
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:24,169
And he made it sound as if this
undertaking of his

521
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:26,087
was a recent inspiration.

522
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,290
If you're right,

523
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:30,208
he has been thinking
about this for months.

524
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,077
If he can't rebuild it,

525
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,629
he'll abandon the project.

526
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:38,049
How much of the Glades
does he already have?

527
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,718
About a third.

528
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,588
Now, if we can quietly
buy up the rest before he can,

529
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,391
he won't be able to gain
the control he needs.

530
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:48,827
We will need capital.

531
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,645
Do you still have
your contacts in China?

532
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:54,199
I already have a flight planned
for Shanghai tomorrow.

533
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:55,934
Come with me.

534
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:58,486
We shouldn't travel together.
Malcolm might get worried.

535
00:27:58,488 --> 00:28:01,206
He already knows
I have my doubts.

536
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,792
Besides, I'm getting the urge
to take out the "Queen's Gambit"

537
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:04,960
for another voyage.

538
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:08,213
Dad! Do you have any cash?

539
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:10,999
Jerk pizza guy
can't break a 100.

540
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,918
Oliver, you remember
Mr. Chen?

541
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,419
Hey.
Hi.

542
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:17,305
Waiting. Thank you.

543
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:22,978
♪ 1, 2, 3, 4, tell me...

544
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,647
Pizza.

545
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,484
My hero.

546
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:30,902
I'm starved.

547
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:38,276
Yeah.
Hey, Ollie.

548
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:40,245
Where do you keep
the bottle opener in this thing?

549
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:42,981
Bottom drawer.

550
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:44,783
Did you talk to Ray today?

551
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:46,868
About the ski trip?

552
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,988
No. He asked Jean
to move in with him last night.

553
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,008
Oh. Guess they've
been together forever.

554
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,844
We've been together longer.

555
00:28:57,847 --> 00:28:59,347
Guess we have.

556
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:04,636
I only bring this up because your
mom busted me yesterday.

557
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:08,006
And obviously we can't
hang out at my house.

558
00:29:08,008 --> 00:29:09,608
Why? Because your father
threatened to tase me

559
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,610
the last time that I closed
the door to your bedroom?

560
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:14,112
So wouldn't it be nice
to have a little place of our own?

561
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:16,481
Yeah.

562
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:18,083
Maybe.

563
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:21,069
This is a little fast,
Laurel.

564
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:23,354
I know that you like
to think of yourself

565
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:26,691
as a bad boy,
Oliver Queen, but...

566
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:29,678
I feel like we're ready
to take the next step.

567
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,646
Yeah.

568
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:35,333
Let's do it.

569
00:29:40,222 --> 00:29:41,973
Mm.

570
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,715
You lied to me.

571
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:52,216
We had a deal.

572
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,322
Gong dag. Gong-pa-ma-tsom.

573
00:29:59,325 --> 00:30:00,692
What are you talking about?

574
00:30:00,694 --> 00:30:02,327
You promised if I cooperated

575
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:04,779
with the Undertaking,
Walter wouldn't be harmed!

576
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:06,281
He hasn't been.
I'm a man of my word, Moira.

577
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:08,533
We both know
better than that.

578
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:11,503
And I know...

579
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,039
I know you've
had him killed.

580
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:16,758
Turn on the camera.

581
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,851
Oh, Walter...

582
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,437
Like you said, Moira,
we have an agreement.

583
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,045
Walter would stay
in my custody until

584
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,437
the Undertaking was complete.

585
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:36,411
We're both in this together.

586
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:53,961
I've been sitting
in the dark all night, too.

587
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:55,963
All these months
I kept thinking

588
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:58,916
if I could find a clue,
I could get a lead on him.

589
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:02,419
Guess it wouldn't
have mattered.

590
00:31:08,343 --> 00:31:10,794
I can't imagine what
your family's going through.

591
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:16,133
Walter's alive.

592
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,868
What?

593
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,603
But Alonzo said--

594
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:22,840
I need you to pull up
Malcolm Merlyn's phone records.

595
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:25,342
He made a call
from his office

596
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:28,679
to wherever Walter
is being kept at 10:30 p.m.

597
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:30,114
Malcolm Merlyn?

598
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:33,183
Tommy's father?
Why would he kidnap Walter?

599
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,352
Felicity.

600
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,331
L.U.D. showed he made a call
to a tenement complex

601
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,865
located in Bludhaven.

602
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:53,554
Can you pull up
a satellite view?

603
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:55,005
Ok.

604
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,828
That's a lot of security
for low-income housing.

605
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,348
There's two guards
stationed at all access points.

606
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,983
There's just one
on the roof.

607
00:32:05,985 --> 00:32:07,718
Exactly. There's no other
buildings in that area.

608
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,353
If you want to get
onto the roof,

609
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,690
you're going to have to
jump off of something.

610
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:14,692
I've got something.

611
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:55,265
There's a problem in quadrant 4.

612
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:18,449
Mr. Steele.

613
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:21,869
Walter.

614
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:24,071
What?

615
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:26,673
What's happening?

616
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:28,492
You're going home.

617
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,969
I thought I'd never
see you again.

618
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,425
I'm all right.

619
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,813
Welcome home, Walter.

620
00:34:58,815 --> 00:35:00,297
Thank you, son.

621
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,470
Thea.

622
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,409
This is totally
a family thing, isn't it?

623
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,812
I'm sorry, who are you?

624
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,881
This is Felicity.

625
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:18,833
She's my friend.

626
00:35:18,835 --> 00:35:19,951
Mine, too.

627
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,586
It's good to see you.

628
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:22,987
You, too.

629
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:25,322
I'll let you guys
get back to your hugging.

630
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,185
Oliver.

631
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:39,303
We're all together again.

632
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:41,338
Everything's
gonna be all right.

633
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,844
Robert, I don't like
the idea of this.

634
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,613
It's gonna be ok.

635
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:50,848
Yeah, well, how long
will you be gone?

636
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,317
A few weeks. Maybe more,
depending on what I--

637
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:54,869
Why can't you just
fly to China?

638
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,288
I think it's better
the less you know.

639
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,190
I just hate
that stupid boat.

640
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:01,793
Look at me.

641
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:04,829
I love you.

642
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,197
Everything's gonna be fine.

643
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,532
Ok.

644
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,501
Hey.

645
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,670
Got room for one more?

646
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,038
No.

647
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,723
Mom, let me keep dad company.

648
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:16,891
Oliver, you're in school.

649
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,209
Not really.

650
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:20,511
I tried to tell you that.

651
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,214
I could use an extra hand
on the ship.

652
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:24,381
Robert...

653
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,350
Moira, let the kid

654
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,187
take the boat out
with the old man.

655
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,889
All right.

656
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:33,274
All right.
But you promise me

657
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,725
that you'll behave yourself.

658
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:36,410
All right. I promise.

659
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,831
I love you so much.

660
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,199
I love you, too.

I totally spaced.

663
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,372
I gotta call Tommy
and let him know

664
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,124
I'm out of town
for a few weeks.

665
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:53,010
I'll see you on board in 5.

666
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:59,267
Sara? You here?

667
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:03,187
Yeah, you might want to circle
around the block a few times,

668
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:05,256
because your sister
just showed up.

669
00:37:06,775 --> 00:37:10,695
Hi. What are you doing here?

670
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:11,929
You're leaving
for 3 weeks.

671
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:15,432
I wanted to come say bye
to you in person.

672
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,605
I'm glad you did.

673
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,991
And...

674
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,110
I wanted to bring you
something.

675
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:29,831
Oh.

676
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,718
In case you get
lonely at sea.

677
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:41,058
Thank you.

678
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,629
Hey, is everything ok?

679
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,565
I mean, I didn't totally
freak you out

680
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,818
when I brought up the whole
apartment thing earlier, did I?

681
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,987
No.

682
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,638
Good.

683
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,806
No.

684
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:57,474

Yeah.

00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,091
Is it done?

690
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:17,795
Yes. The bomb
is in place.

691
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,597
And there's
a storm front

692
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,683
moving in along the "Gambit's"
projected course.

Ok.

694
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,054
When the "Queen's Gambit"
goes down,

695

no one will suspect it's anything
other than an act of God.

Oliver.

697

Ah. What a miracle.

698
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,499
How's Walter?

699
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:59,470
The police are saying that he
was rescued by the Vigilante.

700
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:01,038
Yes, he was.

701
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,706
Has he said anything
about his ordeal?

702
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,843
Was he able to identify
any of his captors?

703
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,061
No.

704
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:08,379
Hmm.

705
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:11,148
That's too bad.

706
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,684
They'll get
what's coming to them.

707
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,889
I'm just glad that
my family is back together.

708
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:21,158
We all are.

709
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,061
Ollie.

710
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:26,914
Excuse me.

711
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,371
Is Walter ok?

712
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,673
I saw it on the news.

713
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:37,325
Yeah.

714
00:39:38,894 --> 00:39:40,344
Are you ok?

715
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,079
Of course.

716
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:45,599
I promise you
now is not the time.

717
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:47,918
It's you and Tommy.

718
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,353
You and me, actually.

719
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:50,754
I talked to Tommy yesterday,

720
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,556
and the reason
he broke up with me

721
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,776
is because he thinks that you
and I still belong together.

722
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,194
What did you say?

723
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:58,896
Nothing.

724
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:01,198
He walked out on me.

725
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:07,154
I just want you
to be happy.

726
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,657
It's what
I've always wanted.

727
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:13,610
Then will you please
go talk to Tommy for me?

728
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:14,996
And say what?

729
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,613
Say that you and I
are over.

730
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:20,251
That you're not
still in love with me.

731
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:22,786
I can't do that.

732
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,689
Why not?

733
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:28,792
Because it wouldn't be true.

734
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,065
And I have enough lies
in my life already.

735
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,669
I guess you do know
where I live.

736
00:40:55,671 --> 00:40:57,421
I've always known
where you live.

737
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,758
May I?

738
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,517
I'm sorry.

739
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,190
You were right.

740
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:18,359
And I was wrong.

741
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:19,727
About Deadshot?

742
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,545
About everything.

743
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:25,516
About my mother and about her
involvement in the Undertaking.

744
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,519
She lied to me.

745
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,321
To Thea.

746
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:35,543
She's working with
Malcolm Merlyn.

747
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:45,035
They're planning something.

748
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:47,704
Something...

749
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,723
Terrible.

750
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:52,543
I don't know what yet.

751
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:58,048
But I just know one thing.

752
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,819
I need your help to stop them.
