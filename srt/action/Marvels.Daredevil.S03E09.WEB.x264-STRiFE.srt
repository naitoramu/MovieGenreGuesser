1
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,920
That's $80.
Unless you want to go double or nothing.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,240
- You hustling me, grandpa?
- You tell me.

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,920
Did you know, Father?

4
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,800
Matthew? What are you doing here?

5
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,350
Did you know she was my mother?

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Yeah.

7
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,940
You knew.

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,900
I couldn't tell you.

9
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,160
Even when I wanted to.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Don't hide behind your collar, Father.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,490
- Wait. You're a priest?
- Take your money and go.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm not hiding, Matthew.

13
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,000
- I'm right here.
- You...

14
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,010
of all people...

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,550
All those times
I looked to you for guidance.

16
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,390
You saw me struggling...

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,060
and you chose to hide the one thing
that could have changed everything for me.

18
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,400
Please, Father, help me understand
why you would do that.

19
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,580
I prayed for Maggie to find it in herself
to tell you years ago.

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,330
She couldn't find it in herself
to walk nine blocks to visit me as a kid.

21
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,000
Or to comfort me when my father
was murdered and I thought that...

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,930
I knew that I was alone in this world.

23
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,550
- You were never alone...
- Yes, I was!

24
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,010
And you let me believe it.

25
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,640
Yes. Yes, we did.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Why?

27
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,200
- What did Maggie say?
- I'm asking you.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,410
Maggie's a good person, Matthew.

29
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,330
Flawed, like us all.

30
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,910
And tortured over decisions she's made.

31
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,380
But she dedicated her life
to making amends.

32
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,630
You still haven't answered the question.

33
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,880
Growing up without your parents, Matthew,

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,890
you don't grow to see them as people.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,930
You need to understand that...

36
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,600
to understand her.

37
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,740
- We should go. This was a stupid idea.
- Definitely.

38
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,530
No, we're here.
Let's just give it a minute.

39
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,500
Three weeks from now,
we're not going anywhere anymore.

40
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,090
- True.
- Just a minute.

41
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,970
- Hey.
- Me?

42
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,560
Yeah, you. Can you give me a hand up here?

43
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,730
- No, I can't.
- Yeah, you got to.

44
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,860
Come on, it's only gonna take me
60 seconds to put this asshole down.

45
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,240
Three minutes, tops.

46
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,360
- Okay, now is a good time to leave.
- Yes, it is. Let's go.

47
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,950
What do you need me to do?

48
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,160
Nothing much.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,910
Just gotta give me some water,
maybe wipe off my face, like that.

50
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,290
Come on.

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,870
Maggie, obedience, poverty...

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Chastity.

53
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,880
You ever done this before?
You got brothers or something?

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
No. Never seen a fight before, either.

55
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,050
Shit.

56
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,690
Then why'd you pick me to come up here?

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,470
I just figured a nun
wouldn't put something in my bottle.

58
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,550
It's gonna be all right.

59
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,760
You just gotta put my mouth guard
in my teeth at the start of the rounds.

60
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,020
Maybe give me
some water between rounds, too.

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,060
I thought you said
you only needed 60 seconds.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,560
Yeah. Well, it's just a backup plan.
You never know.

63
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,550
Water.

64
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,210
Yeah, come on. I only got a minute.

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,880
- Can you get that?
- Get that?

66
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,300
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,650
Maggie, what is wrong with you?

68
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
Maggie?

69
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Maggie.

70
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,470
Maggie.

71
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,000
Damn, I don't know
what I should've done.

72
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,210
I guess that's not really true.

73
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,760
You know, when I heard Maggie
call me her son,

74
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,640
my thought was... my first thought...
was how stupid I'd been.

75
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,140
That it had been right in front of me
for so long.

76
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,110
And then I remembered that it had been
in front of you for even longer.

77
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,070
From... From the beginning.

78
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,580
We've talked so much about truth...

79
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,160
you and I.

80
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,580
Of my truth, God's truth.

81
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,760
Now it seems like all those conversations
were just a goddamned lie.

82
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,520
Shame on you.

83
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,650
We couldn't do this at the office?
We had to come all the way out here?

84
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,280
Once I explain everything to you
and the SAC, you'll understand, sir.

85
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,740
Shit, I better.

86
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,170
- Sorry about this, boss.
- Come in, guys.

87
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,710
Mom?

88
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,130
- Where did you put them?
- Give me a sec?

89
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,510
Like you'd understand.

90
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,220
I understand, Allison. I just don't care.
Now, move it.

91
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,350
- Make sure your dad signs those papers.
- I know. I know. Bye, Mom.

92
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,820
At least she talks to you.

93
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,820
I can't pry my girls
away from their phones.

94
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,700
You say that like it's a bad thing.

95
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,570
Sorry about the mess.

96
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,160
My contractor promised
he would be done months ago.

97
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,120
- How do you take it?
- Black is fine, thanks.

98
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,160
Uh, none for me.

99
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,540
Thanks.

100
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,970
Interview with Special Agent Rahul Nadeem
and Special Agent in Charge Tammy Hattley,

101
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,810
conducted
by Supervisory Special Agent Winn,

102
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,360
FBI Office of Professional Responsibility.

103
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,610
Okay, Ray. You've got our attention.

104
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,530
What's this about?

105
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,620
There's no good way for me to say this.

106
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,000
But I believe Wilson Fisk is currently
engaged in a criminal conspiracy

107
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,090
and has manipulated the bureau
into becoming his unwitting accomplice.

108
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,970
I also have reason to believe that Fisk
has corrupted an agent on his detail.

109
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,050
Who?

110
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,720
Dex.

111
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,930
You're referring
to Special Agent Ben Poindexter?

112
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,270
Yes, sir. And as crazy as it sounds,

113
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,980
I think Poindexter may have perpetrated
the attack at the Bulletin.

114
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,650
What the hell are you talking about?
Why would you think that?

115
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,870
Because while I was pursuing
those suspicions yesterday...

116
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,660
Dex shot me.

117
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,790
Jesus Christ.

118
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,090
Sir, OPR needs to start
an internal investigation into Fisk,

119
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,050
into Poindexter, into all of it.

120
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,590
And for the record...

121
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,640
this was on my watch.

122
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,600
I personally ran Fisk's detail.

123
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,600
SAC Hattley did everything by the book,
and this shouldn't fall on her.

124
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,150
I take full responsibility.

125
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,070
Ray, I'm sorry, but I'm placing you
on administrative leave,

126
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,280
effective immediately.

127
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,370
I understand.

128
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,500
And will cooperate fully.

129
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,350
So...

130
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,520
what do we do next?

131
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,320
First, we call you an ambulance.

132
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
No!

133
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,830
Ray! Put down the gun! Please!

134
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,460
Damn you, Ray.
You bring this into my house?

135
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,210
My home?

136
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Sit down.

137
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,930
Sit.

138
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,360
Your prints, your weapon, the recording.

139
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,740
Do I need to explain to you
what this means?

140
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,990
Answer my question, please.
Do you understand your situation now?

141
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,410
Ray?

142
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,330
You get this?

143
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,720
Yeah, boss.

144
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
I understand.

145
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,760
I'm not your boss anymore.

146
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,270
Wilson Fisk is.

147
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,230
You don't have to run.
Hiding is an option.

148
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,980
I'm not so sure it is, Foggy.
Not after what I said to Fisk.

149
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,730
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

150
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,530
But I wouldn't bother paying the rent
like we did for Matt.

151
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,650
Come on. You'll be back.

152
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,570
Foggy,
Fisk is never gonna stop hunting me.

153
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,530
Then don't run or hide. Do what I did.

154
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,950
Make yourself so public
he can't touch you.

155
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Yeah, well, it's not gonna matter, Foggy.

156
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,080
My DA campaign's kept me out
of his crosshairs so far.

157
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,670
Yeah, well, you didn't confess
to killing his BFF, so...

158
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,460
Valid point.

159
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,550
- But maybe...
- Look, Foggy. I'm running.

160
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,220
Right after I tell Matt
I completely betrayed him.

161
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,230
Come on.

162
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,730
You didn't betray him.

163
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,940
Fisk knows that Matt is Daredevil
because of me.

164
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,490
He can't actually know that for sure.
You didn't say anything.

165
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,070
No, you weren't there. He, uh...

166
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,240
The way he looked at me...

167
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,910
He knows.

168
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,670
Just, uh, destroy these for me?

169
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,550
- No, Foggy...
- Please take it.

170
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Thank you.

171
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,600
I should go.

172
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,990
We're gonna get through this.
I don't know how, but we will.

173
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,830
Watch your back. Please.

174
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,300
Change can be scary, Marcus.

175
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,810
Even when it's for the good.

176
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,230
No, it's not.

177
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Oh...

178
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,530
You know,
the Dockerys are a wonderful family,

179
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,360
and now you get to be a part of it.

180
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,870
But you will always be
a part of our family, too.

181
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,910
Maggie.

182
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,630
What is it, Paul?

183
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,380
Matthew knows.

184
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,110
Oh...

185
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,550
I guess you know
everything now, Matty.

186
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,640
Everything I need to.

187
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,770
Meh. Doesn't change a goddamn thing.

188
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,030
- Ray?
- Yeah?

189
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,990
You have a visitor from work.

190
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,750
My hand's not big enough.

191
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,170
Sure it is. Look.

192
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,880
Just keep your fingers like that,
hugging the seam,

193
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,590
and just snap your wrist
when you release it.

194
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,220
And that makes it curve?

195
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,050
Like crazy.

196
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,180
There he is. Morning, Ray.

197
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,850
Dad, he's teaching me
how to throw a curveball.

198
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,520
You want eggs?

199
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,190
Uh, no, thanks.

200
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,440
- Go get ready for school, Sami.
- But, Dad...

201
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,860
School first, kid.

202
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Okay.

203
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,610
This is cool. Thanks, Mr. Poindexter.

204
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,030
Call me Dex. Your dad and me go way back.

205
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,420
So, Dex, what brings you to my house?

206
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,420
Well, you've been bragging
about Seema's cooking for so long,

207
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,800
I figured I'd come up with an excuse
to finally come try it.

208
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,930
You don't need an excuse, Dex.
What you've done for our family...

209
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,970
...you're always welcome here.

210
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,560
Honey, we're gonna talk shop.

211
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,230
Oh. Okay. But only for a few minutes.
I don't want Dex's eggs getting cold.

212
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,660
What are you doing here, Dex?
Your issue is with me, not my family.

213
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,750
My issue is definitely with you.

214
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,420
That stunt with the lawyer, Ray?
That was cold.

215
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,510
You convinced me that you had my back.

216
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,220
But Fisk wants you alive.

217
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,430
What does he want from me, Dex?

218
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,150
Your friend.
The one you brought to my home.

219
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,980
I don't know who he is. Or where he is.

220
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,610
Yeah, you do.

221
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,110
But it can wait.

222
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,990
You're bleeding, Ray.

223
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,290
I'll cover with Seema
while you change your shirt.

224
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,590
Now, let's go.
We're spending the day together, partner.

225
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,260
It smells delicious.

226
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,470
Taste as good as it looks?

227
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,180
Shit.

228
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,770
I have a super for that.

229
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,020
I can fix this, damn it.

230
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,650
- You okay?
- Peachy.

231
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,660
Karen and Matt can do whatever they want.
I'm not gonna run.

232
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,160
You can't quit now.
You're giving people hope.

233
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,120
Mrs. Wobschall stopped me
in the produce aisle.

234
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,790
At first, I didn't believe her,

235
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,710
but then she showed me
a clip on her iPhone.

236
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,460
You were a natural. Totally amazing.

237
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,840
What are you talking about?

238
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,840
Because when you get
beyond the cold facts,

239
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,300
and you really get worked up
about what you're doing, you can...

240
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,930
Holy shit.

241
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,650
We've got to work
on your closing,

242
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,930
but this video has had nearly
100,000 views in its first 24 hours.

243
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,690
Half the cops in New York have reposted it
to their personal accounts.

244
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,190
Has Blake Tower responded?

245
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,190
Complete radio silence.

246
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,230
Probably because you've successfully
branded him as the pro-Fisk candidate

247
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
and anything he says
will only make it worse.

248
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,490
- Wow.
- Foggy, if you play this right...

249
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,280
I could actually win.

250
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:22,250
And as the new DA, you make it
your top priority to nail Wilson Fisk.

251
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,170
I don't have much time.
Fisk is doing something.

252
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,630
Specifics, Ray.

253
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,390
I don't know what.
But when I do, I'll call you.

254
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,100
Be ready.

255
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,600
It's done.

256
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,600
Nice work, partner.

257
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,490
It's a shitty way for you to find out,
Matty, about your mother.

258
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,080
Yeah. You should have told me.

259
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,250
Maybe I promised her
that I wouldn't.

260
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,000
That is no excuse.

261
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,670
Yeah, I know, kid.

262
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,250
But after I took that bullet,

263
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,880
Maggie had years to tell you the truth
and she didn't.

264
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
That wasn't my choice, it was hers.

265
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,550
You both lied. You both left.

266
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
I never left you.

267
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,310
You didn't go down in that fight
like you were supposed to.

268
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,980
Knowing they'd kill you for it.

269
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,730
I did that for you.

270
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,900
So you'd know
what your old man is made of.

271
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,230
My old man chose his ego over a lifetime
with his son. That's what I know.

272
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,320
It wasn't ego,
it was living up to a code.

273
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,910
Being a man.

274
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,830
It means lovin' the feel of my fist
in someone else's face.

275
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,540
It means waiting for them
to hit the ground

276
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,420
and knowing that I put them there.

277
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,540
And, yeah, okay...

278
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,670
maybe I put that at the top of my list
and maybe it cost me everything,

279
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,880
including you.

280
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,930
But you do the same thing.

281
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,310
No, I don't.

282
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,640
You have a code, too.
You beat the shit out of people.

283
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,310
You tell yourself it's okay
because you didn't kill anyone.

284
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,780
There is something wrong with us, Matty.
It's just who we are.

285
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,740
That's who you were, Dad.

286
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,410
I'm not like you.

287
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,370
I don't throw fights.

288
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,500
And I don't let everyone else suffer
'cause of some bullshit code.

289
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,790
Not anymore.

290
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,090
When I get to Fisk...

291
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,380
I'm gonna kill him.

292
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,780
- Sister Maggie... Sister Maggie?
- Devin.

293
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,790
Excuse me, Sister Maggie?

294
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,130
I'm sorry to bother you.
They told me I could find you here.

295
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,960
He's gone. I don't know where.

296
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,260
It's a matter of life and death.
Do you have any idea when he'll be back?

297
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,720
He won't be.

298
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,310
I...

299
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,150
I don't understand. Why? Why not?

300
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,530
He learned the truth.

301
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,490
That I'm his mother.

302
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,240
Wow. Uh...

303
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,670
He never talked about... about you.

304
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,880
I was a danger to Matthew
when I gave him up.

305
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,390
Nowadays, they know a great deal
about postpartum, but...

306
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,390
at the time...

307
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,850
I was convinced that I was betraying God.

308
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,610
I hadn't yet
taken my vows, but in my heart...

309
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,070
I believed I had committed
an unforgivable sin.

310
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,330
And so I replaced that sin with another.

311
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,410
I abandoned my child.

312
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,250
Why... Why did you tell him now?

313
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,090
I didn't. He found out on his own.

314
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,760
I wanted to tell him.

315
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:49,100
When Jack was alive, I convinced myself
the truth would confuse Matthew.

316
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,850
After Jack died, I convinced myself
it would do more harm than good.

317
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,610
Finally, I just realized
that I was too much of a coward.

318
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,490
The Lord has a way.

319
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,540
Sending the Devil of Hell's Kitchen
to me now.

320
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,130
Showing me what became of my sin.

321
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,920
The Lord gave me another chance
to make things right.

322
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,010
And I failed, yet again.

323
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,510
Matthew knows who and what I am now.

324
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,430
He won't be back.

325
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,450
I'm sorry.
It's unfair of me to burden you.

326
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,200
I just... I don't...

327
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,950
I don't know what to say.

328
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,500
What can you say to someone
who's scarred your friend for life?

329
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,970
He must be in a lot of pain right now.

330
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,390
When you find him, he'll need a friend.

331
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,980
That's just it.
See, I can't really stick around.

332
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,140
Um...

333
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:23,940
Fisk knows... about Matt. I just...
I just wanted to warn him before I run.

334
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,780
- Are you in danger?
- Yeah.

335
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,530
Matt's not the only one
that Fisk wants dead.

336
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,410
Do you have someplace to go?

337
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,790
No, I was just gonna get
the first bus out of town.

338
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,460
I can help you.

339
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,300
Uh, yeah, no, you don't want me anywhere
near you right now. Trust me.

340
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,880
The church has been helping people hide
for 2,000 years.

341
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,430
Hide here.

342
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,430
Give me a day to make a few calls,

343
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,480
and you'll have shelter halfway
around the world by the end of the week.

344
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,480
Please, let me do something for you.

345
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,900
For Matthew.

346
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,030
Yeah.

347
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,470
Everybody,
I have an announcement.

348
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,390
And some good news after a shitty week.

349
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,050
I'm happy to tell you that

350
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,180
Special Agent Poindexter
has been reinstated to duty.

351
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,230
Turns out even DC can't hold
good deeds against someone forever.

352
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
Seriously, people...

353
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,190
the way you came together
and helped Dex hire that lawyer...

354
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
I'm proud of you.

355
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,990
If we don't look out for each other,
who will?

356
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,080
You got anything to say, Dex?

357
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,370
Uh...

358
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,330
I guess I just wanna say thank you.

359
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,670
I wouldn't be here without your help.

360
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,340
Especially you, Ray.

361
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,090
Someday, I'll pay you back
for everything you did.

362
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,060
You look good, Franklin.

363
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,390
I'm still passionate
about what the law can do.

364
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,810
Maybe a haircut next time, though.

365
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,980
He's making quite the name for himself.

366
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,940
Theo, you gotta see this movie
your brother's in.

367
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,240
Let me fix you a plate, sweetie.
Come here.

368
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,030
Hold on, Ma.
I need a couple minutes with Foggy.

369
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,450
I'll be quick.

370
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,580
Don't worry about her, Foggy.
She'll be fine.

371
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,960
So, Marci, have you considered
freezing your eggs?

372
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,960
- It's never too late.
- Anna!

373
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,880
This better be important.

374
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,090
All that stuff you said about Fisk
on the video, you gotta take it back.

375
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,140
- What are you talking about?
- You have to make a different video, man.

376
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,810
Issue a statement or whatever.
Say you were drunk.

377
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,390
Au contraire, mon frère.

378
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,310
That's the last thing I gotta do.

379
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,440
I gotta exploit this opportunity
to expose everything Fisk is doing.

380
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,360
No, no, no. Foggy, listen to me.
You need to apologize.

381
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,030
What happened?
Did someone come after you, Theo?

382
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,330
Fog, it's real bad.

383
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,870
About a year ago, some of our suppliers
stopped taking our orders.

384
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,580
Just stopped.
No reason I could understand.

385
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,290
We couldn't change their minds
for the love of money.

386
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,050
After a few months, the shop
was in a tight spot financially, right?

387
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,340
And we didn't have the collateral
to get a loan...

388
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,800
Why didn't you come to me?
I could have helped.

389
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,140
I didn't have to,
because of what happened next.

390
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,060
Out of the blue, I get this call
from a bank I never heard of

391
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,980
offering to help us out. Red Lion Bank.

392
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,230
- Shit.
- You know these guys?

393
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,730
Just keep going.

394
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,570
So, the loan officer there,

395
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,570
he coaches me
on how to move the numbers around.

396
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,240
Make our assets look healthier, you know.

397
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,950
And bam!
The loan comes through without a hitch.

398
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,580
I don't give it another thought.
Life goes on.

399
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,670
I mean,
we've been through a lot around here.

400
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,290
And the old suppliers came back.

401
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,170
Yeah. Yeah, they did,
now you mention it.

402
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,340
And then someone came to talk to you?

403
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:19,010
This afternoon, yeah.
This old English dude comes to see me.

404
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,970
He knew all about the creative accounting
on the loan app.

405
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,560
He said unless I could convince you

406
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,110
to walk back everything
you said about Fisk...

407
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,820
he'd have Red Lion call the loan.

408
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,190
Of course.

409
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,160
Foggy, that application...

410
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,580
if anyone looks too carefully at it...

411
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,200
You're going to jail.

412
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,580
Not just me.

413
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,080
Mom and Dad signed it, too.

414
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,550
We have a new teammate today.

415
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,520
Take a seat, Ray.

416
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,900
I don't believe it.
Fisk's got something on all of you?

417
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,990
Arinori?

418
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,830
Better we don't talk about it.
And in here, we don't even say his name.

419
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,170
That's one of the rules, Ray.
We only refer to him by his code name.

420
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,010
What code name?

421
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,890
Kingpin.

422
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Another roundup, gentlemen.
And we're going to hit them fast and hard.

423
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,560
Kingpin wants this one to make a point.

424
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,240
FBI! Don't move!

425
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,150
Shit. It's the feds!

426
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,160
Down on the ground, now!

427
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,580
- Stay where you are.
- No.

428
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,960
John Hammer, you're coming with us.

429
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,310
Good morning, Mr. Starr.

430
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,240
I got this one.

431
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,880
Please come quietly.

432
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,100
- Shift change, guys.
- We just came on an hour ago.

433
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,810
Hattley's orders.

434
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,360
I think she's punishing me
for getting off suspension so fast.

435
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,480
And thanks for bringing me
along for the ride.

436
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,650
She's the boss.

437
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,330
See you later.

438
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,300
So what was it? Money?

439
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,510
I've known you for ten years,
for Chrissakes.

440
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,010
Shut your goddamn mouth.

441
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,850
Or what?
You'll frame me for another murder?

442
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,890
Keep your head forward.

443
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,810
There's no mics in here,
but you know they're watching.

444
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,230
You murdered Winn.
How do you live with that?

445
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,990
I killed him to save your life.

446
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,570
That's right. This is on you.

447
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,700
I didn't tell you
to break into Dex's apartment.

448
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,910
I would've stopped you,
and you wouldn't be here.

449
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,750
But here you are.

450
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,340
I can't believe you want this.

451
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,800
We made this happen.
We can find a way to end it.

452
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,010
There's no way out, Ray.

453
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,890
Fisk's had you marked
for more than a year.

454
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,810
What do you mean, had me marked?

455
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,230
Why do you think your sister-in-law
lost health coverage?

456
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,360
He made you desperate for this job,

457
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,600
you did everything you could
to get him this penthouse,

458
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,030
get him everything he asked for.

459
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,580
Like I said, there's no way out.

460
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,660
We're out of our league here.

461
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,380
You could've gone to Homeland Security
or the NYPD.

462
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,840
Not take me down with you.
Not murder an agent.

463
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,890
You make a report.
You get your family somewhere safe. Jesus.

464
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,560
That's not an option with Fisk.

465
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,810
I used to have two children, Ray.

466
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,110
They made it look like a hit-and-run.

467
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,320
I got a divorce.
Maybe that keeps him a little safer.

468
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,820
But there's still Allie, so...

469
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,660
Think about Seema and Sami.

470
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,080
And do what Fisk tells you.

471
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,300
- Where is Mrs. Shelby?
- She's on her way, sir.

472
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,640
No.

473
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,140
Nadeem.

474
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,590
Let's go.

475
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,190
- Yeah?
- Fisk has left the hotel.

476
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,570
How is that possible?

477
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,700
I don't think Dex
was the only FBI agent he turned.

478
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,910
But he's taking Fisk
to meet with other crime bosses.

479
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,420
- Some kind of sit-down.
- Where?

480
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,380
I'm texting you the address.
But if you catch Fisk in the act...

481
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:53,340
This is our chance to take him down.
Thank you, Nadeem.

482
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,680
We'll meet you inside, Nadeem.

483
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,980
What do you want me to do?

484
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,690
Be ready.

485
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,820
Daredevil will know it's a trap,
but he'll come anyway.

486
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,880
Red Fish Blue Restaurant,

487
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,750
48th Street and 9th Avenue.

488
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,670
You're not fallin' for that,
are you?

489
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,050
That guy, he ain't in your corner.
Not anymore.

490
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,010
That doesn't matter.

491
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,810
It's been a long time
since you used Muay Thai ropes, Matty.

492
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,310
That guy in my suit kicked my ass.
I can't beat him from a distance.

493
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,730
I gotta draw him in close
and do more damage.

494
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,110
You're too mad to think straight.
And it's gonna get you killed.

495
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,740
Matty, come on.

496
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,910
Your mother didn't only leave you.
She left me, too.

497
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:09,000
You looking for sympathy?
'Cause that's not happening.

498
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,920
She left us because we're cursed.

499
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,260
Because she knew we got the devil inside.

500
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,470
So it's my fault?

501
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,350
Would you be honest with yourself?

502
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,230
You put on that mask because it lets you
feel all right with who you really are.

503
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:32,860
It lets you hurt people and makes you
feel like it's for something important...

504
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,360
...something good,
maybe even for God.

505
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,450
But that ain't the truth,
and we both know it.

506
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,410
You and your father
are cut from the same cloth.

507
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,710
A corrupt boxer who takes
as much satisfaction in inflicting pain

508
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,080
as he does money for taking dives.

509
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,630
And his son,

510
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,920
who's trying to convince himself
he's any better than his criminal father.

511
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,510
You were born from nothing.

512
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,930
You remain nothing.

513
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,810
- Arrest me, or I'm leaving.
- Stay where you are.

514
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,440
We have a right to counsel.

515
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,150
This some bullshit.
What are we waiting for?

516
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,690
We'll know when it happens.

517
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,040
You know something about what's going on?

518
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:04,240
Well, they pick us up all quiet like.
No press, no perp walk.

519
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,200
Take us here instead of downtown.
The feds want something.

520
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,020
- Fisk?
- What the hell is this?

521
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,610
It's an opportunity, Mr. Starr.

522
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:26,870
I've brought you here
to offer you my protection.

523
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:33,410
From investigations and prosecutions
by the federal government.

524
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,880
Bullshit. This is a sting.

525
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,090
Hey, jury, if you can hear this
on tape, I'm totally innocent.

526
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,050
I don't even know these people.

527
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,010
How much? What's the vig?

528
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,680
- Twenty percent.
- For Chrissake.

529
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,770
Of everything.

530
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,610
I don't know how you keep that suit white
with all the bullshit you pack into it.

531
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,320
I know what this is.
We all know what this is.

532
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,990
You want us to confess to something
that buys you another month

533
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,990
in that hotel suite
you conned yourself into.

534
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,370
No. You can count me out.

535
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,730
The tax is now 25 percent.

536
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,900
I gotta hand it to you, Fisk.
You know how to put on a show.

537
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,070
Just one question.
Where do I drop the cash?

538
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,370
If you tipped him...

539
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,080
I said exactly what you told me to say.

540
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,700
You were there.

541
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
Let's go.

542
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,440
Moving to Stairwell C.
Weapons out.

543
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,910
Are you gonna kill me?

544
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,290
No.

545
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,880
Not you.

546
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,000
Fisk?

547
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,050
Oh, thank God.

548
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,220
When will he be back?

549
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,480
Minutes.

550
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,240
Thank you.

551
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,030
Karen Page
located at the Clinton Church.

552
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:46,240
Keep all NYPD units clear of that location
until otherwise advised. Copy?

553
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,700
What does Fisk want with Karen?

554
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,710
He wants her killed.
