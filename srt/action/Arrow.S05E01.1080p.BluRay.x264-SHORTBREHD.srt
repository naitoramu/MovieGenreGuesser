1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,549
<i>Last season, on Arrow... </i>

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:07,012
I convinced you that we can have it all.
I was wrong.

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,972
We have to let each other go.

4
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,855
I have a village, too. Run by
a government strongman named Kovar.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:16,643
You'll go back to Russia,
and you can take on this Kovar.

6
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,106
What are you gonna do now, Oliver?

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,317
I know you wouldn't approve of what I did.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,610
<i>But you were always
better than me, Laurel.</i>

9
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,871
<i>That is what I loved most about you.</i>

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,664
<i>I thought about Laurel
and what she'd say.</i>

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,286
<i>I think she'd tell me to get out.</i>

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,868
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,129
<i>Take some time
away from this team,</i>

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,339
<i>away from the city.</i>

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,134
<i>I, Oliver Queen, do solemnly swear
to faithfully</i>

16
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,301
and impartially perform and discharge
the duties of the office of mayor.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,150
- Your brother's late.
- "Late" is his "on time."

18
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,152
And he's not just my brother,
he's the Mayor.

19
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,905
Well, maybe someone should
remind him of that.

20
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,859
Is there something
I can help you with, Captain?

21
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,365
This evening is important, Miss Queen.

22
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,917
And it's supposed to be the kickoff
to the Anti-Crime Initiative.

23
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,835
And I don't think I need to tell you
how much this city...

24
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,836
City needs the A.C.l. Yes, I know
and so does he so he will be here.

25
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,718
He's just taking care
of a little business first.

26
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,298
Blonde or redhead?

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,014
Brunette actually.

28
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,922
I found the bomb.

29
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,804
No, no, no. That's not "a bomb,"
that's one, two, three, four bombs.

30
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,394
I'm in the brains.
It's gonna take a while to disarm.

31
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:29,067
- Do you think you can keep Machin busy?
- I don't think that'll be a problem.

32
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,751
Does this mean you're not gonna kill me?

33
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,249
What's a guy got to do
to get a little love?

34
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,049
I only tried blowing up the city.
I mean, half of it.

35
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,427
Sleep.

36
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,264
Tell SCPD I left a present for them.

37
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,470
Get away from that!

38
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,260
I'm disarming it.

39
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,807
It's handled. Overwatch?

40
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,190
Yeah. Oh, man,

41
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,400
that thing's just a really ugly piece
of modern art now.

42
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,484
Aw. You gonna make a new friend?

43
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,947
I thought I told you
to stay off the streets.

44
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,867
- It's my city, too.
- You wanna help?

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,034
Yeah.

46
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,329
Then make a donation
to the police department.

47
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,792
- And keep that elevated.
- Keep what elevated?

48
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,171
I don't want to see you out here again.

49
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,519
The Mayor will be making his official
statement on the Anti-Crime Initiative

50
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,437
at the ceremony honoring
the Black Canary, but...

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,482
But he can say a few words now.

52
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,652
The A.C.l. is an important step
towards lowering crime in the city,

53
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,196
but I'm not gonna consider it
without some major reform.

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
What type of reforms?

55
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,874
Uh, to start,
an investigation into allegations

56
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,034
of widespread corruption
within the police department.

57
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,125
Okay. Mayor Queen will elaborate
on all comments

58
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,915
at the ceremony honoring the Black Canary.

59
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,334
Thank you all very much.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,299
You realized you just
accused the police department

61
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,339
of being corrupt
at the police department gala?

62
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,552
I answered a question.

63
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,764
Yeah, and you also just put blame
on the police department

64
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,554
instead of taking responsibility
for the city's crime.

65
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,770
- You know I'm taking responsibility.
- Yeah. As the other guy.

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,937
But as the Mayor, it looks like
you're sleepwalking, okay?

67
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,198
Showing up late again
is not helping that perception.

68
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,156
Being the Mayor gives me access
to actionable intel as "the other guy."

69
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,037
It's a means to an end.

70
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,540
Well, it didn't start off
like that, Ollie.

71
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,043
You wanted to become
and then became the Mayor

72
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,081
- to actually be Mayor.
- Right. And then reality set in.

73
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,250
Even if we weren't dealing with
a corrupt police department, and we are,

74
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,794
or an electorate that thinks
I got all my political knowledge

75
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,008
by binge-watching The <i>West</i> Wing,

76
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,051
I still wouldn't be able to focus
on being the Mayor, Speedy.

77
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,720
Because I'm flying solo
as "the other guy."

78
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,059
Okay, nice try.

79
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,224
Talk to the comptroller
about tax incentives.

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,768
- And Councilman Garcia about sanitation.
- Mmm-hmm.

81
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,235
I also put the applications
for Deputy Mayor on your desk.

82
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,239
I'm gonna go drink.

83
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,729
What I do care about is what
you promised me if I won tonight.

84
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,942
None of yours.

85
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,902
What?

86
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,369
<i>Whose'?</i>

87
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,720
What are you two doing here?

88
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,511
- It's late.
- That's what I told her,

89
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,930
but she's been complaining
that the secondary processor

90
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,769
keeps overclocking the GPU cache.

91
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,276
It must be nice to have someone
down here who speaks Felicity.

92
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,688
Well, I'm strictly repair and maintenance.
You guys are the vigilantes.

93
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,528
Yeah, well, it's getting to be
an awfully big club.

94
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,036
- What's this?
- A little dossier on Wild Dog.

95
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,914
- "Wild Dog?"
- Yeah, you know, 'cause of his shirt.

96
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,791
"Silly Dog" just didn't really
have the same ring to it.

97
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,918
I suggested the "Wild."

98
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,546
Right. And why do I need a dossier on him?

99
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,628
So, I was thinking,
instead of putting an arrow in him,

100
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,919
you might consider
bringing him into the fold.

101
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,632
He shot him? You shot him?

102
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,218
Okay, I know it's not the most enticing
of recruitment pitch plans.

103
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,974
But there are plenty of candidates
willing to compensate

104
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,055
for our ineffectual-slash-corrupt
police department.

105
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:52,394
<i>Evelyn Sharp. Mr. Ski Goggles.
I'm still work-shopping that codename.</i>

106
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,149
I'm not...
I'm not putting together a new team.

107
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,777
Okay, well, in case you haven't noticed,
we're a little short-handed.

108
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,065
Just for a little while.
John will come back.

109
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,781
- Thea will come back.
- And if they don't?

110
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,414
Then I will handle it.
Get some sleep. Both of you.

111
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,709
SCPD! We have you surrounded.
Guns on the floor, now!

112
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,846
What is this? These aren't our guys.

113
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,432
No, they're Los Halcones.

114
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,685
See, they tried to rob you tonight.
A shoot-out ensued.

115
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,780
You killed them. They killed you.

116
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,863
Drop the bodies,
empty the cash into the van.

117
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:56,124
Bravo! Cleverness and efficiency.

118
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,709
Very Robin Hood.

119
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,467
But I doubt that
you'll be providing the poor

120
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:07,426
with any of these ill-gotten gains.
Enlighten me.

121
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,844
- I'm new in town.
- Kill this prig.

122
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,640
Note! Any attempt to "kill this prig"

123
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,729
will result in your swift demise.

124
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,744
- Are you the one in charge?
- Go to hell.

125
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,029
Oh...

126
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,911
I'll take that as a "yes."

127
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,375
Okay, gang-

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,687
He said he was in charge.
Anybody else want to be in charge?

129
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,987
No takers? Then I guess
it's gonna have to be me.

130
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,830
Six DOA's. The dealer and his girlfriend,
two Los Halcones and one of our own.

131
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,787
And who's lucky Number Six?
Keating.

132
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,874
COD doesn't match the other vics,
who were all shot at close range,

133
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,880
- but Keating...
- Blunt force trauma.

134
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,379
And these, what?
Some sort of calling card?

135
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,636
M.O. matches a skel named Tobias Church.

136
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,095
According to his jacket, he and his crew
tore up Hub City and Blüdhaven.

137
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,060
- And now he's here.
- Question is, what was Keating doing here?

138
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,064
Nothing good.
He didn't call anything in.

139
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,191
You think he's one of the bent cops?

140
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,942
It doesn't matter. He's dead now.

141
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,316
Well, Lance was a royal pain in the ass,

142
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,701
but at least he kept
his department in line.

143
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,864
Well, you could always give him
his badge back. He's back in town.

144
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,499
Though word has it he took a few bumps
off the wagon on his way.

145
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,427
All right, all right, all right.
All right.

146
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:19,017
Knockin', that's not like you.

147
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,146
Give us a minute.

148
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,277
- How long you been back in town?
- Uh, couple of weeks.

149
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,110
- Where's Donna?
- She's in Heaven.

150
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,166
It's a casino in Vegas that
she's waitressing at these days. Not...

151
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,921
- So you two aren't, uh...
- Oh, come on, Oliver.

152
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,209
- Opposites attract, but not that much.
- Did you break up before...

153
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,134
Well, you know,
not that it's any of your business.

154
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:58,052
But you see, a drunk needs a reason
to stay sober.

155
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,603
Fresh out, my friend.

156
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,394
Well, Quentin...

157
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,730
You know what? I don't know if you're in
a position to be judging me anyway.

158
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,654
It's just me out there.

159
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,491
Sometimes, saving the city
takes priority over running it.

160
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,582
But that'll change
when the team gets back together.

161
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,164
I can devote more time
to actually being the Mayor.

162
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,456
That team could include you.

163
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,714
Would I cover up
this beautiful face with a mask?

164
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,344
That's not what I meant.

165
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,339
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Oliver?

166
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,679
I got a pretty full day ahead.

167
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,473
You know about the ceremony?

168
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,027
The city's gonna honor Laurel.

169
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,859
Yeah.

170
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,324
It's probably best I don't turn up
and embarrass her memory, then.

171
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:24,100
You killed my best fighter.
You cost me lots of money.

172
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,523
Your Russian's terrible.

173
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,779
Your accent's American.

174
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,242
So,

175
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,784
what are you doing so far from home?

176
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:49,038
Adam Hunt. Daniel Brickwell.
Frank Bertinelli.

177
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,083
If I were you...
I'd put that back in my bag.

178
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,923
Jason Brodeur. Leo Mueller...

179
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,214
I said, put it back.

180
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,974
You know what?

181
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,386
This book, it intrigues me.

182
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,348
It's the only reason
you are still breathing.

183
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,780
It was my father's.
I'm waiting to use it.

184
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,606
Waiting for what?

185
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,820
To be ready.

186
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,782
Well, I have some bad news for you.

187
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,994
You're going to be dead before you are.

188
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,293
You must be lost. City Hall is that way.

189
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,004
Wanted to see
if you had info on our new player.

190
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,294
And you wonder why your approval rating
is in the basement.

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,589
- I don't wonder.
- How'd you ditch your security detail?

192
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:43,133
I used to ditch John Diggle.

193
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,640
Yeah. Tobias Church.

194
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,518
AKA "Charon."

195
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,776
The ferryman of Hades. Left gold coins on
the eyes on one of his victims last night.

196
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:54,977
Well, well, well...

197
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,737
I didn't fail every course
that I took in college.

198
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,612
Warrants out for his arrest
on no less than 20 murders

199
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,152
and those are just the ones
that they can connect him to.

200
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,158
Mr. Church just became our top priority.

201
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,539
"Our" is not going
to be enough for this guy.

202
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
Okay. Felicity...

203
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,664
Church runs with a crew.
And yours is not coming back.

204
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,712
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

205
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,420
It's called "not being in denial."
You really ought to give it a try.

206
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,587
Look, for the past five months,
you have been frozen in amber.

207
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,927
Waiting for things to go back
to the way things were, they're not.

208
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,721
You need to move forward.

209
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,224
Especially, with guys like this
coming into town.

210
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,273
Don't worry about him.
He's not gonna be staying very long.

211
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,731
Just find a way
for me to find him, please.

212
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,195
- Why isn't he at City Hall?
- That's a question I keep asking myself.

213
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,159
- What are you workin' on?
- If Oliver's asking,

214
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,541
- a location for our new baddie in town.
- And if he's not asking?

215
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,416
Got an address for this guy.
You mind checking him out for me?

216
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,206
I'm a happily married man, Felicity.

217
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,875
Just see what you can find out.
Like, if he's <i>loco</i> or anything.

218
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,215
We are callin' him the "Wild Dog."
Isn't that already settled?

219
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,630
- Please?
- No.

220
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,343
- Please.
- Okay. Fine.

221
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:13,148
Cities are like gen pop. First day in,
you find the biggest guy in the yard,

222
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,025
put him down. Hard. Sends a message.

223
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:20,030
"Screw not with me."
So here we all are.

224
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,737
Now who's the biggest guy in the yard?

225
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,453
It's highly unlikely that
he will just come out to play.

226
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,081
But it's like my younger brother
always said,

227
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,412
"Don't fish without bait."

228
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,420
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

229
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,584
With all that ails our city,
I think it's fair to ask

230
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,597
why we would spend time and money
to honor anyone.

231
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:50,723
Why we would commission a statue
and have a ceremony to unveil it.

232
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,606
Surely those resources
could be put to better ends.

233
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,811
But I for one think
there is no better end than a reminder

234
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:03,277
<i>of what we are capable of
when we stand together united.</i>

235
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,243
<i>A reminder of those
who have made the ultimate sacrifice</i>

236
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,449
<i>protecting our home.</i>

237
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,001
<i>And a reminder that as long as
we keep their spirit in our hearts,</i>

238
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,630
there will always be better days ahead.

239
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,920
And as she reminds us,

240
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,179
let us always remember her.

241
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,811
Ladies and gentlemen, Laurel Lance.
The Black Canary.

242
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,962
Whoa!

243
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,256
- Felicity.
- We saw it.

244
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,263
Why didn't Oliver fight back?
Sorry. Really dumb question.

245
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,175
- Yeah, well, can we track the van?
- No, they shut down traffic cameras.

246
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,891
And there're no satellites over the area.
We're blind.

247
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,057
Okay, well, if that SCPD van was legit,
then the police are gonna be no help.

248
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,565
Well, maybe this is a job for Speedy.

249
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,897
Can you suit up
and hit the streets for intel?

250
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,237
Can you maybe try to hack into
the police department

251
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,864
and see if there is any
internal chatter we can go on?

252
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,451
Gentlemen. And lady.

253
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,621
This is not personal.

254
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,872
I know it feels personal. But it is not.

255
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,960
You are all here as a means to an end.

256
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,086
I finally figured out a way
to make politicians useful.

257
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:32,095
You want the Green Arrow?

258
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,637
Ooh.

259
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,262
Your Honor.

260
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:44,275
Listen, the Green Arrow is not coming.
You're wasting your time.

261
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:49,690
Just for the fun of it, how is it that you
know so much about Mr. Arrow?

262
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,530
I have it on pretty good authority
that he's tied up right now.

263
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,031
- Are you his buddy?
- I have connections.

264
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,616
And I... Listen.

265
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,043
You let these people go,

266
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,289
and I'll make something happen.
Do we have a deal?

267
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,129
No, we most certainly do not.

268
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,794
I don't need your help, Mr. Mayor.

269
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,966
Do you think I would go to
all this trouble without a plan?

270
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,138
Yeah.

271
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,648
But that's because I think you're stupid.

272
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,362
Take Mr. Queen to a quieter place
and teach him some manners.

273
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,162
You almost shot my friend in the head.

274
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,827
Leave us.

275
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,342
My book!

276
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,516
Oliver Queen. My brother.

277
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,861
Anatoly. It is very good to see you.

278
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,731
What are you doin'?

279
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,073
Ahh!

280
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,449
I just dislocated thumbs. Useful if
getting tied to chair is to become habit.

281
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,704
- This is going to hurt little.
- Son of a bitch!

282
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,248
Yeah, with bit of practice
you can do yourself anytime.

283
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,508
Anatoly, can't you bring
a knife next time?

284
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,668
What is fun of that?

285
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,846
My old friend, I thought you dead!

286
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:42,803
Well, if you hadn't have shown up,
I probably would be.

287
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,143
It's good to see you, <i>tovarisch.</i>

288
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,774
What are you doing in Russia?

289
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,774
I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

290
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,951
If this is true, I did you no favor
by saving your life just now.

291
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,582
We got a twenty
on Oliver's location.

292
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,834
- Felicity and Curtis?
- Neither.

293
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,586
Felicity says it's probably the work of
a "Tobias Church."

294
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,592
And look, he's done his homework too
'cause he knows the Green Arrow is workin'

295
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,297
with someone who's tapped into
the city's security cameras of...

296
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,465
Okay, so, he's trying to call
the Green Arrow out.

297
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,931
Yeah, except he doesn't know
he's already got him. Cute, huh?

298
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,598
All right, well, you...
You need to go do something.

299
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,601
Well, that was...
That was gonna be my line to you.

300
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,442
For the first time in a...

301
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:41,111
A long time, I'm really starting
to feel like myself again.

302
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm not a killer,
I'm not a vigilante, lam...

303
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,869
I am a normal version of me.

304
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,713
And I think just after everything
that happened with Laurel...

305
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,465
I really needed to know
that life like this was even possible.

306
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,635
And now that I do,
I don't wanna give it up.

307
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,931
Yeah, yeah, I get
where you're coming from.

308
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,021
I do. I lost my job, I lost my...
I lost my daughter, I lost my girl,

309
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,656
and you know I just wanted to hit pause
on the world, you know?

310
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,073
- Yeah.
- But then I, uh...

311
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,488
You know, what?
I listened to Oliver's speech.

312
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,748
Well, you know, that's
when I realized that I, I can't do that.

313
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,751
I can't hit pause on it when I gotta
get on with my life, you know?

314
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,173
Even if that life
isn't what I want it to be.

315
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,019
I didn't vote for you.

316
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,432
That's okay. I ran unopposed.

317
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,361
"Mayor Handsome," they call you.

318
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,657
Not for long, though.

319
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,367
If you hit me again...

320
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,716
- I'm gonna kill you.
- You're delusional.

321
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,797
You're zipcuffed to that chair.

322
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,944
- Please, don't...
- I'm sorry. But nobody can know my secret.

323
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,871
<i>- I thought you retired.</i>
- Yeah, <i>me too.</i>

324
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,386
Speedy!

325
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,265
There are wires. They've been rigging
explosives to set up a kill cordon.

326
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,268
- A what?
- If we try to get down there

327
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,852
- we're gonna blow everything up.
- I can't just leave them there.

328
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,105
No!

329
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,283
We'll come back for them.

330
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,375
Felicity's already looking
for the power station blueprints.

331
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,536
Now, if we can get past
that kill cordon, we...

332
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:41,298
Then we can kill all of Church's men
instead of just those guys?

333
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,961
- Excuse me?
- I saw you break that guy's neck, Ollie.

334
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,256
You murdered him, okay. I thought
you weren't doing that anymore.

335
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,892
Maybe if I showed a little less restraint,
Laurel might still be alive.

336
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,304
Okay, you cannot keep hiding behind that.

337
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,019
And you know that's not
what she would have wanted.

338
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,651
You know, Thea, you told me
that the dead don't want anything.

339
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,564
Now, I could have killed Damien Darhk
before that night at Iron Heights.

340
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,326
I had multiple chances to do so.
And I didn't.

341
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,241
Because I thought
that taking the high road

342
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,657
was more important than saving lives.

343
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:19,420
And that is a mistake
that I will never ever make again.

344
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,673
I wouldn't call not killing people
a mistake, Ollie...

345
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,300
I would. Because when I did take
Darhk down for good,

346
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,009
I had to confront the fact
that Malcolm Merlyn was right.

347
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,684
Either I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary

348
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,682
or I shouldn't be out there at all.

349
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,851
Which is exactly why I can't be.
I won't ever again.

350
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,736
- Thea...
- No, no.

351
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,825
Ollie, lam sorry, but I wanna honor
Laurel just as much as you do.

352
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,704
Just not like this. And I don't care
what your reasons are,

353
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,366
putting killing back on the table
is a huge step backwards.

354
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,418
And I don't want anything to do with it.

355
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,713
- Sorry that you had to hear that.
- Hazard of the job. You okay?

356
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,382
I just... Seeing Thea in the suit, it made
me feel like everything was gonna

357
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,721
get back to normal.

358
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,227
Well, I'm running out of different ways
to tell you that it's not.

359
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:22,392
Hey. Look, being a vigilante
is not just putting on a mask

360
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,608
and thinking up a codename.
These people are amateurs, Felicity.

361
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,616
You really think that they're gonna
replace Dig or Thea or Laurel?

362
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,904
They couldn't do that if I wanted them to.
And I don't want them to.

363
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,290
They're already out there, Oliver.
Because of you.

364
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,918
- Inspired by you.
- After what happened with Laurel,

365
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,626
how can you ask me to put
more people in the crosshairs?

366
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,291
Lam not the one who is asking.

367
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,427
Or do you not remember the promise
that you made to Laurel before she died?

368
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,305
Laurel was thinking about the future.
You need to think about yours.

369
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,592
Right now, I need to think of ways
to stop Tobias Church.

370
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,806
- Oliver...
- So, you let me know

371
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,188
when you find a way around
the kill cordon.

372
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,400
Nothing ever simple with you,
Oliver Queen.

373
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,615
You survive Lian Yu, twice, you say.

374
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,781
And instead of going home,
you come to mine.

375
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,623
Well, I didn't know this was your town.
Or that you're a Bratva boss...

376
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,790
- <i>Avtoritet.</i> It's like a captain.
- Right.

377
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,216
- What business do you have with Kovar?
- It's a promise that I made.

378
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,631
What, that you'll kill him?
Or that you die trying?

379
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,720
'Cause second's much more likely.

380
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:41,558
Okay, Anatoly, you just need to tell me
if you can get me close to him.

381
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,436
Kovar has army. Government soldiers.

382
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,192
It's very dangerous.

383
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,029
You're sure you want to risk your life
for this promise?

384
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,200
- "The shark that does not swim, drowns."
- What does that mean?

385
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,249
I know real reason why you not go home.

386
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,206
You're not swimming.

387
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:14,595
This business with Kovar.
It's old promise. It's in past.

388
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,680
You need to move forward, my friend.
You need to move ahead. Move on.

389
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,686
All right. But the only way will kill you.

390
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,904
- Curtis?
- Okay.

391
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,316
This is the craziest
super-hero scavenger hunt

392
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,860
I have ever been on.
Not that I've ever been on any, but...

393
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,700
Wild Dog isn't a "super hero."
He's a vigilante.

394
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,365
You are really gonna have to explain
the distinction to me.

395
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,876
Either way, we'd have better luck
with an ad in the paper.

396
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,377
No one reads the classifieds anymore.

397
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,959
Why don't you just come on back,
and we'll figure out our next move.

398
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,374
You got it.

399
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,463
What do you want?

400
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,935
<i>Hey, this is John. Leave a message.</i>

401
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,351
Hey, John. Um...

402
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,400
I hope that everything's going well
over there.

403
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,070
Listen, no pressure, but give me
a call back when you get a chance. I...

404
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,494
I have a question and I figure
you'd probably have an answer.

405
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,450
Be well.

406
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,038
Lonely at the top, Mr. Mayor?

407
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,625
Actually, being the Mayor
isn't the job that's lonely.

408
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,249
- Thea?
- Thea's not coming back.

409
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,839
Neither is John.
There's a Russian proverb,

410
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,345
been thinking about it a lot recently.

411
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,855
"The shark that does not swim

412
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,945
"drowns."

413
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,948
You don't move forward, you die.

414
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:02,612
But listen, you will die if you try takin'
on this Tobias Church by yourself.

415
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,280
There's no more team, Quentin.

416
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,119
And I can't trust anyone
on the department.

417
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,122
Then don't. Just trust these guys.

418
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,129
Lieutenant Conahan.
I trained him back in the day.

419
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,965
The guy is so clean,
he doesn't even double park.

420
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,175
And he's vouched for each
of these officers.

421
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,217
- To do what?
- To help you

422
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,307
- whatever way we can.
- "We"?

423
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,227
Look, I don't know
any Russian proverbs, all right?

424
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,143
- But both of us have got to move on.
- Yeah.

425
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,362
Boy, I thought
that was gonna be a bigger fight.

426
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,239
That's what Laurel would've wanted.

427
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:46,326
After tonight,
I realize anything can happen,

428
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,660
which is why I need you to
make me a promise.

429
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,584
- Anything.
- Please...

430
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,597
Please don't let me be the last Canary.

431
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:08,557
That way, a part of me will always be
out there with you.

432
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,351
I promise.

433
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,162
There's nothin' out there.
Gonna grab a smoke.

434
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,658
We're in.

435
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,121
<i>Copy</i> that.

436
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,374
<i>I'm gonna disarm the bombs. Fisher'll take
the others and get the councilmen.</i>

437
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:39,713
All right, watch your back, all right?
I got you from here.

438
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,923
And where do they think "here" is,

439
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,179
- exactly?
- I forgot to mention that.

440
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,338
<i>I</i> am jealous.

441
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,221
<i>I've been trying to get Oliver
to work with a team for weeks now.</i>

442
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,894
- They're not a team.
- Well, you can look it up.

443
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,647
A team is, "a group of persons
associated with a joint action."

444
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,067
Duck.

445
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,909
Duck.

446
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,697
Goose.

447
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,413
That's more like it.

448
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,759
Hey! Don't worry!

449
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:34,976
After I kill you,
I will let the hostages go. I promise.

450
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,832
<i>Taking heavy fire.</i>

451
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,797
<i>- Fisher?
- I need backup.</i>

452
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,678
Conahan, Fisher's catching heat.
Can you assist?

453
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,554
<i>Negative.
We got a bigger problem.</i>

454
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,681
Church has wired the conductor.

455
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,764
The conductor is in the center of... If it
goes, the whole building's gonna blow.

456
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,600
<i>You have to get out of there.</i>

457
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,682
Not without Church.

458
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,816
The whole power plant is gonna go up.
There's nothing I can do to stop it.

459
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,191
Get them out of here.

460
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,984
- I'll disarm the cordon.
- I got it.

461
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,618
Overwatch!

462
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,917
Hostages are safe.
You have maybe five seconds.

463
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,229
Hey. Keep her flying.

464
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,261
Good morning.

465
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,226
I had intended to state my position
on the Anti-Crime Initiative

466
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,891
during the city's tribute
to the Black Canary

467
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,026
but that speech was cut short.

468
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,064
In the intervening days,
I have refined my position.

469
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,073
<i>Now, I have been reluctant
to embrace the A.C.l.</i>

470
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,736
<i>because of widespread corruption
within our police department.</i>

471
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,407
But these four officers have shown me
and the entire city

472
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,623
that there are still good men
and women in the SCPD.

473
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:06,165
Today, I'm announcing the formation
of the Anti-Crime Unit.

474
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,005
These four officers will report
directly to me.

475
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,303
And by working together,

476
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,466
we will begin the process
of saving our city.

477
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,229
Wanna thank you all for comin' out.

478
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,392
<i>Wanna thank you all
for deciding to hear my vision.</i>

479
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,653
The Green Arrow
cannot be stopped. Unless...

480
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:34,114
Unless we all work together.
Under a singular command.

481
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,951
- And I suppose that leader'd be you?
- You need someone from the outside.

482
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,961
I know this because it took me less than
12 hours to get inside your organizations.

483
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,125
All of them.

484
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,542
What's that mean? "Get inside"?

485
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,597
It means that, Mr. Bertinelli.

486
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,179
What are you still doing here?

487
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,939
Thought you'd be out celebrating
after your big win.

488
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,691
Well, it wasn't exactly a win.

489
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,319
You went from being the Do-Nothing Mayor
to the Rockstar Mayor

490
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,777
in under 24 hours.
I would say that that qualifies.

491
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,408
- Church is still out there.
- I'm not worried about that.

492
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,194
What with your new unit of super-cops

493
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,112
and the new team of vigilantes
you're gonna be recruiting,

494
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,498
Church is gonna see
the inside of a cell in no time.

495
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,200
- I see what you did there.
- What did I do?

496
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,869
You talked about the new team
like it's a done deal.

497
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,877
Oh, that. Well, I just thought,
since you decided to

498
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,670
"keep swimming" as mayor you might do
the same as Green Arrow.

499
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,838
You might be right.

500
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,350
Lance told me about the Russian proverb,
by the way. Very poetic. Wait,

501
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,436
did you just say I might be right?
Are you okay?

502
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,611
- Been looking into your guy.
- Wild Dog?

503
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,448
- Says here, his name is Rene Ramirez.
- Yeah, but "Wild Dog" is much scarier.

504
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,281
- So by "looking into," does that mean...
- I'm thinking of recruiting him.

505
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,070
- Good.
- You better.

506
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,326
Because if you don't, I have no idea
what I went through this for.

507
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,670
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- I was looking for Mr. Dog,

508
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,002
and then I was jumped by two insanely
aggressive guys with knives.

509
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,382
Do you remember
what they looked like?

510
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,385
Yes, and I will tell you everything
on one condition.

511
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,965
You recruit me too.

512
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,892
Okay.

513
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:27,557
Kovar face many threats.
Many people want to kill him.

514
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:32,444
Only people who have power
to get past his army are Bratva.

515
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,989
So,

516
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,902
first you say that this is gonna kill me,

517
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,913
and now it looks like
you wanna initiate me.

518
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,877
Unless you are careful,
it will be one and same.

519
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:54,758
Okay, Anatoly.

520
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,170
So, I survive this.

521
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,425
Then I'm Bratva.

522
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,600
You survive this,

523
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,855
you can begin process of becoming Bratva.

524
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,654
Hey, buddy. How you doin'?

525
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,243
Well,

526
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,411
besides feeling like I've got the worst
case of déjà vu ever, not bad.

527
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,545
<i>- How about you? You still the mayor?
- Yeah.</i>

528
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,456
They haven't voted me out yet, so...

529
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,375
Yeah, well, give it a little bit of time
and they'll come to their senses.

530
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,842
I got your message. You all right?

531
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,678
I'm all right. I just, I...

532
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,593
I wanted to bounce something off of you.
And get your perspective.

533
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,976
Okay? On?

534
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,525
Felicity thinks that it's time
we put together a new team.

535
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,444
And you want to know if I think
that's a good idea?

536
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,820
I do.

537
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,820
I think it is.

538
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,829
Wasn't exactly the response
you were looking for, right?

539
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,911
No, no.

540
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,829
But I'm not surprised. Uh...

541
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,915
I need to make peace with the fact

542
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,841
that things aren't gonna go back
to the way they were.

543
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:23,680
- So, does that include you and Felicity?
- I don't know.

544
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,660
- Mmm. You're a magician.
- Tough day?

545
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,032
Mmm, just long.

546
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,168
Better now.

547
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:12,687
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'm headed home.

548
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,314
Yeah, it was a good day. It was real good.

549
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,019
Diapers and formula. You got it.
I'll be home in a bit.

550
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,990
How you doing? Help you with somethin'?

551
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,436
Green Arrow?

552
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,266
No. I'm not Green Arrow.
