1
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,561
Listen to me, all of you.

2
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,441
I want you to get out of the tent again.

3
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:11,001
- I have important information
about Retoxil.

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:12,681
As you have to order it on request,

5
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,601
they have all patients very localized,

6
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:16,841
but in Toledo there's been
an unusual demand.

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,201
- Just three days before
entering the factory.

8
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:22,121
Go to that pharmacy by yourself.
Don't talk to anyone about this.

9
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,441
- Help, please, we just got mugged!

10
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,361
- I don't know.
The pharmacy has been robbed.

11
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,641
They've taken the records.
The pharmacy thing

12
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,281
was only known to you and me.
- And you didn't tell anyone, did you?

13
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:38,521
Didn't you say anything to the guy
in the cafeteria?

14
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:41,361
- How much do they pay you? A million?
- Go fuck yourself.

15
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,401
It's Arturo. Do you hear me?

16
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:46,401
- We're in the basement of the boilers.

17
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,881
Try to get you back here in two hours.

18
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,641
- I stole some stuff from the toolbox.

19
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,601
Ask them to take you back to the bathroom.

20
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:56,841
You take the tools and stick them under
the toilet seat.

21
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:03,641
- Come on, Salva,
look at me under the table.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,561
I have well-founded suspicions that
you're hiding something

23
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,041
in that workshop where you supposedly
makes cider.

24
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,001
I'm sorry, Salva.

25
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:15,201
This place is wonderful.

26
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,961
Don't stop.

27
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:25,321
What the fuck are you doing here, man?
Get it out. Leave me alone with this one.

28
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:27,081
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker.

29
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:35,401
Give me one fucking reason not to
open your head right now!

30
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,321
They are getting away.
What?

31
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,561
16 hostages. 16 hostages, right now.

32
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,481
I already got the results of what you
asked for.

33
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,721
- The person who touched that spoon
is the same

34
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,241
that forced the patrol car.
- You're awesome, Pilar.

35
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,801
Raquel, it's me again. We have the guy

36
00:01:57,961 --> 00:02:01,001
who helps them from the outside.
It is Salva. Salva.

37
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,721
- They're escaping through the cargo area.

38
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,441
- Tokio, go find Nairobi.

39
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,801
Río, Denver, bring Oslo and Helsinki.

40
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,681
- Take cover, take cover, take cover!

41
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,401
Is everybody under cover?

42
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,801
- Let's go get them.

43
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:24,761
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

44
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,161
- Attention, explosion in the building!

45
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:56,681
I want communication with the assault team now.

46
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,201
Intervention team 1 and 2,
go to the incident area.

47
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,561
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

48
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,921
- Priority: hostage rescue.

49
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,921
Evaluation of possible entry.

50
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,401
- Show me the loading area.
Show me the loading area.

51
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,401
That one, that one.

52
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:20,601
- Attention, there's movement.
Someone is coming out.

53
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,361
We've got them in range.
Repeat, we have them in range.

54
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:25,801
- They're hostages. They are hostages.

55
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,761
- We've got a visual.

56
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,641
We're waiting for confirmation.

57
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,641
"Do you know that when there's
a traffic jam after an accident

58
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,641
isn't it because of the accident itself?

59
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,681
It's because the rest of the cars stop to look.

60
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:51,201
They can't help it,

61
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,441
because deep down we're so basic

62
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,921
like a mosquito going towards the light,

63
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,401
like any insect that tries to escape

64
00:03:58,561 --> 00:03:59,761
if you lock him up.

65
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:04,761
And inspector Murillo

66
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,281
it wasn't much more complex
at the end of the day."

67
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:09,921
Can I have a long latte of coffee?

68
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,721
"That's why she was there,

69
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:38,161
washing his armpits and smiling
at the mirror,

70
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,201
while his companion struggled
between life and death."

71
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,841
Confirmed. Confirmed, they're hostages.

72
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:50,481
Rescue protocol.
I want a clean extraction.

73
00:04:50,641 --> 00:04:52,161
- Let's go!

74
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,281
- Come on! Let's get out of here!

75
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,761
Come on! Let's get out of here!

76
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,241
- Let's go!

77
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:16,881
- To the vehicle!

78
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:19,401
- Quick, quick! Go, go, go, go!

79
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,721
Let's go!

80
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,601
- Come on! Let's get out of here!

81
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,721
- Medical team, stand by. I want all
hostages here. Let's go.

82
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,041
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go, let's go!

83
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:45,401
- Come on.

84
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,441
- Everybody out.

85
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:25,441
- We've got a visual of the inside.

86
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,761
- He's wearing a Dalí mask.

87
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,521
- Favourable conditions for an assault.

88
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,241
- We await orders.
- Assault team, stand by.

89
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,201
We're going in.

90
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:43,721
"The world could crumble while she
thought of nothing,

91
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,081
that's how you stay when you've just

92
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:48,481
Get laid, but there's always something

93
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,681
that brings you back to reality and
doesn't usually do it softly."

94
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:54,281
"Witnesses speak of a great deflagration

95
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,441
at the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre

96
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,441
and the possible escape of 15 to 16 hostages

97
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:02,121
whose identity has not yet transcended.

98
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,561
Apparently, they haven't suffered
any serious injuries.

99
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,481
And a breaking news story.
Sub-inspector Ángel Rubio,

100
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,161
one of the crisis command officers,

101
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:13,201
has suffered a serious traffic accident
on the M-506,

102
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:17,041
from Getafe to Pinto, in Madrid.
His vehicle has gone off the road

103
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:19,161
and it's been spining several times.

104
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,201
The sub-inspector is being attended to

105
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:25,121
by the health services and their condition
is not known at this time.

106
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:28,161
There have been no more vehicles
involved in this accident.

107
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:31,561
and it is not yet known whether it
was due to mechanical failure

108
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,121
or a distraction."

109
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,441
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

110
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:45,761
Nairobi, are you all right?
I think I have a fever.

111
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:50,961
Ouch!

112
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,641
Let's see.

113
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,081
No, it doesn't look like a fever.

114
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:08,041
Maybe it was the barbecue, because
I don't feel very well either.

115
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:13,321
Well, lie down here, there's room.

116
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:18,761
Profesor, I'm not going to bite you.

117
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,481
It's up to me...

118
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,801
or do you breathe tension into
the environment?

119
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,201
Tension? Yes

120
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,121
Here? Yes.

121
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:49,201
Let's see, maybe is the four months

122
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:54,921
locked in here, the fever

123
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,801
or that you have sex appeal.

124
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,001
Isn't it the same with me?

125
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,641
Well...

126
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:11,321
Nairobi, there's no doubt that...

127
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:15,241
That you're a woman of character,
you're a racial woman,

128
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:19,201
Pretty... so, a woman...

129
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:22,441
And I, of course, am sensitive to
those stimuli,

130
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,521
It couldn't be any other way.

131
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:30,521
but interpersonal relationships
are not allowed.

132
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:35,841
Yeah, but I'm not asking you to
marry me either, profesor.

133
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,881
I know, but I really don't...

134
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,481
A "quicky."

135
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:40,681
Please.

136
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,081
Oh, God!

137
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,921
Okay, okay, okay.

138
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:51,241
Ugh!

139
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,041
I wouldn't want to hurt you,
but we can't.

140
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,321
No, you can't hurt me.

141
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:04,281
In fact, I think you're the man

142
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:06,401
who's treated me the best in my whole life.

143
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,361
You and your plan.

144
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:19,361
Tokio told me the plan didn't occur to you,

145
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:24,361
but you haven't told her whose idea it was.

146
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,641
The most important person in my life.

147
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,001
I was a sick kid, you know?

148
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:43,281
And a sick teenager.

149
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:50,001
So I spent many years prostrate in a bed

150
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,881
in a hospital reading, reading a lot.

151
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:59,241
My father used to tell me stories.

152
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:03,921
He used to tell me about the movies
he saw about robberies.

153
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:08,521
That's quite a figure your father,
isn't it?

154
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,001
Instead of telling you "The Ugly Duckling"...

155
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:18,801
Well, one day he told me the most
extraordinary film

156
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:20,521
they've ever done.

157
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,841
"You know money is made in a machine,

158
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:25,281
right?" he said.

159
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:29,281
And I said no.

160
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:37,561
"And that machine is in
a place called the money factory

161
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:41,801
and with a master plan...
It has to be masterful,

162
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,481
don't ever forget it.
You could go in there

163
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,321
and make all the money you want,

164
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:57,561
without stealing from anyone.
Do you understand?"

165
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:01,881
That day he was shot at the doors

166
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,841
of the Hispanic American bank.

167
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,041
He didn't tell me about movies.

168
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,641
He told me about his own robberies.

169
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:20,401
"You could fulfill your dreams

170
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,961
without hurting anyone."

171
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,961
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

172
00:13:41,481 --> 00:13:43,801
- Sir, there's movement inside.

173
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:49,401
They're closing the door.

174
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,201
- Cover fire! Cover fire!

175
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:06,401
- Take anything to hold! Run!

176
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,561
- Take that back!

177
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:16,921
- I can't, I can't!

178
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,881
- Get down!

179
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,761
- Ah!
- Holy shit! Helsinki!

180
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,681
Helsinki!

181
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:26,401
Helsinki!

182
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,681
- Take it! Get it, get it!

183
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,761
- Ah!
- I'm going with Helsinki!

184
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:38,761
Cover me!
- Cover fire!

185
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,121
Three, two, one! Fire!

186
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,761
- Fucking hell!

187
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,641
Helsinki

188
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,081
Help! Help!

189
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,801
Where?

190
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:07,281
No, no.
- The vest has stopped the bullet.

191
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,961
- You've got nothing, you've got nothing.

192
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:18,521
Assault teams, we launch smoke and
enter from the flanks.

193
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,041
We're going in.

194
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,721
Cover fire.
Now!

195
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,561
- Look out! Look out!

196
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,441
- We launched the smoke on my command.

197
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,201
Now!

198
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:38,161
- They have thermal vision equipment.

199
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:40,681
That smoke's only gonna hit us,
get it out.

200
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:43,361
Come on, Moscú.

201
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,481
They're coming in!

202
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,521
- We have to put the wall back on.

203
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:47,881
- Go inside.

204
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,201
- Cover fire. Three, two, one.
Fire!

205
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:57,881
- Fucking hell!

206
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,961
- They're coming in!
- They're on top of us!

207
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,761
- They're coming in, they're coming in!
- They're all over us!

208
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,441
- Cover up, cover up, cover up!

209
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:27,001
I'm coming. I'm coming.

210
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:36,601
Take cover!

211
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,641
- Machine gun!

212
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,881
- Take cover. They are shooting
with large caliber.

213
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,041
Wall, wall!

214
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,721
Fucking hell!

215
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,201
- Come on, come on! Help!

216
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:36,001
- The drill! Come on, hurry up, Berlín!

217
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,441
Come on, let's go!

218
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,681
- Where's Oslo?
- I don't know, I haven't seen it.

219
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:28,161
Mari Carmen, I'm sorry.

220
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:38,041
- Ángel's things.

221
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:51,641
What happened?

222
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,801
He was drinking before the crashed

223
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:57,681
I talked to the police.

224
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,601
He made 16 calls to you.

225
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:08,681
What happened?

226
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,041
What did you say to him?

227
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:18,601
- Nothing. I didn't pick up his phone.

228
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,041
I was in an operation.

229
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,401
- Tell me what happened between you two,
please.

230
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:31,001
Ángel overturned, invaded the opposite lane

231
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:34,041
and swerved like he wanted to end it all.

232
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,161
A friend of his from Traffic gave me this video.

233
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:51,841
Tell me, why has my husband
attempted suicide?

234
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,681
- I don't know.

235
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,441
Things weren't going well at work.

236
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,121
- At work?

237
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:06,401
I've been waiting seven years,

238
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,841
seven years waiting for one day to stop
being in love with you.

239
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,561
And now all I hope is that he wakes up.

240
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:27,641
Why didn't you warn us? Why?

241
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:30,921
Where the fuck have you been?
Where the fuck have you been?

242
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:35,121
- Man down! Man down! Help!

243
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:40,921
- Helsinki, what happened?
- Hostages, escape, very strong blow,

244
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:45,481
Trauma.
Did you know about escape?

245
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,441
What hostage made the escape?

246
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,721
What hostage made the escape?

247
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:57,001
- Arturo said it,
but I didn't get there in time.

248
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:58,681
- Arturo.

249
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:11,881
- Helsinki. Helsinki.

250
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,601
Oslo is wrong.

251
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:19,041
- No, He's not.

252
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,681
- He's badly hurt, Helsinki.
- No, no.

253
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:25,681
Not badly hurt, not badly hurt.

254
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:29,201
He just needs rest and medicine.

255
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:34,041
Medicine. A medicine.
- Why are his eyes open?

256
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:38,761
- And now I give prednisone,
anti-inflammatories and heparin,

257
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:40,601
and go to sleep.

258
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,641
And tomorrow Oslo better.

259
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:52,641
- Hey, Moscú.
You don't worry.

260
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:56,201
Oslo and I have had worse colds than this.

261
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:58,881
Worst colds.

262
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:16,121
"Oslo's gaze was never sparkling,

263
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,321
but now it was the gaze of all of us:

264
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,081
sad and absent.

265
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:23,161
Hope is like dominoes:

266
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,921
when one falls, they all fall.

267
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:29,521
And the hostages realized we were screwed."

268
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,761
We heard all the gunshots last night.

269
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,801
Is anyone hurt?

270
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:46,161
I'm not gonna shut up.

271
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:55,801
- Have a seat.
- One of my students is missing,

272
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,641
Pablo Ruiz, and I want to know
where he is.

273
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,281
- Have a seat.

274
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,121
Sit down!

275
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,361
Your student escaped with a group of hostages.

276
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,601
They blew up a cargo and it went out.

277
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,881
You don't have to worry about anyone,

278
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,361
they're all fine.

279
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,681
What's the crazy one doing?

280
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,841
Ma'am, sit down and leave the claps.

281
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:45,561
Have a seat.

282
00:24:45,721 --> 00:24:47,361
Sit down!

283
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:53,761
Ma'am, sit down.

284
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:56,441
Get on the ground.

285
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:00,401
Get on the ground!

286
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,801
Everybody down to the floor, damn it!

287
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,001
Get on the ground!

288
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:13,041
Sit the fuck down!

289
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,441
Get on the ground!

290
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,681
Make them stop. Make them stop!

291
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,161
Stop it! I said stop it!

292
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:35,641
Sit down, all of you.

293
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:58,801
Have a seat.

294
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,921
Sit down, please.

295
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:23,401
Oh, look.
- No, Moscú.

296
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:24,681
No.
- What?

297
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:26,281
- Open your eyes first.

298
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:27,961
Watch where you shoot.

299
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,441
Grab a gun.

300
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,201
Low elbow.

301
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,521
Hey, but you wear thong, don't you?

302
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:36,921
I'm not wearing panties.
- Won't you wear panties?

303
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,161
- No, I'm not.

304
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,441
- Well, neither do I.

305
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,841
With the dick free you rob.
Don't be a slut.

306
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,241
With the dick free.

307
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:46,721
The hostages.
Shut up.

308
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,081
- What's going on?

309
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:54,521
With the passage of hours, the hostages
will cease to be docile.

310
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:57,761
When they see that there are no deliveries,
that there are no advances,

311
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:00,761
their survival instinct will lead them into action.

312
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,641
And what are they going to do?

313
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:05,401
Are the numismatics gonna make a Bruce Willis'?

314
00:27:05,561 --> 00:27:06,881
Something like that, Nairobi.

315
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:11,561
They'll try to escape or they'll escape.
No.

316
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:13,881
It's possible that will happen.
We are armed.

317
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,921
At that point, the rest of the hostages

318
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,481
we'll lose our fear.

319
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:20,481
If that happens, it's very important
to reestablish control.

320
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,921
and in that case we'll do it through empathy.

321
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:28,721
generating a much stronger climate of trust

322
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,041
than what we've had up to that point.

323
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:39,481
Well, trust and M-16s don't marry, do they?

324
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:44,841
Then we'll have to find things that
unite us to the hostages.

325
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:48,241
Let's see, what unites people?

326
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:52,241
Well, football.
Football is a very good example,

327
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:57,161
but there's one thing that unites
even more than football.

328
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,281
Sex?

329
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,601
Sex unites, but two by two.
Or not.

330
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,601
Careful.
Normally

331
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:11,241
Well, there are threesomes and...

332
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:15,681
And there are quartets,
even more group structures.

333
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:17,521
Structures?
Needless to say

334
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,761
that has no place in our plan.

335
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:21,561
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
Thank goodness,

336
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:25,281
because as lucky as I am,
if we have an orgy,

337
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,001
I'm sure he'll touch me behind this one.

338
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:32,081
- But, Profesor, what unites more than sex?

339
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,161
What unites us?

340
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:37,001
Uh!

341
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,681
I mean all of us.

342
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:43,481
Well, let's see, I've grown
very fond of you all,

343
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:45,521
but... Sincerely?

344
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,041
The money.

345
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,241
The money.

346
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:53,641
Not one other thing, but we'll
have plenty of money.

347
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:56,801
I've been thinking a lot

348
00:28:56,961 --> 00:29:00,121
on how we could transform our hostages

349
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,561
in our partners

350
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:08,121
and, well, I've come to a conclusion:

351
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:17,281
money or freedom.

352
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:21,921
Have you ever thought, I mean by fantasy,

353
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:23,481
to put a price on yourself?

354
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:25,641
- I can tell you that yes.

355
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:29,201
- Think about it, you've got two hours.
- I have nothing to think about.

356
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:32,361
- I'm talking about the pain,
the damage we're inflicting on him.

357
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,761
- I'm here working better than
I've ever worked in my whole life.

358
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:38,601
- What would be the minimum wage
for a hostage?

359
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,721
I've thought of a million euros.

360
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,241
Like that, free, no taxes.

361
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:43,481
You're not gonna fool me,

362
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,721
I know perfectly well how all this works.

363
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:46,841
Is that so?

364
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,281
- You know how much this costs.

365
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:51,321
And he knows that the profession is
something you carry in your blood.

366
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:54,281
I've never had a boss like you,
Miss Nairobi.

367
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:57,601
Is it that or the second choice?
What's that second choice?

368
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,241
Just go out?

369
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:02,201
Just like I'm telling you,
but empty-handed.

370
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:04,561
- How are we gonna get a million
euros out of here?

371
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,681
Hiding in our underwear?

372
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:11,201
You give me the address of a carnal cousin
of yours, a friend,

373
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:14,281
and I'll send you a postcard envelope
with your money.

374
00:30:14,441 --> 00:30:16,881
within five or six months of getting
out of here.

375
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,081
- Think about it, it's not
the same raising a child

376
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:21,001
with a million under the mattress.

377
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:24,041
- Well...
- Freedom...

378
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,201
or the money.

379
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:35,401
- There was a camera here,
at the entrance to the restrooms.

380
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:37,961
And in this hallway I think
there was another one.

381
00:30:38,121 --> 00:30:40,641
- You mean apart from the security cameras.

382
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,601
of the building, had they installed more?

383
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:44,281
- Yeah, those were different.

384
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:46,921
- They had us digging a tunnel.

385
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,881
It was in the basement.

386
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:53,281
There was a lot of ammunition,
like for a war,

387
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,761
there were boxes of bullets....,

388
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:59,521
chargers, explosives.

389
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:04,201
- Yeah, these three were part of the band.

390
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:09,361
There were eight of them,
two of them foreigners.

391
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,801
- Would you know if one of them
is the profesor?

392
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:17,361
- They had city names:

393
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:21,321
Berlín, Moscú, Denver...
- Nairobi...

394
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,601
- Helsinki...
- She was Tokio.

395
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:26,121
- This was Río.
- It was the least dangerous of all.

396
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,321
He was Alison's keeper.

397
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,761
- They had Alison separated from
the rest of the hostages?

398
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:34,841
- Yeah, sometimes they split it up.

399
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:37,081
- One of the foreigners is wounded.

400
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,201
Or dead.

401
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,561
We hit him in the head with a pipe.

402
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:43,401
- Oslo called him.

403
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:50,201
- If you'll excuse us. You can take a break.

404
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:52,041
If you'd like a cup of coffee or something to eat.

405
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,001
Lobo, escort him out.

406
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:02,201
You'd better sit down.

407
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:15,121
These are Ángel's glasses.

408
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:20,441
They had inserted a microphone with a
coverage of 1500 meters.

409
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:24,481
They should have put it on when
he entered with the doctors.

410
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:27,441
Ángel is not a traitor.

411
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:32,121
- Raquel,

412
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,001
I know what's going on in your head right now.

413
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:38,241
But he was doing his job.

414
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,761
Any one of us would have done the same thing.

415
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,641
All the clues pointed to him.

416
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:46,721
I was wrong, too.

417
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:28,481
"You have a new message.

418
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,881
- Raquel, it's me again.

419
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,241
Call me, your answering machine's full.

420
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:34,041
We got him, listen, we got him.

421
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:37,041
We got the guy who's helping them
from the outside, yeah.

422
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:39,561
Yeah, it's Salva, Salva,
the one on the cider.

423
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:42,201
He fucking threatened the russian.
He's using you, dammit.

424
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:46,161
He's come up to you to take advantage
of the investigation.

425
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:53,041
He's using you, Raquel.
- To return the call..."

426
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:02,521
"Hi, I'm Raquel. I can't take care of you now.

427
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:05,681
If it's urgent, leave a message after the beep."

428
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,641
"The voicemail of the number
you're calling is full."

429
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,601
Ángel's been calling me all afternoon.

430
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:19,041
But I didn't take his cell phone.
16 calls.

431
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,161
He called me 16 times.

432
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:23,761
And I didn't take it.

433
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:32,721
"Raquel, Raquel, it's Ángel.

434
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:35,601
Listen, I'm asking you to reconsider.

435
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:39,801
I understand the heat of the moment.
I've gone too far..."

436
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:41,761
Disconnect the speakers or turn it down.

437
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:43,841
"It's the first brawl you and I have ever had.

438
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,241
I'll be an asshole or whatever you want,

439
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,921
but I'm not the mole.

440
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,961
I'm not the mole, dammit.

441
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,241
You're gonna fuck up my life, Raquel.

442
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:55,721
Call me."

443
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:07,481
"Raquel, can you tell me why the fuck
you're not picking up the phone?

444
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:09,161
Huh?

445
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:12,401
After 15 years with you, by your side,
like a fucking loser.

446
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:16,561
And not for getting close to you, no,
for friendship, for love.

447
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:17,921
Do you hear me?

448
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:19,561
For love."

449
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:26,761
"I was about to send it all to hell.

450
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:30,001
To send Mari Carmen to hell
for a bitch who wouldn't fuck.

451
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:34,921
Do you hear me? You're a bitch,
an obsessive bitch.

452
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:37,401
You're a fucking bitch! Fucking bitch!

453
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:41,521
A pussy-eater, a frigid."

454
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,801
"How many blows can you take before
you fall to the ground?

455
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:04,681
If you are Raquel Murillo, many.

456
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:07,281
But there's something wrong with being
a good hitter.

457
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:10,561
- Attention, Inspector Murillo is
approaching the facade.

458
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:14,041
And if the blows don't stop, you're gonna
end up falling just the same.

459
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:18,841
And when you fall, it'll be like all those
blows come together.

460
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,281
- Raquel!

461
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,761
- Raquel!
- Raquel!

462
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,201
Raquel!

463
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,721
Murillo stopped hearing.

464
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:31,001
Stop thinking.

465
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,401
He just walked.

466
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:41,961
She was an empty body

467
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:44,841
looking for the end of it all.

468
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:46,681
Raquel!

469
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:54,561
Let's go!

470
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,761
- Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

471
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:05,001
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I didn't understand you.

472
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:11,481
- Freedom.

473
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:15,361
I said I want the...
- No, no, no.

474
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,401
Wait, before you seriously answer me,
I want...

475
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:22,881
I'd like to make a couple
of considerations.

476
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:28,401
The first is that you must contemplate

477
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,121
that you and I have a relationship.

478
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:41,361
And the second is that freedom is full
of unforeseen events,

479
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:46,401
of dangers and terrible things, perhaps,
I'm scared personally,

480
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:48,441
I'm afraid of it.

481
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:51,881
Do you know the eagle chicks

482
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:57,521
that jump before their time and
shatter against the rocks?

483
00:37:57,681 --> 00:37:58,761
I'm afraid of that.

484
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:02,681
Or the bunnies, the rabbits in their burrows.

485
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:06,841
They see the sunlight and they come out.

486
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:17,841
And a wolf breaks their necks with a bite.

487
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,521
I'm afraid of that.

488
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,521
No, Ariana, because...

489
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:34,361
Maybe now, right now, it's much more dangerous.

490
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:39,241
to get out of here than to stay.

491
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:46,041
And I wouldn't want anything bad to
happen to you, Ariana.

492
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:55,361
I don't want you to be anxious either.
I don't want that.

493
00:38:55,521 --> 00:38:57,601
I'll give you a couple of hours to
think about it.

494
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:11,161
I've got to get out.

495
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,481
I'm pregnant.
I have to go to the gynaecologist and...

496
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,281
Well, and the traumatologist,
or the doctor you go,

497
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:20,121
I don't know which doctor you go to
if you've got a bullet in your leg.

498
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:22,601
Well, it's internal medicine, isn't it?
I don't know.

499
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,921
But let's see, what's going on?

500
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:26,561
You don't like the million?

501
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,961
With that your life is solved.
No, it depends.

502
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:32,601
Because if my wound gets gangrene,
I'm left lame...

503
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:36,481
If that happens, we'll think about it.
You don't have to get into the worst.

504
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,761
I think.

505
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,761
Hey, besides, you're luxurious here.

506
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:46,281
With your own room, Mónica Gaztambide's
presidential suite.

507
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:47,441
Or not?

508
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:57,081
Maybe, if you leave, you even miss us.

509
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:02,201
Why do you insist that I stay?

510
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:13,161
You haven't fallen in love, have you?

511
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,201
That's not true.

512
00:40:18,361 --> 00:40:19,961
Look at me. Look at me.

513
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:21,121
Are you serious?

514
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,081
What if he's serious?

515
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,321
Let's see, you can't fall in love in 60 hours.

516
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:30,241
Well, 60 hours. Well, in 60 hours I shot you.

517
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,241
And I got it out of you.

518
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,881
You found out you were pregnant,
that if you abort,

519
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,281
not abort, if you leave the boyfriend.

520
00:40:37,921 --> 00:40:39,841
That you're sleeping with me.

521
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,241
If you give me 24 more hours,
maybe I'll ask you to marry me.

522
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:46,601
And in the other 24 we got divorced.

523
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:48,801
What the fuck does time matter in here?

524
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,201
If in the end time is one thing...

525
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,841
Okay.

526
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,041
Okay what?

527
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:57,001
I'm staying.

528
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:04,881
But to get married and that's
gonna give me more time,

529
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:08,121
All right? I don't know, 16 minutes or something.

530
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:13,921
Hello?

531
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,801
Look, I'm sorry to call you back.

532
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:18,321
I'm Raquel's mother.
As you were the other day

533
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:22,121
so close to my daughter. I have an urgent message

534
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:25,401
of Deputy Inspector Ángel. And I don't locate her.

535
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:27,521
Are you near her?

536
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,841
Not right now, but I'm going to see her
in a moment.

537
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:32,561
If you tell me, maybe I can get it to her.

538
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:35,361
You don't know how grateful I am to you,
because it seemed important.

539
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:38,201
What message?
Wait, I'll read to you.

540
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:44,001
Yeah. "We've got him,
we've got the bloody guy

541
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,881
who helps them from the outside.
He's the cider guy.

542
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:51,721
The one who was in the junkyard,
the one who threatened the Russian."

543
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:53,481
Just a second. Uh...

544
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:57,441
"His fingerprints were on the Z. We have it.

545
00:42:57,601 --> 00:43:01,041
I'm going to the tent and
I'll tell you everything."

546
00:43:01,201 --> 00:43:03,361
Did you write it down well?

547
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:06,721
Yes. Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

548
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:10,321
Well, thank you very much again,
thank you very much.

549
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:11,841
You're welcome.

550
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,441
The Profesor had built
his plan millimetrically:

551
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:30,561
every move of the police,
every possible mistake of his gang,

552
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:35,961
hostage behavior, every variable; everything.

553
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:39,641
And then, when he thought he was in control,

554
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,761
found out that he didn't.

555
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:43,801
It never occurred to him that in order
for the whole plan

556
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:47,761
didn't go down the toilet he was
gonna have to kill.

557
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:56,481
Kill the mother of the woman he was
falling in love with.

558
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:00,801
And of course, no one is prepared for that.

559
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:16,441
What did you put in me?
- An intravenous pain reliever.

560
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:18,721
- Have you talked to the hostages yet?

561
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:20,121
What did they say?

562
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:24,601
- So far we've confirmed they're tunneling.

563
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,641
We're going to locate the exact position.

564
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:30,321
And what we already know, they're
heavily armed.

565
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,121
Raquel, you're the most qualified person

566
00:44:35,281 --> 00:44:37,201
to take command of this operation.

567
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:39,881
But it's about time to rest.

568
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:46,441
- Don't worry about anything.

569
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,161
The commissioner is on his way
to take his place.

570
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:50,921
So you'll go home for a few hours.

571
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,001
You have to sleep.

572
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,921
- Can I make a call?
- Sure.

573
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:00,561
Here you go.

574
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:15,681
Salva.

575
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,161
I'm Raquel.

576
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:19,321
I need you to...

577
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:21,881
come and get me out of here.

578
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,441
This is the worst day of my life and...

579
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,881
And I have to escape from this tent,
from this city.

580
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:31,521
Salva, are you there?

581
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,121
I can't, I have an engagement.

582
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:37,481
Sure, I understand. Call you like that...

583
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:51,601
Morning.
Hello.

584
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:56,161
Tell me.
I am Salva, your daughter's friend.

585
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,161
We spoke on the phone.

586
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:00,921
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

587
00:46:03,521 --> 00:46:05,281
Come in, come in.
Thank you.

588
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,321
Go ahead.

589
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:29,401
He's not reacting.

590
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:33,401
I don't mean to be ominous,
but I'm afraid the blow to the skull

591
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:34,961
has caused irreparable damage.

592
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:39,961
- What's the matter, you're a neurosurgeon?
We don't know.

593
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:42,281
We have to get him to a hospital.

594
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:44,161
Maybe he can still be cured.

595
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:47,081
- Nobody's getting out of here, you hear me?

596
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,361
With or without a hole,
you know what the profesor said.

597
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:52,801
- I don't care about the profesor.
Where was the profesor

598
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:54,961
when 16 hostages escaped?

599
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:57,561
Where was him when Oslo's head was opened?

600
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:00,681
We open the doors, we call the police.

601
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:03,441
and let the doctors take him.
- What the hell are you talking about?

602
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,321
The rules are clear, no one leaves.

603
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,121
We accept everything, Oslo too.

604
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:10,441
Sixteen hostages have escaped.

605
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:11,841
The rules have changed.

606
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,441
The hostages don't know what's
going on here, Oslo does.

607
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:16,881
- So what? I don't know.
He can't even talk.

608
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:20,001
And even if he could, he wouldn't turn us
in to the police.

609
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:21,161
Let's vote.

610
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:24,121
- This is not a pretty democracy.
- It is not, no.

611
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:30,121
We open the doors and let Oslo out.

612
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,321
- No one's getting out of here.

613
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:40,801
Oslo doesn't come out.

614
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,801
I talk to Oslo before I go in.

615
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:56,801
Doesn't matter about the wound.

616
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,561
Death before prison.

617
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,001
Do you understand?

618
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,001
- Yes.

619
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:17,321
- I'll take care of Oslo.

620
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:39,601
The truth is, you have a beautiful house.

621
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:41,041
Thank you very much.

622
00:48:42,241 --> 00:48:45,561
Raquel is not at home, the poor one
works so much...

623
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,841
I was having a coffee,
would you like me to make you one?

624
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:04,321
I wouldn't want to disturb you.
I won't be long.

625
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:06,521
Well, thank you very much.

626
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,321
Have a seat.

627
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:48,361
"There are 10 000 ways to kill a grandmother,

628
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,321
but the Profesor was no hitman.

629
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,121
More like a chess player.

630
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:55,841
The world of crime was big to him.

631
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:01,681
So he chose the cleanest and smartest option.

632
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,321
Pour 2.5 milligrams of dioxin into
grandmother's coffee.

633
00:50:10,561 --> 00:50:13,241
Waiting for the heart failure that it
was going to cause.

634
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,121
and evaporate."

635
00:50:17,321 --> 00:50:18,961
Would you like some sugar?

636
00:50:20,241 --> 00:50:21,921
Oh, yes, please. Three tablespoons.

637
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:23,841
You're greedy, aren't you?

638
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:28,321
So do I, although I shouldn't.

639
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,881
"Three spoonfuls of sugar
and one spoonful of dioxide.

640
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:43,761
In 15 minutes, heart failure would occur.

641
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:46,601
In 30 minutes, Raquel
would find her mother's body.

642
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:49,121
In an hour, a judge
assisted by a medical examiner

643
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,201
would order the removal of the body

644
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:54,121
for cardiovascular infarction,
with no signs of violence,

645
00:50:54,281 --> 00:50:57,401
with the victim's age, with the door
locked inside his house.

646
00:50:57,561 --> 00:50:59,561
There would be no autopsy."
Thank you very much.

647
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:02,681
"Clean and simple."

648
00:51:23,321 --> 00:51:25,241
My daughter didn't spend the night here.

649
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:29,121
Was she with you?

650
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:34,361
Well... Well, the truth is that it is.

651
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:37,841
We saw each other yesterday.
Good.

652
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,521
Did you make love?

653
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:51,281
Well...

654
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:56,161
Well, we do, actually.
I'm glad.

655
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,921
All right, then.
And forgive the intrusion,
but I'm really glad.

656
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:04,121
My daughter needs as May water

657
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:06,841
Someone who love her and make love to her.

658
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:11,401
And be a good man.

659
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,521
And you seem like a good man.

660
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:20,201
I can see it in your eyes.

661
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,241
Ouch. Excuse me. I dropped it.

662
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:35,721
It's just that over the years,
we get very clumsy.

663
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,521
I beg your pardon.

664
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:07,521
Oslo won't talk anymore.

665
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:11,481
I'm so sorry. It is not a tragedy.

666
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:13,161
You knew about the escape.

667
00:54:15,401 --> 00:54:17,241
Denver told me.

668
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,721
You knew about the escape.

669
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:24,841
To know, to know, I didn't know.
I sensed something

670
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:26,881
and I told Denver to help.

671
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:39,001
He was hit with this tube

672
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:42,921
from the back.

673
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,401
Oslo friend.

674
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:51,321
Me and Oslo warfare together,

675
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:53,761
peace together.

676
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:56,601
Robberies together.

677
00:54:57,481 --> 00:54:58,761
Jail together.

678
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:03,521
Oslo friend. Do you understand, Arturo?

679
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:08,281
On your knees.

680
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:43,281
Did you really think we weren't gonna try to escape?

681
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,721
That we weren't going to defend ourselves?

682
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,161
That we were going to stand idly by

683
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,601
watching you kill us?

684
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:58,481
How you tortured us, how you raped us.

685
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,961
Once and a thousand times I would,
so if you're gonna do it,

686
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:09,081
give me strong because,
if you leave me alive,

687
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,721
maybe I'll finish you off later.

688
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,481
I came to work

689
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:21,161
like every day.

690
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,721
Without hurting anyone.

691
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:29,441
Just doing my duty.

692
00:56:31,161 --> 00:56:33,241
Who do you think are the good guys, Helsinki?

693
00:56:34,881 --> 00:56:36,681
You?

694
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:39,481
Finish quickly, please.

695
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,201
Bring me the dustpan and the mop.

696
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:02,721
It's right there in the corner, please.
Thank you.

697
00:57:03,601 --> 00:57:04,961
I'll take care of it.

698
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:19,201
"I no longer live in Almazán.
I live in Madrid.

699
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:22,681
I have two daughters, Raquel and Laura.

700
00:57:23,721 --> 00:57:25,841
I'll never go to a residence.

701
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:28,601
Raquel is serious,
but she loves me very much."

702
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:45,401
We got him. He's the cider guy.

703
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:48,241
His prints were on the zeta.

704
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:52,281
Do you mind if I make a call?
No, of course not.

705
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:05,081
Raquel, it's me again.

706
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:07,161
Give me a call.
Your answering machine is full.

707
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:08,841
We've got him. Listen. We got it.

708
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:11,801
We got the guy who's helping them
from the outside.

709
00:58:11,961 --> 00:58:14,521
Yes. It's Salva. Salva, the one with the cider.

710
00:58:14,681 --> 00:58:18,241
He was at the junkyard.
He threatened the Russian. Fucking hell.

711
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:21,041
He's fucking using you.
Her fingerprints were on the zeta.

712
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:31,401
"to listen to the message again press 1.
To delete it, 2.

713
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,321
"Message deleted. No more messages."

714
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,241
They don't get it.

715
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,921
Salva?

716
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:00,921
What are you doing here?

717
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:04,961
This was my engagement.

718
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:09,601
The only thing I left you
in the garden was a shame.

719
00:59:23,881 --> 00:59:25,681
Isn't he a heaven?

720
00:59:26,641 --> 00:59:30,721
He already told me you've made love.

721
00:59:30,881 --> 00:59:34,561
- Mom... I didn't say anything.

722
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:36,441
She must have figured it out on her own.

723
00:59:37,321 --> 00:59:38,681
Let's eat.

724
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,201
Sure you don't want to try my custard?

725
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:45,361
We'll have to try them,

726
00:59:45,521 --> 00:59:47,201
if they're as good as this soup...

727
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:50,201
Of course, it's the best I've tasted
in a very long time.

728
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:51,601
Thank you.

729
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:54,841
Daughter, don't be dizzy, you eat very little.

730
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:56,201
That's the job.

731
00:59:57,521 --> 00:59:58,681
He's got her under a lot of stress.

732
00:59:58,841 --> 01:00:00,841
About the kidnapping,
you know what I'm saying?

733
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,561
Yeah, man, you're gonna tell me.

734
01:00:03,721 --> 01:00:05,801
I follow it a lot, I'm following it a lot.

735
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:07,201
In the press.

736
01:00:08,401 --> 01:00:11,161
It's tremendous what's going on.
I can't stand it.

737
01:00:12,601 --> 01:00:14,361
It's just that there was gunfire yesterday.

738
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:19,241
And explosions, really,
those people heavily armed,

739
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:22,521
I don't know, any day
there's going to be a tragedy.

740
01:00:22,681 --> 01:00:24,361
Yesterday there were shots...

741
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:26,801
People heavily armed...

742
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:31,161
"They have at least three M-16s.

743
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:33,001
A floor machine gun.

744
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:37,681
Retoxil, it's a rare drug.

745
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:39,801
- In Toledo there has been an unusual demand."

746
01:00:39,961 --> 01:00:41,521
Where was the last purchase made?

747
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:43,441
- Here, in Palomeque, on October 18th.

748
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,761
Excuse me, I have to make a call.

749
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:52,121
- But, daughter.

750
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:55,001
Every day like this.

751
01:00:56,161 --> 01:00:57,841
Suárez, put me through the speakers.

752
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,161
- Connect my cell phone,

753
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:03,081
we have communication with the inspector.
Turn it up.

754
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:06,281
- Listen to me well, I need you to
look for all the farms

755
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:08,001
with hunting grounds
within a radius of 100 km

756
01:01:08,161 --> 01:01:09,561
from Palomeque's pharmacy.

757
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:11,481
- I want a map of Toledo now, look for it.

758
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:12,721
Palomeque perimeter.

759
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:15,001
- If they bought the drugs there,

760
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:17,081
means they were very close.

761
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,401
Fuck, how come I didn't notice before?

762
01:01:19,561 --> 01:01:22,201
They needed a place to get organized,

763
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:24,001
to prepare the plan step by step.

764
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,761
They had to do target practice.

765
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:28,281
before entering the factory.

766
01:01:28,441 --> 01:01:31,521
Somewhere where the shooting
won't arouse suspicion.

767
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:35,721
- I want units around
Palomeque's perimeter.

768
01:01:35,881 --> 01:01:37,441
within a 100-kilometre radius and I want them now.

769
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,241
- It has to be a farm of more than 100 hectares.

770
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:42,561
- Search the cadastre.

771
01:01:42,721 --> 01:01:45,841
- With a house inside.
Call me as soon as you have something.

772
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:47,361
- Count on it.

773
01:01:49,961 --> 01:01:51,961
You heard the man. We don't have time to waste,

774
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:53,281
let's go get 'em, okay?

775
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:56,321
That farm, those units,
I want it all, I want it now.

776
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:03,801
Yes?

777
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:09,081
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

778
01:02:09,761 --> 01:02:11,121
Yeah, a little tired.
Come in.

779
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:14,001
Stunned too,

780
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:16,921
they had to inject me with a painkiller.

781
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:20,241
and to tell you the truth, I'm not very used to it.

782
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:22,521
I'm not very lucid today either.

783
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:26,321
Sorry, Salva, but I need to lie down.

784
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:29,401
I have to get some sleep.
Sure, sure.

785
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:42,161
The time has come to make a decision.

786
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:44,961
You have to choose

787
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:47,881
between becoming accomplices
and getting a million.

788
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:50,241
Or be whole and get out of here.

789
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:54,721
Freedom

790
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:58,241
or the million.

791
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:04,241
Those of you who stay
with us to see the end,

792
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:08,641
you will receive 20 000 banknotes of
50 euro at home.

793
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:11,601
Vacuum-packed, like good ham.

794
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:16,001
All those who wish to leave,
please cross the line.

795
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,961
What are we going to do with those
who choose freedom?

796
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:44,321
You'll take them to the factory basement.

797
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:46,121
and lock them in there.

798
01:03:50,281 --> 01:03:51,281
I know it's regrettable,

799
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,841
but they are precisely those

800
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:57,281
that could ignite another mutiny.

801
01:03:59,401 --> 01:04:02,001
And I need to protect you.

802
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:04,441
Why didn't you give me the
option to go out?

803
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:06,841
- Because you're the big star, honey.

804
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:09,881
Do you really think there's any need
to explain it to you?

805
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:12,561
Get out of the way, you're in the middle.

806
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:30,281
Well, time's running out.

807
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:31,881
Now or never.

808
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:34,601
You can cross the line and get out of here.

809
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:38,361
or stay with us

810
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,281
and get the million.

811
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:43,801
All right, all right, all right,

812
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:46,001
those who want to get out,
hands on your head.

813
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:50,281
Go ahead, through the loading dock door.

814
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,201
"What the profesor had achieved

815
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:55,441
was to divide the hostages

816
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:57,761
among those who were to become

817
01:04:57,921 --> 01:04:59,161
in our partners

818
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:02,001
and those who could still complicate things.

819
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:04,721
Or so we thought."

820
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:28,121
Yes?. Suárez.

821
01:05:28,281 --> 01:05:29,681
- Inspector, we have the estate.

822
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:31,841
It fits the description perfectly.

823
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:33,001
- Where is it?

824
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:35,441
- Very close to Palomeque, the village
of the pharmacy.

825
01:05:35,601 --> 01:05:37,561
It has 640 hectares and private
hunting grounds.

826
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,801
Inside is an abandoned dwelling
large enough

827
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:43,001
to plan a heist of this magnitude.

828
01:05:43,161 --> 01:05:45,761
- How did you find it?
- A neighbour claims to have seen

829
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:47,761
to a group of young people on
St. John's night.

830
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:50,441
They didn't look like hunters,
but he heard detonations.

831
01:05:50,601 --> 01:05:52,481
throughout the summer.
- Detonations?

832
01:05:52,641 --> 01:05:53,921
- Yes.

833
01:05:54,081 --> 01:05:55,761
He don't know what they were, but he is sure

834
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:57,441
that they weren't hunting shotguns.

835
01:05:57,601 --> 01:05:59,881
I'm mobilizing units into the area and preparing

836
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,761
an assault team for possible armed intervention.

837
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,321
- All right, send all the information to my cell phone.

838
01:06:05,481 --> 01:06:07,321
I'll be there as soon as I can.

839
01:06:08,361 --> 01:06:10,721
Lobo, we've got a green light,
we're on our way,

840
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:13,001
teams 1, 2 and 3 ready. Now!

841
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:17,761
Salva, look, I don't feel very well.

842
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:19,641
Do you know how to drive?

843
01:06:21,881 --> 01:06:23,761
Yes.
I need you to take me somewhere.

844
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:04,921
Tomorrow it all starts.

845
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:10,841
Sergio,

846
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:16,921
I want you to promise me one thing.

847
01:07:18,321 --> 01:07:21,881
If things get ugly, you'll get away.

848
01:07:24,561 --> 01:07:26,521
You're not gonna wait in the hangar.

849
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:29,601
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

850
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:32,521
You know as well as I do that everything
can go wrong.

851
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:37,681
I'm only going in there if you promise me

852
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:41,081
that if the thing goes to hell you're
not going to get caught.

853
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:48,561
I'm not gonna promise you that.

854
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:54,841
Either you promise me that now or you stay tonight

855
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:57,281
without a captain in charge.

856
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,881
You already know me.

857
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,481
Nothing's going to go wrong, Andrés.

858
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:13,361
We're the resistance, aren't we?

859
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:22,161
"The profesor's life revolved around a single idea.

860
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:25,401
Resistance.

861
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:31,881
His grandfather,
who had resisted with the partisans

862
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,321
to defeat the fascists in Italy

863
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:36,441
had taught him that song.

864
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:40,161
And then he teach it to us."

865
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:49,521
Six kilometers straight ahead.

866
01:09:49,681 --> 01:09:52,161
and then the first detour to the right.

867
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:56,841
Salva, can you go a little faster?

868
01:09:57,001 --> 01:09:58,721
You're not gonna get a ticket with me.

869
01:09:58,881 --> 01:09:59,841
You're going to 40.

870
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:03,601
It's true, I'm sorry, I'm just a little thick.

871
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:52,841
The left side and the right side as well.

872
01:11:29,681 --> 01:11:31,401
Don't let anyone in without the suit.

873
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,281
And anyone who's not indispensable,

874
01:11:33,441 --> 01:11:35,881
outside perimeter one, understand?

875
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,401
- I got it.

876
01:11:43,241 --> 01:11:46,481
We've won the lottery.
Here's all the colored DNA.

877
01:11:50,401 --> 01:11:52,441
Bring in the CSI photographers,

878
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:53,641
I want pictures of everything.

879
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:55,881
You have to cover this house, every corner.

880
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:02,641
"We're upstairs.

881
01:12:10,521 --> 01:12:14,361
There's an attic, you're not going to believe
what we found."

882
01:12:16,281 --> 01:12:19,841
Inspector, you have to see this.

883
01:12:31,521 --> 01:12:35,161
It's all on the walls, timetables,
photos, plans...

884
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:39,761
The whole damn plan. We got 'em, fellas.

885
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:44,441
Your time is up.
