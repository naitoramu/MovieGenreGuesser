00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:02,577
Oliver: My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:04,356
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:06,372
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,246
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:10,385
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,761
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,169
To the rest of Starling City,
I am someone else.

8
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:19,305
I am...something else.

9
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:20,742
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,481
I killed Sara.

11
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:24,848
Malcolm gave me something
that made me

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,951
susceptible to suggestion.

13
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:28,614
What happened wasn't
your fault, Thea,

14
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,381
because it wasn't
your decision.

15
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,747
Malcolm? He's going
to face justice.

16
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:36,791
He's gone. Malcolm Merlyn
will never be seen again.

17
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:41,259
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

18
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,561
When I told you
that Malcolm killed Sara,

19
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:45,789
he wanted her dead,
but I am the one

20
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,027
who fired those arrows
into her chest.

21
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:50,330
I promised you your vengeance.

22
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,496
So take it.

23
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,827
Kill me.

24
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,032
But spare
John Diggle's life.

25
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,827
Let him go.

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,221
I will beg for it.

27
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,426
You've shown
tremendous strength,

28
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,086
fortitude,

29
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,187
and power.

30
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,422
No, Mr. Queen...

31
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:23,417
I don't want to kill you.

32
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,783
I want you to take my place.

33
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,884
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

34
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:34,426
Ra's is a title greater
than any one man.

35
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,726
Wing ta Lao wo chey.

36
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,920
Am I supposed to understand
what that means?

37
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:49,460
No. It is from a dialect
no longer spoken.

38
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:52,323
Said to me by a man
whose place I took.

39
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:55,656
Contemplating the same offer.

40
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,989
And what it means is,

41
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,659
a tale to be told...

42
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,727
begins thus.

43
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:12,987
Ayy!

44
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,088
[All grunting]

00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,996
[Ra's speaking Arabic]

46
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,698
Don't let your footing
betray you.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,896
Let your power come not from
the strength of your attack

48
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:43,230
but from the ground
that holds your feet.

49
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:52,302
All men seek guidance,
a purpose.

50
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:55,572
The means to live
without pain.

51
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,664
Those who journey here have given
such an exchange

52
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,397
for their fealty.

53
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:04,636
You mean they have
to kill for you?

54
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:10,412
No, Mr. Queen,
they have to die for me.

55
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,622
Is all of this supposed
to impress me?

56
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:26,662
No.

57
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,997
It's to inform you.

58
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:32,364
Surely men have
branded you a murderer,

59
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,163
a torturer.

60
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:39,433
But see, I would never
shame you with such bluntness.

61
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:43,606
Because I see it
in your eyes.

62
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:47,173
The struggle you have
with your dual identity.

63
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,846
Oliver Queen and the Arrow.

64
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:52,279
Neither are giving you
what you crave.

65
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,983
But becoming
Ra's al Ghul will?

66
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:59,120
Oliver Queen is a man
destined to be alone.

67
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,590
He loves a woman
he knows he cannot have.

68
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,155
You don't know me.

69
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,689
But I know the Arrow.

70
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:08,351
"Al Sahhim."
You will never be

71
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,323
anything more than a vigilante
for those whose lives you save

72
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,353
at the risk of your own.

73
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:17,158
And the city will turn on you,

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,554
and your closest allies
within the police department

75
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,816
will call you a criminal.

76
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,055
You will be scorned

77
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,053
and hunted,

78
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,692
and then killed.

79
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,953
Dying as you began
your crusade...

80
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,852
Alone.

83
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:54,140
Your brother attempted to have me
believe that he killed Sara.

84
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:55,909
Your confession
is even less convincing.

85
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:57,876
I don't have
any reason to lie!

86
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,180
Except to protect your father.

87
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,580
Why would I
protect Malcolm

88
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:03,020
when I turned him
over to you?

89
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,516
He gave me a drug
called Votura.

90
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,388
I put three arrows
into her chest,

91
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,292
and I had no idea
what I was doing.

92
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:12,229
He used me.

93
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:16,661
Someone she trusted.

94
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:18,365
So I don't deserve
to be living

95
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,333
any more than
Malcolm does!

96
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:23,804
There would be no justice
in killing you.

97
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:27,540
I killed Sara!

98
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,612
Kill me.

99
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:30,781
Do it.

100
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:33,413
Do it.

101
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:38,255
The blood debt ends
with Malcolm's death.

102
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:41,594
Which, I can assure you,
my father has taken care of already.

[Breathing heavily]

107
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,364
Are you ok?

108
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,000
How the hell...

109
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,400
Did she get out?

110
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,812
It's League training,
probably.

111
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,581
What were you doing down
here in the first place?

112
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,486
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

113
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:23,086
It was Herodotus
who first wrote of these waters.

114
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:26,526
And Ponce de Leon traveled
the earth in search of them.

115
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,800
And their discovery by Al-Khidr

116
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,368
is chronicled in the Qu'ran.

117
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,840
And they have permitted me

118
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:38,040
to live way beyond my time.

119
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:42,448
You don't seem too fazed
by what I've told you.

120
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,586
I've seen things that
have helped me to believe

121
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:52,122
that this world is a much bigger place
than people realize.

122
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:55,858
As I told you
on the mountain, boy,

123
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,833
man can only evade
death for so long.

124
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,465
The waters' powers

125
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:05,568
are losing
their effect on me.

126
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,367
My time is almost over,

127
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:10,671
but my legacy won't be
just ash and bone,

128
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:12,343
it will be history.

129
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:16,542
And you think that I'll help you
secure that legacy?

130
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,949
You survived my sword.

131
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:21,845
Your resurrection wasn't a gift
from these waters,

132
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:25,821
rather by force
of your own will.

133
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:28,189
And what better heir
to immortality

134
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,789
than someone who has already claimed
victory over death?

135
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:35,061
I didn't defy death
just to become an instrument of it.

136
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,997
We are justice.

137
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,637
Isn't that what
you've dedicated your life to?

138
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,405
Then why confine your crusade
to a single city...

139
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:50,243
When I can give you
a whole world to save.

140
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,580
By executing anyone who
stands in my way?

141
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,789
You would command resources
that you cannot even fathom.

142
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,325
Numbers greater than any army.

143
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,789
And more loyal.

144
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:11,367
Now, if you wish for them
to renounce killing as you did,

145
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,872
thy will be done.
[Scoffs]

146
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:17,209
I doubt that.
It's called

147
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,377
the League of Assassins
for a reason.

148
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,313
The League's reason
would be your own.

149
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:27,418
You would be Ra's al Ghul.

150
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,298
And what if I say no?

151
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,203
Then you are free
to leave.

152
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:48,778
With your compatriots,

153
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,209
as a gesture of good will.

154
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,447
All debts forgiven,

155
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,215
and all blood oaths waived.

156
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:12,833

[Door opens]

158
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:34,171
Really need to stop having these

159
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,837
I agree.

160
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,542

00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,674
One of them had his
lips sewn shut.

325
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,946
Is that
a real thing?

326
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:41,314
Apparently.

327
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:44,514
Ugh. If only I had known
I have that option.

328
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:47,682
[Sighs] Ok.

329
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,054
Michael Amar?

330
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:52,056
Yeah.

331
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,019
Hmm.

332
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,480
Street name's "Murmur"
because of the whole lip stitch thing.

333
00:17:55,482 --> 00:18:00,258
Practitioners say it focuses
the mind like meditation.

334
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,396
You ok?

335
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:05,702
I handed some of Amar's men
over to Lance.

336
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:08,638
He knows the Arrow
knew about Sara, didn't tell him.

337
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,174
What did Lance say?

338
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,510
Some variation
on "Go to hell."

339
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:13,806
Oliver, he just
needs time.

340
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,046
No, he's right.

341
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:18,510
I lied to him. For months.

342
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:23,085
Kept something from him,
and he had every right to know.

343
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,085
Are you ok?

344
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,452
I mean, besides Lance

345
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,491
and the whole
me and Ray thing?

346
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,754
I mean, it just seems like there's
something else going on

347
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:34,122
underneath all that.

348
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:35,562
I'm fine.

349
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,427
Thanks for help
with Amar's name.

[Knock on door]

351
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,538
Oliver's not here.

352
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,408
Actually, I came by to
see how you were doing.

353
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,542
He told you that
Malcolm was here?

354
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,941
Go ahead.

355
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:59,276
I'm the last person
to stop you from killing him.

356
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:02,640
My last attempt to do so
didn't exactly work out.

357
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,280
That's kind of why
I'm here.

358
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,216
I'm worried
about you.

359
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:13,319
Everyone's so interested
in saving my soul these days.

360
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,759
Look, no one wants
to see Merlyn dead

361
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:18,158
more than me.

362
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,461
But Oliver was right.

363
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,598
You wanted your own
father killed.

364
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,798
Yeah, and how
messed up is that?

365
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,135
You know, I wish that I never learned
Malcolm was my father.

You have a normal father.

the best of terms.

probably go.

[Door closes]

How much of that
did you hear?

376
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,858
Enough to know
that I am the last person

377
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,593
you wish to see alive.

378
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:16,298
I'm not going
to apologize for what I did.

379
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,033
And I'd do it again.

380
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,136
I know.

381
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,302
You asked me
to teach you to be strong.

382
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:28,437
To make sure
you can't be hurt again.

383
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,940
You learned
your lessons well.

384
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:34,705
I have learned
nothing from you.

385
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:37,808
Do you realize
that I'm so messed up,

386
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,175
I was willing
to die last night?

387
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:43,342
For what you made me do?

388
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:47,045
You know, I didn't
actually think it was possible

389
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,284
for me to hurt any worse
than I did when I came to you.

390
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:53,283
You proved to me
I was wrong.

391
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,659
So what was it again
that you taught me?

392
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,555
Show me the knife.

393

How did you know?

394
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:08,271
You are my daughter.

395
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,734
Do it like I taught
you--one strike to the neck,

396
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,205
it'll be over
quickly.

You're sick.

I love you, and I
want to do what is best for you.

If that were even close
to being true,

400
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,638
you would have stayed
out of my life.

401
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:35,180

Oh.

Your safe return
pleases me, my child.

of explaining why

Malcolm Merlyn is still alive.

If you're not going
to watch your tongue,

then at least
mind your tone.

408

Why did you release
Al-Sahfer's murderer?

409
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,934
As a gift
to Oliver Queen.

410
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:57,599
An advance for him
becoming my heir.

the courtesy of admitting it.

of you allowing
weakness into your life.

your devotion to her

Got out of Iron Heights
two months ago.

Did he escape?

No, released. Turns out
he was serving a sentence

429

based on a coerced confession.

What was he after tonight?

industrial grade diamonds.
But word on the street

436

is this shipment was loaded
with high end jewels they didn't take.

437
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,567
Why would he steal
worthless diamonds?

That's the million
dollar question.

from my less socially responsible days.

see if I can find out

to move these diamonds.

you letting him?

He wants me to take his place

Is there even a world
where he can imagine you saying yes?

You're not really
considering this.

Just because

is momentarily unavailable.

In my head, I've already slit his
throat seven times.

to bring him here.

I couldn't even fathom

493
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:34,299
in the last month,

to Slade Wilson's head

my father's life twice.

either of them.

kill Malcolm?

I encouraged her
to kill me.

My version of being
a supportive father.
