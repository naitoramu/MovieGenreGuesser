00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,315
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,360
The Dante painting.

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:05,760
It's being used
as some sort of

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,513
highly advanced
identification protocol

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,159
within terrorist Circles.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,440
<i>I'm here to
offer you a deal.</i>

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,551
You give us Dante,
you go free.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,031
<i>No one said anything about
sticking a bomb in my head.</i>

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,230
What do you see?

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm with my father
at sea.

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,959
His bodyguard
ha-Hackett,

12
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,309
my dad shot him.

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,736
<i>Your father
was a murderer.</i>

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,513
Mr. Queen is
officially working

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,398
<i>for the SCPD.</i>

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,600
We need to analyze this DNA.

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,856
<i>It belongs to
the new Green Arrow.</i>

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,473
<i>The vigilante
is your sister.</i>

19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,119
The DNA match is on
your father's side.

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,714
<i>He had
a second family.</i>

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,360
<i>How... how could
he abandon them?</i>

22
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
Hello, Emiko.

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,960
We're talking tonight

24
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,317
with two former vigilantes
turned public servants...

25
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,598
Oliver Queen
and Laurel Lance.

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,956
Ms. Lance, you've had
an impressive start

27
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,110
as district attorney.

28
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,079
Tell me what these last few
months have meant to you.

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,277
Well, rich,
when I first got this job,

30
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,511
I didn't think
I could do it,

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,879
considering... the trauma
that I had endured.

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,871
But I wanted to honor
my father's legacy.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,036
And I think
you have.

34
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,759
Well, I know she has.

35
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,880
Mr. Queen,
you've talked before about how much

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,112
your own father's
sacrifice inspired you.

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,475
Yes.

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,916
Do you believe
that's his legacy?

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,034
Hello, Emiko.

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,479
I know everything.

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,673
You've wasted your time
coming here.

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,674
What our father did to
you, to your mother

43
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,399
was unforgivable.

44
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,114
I need to try and make
things right.

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,353
My father did sacrifice
himself for me, and...

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,310
I'll always be grateful.

47
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,632
Still, that experience
on the raft...

48
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,554
just the two of you...

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,111
watching your father commit
suicide right before your eyes,

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,554
that must have been
hArrowing.

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,798
What a true hero
your father was.

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,000
I can prove to you that
I'm nothing like him.

53
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,395
You're a Queen.

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,256
All you know how to do is
leverage your own privilege

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,396
to help yourself.

56
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
What happened to you
was wrong.

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,269
You should have been

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,794
a part of our lives.

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,270
You should be a part
of my life now.

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Why do you think

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,432
I want anything to
do with the Queens?

62
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,160
'Cause your family destroys
everything it touches.

63
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,550
I just want a chance.

64
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,119
Just give me a chance.

65
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
Emiko...

66
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,189
You're my sister.

67
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,439
I have no family.

68
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,836
My goal has always been
to serve this city.

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,994
I understand that
there are people who...

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,720
they disagreed with my
methods before.

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,238
So I would like to assure
the people of Star City

72
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,199
I will no longer be hiding
in the shadows,

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,639
and I promise to always
be on the side of the law.

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,795
I believe that trust
can be built

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,475
through transparency.

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,393
And I'm gonna prove it.

77
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,798
Thank you.

78
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,936
You were amazing.

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,616
You were genuine and
heartfelt and amazing,

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,633
and for a second there,
I almost believed that you liked Laurel.

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,200
I almost do.

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,440
If Dinah's goal is
to convince the city

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,630
to accept you
as SCPD,

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,279
I would say
mission accomplished.

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,039
We'll see.

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
Emiko will come
around, too.

87
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,720
Well, she has every right
to be angry.

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,231
My father abandoned her.
I just...

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,989
I need her to see

90
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,430
that he and I are not
the same person.

91
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,989
Well, she will, because
you're not the same person.

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
Look, that was
an excellent first step.

93
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,279
If you can prove
yourself to the city,

94
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,829
you can convince your sister
to give you a chance.

95
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,151
I hope you're right.

96
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,791
You're here because
A.R.G.U.S. is assembling

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,111
a unique task force,

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,669
and you've been identified
as a potential candidate.

99
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,552
For a bomb in my head?
No, thanks.

100
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,835
I heard what happened

101
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,400
to the members
of your last squad.

102
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,880
We are offering you a chance

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
to lessen your
prison sentence

104
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,671
by repaying your debt
to society.

105
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,752
And what about
your debt to society?

106
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,479
Arrow was a criminal,

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,994
and you fought
alongside him.

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,232
You've Demonstrated
a severe negative response

109
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,913
to male authority figures.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,119
Yeah. Well, when you grow up
with a father like mine...

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,994
Daddy issues.

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,832
You're only alive right now
because of your friends.

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,836
Welcome back to
A.R.G.U.S., Ms. Cutter.

114
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,197
"Ms. Cutter." So formal.

115
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,555
Tell us about
a challenge

116
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,438
that you've worked
to overcome.

117
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,515
Well, the love of my life
rejected me...

118
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,749
For a blonde.

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,752
What the hell
is going on?

120
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,277
China white, spawn of Slade,
and now cupid?

121
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,352
It's like the ghost of
villains past in here.

122
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,760
Have we met?

123
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,912
Agent Holt, a word.

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,837
You're not my type.

125
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,999
The ghost initiative
is just

126
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,600
a cooler-sounding
name for suicide s...

127
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
look, I know you're angry,
but this is about Dante.

128
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,675
So I was right.

129
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,672
There's a hidden meaning
in that painting.

130
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,353
It turns out Dante's
a person...

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,550
a very dangerous one.

132
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,256
Intel from our
overseas office indicates

133
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,555
that he is the financier

134
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,235
behind dozens of terrorist
attacks all over the world.

135
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,776
Apparently, there's
only a few people

136
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,632
who have
direct contact with Dante.

137
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,757
We tracked one back to
a compound in Egypt.

138
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,639
We get a hold of this guy,
we catch Dante,

139
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,736
and the ghost initiative is
our best shot at doing that.

140
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,353
How did you all
find all this out?

141
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,318
Why was I left
in the dark?

142
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,710
The lead came from
a source...

143
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,315
our first member in
the ghost initiative.

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,589
Have you all lost your mind?

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
Ricardo Diaz?!

146
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,157
The same Ricardo Diaz
we just put in prison,

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,390
the guy who stabbed me,

148
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,870
who tried to kill all of us
about 17 times? This...

149
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,599
Curtis, we know that
it's not ideal.

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,593
That is the definition
of an understatement.

151
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

152
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,595
No one knows, and it has
to stay that way.

153
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,856
A.R.G.U.S. knows that we
restarted the ghost initiative,

154
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,758
but they don't know that
we're using them

155
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,069
to go after Dante.

156
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,936
And if they did,
they would kill the mission.

157
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,792
Remember Switzerland?

158
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,952
Now that you're looped in,
we need your help.

159
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,992
I'm not putting any bombs
in anyone's heads.

160
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,276
I don't care how evil
that head might be.

161
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,430
You don't have to.

162
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,113
We just need you
to make sure

163
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,396
the bomb tech isn't rejected
by the subjects' bodies

164
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,550
after insertion.

165
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,936
Yeah, 'cause that's
so much better.

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,112
Curtis, this is how
we catch Dante.

167
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,714
And it's not a request.

168
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,955
I hope you like
malbec.

169
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,077
If it's alcohol,
I love it.

170
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Good. Well, actually,
I don't know

171
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,080
your Earth-Two
situation.

172
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
Maybe you shouldn't be
drinking?

173
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,800
Oh, please.

174
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,111
I don't have a problem
with alcohol,

175
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,839
maybe the first thing
I've managed

176
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,474
to one-up
your Laurel on.

177
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,314
Well, then here you go.

178
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,073
So what's going on?

179
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
What do you mean?

180
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,720
You told me to meet
you here.

181
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Mm-hmm.

182
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,280
Usually, there's a reason,

183
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,919
like a kidnapping

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,595
or maybe you need help
torturing someone again.

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
I just wanted
to celebrate with you

186
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,918
after your incredible
interview.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,913
Oh. OK.

188
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,119
Quentin would be
really proud of you,

189
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,680
the work you've done
as a D.A.

190
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,355
and the person that
you've become.

191
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,800
Really.

192
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,150
Thank you.

193
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,273
I'll be right back,
but pace yourself

194
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,120
because we are gonna
drink this whole bottle.

195
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,153

<i>It is a must to know

That's impossible.

208
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,750
Hello, Brett.

209
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,314
Who the hell are you?

210
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,960
I discovered
a new talent.

211
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,352
I thought you should be
the first to hear it.

212
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,755
We both know you're not as
perfect as you say you are.

213
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,551
You should be behind bars.

214
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,994
I think you've had
enough, buddy.

215
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,755
Let's go.

216
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,952
What just happened?
Who's that guy?

217
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,679
I guess not everyone's
a fan of the D.A.

218
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,274
OK, but the wine, the wine.

219
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,879
Oh, my producer loves
the piece.

220
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,395
Yeah. He thinks it's
gonna be huge.

221
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,360
Yeah, I'm still here.

222
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,237
Hey. I'm gonna have
to call you...

223
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,096
Rich Kannon left the
studio just after 8:00

224
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,190
to meet his wife
for dinner

225
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,456
but never made it
to the restaurant.

226
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,640
Never even made it
to his car.

227
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,936
They found it in
a parking lot this morning.

228
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,996
Security cameras?

229
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,514
Every single one
of them shorted out

230
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,360
just a few minutes before
Kannon disappeared.

231
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,760
Oh. Overhead lights
were blown.

232
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,240
Suggests a power surge.

233
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,696
That means our
kidnapper knows his way

234
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,790
around an
electrical grid.

235
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,678
That takes planning.

236
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,136
This wasn't just
some Random attack.

237
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,391
Well, maybe someone saw
my interview

238
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,551
and didn't like
what they saw.

239
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,359
This doesn't feel like
a coincidence.

240
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,590
Well, probably not.

241
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,600
But until we know more,
we can't assume anything.

242
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,836
Captain, you need
to see this.

243
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,832
<i>Oliver Queen is not a hero.</i>

244
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,120
<i>He's a fraud and a liar.</i>

245
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,953
<i>He does not
deserve to represent</i>

246
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,554
<i>the people of Star City.</i>

247
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,270
<i>And if he does not quit
the SCPD,</i>

248
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,876
<i>measures will be taken,
people will suffer.</i>

249
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,273
How's the analysis
coming?

250
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,656
Almost finished
with my algorithm.

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,536
And then after that,
I should be ready to start testing,

252
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,155
assuming they don't
trip-walk into the bathroom

253
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,197
and accidentally set off
the bombs in their neck.

254
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,680
I guess that saves me
from asking

255
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,195
if you're still having
a problem with all this.

256
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,997
Look, I know these are
bad people,

257
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,639
but what we're doing
is inhumane.

258
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,518
Curtis, restoring
the program is

259
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,034
the only way we
can get Dante

260
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,389
without A.R.G.U.S.
oversight.

261
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,437
And that makes it right?

262
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,273
How can you be OK with that?

263
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,477
I'm not. I'm not.

264
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,956
We are fighting evil

265
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,350
that most people don't
even know exists.

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,760
And sometimes that
means making

267
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,190
very difficult
decisions, Curtis.

268
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,911
The bombs are just
a failsafe. That's all.

269
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,880
There has to be
a better way.

270
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,394
I wish there were.

271
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,856
<i>District attorney
Laurel Lance entering</i>

272
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,030
<i>Queen residence.</i>

273
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,112
Phase one is online
and operational.

274
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,429
What the hell was that?

275
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,256
Just a little something
I've been working on.

276
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,910
Oh, good. That's why
I'm here, actually.

277
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,196
I was hoping to utilize
some of your skills

278
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,555
to help me with something.

279
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,074
- Ooh.
- Hypothetically...

280
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,719
OK, let me
stop you right there

281
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,712
because we both know that
"hypothetically" means

282
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,598
that this is
definitely happening.

283
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
I need to know if someone
from Earth-Two is here.

284
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,840
OK. That's not where
I thought you were going

285
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
with that.

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,514
Is it that guy
from the bar?

287
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,876
I knew you recognized
him. Who is he?

288
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,792
The more I know,
the more I can help you.

289
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,834
Do you remember
when I helped you

290
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,152
with that whole torturing
the assassin thing?

291
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,469
No questions asked?

292
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,120
Vaguely. OK, fine.

293
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,873
I will see what
Cisco can dig up,

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,880
but then we are done
playing hypothetical games.

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,036
Deal.

296
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,634
His name's Brett Collins.

297
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,315
You know, one of
these days,

298
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,756
you are going to realize
that you can trust people.

299
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,392
- Hey.
- Yeah.

300
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,512
You know, we knew
not everyone was

301
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,637
gonna be a fan of
you working here.

302
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,096
I mean, you should see
my stack of hate mail,

303
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,456
and that was without
everyone knowing about me.

304
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,951
Mm-mm. This guy's
an amateur.

305
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,396
The video quality,
the execution...

306
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
he's new at this.

307
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,916
He also didn't do a very good
job covering his tracks.

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
The video was uploaded
from a coffee shop

309
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,518
in the souTheast
quadrant of The Glades.

310
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Do we have satellite
imagery there?

311
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,832
I think so.
Hold on.

312
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,673
What are we looking for?

313
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,632
We're looking
for windows.

314
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,274
If he didn't know
to cover his tracks,

315
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,716
he might not have gone
too far from home.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,800
There.

317
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,198
That's a match.

318
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,600
Let's go get him.

319
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,910
Kannon's been moved.

320
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,759
Nothing down here either.

321
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,313
I got a visual,
souTheast corner.

322
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,234
Copy. Closing in from below.

323
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,076
Oh, god. Please help me!

324
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,234
Come on, now.

325
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,155
You don't want
to do that.

326
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,315
Wrong. People without the last
name Queen are human beings, too.

327
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,074
Oh. Oh, god.

328
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,470
I got Kannon. Anyone
have eyes on the target?

329
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,235
Lost him.

330
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,756
We got the reporter.

331
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,990
The kidnapper
got away.

332
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,856
That's not the only thing
that's bothering you.

333
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,314
It was something
that he said:

334
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,990
"People without the last name
Queen are human beings, too."

335
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,309
Oh, and you disagree?

336
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,599
I agree.
The timing's funny.

337
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,416
What with your secret half-sister
mysteriously returning into your life,

338
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
it's strange.

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,955
It's not that it's
strange. It's familiar.

340
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,760
The psychiatric records
from slabside

341
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,832
that you leaked
to the press.

342
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,957
Can you pull up my
transcript with Dr. Parker?

343
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,936
Not exactly sure what that
has to do with anything,

344
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,633
but, yes, I can.

345
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,439
Thank you.

346
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,870
Here you go.

347
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,336
Can you scroll down
a little bit, please?

348
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,510
- Mm-hmm.
- There.

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,639
"What became of Hackett?

350
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,234
"Your father shot him.
Then what?

351
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,993
"He doesn't matter
in this story,

352
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,117
"just collateral damage?

353
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,876
People without the last name
Queen are human beings, too."

354
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,792
The files I sent to
the press were redacted.

355
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,736
The ones you sent to
the D.A. weren't.

356
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,831
So the kidnapper
hacked them, but why?

357
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,832
Why these particular
sessions with Parker?

358
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,758
Can you look up Hackett,
first name David?

359
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,791
Hackett, David,
died in 2007.

360
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,958
Survived by his son Sam,
no other living relatives.

361
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,554
I met Sam a few times
growing up.

362
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,080
Yeah, he's got quite
the rap sheet...

363
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,719
assault,
assault with intent,

364
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,792
a bunch of drunk
and disorderlies.

365
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,792
His father was
lost at sea.

366
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,917
Or so he thought

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,640
until he read your
sessions with Parker.

368
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,076
And he found out his
father was murdered

369
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,989
by my father.

370
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,231
Emiko was right.

371
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,553
My family destroys
everything it touches.

372
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,074
Crap.

373
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,153
Hey, I have to go.

374
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,913
- OK.
- And I'm sorry.

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,753
I love you.

376
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,354
I love you, too.

377
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,993
Lookie here.
Mr. Terrific.

378
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,118
It's been a while,
my friend.

379
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,271
You look
a little nervous.

380
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,760
Is that because
the last time we met

381
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,520
I had my knife
in your gut?

382
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,714
Wasn't personal.

383
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,110
It's probably best not to
talk during the procedure.

384
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,630
Hey.

385
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,713
He looks a little nervous,
doesn't he?

386
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,398
I can smell it on him
from here.

387
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,716
It's OK, sweetie.
I'll protect you.

388
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,256
You know, it's
really gonna be nice

389
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,193
to finally have some
peace and quiet.

390
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,440
What the hell
are you doing?

391
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,557
Making sure the bombs
inside of your neck work.

392
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,791
But to do that,
I need to turn them off,

393
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,190
which means that you have
to take a nap.

394
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,433
It's strange...

395
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,920
you thinking
it's a good idea

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,753
to give me drugs.

397
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,830
No. No, no, no, no.

398
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,434
This can't be right.

399
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,270
I thought you were
some kind of genius.

400
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,553
- Wake 'em up!
- Not a chance.

401
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,677
I said, wake them up!

402
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,037
OK, OK.
It doesn't matter.

403
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,440
Even once you get
out that door,

404
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,056
A.R.G.U.S. guards are
gonna be all over you.

405
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,514
You let me worry
about that.

406
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,080
Move!

407
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,071
Up. Hey. Get up.

408
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,399
What the hell's going on?

409
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,274
Early release
for good behavior.

410
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,599
What about the bombs
in our necks?

411
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,433
Thanks to our friend here,

412
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,749
out of commission.

413
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,874
Move.

414
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,036
You're still
a disgusting drunk.

415
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,634
You haven't
changed a bit.

416
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,873
But you have.

417
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,034
Look at you, pretending
to be reformed,

418
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,632
playing make-believe lawyer
in those fancy D.A. suits.

419
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,353
You're a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

420
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,680
a wolf that this city
needs to be rid of.

421
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,478
You should have stayed
on Earth-Two.

422
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,880
What the hell is Earth-Two?

423
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,872
You know,
threatening me...

424
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,719
That was a bad idea.

425
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,598
Then again,
your judgment's

426
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,876
in a perpetual state
of impairment.

427
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,475
I should've finished
you off the first time,

428
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,354
although I doubt anybody
would've missed you.

429
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,476
Laurel!

430
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
We're leaving now.

431
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,990
You followed me here?

432
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,197
I didn't follow you. I...
I... I followed your DNA,

433
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,794
which you left on
my door handle.

434
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,336
It's all part of this new
program that I'm working on

435
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,589
that tracks
genetic material.

436
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,639
And here I thought I only had one
stalker that I had to worry about.

437
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,040
So you should be
flattered

438
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,680
because I only stalk
people that I like.

439
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,840
And now that I've found you,

440
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,515
you are going to tell me
what is going on.

441
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,376
Hey,
I know you're new to this whole cop thing,

442
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,313
but the SCPD is not exactly
too popular in The Glades.

443
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Right.

444
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,591
Where are we anyway?

445
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,399
Kidnapper's apartment.

446
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,755
His name is Sam Hackett,

447
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,911
and he has a degree in
electrical engineering,

448
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,874
and he has motive.

449
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,676
His father, Dave, was
my father's bodyguard

450
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,672
on <i>the Queen's Gambit.</i>

451
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,070
Wh... why would he be going
after you for that?

452
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,838
Dave made it
to the life raft

453
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,519
with my father and I.

454
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
When my father
realized

455
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,911
that only one of us
could survive,

456
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,394
he shot him.

457
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I didn't know.

458
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,159
Nobody knew until
Dr. Parker.

459
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,637
Sam Hackett, SCPD.
Open up.

460
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,117
Huh. Sam had
a search trip planned

461
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,554
to the North China Sea.

462
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,190
I'm sorry. He was still
looking for his father?

463
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,119
Still holding out hope
he was alive? Why?

464
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,919
Because you survived.

465
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
And here are

466
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,438
my unredacted transcripts
with Dr. Parker.

467
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,677
All these years, Dinah.

468
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,317
All these years he
never got closure.

469
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,673
Oliver.

470
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,834
You got to see this.

471
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,474
Looks like he was building
some sort of weapon.

472
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,032
Remember, they're the
ones that need us alive,

473
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,316
not the other way
around.

474
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,557
I love it when
a plan comes together.

475
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,240
Looking for these?

476
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,076
You just keep trying
and failing.

477
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,194
This time I came prepared.

478
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,870
Not prepared enough.

479
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,270
This time, I'm gonna
finish the job.

480
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,997
This is the dragon.

481
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,480
A.R.G.U.S. is coming
for you.

482
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,736
<i>And we'll be sure to send him</i>

483
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,479
<i>your regards
when we do.</i>

484
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,676
<i>What's the matter?</i>

485
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,558
<i>You look like you've
heard a ghost.</i>

486
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,837
What the hell just happened?

487
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,436
Well, first, I overrode
the explosive program

488
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,034
A.R.G.U.S. put inside
your head

489
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,191
with a virtual reality
simulation that

490
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,839
started running about
20 minutes before

491
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,752
you remember getting
your sedative.

492
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,514
Then I owned your ass.

493
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,478
You're dead.

494
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,995
No. See,
that all happened in your head, too.

495
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,833
By the way, harsh.

496
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,314
Get me out of here.

497
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,616
See, I don't think you're gonna
want to be getting out of here

498
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,758
because if you were to do that,
Dante would be waiting for you.

499
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,116
And I think he's gonna be
really pissed when he finds out

500
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,352
you gave us everything
we need to get him.

501
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,231
A.R.G.U.S. thanks you
for your cooperation.

502
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,711
<i>As Star City's newest kidnapper
continues to elude the police,</i>

503
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,439
<i>there have been renewed calls</i>

504
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,557
<i>demanding Oliver Queen
step down.</i>

505
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,040
<i>A recent poll showed</i>

506
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,272
<i>that as many as 77%
of Star City citizens</i>

507
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,239
<i>would support his removal
from the sc...</i>

508
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,176
Any luck with the evidence
at Hackett's place?

509
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,016
Well, the guys in tech are
still working on I.D.-ing

510
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,997
the fragments, but judging
from his notes,

511
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,309
plan "b" involves
a lot more

512
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,676
than just kidnapping
a reporter.

513
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
But we can't stop him if
we don't know where he is.

514
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,517
I know one way you
can stop him...

515
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,313
fire me.

516
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,790
77% of Star City
agrees with me.

517
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,795
So that's what this
is about, public opinion?

518
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,314
No. I...

519
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,879
I wore that mask
for a reason.

520
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,030
Now that I've taken
it off,

521
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,176
maybe the consequences are
finally catching up with me.

522
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,793
Well, you can't take
responsibility

523
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,111
for every choice some
lunatic makes, you know?

524
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
No. I have to take
responsibility for this.

525
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,793
Me being on the force

526
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,712
puts your reputation
at risk,

527
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,519
and it's putting lives
in danger.

528
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,596
Cops face risks every day.
That is the job.

529
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,751
And you are not putting
anyone's life in danger,

530
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,236
not unless you stop
fighting for them.

531
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,816
You think you're gonna do
one interview,

532
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,576
and all of a sudden, your
problems go away overnight?

533
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,990
I think I have been
so obsessed

534
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,912
with proving to people
I'm not my father

535
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,151
that I didn't stop
and look at all the ways

536
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,993
that I am exactly
like him.

537
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,278
I should have come clean
with Sam years ago.

538
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,510
But you didn't,

539
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,593
and you can't stop the past
from haunting you.

540
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,056
The only thing you have
control over is

541
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,117
what you do going forward.

542
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,256
Let me break
this down for you

543
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,736
in words that I think that you're
going to be able to understand.

544
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
You are the D.A.

545
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,991
You cannot be seen
attacking Randos

546
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,639
outside of a bar!

547
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,837
Brett Collins isn't a Rando.

548
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,915
He's supposed to be dead.

549
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,356
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?!

550
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,474
Collins is the drunk driver
who killed my father, OK?

551
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,954
I was 13.

552
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,478
And I spent so many years
just dreaming

553
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,677
of the ways that I was
gonna make him pay.

554
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,399
And you know what? I did.

555
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,914
When I got my cry,

556
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,435
I tracked him down,
and I killed him.

557
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,480
Or at least I
thought I had killed him,

558
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,233
but, apparently,
he's still alive

559
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,552
and... and stalking me
on another Earth. Here.

560
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,789
What? What?

561
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,032
It's you haven't had
a problem talking about

562
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,476
the dozens of other people
that you have killed.

563
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,632
Um, so why... oh, why keep
this one a secret?

564
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,871
If someone
had killed my dad,

565
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,599
I would want
revenge, too.

566
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,678
Collins... he caused
the accident

567
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,831
that killed my father,

568
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,037
but he wasn't the reason
my father died.

569
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,555
He never should've been
on the road that day.

570
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,875
He was working a lot,
which...

571
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,476
I hated...

572
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,794
But I knew on my birthday

573
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,951
that we would be
able to celebrate,

574
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,160
only he...

575
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,117
He showed up
without my cake,

576
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,877
and I threw a tantrum.

577
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,997
So he went back out.

578
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,837
That's when Collins drove
him off the road.

579
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,920
And do you know
the last words

580
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,832
that I said to my father?

581
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,992
The last thing that I said
to him was "I hate you."

582
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,232
My dad died because of me.

583
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,358
Well, now that you've
said it out loud,

584
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,797
can you understand
how irrational that is?

585
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,035
This is exactly the reason

586
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,349
I've never told
anyone before.

587
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,798
Well, you should've
so that that someone

588
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,631
could tell you that
it's not your fault.

589
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,192
If someone is after you
on this Earth

590
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,956
or on any other Earth,
we are going to get him

591
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,953
whoever they are, together.

592
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,916
Officer selway,
what do you got?

593
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,957
There's something strange
about these fragments.

594
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,032
There's a partial etching
on some of them.

595
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,376
Separately,
they don't mean much,

596
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,914
but you put them together,

597
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,912
you get the logo for
Star City electric.

598
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,957
They use it to tag
proprietary parts.

599
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,096
Well, Hackett has a background
in electrical engineering.

600
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,351
Do you think he was
moonlighting for this company?

601
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,590
I ran his soc.

602
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,558
There's no record of him
working there.

603
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,677
Maybe try Dave Hackett.

604
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,678
After his father died,
Sam spiraled.

605
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,190
Severe depression,
got picked up for drugs.

606
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
If he wanted to get a job,

607
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:30,696
he'd have to find a way
to hide that.

608
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
Well, damn.

609
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,856
Someone
with the father's soc

610
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,190
has been working at
sc electric since 2015.

611
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,239
Hey, doesn't the sce use GPS
trackers in their work vans now?

612
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,630
Yup, I'll run a trace.

613
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,789
How did that 240 go?

614
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,918
A couple of drunk frat
bros. Waste of time.

615
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,320
What's going on
over there?

616
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,993
I guess the box
needed work.

617
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,195
And 3, 2, 1. Bam. Huh.

618
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,509
Found
the location?

619
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,195
Yeah, but it can't be right.
It says the Van's here.

620
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,397
Hey, did
somebody call this in?

621
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,509
Not yet.

622
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,437
- Come on!
- What's happening?

623
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,514
You OK?

624
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,319
Yeah.

625
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,795
Dinah, you OK?

626
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,155
What the hell was that?

627
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,720
I don't know.

628
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,750
That was only a warning.

629
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,309
Because you've aided and abetted
Oliver Queen,

630
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,074
you're all going to suffer.

631
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,755
Uh!

632
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,958
The static generated
by the electricity

633
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,713
coursing through these
walls right now,

634
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,553
it makes this vest

635
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,271
and every substance that
can hold a current deadly.

636
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,113
What the hell do you want?

637
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,233
Oliver Queen.

638
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,357
Until I find him,

639
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,750
every minute,
a body drops.

640
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,911
He must've hacked into
the electrical grid.

641
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,536
I want you to get outside,
and shut it down.

642
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I'll stall him.

643
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,075
How? He wants you dead.

644
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,435
Just hurry.

645
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,675
So much for your hero.

646
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,911
Who's ready to die?

647
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,357
Sam, that's enough.

648
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,598
You want me? I'm right here.

649
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,831
But I need you to let
these people go.

650
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,434
They have nothing
to do with this.

651
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,670
Of course they do.

652
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,399
Scpd, the news.

653
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,560
They're the ones who
allow you

654
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,354
to fool everyone into
thinking you're a hero,

655
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,636
but I know
what you really are.

656
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,030
I'm a liar, right, Sam?

657
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,715
Because I did lie
about your father.

658
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,032
He was on
<i>the Queen's Gambit.</i>

659
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,080
He made it to the life raft.

660
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,759
And before my father
took his own life,

661
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,749
he murdered your dad

662
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,994
so that I could survive.

663
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,078
Good. You finally...
you finally admit it.

664
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,311
I was worried that I was
gonna be judged

665
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,357
by the sins of my father...

666
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:54,279
But... but not coming to you
for all of these years

667
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,159
and not telling
you the truth,

668
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,396
I never gave you a chance
to get closure.

669
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,838
That's on me.

670
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,153
I'm truly sorry.

671
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,633
No, no, no, no.

672
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,792
We are way, way
past apologies.

673
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,873
My father is gone
because of you,

674
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,633
and I need to make
that right.

675
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,390
Uh!

676
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,758
I'm going to give
everyone here

677
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,752
the chance to make
a decision

678
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,556
my father never got to...
whether to live or die.

679
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,031
Sam, no one is dying
tonight.

680
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,955
Kill him, you live.
Don't, you all fry.

681
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,278
You have till
the count of 3. 1...

682
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,113
Don't do this, Sam.

683
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,112
2...

684
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,710
I don't want to die.

685
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,319
If you really believe

686
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,636
that you have to do this,

687
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,793
I understand.

688
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
3.

689
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,159
Pull the damn
trigger.

690
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,837
Then I guess we all die.

691
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,076
Gun!

692
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,993
Like I said,
nobody dies tonight.

693
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,759
That includes you.

694
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,800
I think the entire city

695
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,157
can sleep a little more
soundly knowing that

696
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,311
Sam Hackett is
behind bars.

697
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,711
Well, that's the reason
I asked to be here today.

698
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,837
I'd like to set
the record straight.

699
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,039
12 years ago,

700
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,673
when my father's
boat went down...

701
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,751
He and I weren't
the only two people

702
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,479
to reach the life raft.

703
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,677
A third individual,
his bodyguard, Dave Hackett,

704
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,274
was also aboard.

705
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,955
Now, when my father
realized that there

706
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,716
wasn't enough food and water
for everyone, as you know,

707
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,440
he sacrificed himself
for me.

708
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,760
But before he took
his own life,

709
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,952
he took Dave Hackett's.

710
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,718
Your father killed
Dave Hackett.

711
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,678
My father killed
Dave Hackett.

712
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,874
The people of s-Star City
deserve the truth.

713
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,235
Why come forward now?

714
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,837
Hackett has been
apprehended.

715
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,434
The threat is over.

716
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,671
Because transparency
is about

717
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,471
more than just not
wearing a mask.

718
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,314
I've made mistakes.

719
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,830
I'm sure that I will
make mistakes again.

720
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,075
But what I will not
do is lie.

721
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,276
That is my promise to you,

722
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,599
the people of Star City.

723
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,120
I have waited
a long time

724
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,590
to wipe the smirk
off of Diaz's face.

725
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,400
Curtis, this is
very, very good work.

726
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,120
Well, I am happy to help
make Diaz's life miserable

727
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,520
anytime, anywhere.

728
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,512
Your vr program, it is
a game changer.

729
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,954
Now that we got
the Dante info,

730
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,256
we can get rid of those
neck bombs

731
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,696
and finally cancel
the ghost initiative

732
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,393
once and for all, right?

733
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,875
Right?

734
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,114
Curtis...

735
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,232
The ghost initiative program
still has value.

736
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,959
We need boots on the ground.

737
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,016
Look, thanks to you, we can
now get in their heads,

738
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,032
predict problems before
they arise.

739
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,191
This is going to save
a lot of lives in the field.

740
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,794
Except maybe theirs.

741
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,917
When the Dante threat
is over,

742
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,311
I promise you we will shut
this thing down for good.

743
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
There's always gonna be
another Dante.

744
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,155
There's always gonna be

745
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,416
a logical reason to
compromise,

746
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,193
but I'm not
doing that anymore.

747
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,515
We've had this conversation.

748
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,159
Walking away is not
the answer.

749
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,760
Oh, I'm not
walking away.

750
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,556
I'm just not
going to be

751
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,360
following orders
blindly anymore either.

752
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,639
I'm gonna call
my own shots.

753
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,119
A stalker from
a different Earth.

754
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,120
Of course.
Why wouldn't there be?

755
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,670
Ah. I hope you're not
leaving

756
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,353
because I have
some good news.

757
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,032
We have Brett Collins
in custody.

758
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,360
And after what you just
told me,

759
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,416
I'm gonna make sure he stays
there for a very long time.

760
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,510
But how can you hold him

761
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,353
for crimes he committed
on another Earth?

762
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,193
This scumbag is,
unfortunately,

763
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,834
our Earth's problem.

764
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,957
Beat cop picked him up
for public intoxication,

765
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,271
and it looks like he has
a history of stalking

766
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,192
and anti-vigilante violence.

767
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Well, that makes sense.

768
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,496
I mean, he would've seen
your interview,

769
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,352
and you are the former
Black Canary, so...

770
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,399
And the Karma gods must
really be on your side,

771
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,312
because Cisco just texted

772
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,754
that Brett Collins
from your Earth

773
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,475
died 5 years ago
on his porch

774
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,835
from unknown causes.

775
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,957
So 5 minutes ago,
I had 2 Brett problems,

776
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,110
and now I have none.

777
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
None.

778
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,278
Well, thank you. Thank
you to the both of you.

779
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,239
It's not so bad having
other people back you up,

780
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,470
is it?

781
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,316
Hey.

782
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,236
Laurel has
a stalker?

783
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,312
Yeah, it's been a crazy
couple of days.

784
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,629
Yup.

785
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,632
Speaking of,
I saw your interview.

786
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,336
I'm so proud of you. That
couldn't have been easy.

787
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
It's a start.

788
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,670
It's gonna take a lot more
to convince this city

789
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,830
I've changed.

790
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,792
Oh, I think you'd be
surprised.

791
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,593
I, um, I forgot...

792
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,433
I forgot something
over here.

793
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,599
I saw your interview.

794
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,433
Hmm.

795
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,634
That took guts.

796
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,359
It was the truth.

797
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,200
It took me too long
to say it.

798
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,914
But you did.

799
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,719
And that's a start.

800
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,636
When I was little,
I imagined

801
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,315
what it'd be like to live
in the Queen mansion.

802
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,158
Your lives seemed
so glamorous...

803
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,953
But even more than that,
I imagined

804
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,157
what it must have been like
to have a family.

805
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,870
Your father robbed me
of that,

806
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,872
something I swore I could
never forgive.

807
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,720
But I see now you
are different from him.

808
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,519
I'm trying to be.

809
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,918
Does all this mean
you're ready to talk?

810
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,199
It means I'm ready to
think about talking.

811
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,599
I'll take that.

812
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,680
Greg, move your head!
