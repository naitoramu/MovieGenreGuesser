1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
Let's take some calls
From the request line

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,280
Caller number one

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,820
Hey, man, what's up?

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,870
This is Dominique
From Shady Knoll Trailer Park

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,780
What's up, Dominique?

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,120
I wanna hear that song
From Lil Jon and Petey Pablo

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,370
A'ight
I got that coming right up for ya

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,380
Now shout out the radio station
That gave you what you wanted

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,790
W boom boom beat, baby!

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,400
Luge! Luge! Luge! Luge! Luge! Luge!

11
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,500
Yeah!

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,880
- Come on.
- Come on!

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,630
- Go for it!
- Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

14
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,710
Professor Reed called
my thesis "bromidic."

15
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,300
I had to look it up.
Do you know what "bromidic" means?

16
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,970
- Yeah, it means, like, dull, right?
- Right.

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,570
What's your major again? English?

18
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,610
Oh, no, I'm taking kind of a gap year.

19
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,950
- Later.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,290
Yo, let me get a gram.

21
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,420
Uh... Yeah, that'll be $100.

22
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,470
How about a student discount?

23
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,260
Yeah, that's cute.

24
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,010
Come on, help me out.
I can give you, like, $60.

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,140
That's beer money. I don't sell beer.

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,220
Okay.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,730
Hey!

28
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,520
Hey!

29
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,910
Attachment is the root of suffering.

30
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,910
- Give it back.
- Here!

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,420
Apologize.

32
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,630
Suck my dick.

33
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,220
- I'm sorry!
- Yeah, I didn't quite catch that.

34
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,970
- God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Now he's sorry.

35
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,470
Come on. Come on.

36
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,390
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,110
Namaste.

38
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
What?

39
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,450
"Namaste."

40
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,710
Shut up. How'd we do?

41
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,250
Thank God for midterms.

42
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,550
Shit.

43
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,720
Shit.

44
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Hey.

45
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,600
Yeah, yeah, I know. I just... I overslept.

46
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,390
No, no, no, no, I stayed at Rhiannon's.

47
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,400
Okay, okay, relax.
Relax, I'll be there in a minute. Okay?

48
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,480
I gotta go.

49
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,940
Shit, shit.

50
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
Okay.

51
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,570
Okay.

52
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,970
Shit.

53
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,210
Karen?

54
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,590
Comin'.

55
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,720
Sorry, sorry. I'm here.

56
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,930
Hey. You were at Lynch's
picking up pastries.

57
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
- Thank you.
- Where the hell have you been?

58
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,150
Sorry, I was at the bakery
getting pastries,

59
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,530
but they're not ready yet.

60
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,371
- Alice says hi, by the way.
- Your brother coulda done that.

61
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,660
I need you here to prep the front.
You know that.

62
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,220
- Yeah, sorry.
- Yeah, it's my bad, Pop.

63
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,990
I had to work the grill,
I asked her to go.

64
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
I'm not set up for the day.
I'm drownin' here.

65
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,160
Dad, I did most of my prep last night.
I have to make coffee and set tables.

66
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,370
- But it's all under control, okay?
- Get to it, then.

67
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,170
I got it.

68
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,890
6:01, Karen.

69
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,270
Nice to see you, too.

70
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,980
How's that?

71
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,360
I said your coffee's on me today.

72
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,070
Eggs and sausage?

73
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,990
If it's not too much trouble for ya.

74
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,080
Houston, we have liftoff!

75
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,040
- Sausage and eggs?
- Uh, he wants a BLT today.

76
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Really?

77
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,790
Oh. Ha!

78
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,750
Hey, have I told you lately that you suck?

79
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,260
Yeah, probably.

80
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,760
- Where's Dad?
- Delivery's here.

81
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,600
No, no, no. Sysco already came this week.

82
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
Uh...

83
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,100
Gorgeous.

84
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,360
- Thanks, Jake.
- Yeah.

85
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,300
- You're gonna love it.
- Dad?

86
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,190
Ah!

87
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,530
- Hey, what's going on?
- Well, it was time, honey.

88
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,780
How could you do this
without talkin' to me?

89
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,910
Well, I got news for you, kid,
I don't need your permission.

90
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,540
This grill costs $5,000.
How are we gonna pay for that?

91
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,710
Pat Condo says they're gonna reopen
the ski runs real soon.

92
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,260
- We're gonna be swarming with customers.
- Pat's been saying that for ten years.

93
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,470
No, look, Jake...
Jake, we gotta send it back. I'm sorry.

94
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,640
No, we're not. You said you had somethin'
you want me to sign, yes?

95
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,970
Yeah, it's in the truck.

96
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,150
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

97
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,480
You'll figure something out, honey.
You always do.

98
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,930
Everything okay?

99
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Yeah.

100
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,390
I had to fetch my own coffee.

101
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,020
Well, when you go back for a refill,
I take mine with milk and two sugars.

102
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,110
Karen, honey,
you're starting to remind me of my wife.

103
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,270
I don't like it.

104
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,230
Need anything else?

105
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,900
New eggs would be nice.

106
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,160
Oh, God. Shit.

107
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,120
I'm so sorry. Just...

108
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,080
Are you okay, toots?

109
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,250
Uh, yeah. No, it's just been dry lately.
I'll get you...

110
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,050
Fresh eggs.

111
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,470
- Is something wrong with 'em?
- No, no. I just dropped 'em. Stupid.

112
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,900
You know, studies show
hand-eye coordination improves 110%

113
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,100
when you're sober.

114
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,820
Maybe use less butter,
and they won't slide off the plate.

115
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,540
Thanks.

116
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,330
Hey...

117
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,670
do we have a regular order
set up with Sysco,

118
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,550
or do we have to, like,
call it in every time?

119
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,950
Why? You looking for a career
in the greasy spoon industry?

120
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,460
Figured I could pull more weight,

121
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,710
- that's all.
- Why?

122
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,970
Why would you suddenly
feel the need for that?

123
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,250
I'm trying to steal your position of power
in the family.

124
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,220
You have somethin' to say, say it,
I got a lot...

125
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,970
- Can you stop being a dick for two...
- Okay, you caught me.

126
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,640
Fine. I do drugs, all right?
I'm a big junkie.

127
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,900
I'm just two lines away from giving
blow jobs for heroin on the street.

128
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,780
Thanks for the intervention.
I won't touch it.

129
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,320
- We done?
- That's not what I'm talking...

130
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,960
If I wanna go blow off steam,
it's none of your goddamn business.

131
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,530
- What? What...
- Read it.

132
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
No, I deferred.

133
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,170
Yeah, I undeferred you.

134
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,630
I believe the traditional response
is, "Thank you."

135
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,310
No, how... How could you do this?

136
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,350
Because you gotta get outta here, Karen.

137
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,980
Oh, I could kill him.

138
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,990
Well, you can't go to college.

139
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,620
You'd miss me too much.

140
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,080
I don't know, I could just get myself
a college boyfriend.

141
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,210
Name's Ian.

142
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,790
He plays lacrosse, by the way.

143
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,630
Sounds like a douche.

144
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,170
He is. But he's hung like a horse.

145
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,010
But seriously...

146
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
you gonna go?

147
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,060
We both know I'm not goin' anywhere.

148
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,240
Nothing's permanent, Karen.

149
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,240
Not even the Buddha.

150
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,450
Mmm.

151
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,450
Fagan Corners is.

152
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,580
Sometimes, I feel like I could
burn that diner down,

153
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,790
and it would just respawn by morning.

154
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,290
Not if you use diesel.

155
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,550
That's good to know.

156
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,050
Well...

157
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,550
It'll come in useful when I can't find
the five grand to pay for that grill.

158
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,720
Your dad needs to stop with that bullshit.

159
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,730
It shouldn't be on you
to take care of him and your brother.

160
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,320
Maybe you should just let
the diner go under.

161
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,730
Yeah, we should.

162
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,570
But it's all he's got left of my mom.

163
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,860
You're trapping yourself
with that guilt shit.

164
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,450
You're way too nice, K.

165
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,120
Yeah, I know.

166
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,370
You know...

167
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,000
if you wanna make some real money,

168
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,170
you could always come
work with me full-time.

169
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,380
- Pay off that grill in a week.
- No.

170
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,420
Seriously. You're good at it.

171
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,840
You and me together, we could
take this thing to the next level.

172
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,260
You could hook up your family
and do shit for yourself.

173
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,770
Every now and then,
we could even go places.

174
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
Tibet. Paris.

175
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,980
Anywhere we want.

176
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,320
Sounds good, right?

177
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,530
Yeah.

178
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,660
Mmm!

179
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,510
Like a dream.

180
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,270
Hey, Dad.

181
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,570
Hey.

182
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,740
- Hey.
- What's goin' on?

183
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,540
Dad said I had to come back right away.

184
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,540
I just wanted you here
for dinner, little girl.

185
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,210
You made, uh...

186
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,800
Karencakes. That's right.
We're celebrating.

187
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,760
Come on. Sit down, honey.
We're gonna have dinner like a family.

188
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,550
We won't be able to
once you go off to college, now will we?

189
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,680
- Hey. What the hell did you tell him?
- The truth.

190
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,940
That you can only defer Georgetown twice,
or you'd have to reapply.

191
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,770
- So you're goin' next term.
- God damn it, Kevin. No.

192
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,740
Don't worry about us, Karen.
You should go.

193
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,570
Dad, I'm not goin' anywhere.

194
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,950
Listen, Kevin and I will get by.

195
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,120
Besides that, you know,
it's obvious you're bored here.

196
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,380
It's affecting your work.

197
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,880
Sorry, you have a problem with my work?

198
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Well, you're late all the time.

199
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,640
You go out most nights, running around
with that Todd Neiman loser.

200
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,400
Do you think it's some big secret?

201
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,020
That's none of your business.

202
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,070
And you think
people don't know what he does?

203
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
Do you think
that I don't know what he does?

204
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,950
- Dad...
- He's the only person

205
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,540
who gives a shit about how I feel.

206
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,250
- He's a loser.
- Dad, she gets it.

207
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,710
And what you do
reflects back on this family.

208
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,000
You think that I don't want
to go to college?

209
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,340
I can't go to college.

210
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,970
If I leave here,
this place will go under in a week.

211
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,510
We'll be fine.

212
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,840
You just bought a grill
that will bankrupt us.

213
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,350
You know what? I'm... I'm sorry,
but Mom used to do everything around here,

214
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,980
- and now I have to...
- Okay, guys, stop.

215
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,270
No! You have no clue
how to run this place.

216
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,310
- I run the front. I do the books.
- Karen, stop.

217
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,110
- This is ridiculous.
- No, Dad, Dad. You are lost in a fog.

218
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,650
The diner has been failing for years,
and you won't admit it.

219
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
You keep clinging to it,

220
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,980
'cause you think Mom's gonna
find her way back somehow.

221
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,950
Well, if she does,
you're not gonna be here,

222
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,590
- so it won't be your problem...
- Yeah, well, Mom hated this place.

223
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,140
She hated this town, you never saw it.

224
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
She loved this place. This was her home.

225
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,380
No, she loved you.
That is the only reason she stuck around.

226
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,550
She felt like she was dying here
a long time before she got cancer.

227
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,590
You take that back.

228
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,850
You ever wonder why Mom
kept buying lottery tickets?

229
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,230
For somethin' to hope on
when she went into remission.

230
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,470
You know what she was hoping?

231
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,560
She was hoping
that if she ever got a second chance,

232
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,150
she would get us the hell out of here.

233
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,030
Well, Mom never got to find out,
so let's see, huh?

234
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,450
Put that down!

235
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,040
What do you think?
One scratch, and we pay off all the bills.

236
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,250
One scratch, and we go our own way.
One last gift from Mom.

237
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,250
Don't.

238
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,050
Karen, please don't.

239
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,860
Mom lost again.

240
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,490
We all lose.

241
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Now we know.

242
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,860
Hey. Shh... Hey.

243
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,570
Hey.

244
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,070
- Let's get you out of here.
- Yeah.

245
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,240
Okay?

246
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,700
Where are you going?

247
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,700
- You can't just leave!
- Kevin...

248
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,870
Shoulda asked her
before you sent that letter.

249
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,460
- I'm not talking to you, asshole.
- Come on, let's just go.

250
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,790
You're lucky your sister's hot.

251
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,380
Hey, does Bernie know you sell, Todd?

252
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,590
- Maybe he should.
- What the hell did you just say?

253
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,880
- You heard me!
- Hey, hey! Hey, hey! No, no, no.

254
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,930
Hey, hey, hey. I'd go to jail, too.
Is that what you want, Kevin?

255
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,560
Just go inside. Come on, just go inside.

256
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,310
Come on, let's go.
Please, let's go. Let's go.

257
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,100
Just go inside, Kevin. Go.

258
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,170
Babe, take it easy.

259
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,820
- What the hell?
- Shit. Kevin?

260
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,330
You stay the hell away from my sister!

261
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,130
- You're dead, asshole!
- No!

262
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,470
Shit.

263
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,050
Todd, no!

264
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,300
No! Hey!

265
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,780
You get away from him, Todd!

266
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,000
Come on, come on, come on! Get up!

267
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,000
Are you crazy?

268
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,130
Okay. Okay.

269
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,200
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
What's the matter with you?

270
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,740
I was gonna fix it!
I was gonna fix it! You ruined it!

271
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,080
Why? Why would you do that?

272
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,710
Huh?

273
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,040
Because... I already lost Mom.

274
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,130
Watch out!

275
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,990
Kev?

276
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,330
Kevin!

277
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Dad.

278
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,460
You weren't there.

279
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
What?

280
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,350
Bernie is gonna say
it was just Kevin in the car.

281
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,430
But...

282
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,390
He's gonna omit...

283
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,560
certain other details.

284
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,570
He said we've suffered enough.

285
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,870
Dad, I...

286
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,710
You'd go to prison.

287
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,260
Thank God your mother
wasn't alive for this.

288
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,640
Reverend Shockne called...

289
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,980
about Kevin's arrangements.

290
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,190
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

291
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
No.

292
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,870
I need you to, uh...

293
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,500
leave.

294
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,430
I don't want you here, Karen.

295
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,230
Uh...

296
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,310
Hi.

297
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,150
You doing okay down here?

298
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,230
Yeah.

299
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Thanks.

300
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,740
Will it offend you if I say
I'll be glad to be gone?

301
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,790
Sister Maggie called.

302
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,000
She said she'd have some options for you
by the end of the day.

303
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,370
You'll be safe soon.

304
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,170
If you say.

305
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:09,260
Well, I'm getting ready to say Mass.
Um, you could come up if you'd like.

306
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,050
Uh, no, no. Thank you. I'm not Catholic.

307
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,550
Hell, if you get strict about it,

308
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,510
neither are most of the people
who come here.

309
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,770
That doesn't mean you shouldn't join us.

310
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,230
A little ritual, a little ancient wisdom.

311
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,110
Not the worst medicine
for a troubled soul.

312
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,700
Jesus. Am I that transparent?

313
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,620
Someone once said that everyone
is fighting a battle of their own...

314
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,920
that you can't see.

315
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,040
But sometimes...

316
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,170
Sometimes...

317
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,220
you can see.

318
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,310
Yeah.

319
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,480
Father, what do you do...

320
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,200
when you realize that you've lost?

321
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:27,960
A man I helped raise as a boy
came to see me recently.

322
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,170
Matt.

323
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,130
I had...

324
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,840
I had a choice of evils.

325
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:43,270
He blames me for the ones I chose,
for the way his life turned out.

326
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,860
I can't argue with him.

327
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,150
I just have to find a way to live with it.

328
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,990
Yeah, but how do you live with that?

329
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,500
Knowing that you...
that you hurt someone like that?

330
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:10,170
Well, you have to realize, Karen,
that whatever it is that you've done...

331
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,460
or haven't done...

332
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,590
it can still be redeemed.

333
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah, that's nice,
but I'm not so sure that I believe that.

334
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:33,490
"Everything will be okay in the end.
If it's not okay, it's not the end."

335
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,660
John Lennon said that.
Who are we to argue with a Beatle?

336
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,580
Do yourself a kindness. Come to Mass.

337
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,470
Karen Page is located
at the Clinton Church.

338
00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:00,430
Keep all NYPD units clear of that location
until otherwise advised. Copy.

339
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,970
There's one more thing
we need to do tonight.

340
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,730
I don't let people know me.

341
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,070
Very few have.

342
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,450
There was one person,
an employee that I let become my friend.

343
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,500
Eventually, he was like a son to me.

344
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,950
James Wesley.

345
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,420
- Yeah.
- I've read his file.

346
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,550
You're like him in many ways.

347
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,090
He, too, was always prepared.

348
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,630
Aware of every detail.

349
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,970
He anticipated my every need.

350
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
He disappeared.

351
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,230
He was murdered!

352
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,030
When I sent you to the Bulletin,
it was to discredit Daredevil

353
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,660
and the reporter who helped him
become a hero.

354
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,620
I didn't know at the time,
but Karen Page killed Wesley.

355
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,550
Mr. Fisk, if there's something
you want me to do...

356
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,220
just ask.

357
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,340
I want you to kill Karen Page.

358
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,640
Consider it done.

359
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,200
What does Fisk want with Karen?

360
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,740
He wants her killed.

361
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,000
Well, good evening, everyone.

362
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,500
I just want to take a moment
before the service starts

363
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,590
to thank you all for coming out tonight.

364
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,340
The events of recent days
have been deeply troubling.

365
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,760
Especially for us, here in Hell's Kitchen.

366
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,520
He's downstairs.
There are no cameras in the bedroom.

367
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,940
No, no. God...

368
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,650
How long?

369
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,660
What? What are...

370
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,340
- How long until he gets here?
- Seconds.

371
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,910
If you leave,
I have to tell him you were here.

372
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,790
- He'll triple security.
- No, no...

373
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,040
Getting back in here will be impossible.

374
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,340
You'll never have
another chance like this.

375
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,930
- Where are we going, Dex?
- Just keep going straight.

376
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,350
Institutions we trust have been attacked.

377
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,640
Innocent people have been killed.

378
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,690
Wait for me over there.
Keep the car running. I'll be back soon.

379
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,780
What are you gonna do?

380
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,660
Don't worry, partner. I'll do us proud.

381
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,120
We have been called upon
to question

382
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,700
whether the people we thought
were fighting for us...

383
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,830
were really monsters all along.

384
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,460
We are being told
that we are not strong...

385
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,510
that we are not safe.

386
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,470
You do what you have to do.

387
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,930
Yet... here we are.

388
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,850
Stronger, because we will not accept
that we are weak.

389
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,070
Safer, because we will not be divided.

390
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:45,450
I am proud of all of you for coming here
despite your fears.

391
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:50,530
And I am grateful to you, always...

392
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,710
for letting me call myself one of you.

393
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,250
Even when the night is darkest...

394
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,090
Karen Page!

395
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,640
Where is...

396
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,190
Karen Page?

397
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,950
It's locked!

398
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,450
- Go back! Turn around!
- Go back.

399
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,750
All right, hurry up! Hurry!

400
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,420
I'm here!

401
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,420
I'm here. Please...

402
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,930
No, no, no, no, no. Please, don't. Please.

403
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,800
Please, no, no.

404
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,940
Hello, Karen. It's nice to see you again.

405
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,980
No!

406
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,030
No, no...

407
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,420
Matthew...

408
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,840
Matthew, please forgive us.

409
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,050
No.

410
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,360
Matt.
Matt, I can get everyone out.

411
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
But you have to get them away
from the nave.

412
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,440
Okay. Okay.
Can you get them out?

413
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,200
Okay, it's over there. Just wait...
Wait till I distract him, okay? Okay.

414
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,400
Hey!

415
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,980
I'm the one you want, right?

416
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,070
Karen?

417
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,710
Karen?

418
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,550
Oh, my God. Matt. Matt. Matt.

419
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,640
Matt, you okay? You okay?

420
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,470
Hey.

421
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,180
I can't... can't let him leave.

422
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,060
No, no, no.

423
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,440
Oh, shit, no, he's gone.

424
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,780
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

425
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,610
Matt? Matt?

426
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,660
Matt?
