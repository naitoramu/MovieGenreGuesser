1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,753
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,990
<i>After 6 months in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,400
<i>I have been released
from prison</i>

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,597
<i>and returned home
with only one goal...</i>

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,750
<i>to save my city,</i>

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,354
<i>but things have changed.</i>

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,999
<i>Instead of operating
outside the law,</i>

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,515
<i>I am now working
alongside the police.</i>

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,434
<i>I am no longer inmate 4587.</i>

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,115
<i>I am once more
the Green Arrow.</i>

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,594
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,319
<i>Working with the SCPD...</i>

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,536
that's what's best
for this city.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,896
The whole city will be
watching you,

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,752
holding you to
the highest standard.

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,111
Dad, please.
Don't leave.

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,096
<i>Dante took me under
his wing, and he trained me.</i>

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,349
<i>I kept holding out,
thinking</i>

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,511
one day you'd become
the father I deserved.

20
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,840
<i>It's never gonna
happen, is it?</i>

21
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,360
<i>Is there something else
you'd like to talk to me about?</i>

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,279
<i>No. Have a good trip.</i>

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,637
When Emiko realizes that Dante
has been manipulating her,

24
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,953
it will drive a wedge between
her and The Ninth Circle.

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,111
Rot in hell.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,310
The Ninth Circle
got away

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,198
<i>with a very dangerous
biological weapon...</i>

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,953
<i>Cygnus X-1.</i>

29
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,616
<i>I have just
received confirmation</i>

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,350
of two fatalities here at the
Hudolin Mcguire Metro Station.

31
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,716
Scpd have cordoned off the area,

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,230
but the community is
very concerned.

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,472
Rumors are already flying as
to who might be responsible.

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,791
- Captain Drake.
- How's it look?

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,679
You need to see
this for yourself.

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,036
Hey, keep those damn
reporters back.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,711
This is where
we found them.

38
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,433
Oh, my god.

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,400
We'll have to wait for
the official m.E. Report,

40
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,278
but it seems
obvious...

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,477
blunt force trauma.

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
Looks like they got off
a few rounds

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,276
<i>before they went down.</i>

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,680
Did they hit anything?

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,396
Nothing alive.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,071
Where are the suspects?

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,035
We've got two dead guards
and one hell of a mess.

48
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,430
Your team was on-site.

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,557
I think you'd better
start talking.

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,677
This is...
this whole thing is ridiculous.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,639
The real danger is
still out there.

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,360
I don't think you get to
decide the real danger,

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,035
Mr. Queen.

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,389
We went to the
subway platform

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,596
to stop a
terrorist attack,

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,239
which we did,

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,416
but the people
that we were after

58
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
are still on
the loose.

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Well, luckily we have

60
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:32,856
half the department out there
right now following the same lead.

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,856
Do you think that these are
average street thugs, Dinah?

62
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,176
These are terrorists
that tried to release

63
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,078
a biological agent
in Star City.

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,992
Thousands of people
could have died.

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,278
Two people did die.

66
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,600
We found two emerald Arrows
at the scene.

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
The new Green Arrow.

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
Why don't you tell me about her
involvement at the subway tonight?

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,753
She was there.

70
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,435
She? How do you know that?

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,196
I think it's time we
tell people the truth.

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,993
The new Green Arrow
is my half-sister.

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,430
Her name is
Emiko Adachi.

74
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,096
<i>She belongs to
a terrorist organization</i>

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,395
<i>called The Ninth Circle.</i>

76
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,576
The vigilantes have been
tracking her

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,159
for a few weeks now.

78
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,679
Why didn't you inform
the SCPD?

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,035
Because
The Ninth Circle is

80
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,999
just a little bit beyond the SCPD,
officer.

81
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,232
The SCPD-vigilante
partnership works best

82
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,913
when we operate as
a covert unit.

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,320
Doesn't seem so
in this case.

84
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,357
Well, I'm usually kept
aware of what's going on,

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,949
but I did not
know about this.

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
Care to explain why?

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,296
Things started moving
pretty quickly

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,357
after you told us
about Dante.

89
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,794
Oh, thank god.

90
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,792
Please tell me the news
that you are bringing

91
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,951
is about Emiko and her
Ninth Circle buddies

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,150
because I have had
no luck

93
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,656
with my typity-type
finding anything thing.

94
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,909
Oh, well, you're
in luck now.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,559
Dante, not so much.

96
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,950
A couple SCPD beat cops
found his body this morning.

97
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,838
Let me guess,
not from natural causes.

98
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,479
Not unless you call
3 Arrows

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,994
and a knife
to the chest natural.

100
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,216
This was after you told Emiko
that Dante killed her mother.

101
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Can't be a coincidence.

102
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,039
No. She went ahead
and killed

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,873
the only father
figure she had left.

104
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,016
Right.
So that's a "no"

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,296
on the evil sister
redeeming herself then.

106
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,936
OK, so we have
to stop Emiko from using

107
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,316
this bio-weapon that she
stole from the D.I.A.

108
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,336
The terrifying bacteria
that eats through everything?

109
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,536
Yeah, let's keep
that contained.

110
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,576
OK, so the bad news is that
I haven't been able to find

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,273
the bio-weapon,
but the good news is

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,816
that the Ninth Circle
won't be able to either

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,480
unless they get a dissemination device,
a.K.A. A thermal fogger.

114
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
And, yes, I checked.

115
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,600
The only place to get one
is aerodyne initiatives.

116
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,736
Digg, let's get there

117
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,080
- and help them protect it.
- OK.

118
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,336
I'll follow up
with the detective,

119
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,736
see if I can get some more
clues off Dante's body.

120
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
OK.

121
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,936
And I'll hang back
with Felicity

122
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,016
and help her with
the typey-type.

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,316
- That's OK.
- Moral support.

124
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,629
OK.

125
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,799
Mr. Queen,
Mr. Diggle,

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,936
it's a pleasure
to finally meet

127
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,599
the famous Green Arrow
and Spartan.

128
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,558
I always believed in
vigilantes in the city.

129
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,154
Well, love
to hear it.

130
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Wish we were meeting under
better circumstances.

131
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,789
<i>We have reason
to believe</i>

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,678
that an asset of yours
has been targeted

133
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,752
by an international
terrorist threat.

134
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,976
Well, that's quite
an accusation,

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,976
but I can assure you our
security's top of the line.

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,434
With
all due respect,

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,273
this organization is
far more powerful

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
than any
private company

139
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,669
could possibly
contend with.

140
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,558
And with all due
respect to you,

141
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,016
we hired over a dozen of the
world's best hackers and thieves

142
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,599
to try to break into
our facility.

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,239
None made it past
the front entrance.

144
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,755
Uh, Mr. Toth,

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,911
we're simply offering
to help you.

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,136
What possible reason
could you have

147
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,958
for turning us down?

148
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,832
Well, I appreciate
your concern,

149
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,195
but we've got this covered.

150
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,191
It seems odd that
he turned you down.

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
We agreed,

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,096
so we had Felicity
do a deep dive

153
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,351
into toth's
financial records.

154
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,510
Turns out he was
getting

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,592
some very large
deposits.

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,478
<i>So he was on the take...</i>

157
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,752
- From The Ninth Circle.
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,230
And why the hell
didn't you tell me?

159
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,515
Because we couldn't
confirm it

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,034
until later, Dinah.

161
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,873
Well, I want to believe
you, Oliver,

162
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
but you've got to admit,
this looks really bad.

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,271
I mean, we got Arrows
at the crime scene.

164
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,920
We've got a very
incriminating distress call

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,072
from one of the victims,
and you were there.

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,992
Not to mention the
missing security footage.

167
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,916
OK. Dinah,
you know me, all right?

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,993
You know that I didn't
kill those people.

169
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,639
You've killed
before...

170
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,194
Many times.

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,760
Five months ago,
you were sitting

172
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,399
in a cell
in slabside.

173
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,153
You're not
exactly innocent.

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,277
Enjoying yourself?
You having a good time?

175
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,760
You have had it
out for me

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,516
since the moment that
I was deputized by the SCPD.

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,856
You know,
those guards were not just killed, Oliver.

178
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,032
They were savagely
beaten to death.

179
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,656
Do you understand how bad this
looks for the department?

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,151
Yes, I do,
but I didn't do it.

181
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,072
- Then who did?
- I don't know.

182
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
So it
could have been

183
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,720
one of the members
of your team.

184
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,269
My team...

185
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,993
Stopped
a terrorist attack.

186
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,376
Except it wasn't just
your team who was there, was it?

187
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,073
There was
somebody else there,

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,799
somebody besides
Mr. Diggle

189
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,190
and Ms. Smoak
and Mr. Ramirez.

190
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,518
Yes, there was.

191
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,795
<i>We thought
The Ninth Circle</i>

192
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,395
<i>was gonna wipe out
Star City.</i>

193
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,998
<i>So I made a call.</i>

194
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,276
You do understand what accomplice
to murder means, right?

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,999
You can't be serious.

196
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,400
Tonight's security footage

197
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,076
from Hudolin Mcguire subway
station mysteriously disappeared.

198
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,136
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,551
Nope. Nothing, zilch, nada.

200
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,552
She's covering for
her husband.

201
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,030
- Oh, come...
- that certainly is convenient.

202
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,000
And when exactly were you
planning on telling me

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,594
about Roy Harper's
involvement?

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,273
Honestly?

205
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,795
After we saved Star City from
The Ninth Circle's attack.

206
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,111
We know how you guys feel
about "the unsanctioned."

207
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,080
Let's get real.

208
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,913
Emiko and The Ninth Circle
know our faces.

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,639
Roy was our ace in the hole.

210
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,995
So you risked your new
relationship with the SCPD

211
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,514
by teaming up with
a criminal.

212
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,353
Former criminal.

213
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,794
Roy left the city
4 years ago,

214
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,496
and he's been on the straight
and nArrow ever since.

215
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,751
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes, I'm sure about that.

216
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,320
Because we traced
Harper's whereabouts

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,794
after he faked his
death in prison

218
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,439
to get Oliver Queen
off the hook,

219
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,751
and his trail went cold
in march of last year.

220
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,753
Oh. You mean when
Ricardo Diaz kidnapped Roy

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,896
to turn him against Oliver?

222
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,336
You might have forgotten
about that since you

223
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,416
weren't exactly on speaking terms
with Oliver and I at the time.

224
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,874
It still doesn't explain

225
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,111
where he went after
getting freed from Diaz.

226
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,792
I'm sure the kidnapping
was extremely traumatic.

227
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,416
He probably just went
to go get some r&r...

228
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,955
some Roy relaxation.

229
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,151
Not funny. I see that now.

230
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,957
Oh. So this is what
legit looks like.

231
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,511
That's right.
A badge and a bunker.

232
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,835
Never thought I'd
see the day.

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,274
<i>Good seeing you.</i>

234
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm glad you're finally
seeing it in person again.

235
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,514
- Ooh!
- Oh!

236
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,875
Oh, I missed you
so much.

237
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,520
Sorry. I'm just a little
overly emotional these days.

238
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,875
I mean, not overly
emotional,

239
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,016
not, like, heightened
or anything.

240
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,056
Because why would that be?

241
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,560
My hormones
are totally in check,

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,960
like they always have been.

243
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,430
Nerves of steel.
You know me. I'm cool.

244
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
OK.

245
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,239
The Arsenal. Nice
to finally meet you.

246
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,471
You, too. Thanks
for keeping watch.

247
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,472
The Glades can use as many
heroes as it can get.

248
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,074
Welcome back.

249
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,640
All right.

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
How's Thea?

251
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,356
She's good. Yeah,
I think she's finally found her passion.

252
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,159
You'd be really
proud of her.

253
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,469
Last I spoke with her,
she says

254
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,791
you were zeroing in on
the remaining Lazarus Pits.

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,155
Yeah, we found two
already,

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,594
- which we destroyed.
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,956
We were tracking the rest
when we got your call.

258
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,256
Speaking of which,
why'd you ask me to come here

259
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,033
instead of Thea?

260
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,319
Star City's new terrorist
is Oliver's new sister.

261
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
What?

262
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,716
Yeah.

263
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,871
Don't you think Thea
would want to know that?

264
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
- Yeah.
- Yes.

265
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,713
And I have every intention
of telling her.

266
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,350
I just... this woman's
name is Emiko,

267
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,274
and we wanted to get her into
custody before we told her.

268
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,195
I feel like she's finally free
of her life in Star City,

269
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,431
and i... I don't want
to hurt her again

270
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,433
with a wound inflicted
on our family

271
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,590
by our father.

272
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,216
Felicity, Voice-Over:
Roy had been traveling the world

273
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,630
doing some extremely normal
sightseeing.

274
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,296
Apparently he was too busy
to even send a postcard.

275
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,754
Then why did you
call him in?

276
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,354
Because of
the thermal fogger.

277
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,039
The what?

278
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,077
The scary bio-weapon that
the bad guys needed

279
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,800
to spread the bacteria through
the subway's hvac system.

280
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
The device found
on the scene.

281
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,637
The device found
at the scene, yes.

282
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,040
Look,

283
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,856
we thought it was weird
that the ceo of aerodyne

284
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,656
wasn't going to let us protect
it from The Ninth Circle,

285
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,034
so we did
some digging.

286
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,079
And found that Jason toth
was dirty. Oliver told us.

287
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
We knew good old Jason would be
looking for members of the tga,

288
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,816
and we needed someone with a
vigilante-like set of skills.

289
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,036
Voila. Roy Harper.

290
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,077
The facilities at
aerodyne are no joke,

291
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,834
and Roy is incredible
at parkour.

292
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm in.

293
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,953
<i>Remember, Roy,
the floor is armed.</i>

294
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,296
<i>If you touch
anything...</i>

295
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,471
and I mean anything...
it is party time at aerodyne,

296
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
and not in a good way.

297
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
<i>Is there anything
I can touch?</i>

298
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,520
Walls and ceilings
are fair game.

299
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,831
<i>Anything
that's not the floor.</i>

300
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,675
So far, so good.

301
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,070
<i>The control panel's on
the other side of the fan.</i>

302
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,190
I got to get higher.

303
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,160
<i>I see it.</i>

304
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,757
You hit metal, it's over.
Shot has to be perfect.

305
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,356
Margin of error... 0.08,
but who's counting?

306
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,576
Your target is
the red button...

307
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
second from the left.

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,074
<i>I don't have a shot...</i>

309
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,678
But I will.

310
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,776
Felicity, Voice-Over:
Just like that, piece of cake.

311
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,553
Oh, which actually sounds
so good right now.

312
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,871
Do you guys have
any cake or cupcakes

313
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,176
or anything with, like,
a cake-like...

314
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,999
Felicity, tell us
what happened, please.

315
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,056
Roy squeezed his way
through the blades,

316
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,096
and then after that,
it was easy

317
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,557
to make his way into
the R&D vault. Boom.

318
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,956
Heads up. We're
late to the party.

319
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,793
<i>That was our
only way in.</i>

320
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,075
Not the only way.

321
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,960
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Toth.

322
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,794
Oh, your new sister...
not a fan.

323
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,558
Take care of him.
Move! Move!

324
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,072
Who the hell are you?

325
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Your new worst nightmare.

326
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,594
Hmm.

327
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
See youse lads.

328
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,637
Roy?

329
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,473
We lost the bio-weapon.

330
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,033
So let me get this straight.

331
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,594
If your plan had worked,

332
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,319
Roy would have
successfully stolen

333
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,710
a very dangerous
piece of tech.

334
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,871
In other words, committed
a felony.

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,150
Well, technically,

336
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,496
Roy was there to stop The Ninth
Circle from doing what they did,

337
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,896
which was steal the device,
so technically, Roy didn't do anything.

338
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,196
No harm, no foul.
Could I maybe get a pizza?

339
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,509
Just a personal size
is fine.

340
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,240
No. I think you've abused your
food privileges enough for today.

341
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,198
- OK.
- Tell me what happened.

342
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,216
We stopped The Ninth Circle
from terrorizing the city.

343
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
End-stop.

344
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,993
And the two
fatalities.

345
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
That wasn't our fault.

346
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,715
Then tell me what you know.

347
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,710
We knew that
The Ninth Circle

348
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,553
wanted to maximize
the bio-weapon's impact.

349
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,552
There were two possible
locations to do that...

350
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,950
the ventilation room
and the ventilation shaft.

351
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,430
Oliver went to one, John
and Rene went to the other.

352
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,113
Roy and I went
to the switch room.

353
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,794
Oh, wow!
This thing is a fossil,

354
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,673
and not in
a fun ice age way.

355
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,274
Can you shut it down?

356
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,511
Well, once I shut down
the ventilation path,

357
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,435
we should be able
to minimize the damage.

358
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,216
Dinah, Voice-Over: Did
you have any indication

359
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,480
those guards
were still on-site?

360
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,718
No. I didn't see those
guards or any guards.

361
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,838
Sounds like we're
not alone. You got eyes?

362
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,557
All I got is two transit
guards in the corridor.

363
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,296
If they're Ninth Circle,
you can't let them in here.

364
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,640
Well, I can't just
leave you here.

365
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,320
I'll be fine.
I'll be fine. Go.

366
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,153
I stayed in that room until
Oliver gave me the go-ahead.

367
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,310
And what about Roy?

368
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,675
What do you mean?

369
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
Can you account for
his whereabouts

370
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,475
between the time
he left you

371
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,936
and the time those
guards were killed?

372
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,553
Guys, the vents are
shut down.

373
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,240
Please tell me that
you have the device.

374
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,115
He was keeping me safe.

375
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,634
That wasn't
the question.

376
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,280
Felicity, do you know
where Roy was

377
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,629
when those guards
were killed?

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,593
No, I don't.

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,277
Roy Harper, you are
a hard man to track down.

380
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,714
I've been
traveling.

381
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,032
So we've heard.
Whereabouts exactly?

382
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,112
The world.

383
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,669
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

384
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,269
You've got quite
the rap sheet, Mr. Harper.

385
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,673
B&E, Grand Theft Auto...

386
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,672
<i>Aggravated assault.</i>

387
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,434
<i>So is that why you came
back to Star City, Roy,</i>

388
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,153
to steal a device
from aerodyne?

389
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,675
I came back to help prevent
Emiko from stealing it.

390
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,956
She's the one you guys
should be going after.

391
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,474
We will.

392
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,272
But first, why don't you
tell us what happened

393
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,876
after you failed
to stop her?

394
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,271
I went back to the bunker
to figure out a new plan.

395
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,150
According to Felicity,
all Emiko had to do was

396
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,176
fill that device with some
sort of killer bacteria

397
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,920
and Star City would've turned
into a real-life horror movie.

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,320
<i>Cygnus x-1.</i>

399
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,633
Yeah. So she ran some
sort of algorithm

400
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,280
and came up with a few
possible places.

401
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,915
And that eventually led you to the subway.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,719
Cut to the chase.

403
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,996
What happened when
you got there?

404
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,676
Specifically,
what happened after you left Felicity?

405
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,549
I didn't want to leave her,
but she insisted.

406
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,677
We thought The Ninth Circle
might have showed up.

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,799
Roy, Voice-Over:
<i>Turns out we were right.</i>

408
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,031
<i>Those guys in the hoods
jumped me.</i>

409
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,833
<i>After I took out
the first one, they just...</i>

410
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,991
<i>Just kept coming.</i>

411
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,793
<i>I tried to fight back, but there
were just too many of them.</i>

412
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,631
The last thing
I remember is

413
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,120
I was taking a mace
to the face

414
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,873
before everything
went black.

415
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,234
And when I came to,

416
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,356
you all were
on the scene,

417
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,672
and the guards, they
were already dead.

418
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,274
So you have
absolutely no idea

419
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,158
who may have killed them.

420
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,880
It's rather convenient,
don't you think?

421
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,838
You being unconscious at
the same time

422
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,276
two men are
brutally murdered?

423
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,159
Wait, you think I did it?

424
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,120
Whose side
are you on?

425
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,513
I am on the only side
that matters... the truth.

426
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,796
Now, why don't you
stop wasting my time

427
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,190
and tell me
what really happened?

428
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,591
I told you, Roy was
unconscious when I found him,

429
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,240
and that was before the
guards fired their sidearms.

430
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,710
So you don't think
he killed them.

431
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,440
I just don't see
how he could have.

432
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,352
You don't have to
protect him, John.

433
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,352
Dinah, I'm not.

434
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,238
Right, right.

435
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,232
But that is what
you do, isn't it?

436
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,834
You always put other people's
lives before your own.

437
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,957
At some point you
might discover

438
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,918
not everybody's
worth it.

439
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,199
Look, you don't know
Roy Harper the way I do.

440
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,760
He's had his troubles.

441
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,958
But deep inside, he's
a very good man.

442
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,599
Well, you're very quick
to defend Roy.

443
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,796
What about yourself?

444
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,760
Why? Are you asking me
if I killed those guards?

445
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,194
It certainly
doesn't help

446
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,000
that you have blood
on your sleeve.

447
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,955
Walk us through
what happened

448
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,633
after you arrived.

449
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,078
Well, there were two
possible disbursement sites.

450
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,073
Oliver headed for
the ventilation room.

451
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,237
And Rene and I headed
for the ventilation shaft.

452
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,437
And that's when we
ran into trouble.

453
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,155
Access should be here,
ahead on the right.

454
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,439
Emiko.

455
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,313
- I've got her.
- Rene!

456
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,033
She's mine.
Go secure the device.

457
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,435
So that's when you
and Rene split up.

458
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,672
Rene was right.
The device was the priority.

459
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,319
I was headed for
the ventilation shaft,

460
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,872
and that's when I found
Roy unconscious.

461
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,873
And this was before
the gunshots.

462
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
That's correct.

463
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,873
John, Voice-Over:
<i>I ran toward the source</i>

464
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,556
<i>as fast as I could,
but I was too late.</i>

465
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,114
I checked their pulse,

466
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,313
but they were
already dead.

467
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,312
That's how I got blood
on my sleeve.

468
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,517
What about
Mr. Ramirez?

469
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,512
Where was he during
all of this?

470
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,119
John?

471
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,671
John, tell us
what you saw.

472
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,112
When I got to the bodies...

473
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,834
That's when I found Rene.

474
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
Rene?

475
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
What happened
to your hand, Rene?

476
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
I cut it.

477
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,555
Well,
that's obvious.

478
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,677
Was it around the same time
you lost your glove?

479
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,910
What are you
getting at, d.?

480
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,390
You know,
I've seen plenty of perps change their tune

481
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,790
the longer they
sit in here.

482
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,034
The truth has a way
of coming out.

483
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,156
This isn't my first time

484
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,311
being falsely accused
of a crime...

485
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,480
Sir.

486
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,597
Two men are dead, Rene.

487
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,313
Now, we know Team Arrow
was on-site

488
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,552
as well as Emiko, which
means our two main suspects

489
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,990
are either her or...

490
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
Me?

491
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,634
I didn't say that.

492
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,120
Well, that's what you
were thinking,

493
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,760
'cause you've been
looking for any excuse

494
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,513
not to trust me
this whole year.

495
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,034
That's because
you have given me

496
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,476
every reason not to.

497
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,677
How many times have I
warned you about Emiko?

498
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,672
I told you she wasn't
trustworthy.

499
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,989
You refused to listen.

500
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,270
Well, now she ends up

501
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,238
on the scene of an
attempted terrorist attack

502
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,880
and a double homicide,
and you were there, too.

503
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,674
And you what? You
think I helped her?

504
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,399
I just want the truth, Rene.

505
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,393
Tell me what you were doing
before that mission tonight.

506
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,536
We managed
to get the info

507
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,640
on The Ninth Circle's
target

508
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,717
thanks to Felicity's
algorithm.

509
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,156
She traced the chemical
signature of the bio-weapon

510
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,754
to the subway station.

511
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,752
And that's when you
headed off.

512
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,957
Yeah. Straight away.

513
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,511
You good with all this?

514
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,035
I'll be better once we get
to the subway and stop her.

515
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,635
I know that it's going to be
tough going up against Emiko.

516
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,554
You guys got
really close, Rene.

517
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,816
If you're gonna try and give me a pep talk,
save it. I'm good.

518
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,096
I don't want to give you
a pep talk.

519
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,856
I want to make sure that if
you're going out on a mission,

520
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,270
you're doing it
with a clear head.

521
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,400
When I first met Emiko,

522
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,199
avenging
her mother's death

523
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,875
and helping The Glades were the
only things that mattered to her.

524
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,155
Right, except she
was lying.

525
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,596
Then why did she kill
Dante?

526
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Why'd she do it?

527
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,235
I mean, she turned on
a member of The Ninth Circle

528
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
for her mother.

529
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,976
That tells me that family
means more to her.

530
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,913
Fine. It doesn't change
the fact that she

531
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,552
could potentially kill thousands...
thousands of people.

532
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,431
I know, I know, but she's
still your sister, man.

533
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,040
Doesn't any part of you think that
maybe she's doing all of this

534
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,033
because of what your
father did to her,

535
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,474
that if not
for her upbringing,

536
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,075
she'd be fighting with us
instead of against us?

537
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,153
A big part of me
thinks about that...

538
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,713
All the time.

539
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,110
At a certain point,
Rene,

540
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,714
people need to take
responsibility

541
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,314
for their actions.

542
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,920
Emiko made her choice.
I've made mine.

543
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,033
You need to make yours.

544
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,840
There's something I'm not
liking about your story, Rene.

545
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,834
The part where we
save the city?

546
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,434
The part you're not
telling us.

547
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,273
Everything I told you
tonight is the truth.

548
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,079
Then why did we find
your fingerprints

549
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,514
on the murder weapon?

550
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,717
What were you doing with that pipe,
Rene?

551
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,876
I didn't do anything.

552
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,680
That's getting harder
and harder to believe.

553
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,831
John and I split up.

554
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,639
He went after the bomb.

555
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,949
I went after Emiko.

556
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,600
And did you
catch up to her?

557
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,675
No.

558
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
Emiko, it's not
too late.

559
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Let me help you.

560
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,919
I don't need your help.
I spared you once.

561
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,992
This time, I won't
be so generous.

562
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,600
Why are you doing this?!

563
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,673
Because the Queens took
everything from me.

564
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,991
Now it's my turn to
take everything from them.

565
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,516
This isn't you.

566
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,160
You care about
The Glades.

567
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,720
You're dressed as
the new Green Arrow,

568
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,314
and you killed
Dante.

569
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,312
And that proves what
exactly?

570
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,776
That finding your
mother's killer means

571
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,678
more to you
than The Ninth Circle.

572
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,798
Why else would you risk
murdering their leader?

573
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,999
You really don't get it.
Dante wasn't their leader.

574
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,196
I am.

575
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,551
Your mother would hate
what you've become.

576
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,016
Rene, Voice-Over:
<i>I was still searching for Emiko</i>

577
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,156
<i>when I heard
the gunshots.</i>

578
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,717
<i>Where were
you exactly?</i>

579
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,519
Some Random corridor.

580
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,829
The gunshots were close.

581
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,037
I followed the sound, which
led me to the platform.

582
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,270
You know we
have a witness

583
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,034
who pins you as the first
person on the scene.

584
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,157
Yeah. John. He showed up...

585
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,311
he showed up seconds
after I did.

586
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,518
What are you not
telling us, Rene?

587
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,430
Someone else got to
the platform before I did.

588
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,671
<i>And who was it?</i>

589
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,073
It was Oliver.

590
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,591
Bring back Mr. Queen.

591
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,154
You didn't tell us
the truth.

592
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,277
What are you
talking about?

593
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,034
Your friend Ramirez says he
found you near the bodies.

594
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,638
<i>I have no more
ways to tell you</i>

595
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,995
I didn't kill
those guards.

596
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,456
<i>Let me tell you
what I think.</i>

597
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,119
I think you and your team
were there

598
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,640
to stop
the terrorist attack.

599
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,791
I even think you did.

600
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,634
But when one of the bad guys got away,
you went after them;

601
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,439
<i>and transit guards
Rosenberg and Kim</i>

602
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,874
got in your way.

603
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,550
I didn't kill
those guards.

604
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,518
OK, then who did, Oliver?

605
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,114
Because I really
want to help you,

606
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,816
but I can't do that unless
you're honest with us.

607
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,876
So let's try this again.

608
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,236
Tell me what went on in
that subway,

609
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,516
and I want the truth
this time.

610
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
Oliver, Voice-Over:
<i>After we separated,</i>

611
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,640
<i>I went to
the ventilation room.</i>

612
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,235
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

613
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,673
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

614
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,514
One wrong move,
and we'll all be in a load of trouble.

615
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,914
Aah!

616
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,471
You're a real pain in
the arse, you know that?

617
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,336
<i>That's not the part
we're interested in.</i>

618
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,397
We appreciate you
disarming the device,

619
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,709
but that's not
why you're here.

620
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,871
The device
is a weapon

621
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,758
that was gonna kill
thousands of people,

622
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,797
and now it's in
SCPD custody,

623
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,599
thanks to us.

624
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,793
What happened next?

625
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,550
I was still in
the ventilation room

626
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,597
<i>when I heard
the gunshots.</i>

627
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,456
Oliver, Voice-Over: <i>The guards must
have gotten off a few shots.</i>

628
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,551
Oh, no.

629
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,718
But when I
got there...

630
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,758
The killer was
standing over them.

631
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,759
They were gone.

632
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,477
Blood everywhere.

633
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,000
And you got a good look
at who did it.

634
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,673
Yeah.

635
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,752
<i>Then who was it?</i>

636
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,076
Oliver, then who was it?

637
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,833
It was my sister.

638
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,359
Emiko killed
those guards.

639
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,790
I can't believe we're
letting him go.

640
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,236
Oliver Queen is
protecting his sister.

641
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,198
It makes sense.

642
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,936
I don't know. Something
doesn't feel right.

643
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,110
We don't have
enough evidence

644
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,680
to keep them here.

645
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,911
Their stories line up.

646
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,719
Mayor Pollard agrees.

647
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,111
So how's it look?

648
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,995
Pollard bought it.

649
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,952
<i>Yeah, as far as the
SCPD is concerned,</i>

650
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,596
<i>Emiko was the one who
killed those guards.</i>

651
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,479
You all are very,
very good liars.

652
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,914
So are you, d.

653
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,277
We know that this
wasn't easy for you.

654
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,670
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

655
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,439
<i>If anybody finds out
about what we did,</i>

656
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,239
our partnership with
the SCPD is over.

657
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,357
And the same
goes for my job.

658
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,636
We just risked
everything.

659
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,313
That's why we all
had to agree.

660
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,039
This was the only way.

661
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,552
- I've got her.
- Rene.

662
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,313
She's mine.
Secure the device.

663
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,956
I'll be fine. Go.

664
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,791
Aah!

665
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,351
Hey! What the hell's
going on down here?

666
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,193
Vigilante
attack in progress,

667
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,480
Hudolin Mcguire Metro Station.

668
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,513
Roy!

669
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,831
Roy, stop it!
Look at me!

670
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,400
Roy, stop!

671
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,955
Rene! Rene, don't
touch that.

672
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,959
They're dead.

673
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,440
What the hell happened here?

674
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,916
What are we gonna do?

675
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,477
We have to protect him.

676
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,280
Two innocent people
are dead,

677
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,999
and we're covering
it up.

678
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,640
Dinah, if someone
on this team goes down,

679
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,518
this entire team goes down.

680
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,656
<i>He's
absolutely right.</i>

681
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,909
<i>And if Pollard
knew the truth,</i>

682
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,056
we would be
sitting in lockup

683
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
while the city
rehashes

684
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,799
whether vigilantes
are a threat or not.

685
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,360
Which
would free Emiko up

686
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,432
for evil plan b.

687
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,079
But Roy is not
a part of this team.

688
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,431
He's been gone for months
doing who knows what.

689
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,672
With due respect, you don't
know what he's been through.

690
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,719
Roy is and always will be
as much a part of this team

691
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
as the rest of us.

692
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,536
<i>Except the rest
of us don't go around</i>

693
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,960
killing innocent people.

694
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,456
<i>Dinah, as horrible
as that was,</i>

695
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
let's not lose sight

696
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,472
that we stopped
an attack tonight.

697
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,760
And we framed Emiko
for murder.

698
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,069
<i>Emiko's a murderer,</i>

699
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,152
a murderer who's the leader
of The Ninth Circle.

700
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,879
And as long as she is
out there,

701
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,350
this city will remain
under threat.

702
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,920
I hope we can
all agree on that.

703
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Yes.

704
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,631
My search algorithms
are up and running.

705
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,473
It might actually
be a good time

706
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,119
to go ask Roy
what happened.

707
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,310
I'm pretty sure
I already know.

708
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,110
That wasn't Mirakuru.

709
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,394
No.

710
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,957
How did it happen?

711
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,474
What do you mean?

712
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,990
How did you die?

713
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,439
How did you know?

714
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,553
You, Thea, and nyssa
left here over a year ago

715
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,994
in search of Lazarus Pits,

716
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,198
and I have not seen
bloodlust like that

717
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,556
since Thea
was resurrected by one.

718
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,590
Damn it.

719
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,834
To help, I need to
know what happened.

720
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,156
The thanatos guild
had us surrounded.

721
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,358
<i>I tried to get Thea
to safety,</i>

722
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,717
but I was hit with
an Arrow,

723
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,838
which... which is ironic.

724
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,752
I don't really remember
a lot after,

725
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,674
except for... Except for
seeing nyssa and Thea

726
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
destroy the pit.

727
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,594
The one they used
to bring you back.

728
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,036
Yeah.

729
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,998
Nyssa had the lotus elixir.

730
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,910
She and Thea thought

731
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,390
that we could control
the bloodlust, and we did.

732
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,675
Until you didn't.

733
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,911
I keep trying
to figure out why.

734
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,434
And all I can think of
is that maybe

735
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,273
the Mirakuru
changed something.

736
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,797
You know, I never
would've come back here

737
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,674
if I would've known what
was gonna happen.

738
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,320
I never meant
to hurt anyone.

739
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,119
I know...

740
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,830
But keeping this
information from us,

741
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,674
it jeopardized
all the things that

742
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,194
we have been working
for this year.

743
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,237
I never asked you
to cover for me.

744
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,749
I didn't want you to.

745
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,956
You never have
to ask me.

746
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,713
Ever.

747
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,790
<i>Guys?</i>

748
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,599
Felicity
has something.

749
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,954
I expanded my search
parameters, and presto.

750
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,230
Facial recognition
puts Emiko

751
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,515
in an abandoned building

752
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,816
a few miles outside
of Star City.

753
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,040
Any background on
the building?

754
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,520
I mean, you name it,
it's been it.

755
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,829
Hospital,
shipping warehouse,

756
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
manufacturing plant.

757
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,229
I mean,
it's had more owners

758
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,959
than
a fortune 500 company.

759
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,176
Which means it could be
a cover for something.

760
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Yeah, something
being

761
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,336
the Ninth Circle's
headquarters

762
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
here
in Star City.

763
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,875
Emiko's there, which is
all that matters to us.

764
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,031
We're going after her
as a team.

765
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,600
Are you sure?

766
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,555
We got
your back.

767
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,593
Oh, hey, Dinah! Thank you for wiping
that security camera footage.

768
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,036
I could not get there
before the cops did.

769
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,793
I thought that was you.

770
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,832
No.

771
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Let's go wide.

772
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,799
Arsenal, on my 6.

773
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,680
Overwatch,
any heat signatures?

774
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,797
No. Not even yours.

775
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,080
Thermal imaging
can't penetrate

776
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,918
through those walls.

777
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,480
I have eyes on her.

778
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,199
<i>Moving to intercept.</i>

779
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,352
<i>Oliver, confirm
your location.</i>

780
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,675
This is over.

781
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,160
Is it?

782
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,435
Right now,
sergeant Bingsley

783
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,749
is receiving
an anonymous gift

784
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,837
delivered to his office:

785
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,115
The missing
security footage

786
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,476
from the Metro Station.

787
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,359
You're the one
who made it disappear?

788
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,272
You set us up.

789
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,630
What do you want?!

790
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,235
For you to suffer
the way I suffered.

791
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,829
You and your team are
gonna die in there.

792
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,958
And I will be out there
destroying your legacy.

793
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,076
You'll die a villain

794
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,271
just like
our father did,

795
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,558
and I will be the cause
of both of your deaths.

796
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,791
And justice will finally
be served.

797
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,669
What did you say?

798
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,996
I had the chance

799
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,151
to warn our father
about the "gambit."

800
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,435
<i>It was rigged
to explode,</i>

801
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,234
<i>and I knew
about it.</i>

802
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,720
I let our father
die because he

803
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,553
didn't deserve
to live.

804
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,399
And neither do you.

805
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,994
Bye, brother.

806
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,035
<i>Oliver,
do you read me?</i>

807
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,998
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

808
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,196
<i>Oliver, come in.</i>

809
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,195
<i>John?</i>

810
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,156
<i>John, come in!
Oliver?</i>

811
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,879
<i>Come in, please!</i>

812
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,275
<i>Come in!</i>

813
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,909
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
