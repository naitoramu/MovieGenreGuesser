1
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,612
Taxi.

2
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,670
Kapiushon.

3
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,593
Rumors are true.

4
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,640
Kapiushon is back.

5
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,054
You cost us a lot of money
back in Star City.

6
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,565
And you'll more than make up for it
by taking over his drug operation.

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,358
You kept your end of bargain.

8
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,651
Now, you keep yours.

9
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,409
By the time you get back to America,

10
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,827
it will be done.

11
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,529
No, I need more than your word.

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,494
Show him that.

13
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,660
He'll know it's from me.

14
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,629
Man, I can't believe how good
this crappy hallway looks.

15
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,085
Yeah, and it really is crappy.

16
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,885
I mean, this paint looks like
it's been here since the '60s.

17
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:37,962
Yeah, it's...

18
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,638
But it must be good
to be home, right?

19
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,842
Yeah, to be home and to see my baby.

20
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,393
You told Zoe to come straight here
after hockey practice, right?

21
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,766
Actually, she wanted to skip
hockey practice today.

22
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,899
- Welcome home!
- Welcome home!

23
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,479
- Oh! I missed you so much.
- I missed you too, Dad.

24
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,780
I'm so glad you're back.

25
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,318
Ah, you guys didn't have to do all this.

26
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,822
Hey, you've been in the hospital
over a month.

27
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,369
You deserve a hero's welcome.

28
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,992
We have cake, too. Your favorite.

29
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,409
- Is that red velvet?
- I'll cut you a slice.

30
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,244
I love you so much.

31
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,458
So how are you feeling?

32
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,846
Better than ever. Ready to take down
Diaz anytime, anywhere.

33
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,672
We haven't been able to find him
or his lair

34
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,224
using our usual tracking methods.

35
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,765
That's probably because Diaz
is controlling the entire city,

36
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,436
including police and cameras.

37
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,765
I just hacked a new thermal sensing
program from the NSA,

38
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,020
so maybe that gets us somewhere.

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,818
Point is, now, us is back to full
strength.

40
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,313
That's right.

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,984
Ricardo Diaz is working with
SCPD Captain Kimberly Hill,

42
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,369
District Attorney Armand,

43
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,283
and former Bratva <i>Pakhan</i>
named Anatoly Knyazev.

44
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,083
But that is just the tip
of the iceberg.

45
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,369
Ricardo Diaz has members
of Star City's

46
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,298
entire governmental infrastructure
either bought or compromised.

47
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,795
So how are we supposed to find him?

48
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,842
24/7 surveillance on all of Diaz's
known locations and subordinates

49
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,675
until either he or someone
he is working with makes a mistake.

50
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,308
You have your orders.

51
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,766
- Everything all right, sir?
- You can drop the "sir."

52
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,066
A.R.G.U.S. isn't the Army.

53
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,652
Just checking to see
how you are acclimating.

54
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,604
I feel like I'm getting my sea legs.

55
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,989
You might feel that way,
but it doesn't look it.

56
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,026
From where I'm standing,
it looks like you've been doing this

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,486
your whole life.

58
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,196
At least that's what I told the boss.

59
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,621
You're talking to Lyla.

60
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,368
Talking might be a bit
of an exaggeration.

61
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,202
Maldivian phone lines
aren't exactly the best.

62
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,328
Copy that.

63
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,380
I got something
that might help with Diaz.

64
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,466
Lydia Cassamento.

65
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,340
Gun lobbyist who took control
of her family business.

66
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,137
Now she runs weapons
for the Quadrant.

67
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,638
The Quadrant?

68
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,717
High-end cartel, ruled
by moneyed families

69
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,267
with ties to all things black market.

70
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:52,097
Guns, cryptocurrency, drugs, humans.

71
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,145
KH-11 picked up Cassamento
coming into Star City.

72
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,773
And you think Diaz is looking
to restock his firepower.

73
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,149
And if she's making
the trip personally

74
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,447
that means the deal she is working
on is big.

75
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,399
I got a tact team ready
to take her out.

76
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,946
No, belay that order.

77
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,495
If she's bringing guns to Diaz,
she may lead us right to him.

78
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,578
What kind of wool is this again?

79
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,084
Rare vicuÃ±a.

80
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,838
A suit like this is worth what,
100 grand?

81
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,208
For a basic cut, yes.

82
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,426
Hey, I don't want the basic cut.

83
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,675
Leave a little room for the guns.

84
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,806
And don't forget, the muscles
are getting bigger.

85
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,767
You said she'd be here by now.

86
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,977
I called her three times.

87
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,562
You called me once.

88
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,690
Since when did you let these guys
start lying to you?

89
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,942
Don't tell me that the Quadrant's
money has made you go soft?

90
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,865
I thought we were supposed
to meet up last night.

91
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,706
Well, I guess your men are lying
to you again.

92
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,201
I told them I would be down
by the docks.

93
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,872
There were some Halcones
that needed disciplining.

94
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,423
Good.

95
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,377
There's somebody else that needs
a little instruction.

96
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,510
The new mayor.

97
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,099
You mean my father.

98
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,843
I thought he wasn't your father.

99
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,140
You know what I mean.

100
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,472
Need to have a conversation with him.

101
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,563
Lay down some of the ground rules.

102
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,899
I'll talk to him.

103
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,901
No.

104
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,358
I'll talk to him.

105
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,028
You set it up.

106
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,828
You do trust me, don't you, baby?

107
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,710
Of course I do.

108
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,999
I'll make it happen.

109
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,744
If I'm supposed to be frightened,

110
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,163
you are wasting your time, Kapiushon.

111
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,125
I just wanna talk.

112
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,413
We stopped talking year ago.

113
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,125
How you find me?

114
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,176
I got a tip

115
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,379
from a friend of yours in Russia.

116
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,931
I have no friends in Russia.
Your doing.

117
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,342
That's fixed.

118
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,392
Also my doing.

119
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,274
This is <i>Pakhan's.</i>

120
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,193
How you come to have it?

121
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,488
He told me that the Bratva exiled you
because of your friendship with me.

122
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,112
I owed you a debt,
I owed them a debt.

123
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,322
I paid it.

124
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,863
You can go home now, Anatoly.

125
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,705
You said you were an honorable man.

126
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,381
Now, I think you know deep down
that Diaz isn't.

127
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,960
Help me stop him.

128
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,147
Yeah, you're right.

129
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,395
I was honorable man.

130
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,252
Handcuffs would have been fine.

131
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,718
What, so you can dislocate arms
and escape?

132
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,305
Come on, Oliver,

133
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,553
most of your tricks, I taught you.

134
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,431
I also taught you not to go
into a situation alone. Hmm?

135
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,270
I've gone back to basics, Anatoly.

136
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,474
I'm working alone.

137
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,023
That explains why you broke into SCPD
wearing Kapiushon outfit.

138
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,200
Oh. Diaz and I had good laugh
on that one.

139
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,156
Maybe one day we will have
bigger laugh about this.

140
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,910
So you two are friends now?

141
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,119
I thought you wanted back in
with the Bratva, Anatoly.

142
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,129
So I delivered that to you.

143
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,839
And I thank you.

144
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,961
But over past year,
I see things a little more clearly.

145
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,718
I devote my whole life to brothers,

146
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,474
I even become their <i>Pakhan,</i>

147
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,732
and for a setback, they cast me out.

148
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,610
Well, Diaz is gonna do far worse
than cast you out.

149
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,439
If I betray him, yes,
but why would I do that?

150
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,203
Diaz is going to make me
a very rich man.

151
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,417
Bratva took 100 years to go
from prison into government,

152
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,836
Diaz did same thing in months.

153
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,580
I'm still gonna take him down.

154
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,456
Not alone, you cannot.

155
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:56,878
My mission was always supposed
to be solitary.

156
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,971
Put me with a team, fill it
with people that I care about,

157
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,146
it splits my focus.

158
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,565
Was that why you think Diaz
was able to beat you?

159
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,109
He took over the city
while I was distracted.

160
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,524
If you seriously believe that,

161
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,034
then you are even bigger fool
than I thought.

162
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,238
That is saying something.

163
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,748
Damn, it is good to be back.

164
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,004
Guess it's true what they say,
"There's no place like bunker."

165
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,333
I bet you really miss Curtis'
dad jokes.

166
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,713
You know what, I did, a little.

167
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,174
I missed this baby more.

168
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,474
Well, good. Because you are gonna be
wearing it plenty.

169
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,551
We are the only vigilante team
left standing.

170
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,970
What do you mean?

171
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,180
John got into a huge fight with
Oliver and joined A.R.G.U.S.

172
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,147
Then Oliver kicked Felicity
out of the bunker.

173
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,350
So now he's gone solo.

174
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,732
Oh. So Oliver finally
drove them all away.

175
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,276
Can't say I'm surprised.

176
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,982
Or that I care.

177
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,281
Taking down Diaz was always gonna
come down to the three of us.

178
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:04,908
So what's the plan?

179
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,789
Well, we can wait until
my NSA lead pans out.

180
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,117
Until then, we are kind of
dead in the water.

181
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,497
The city's dying. We just can't sit
around here picking our noses.

182
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,580
No, you're absolutely right. And we
need to go at this some way

183
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,255
that does not depend on finding Diaz.

184
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,832
Even if that means grasping
at straws.

185
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,009
Look, forget grasping at straws.

186
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,802
What if we grasp at his wallet?

187
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,256
The best way to get to Diaz
is to go after his operation.

188
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,717
What operation?

189
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,143
He was really deep
into pushing Vertigo.

190
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,390
Was?

191
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,517
John and Oliver took out
his operation three weeks ago.

192
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,017
Well, then that means Diaz has to be
in the market for a new supplier.

193
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,478
Or an old one.

194
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,193
Before Diaz went to prison,
he led the Scorpions.

195
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,899
That is Star City's biggest supplier.

196
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,074
That feels like a leap.

197
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,618
It may be, but it's all we got.

198
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,661
And even if it doesn't lead to Diaz,

199
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,081
we still take down a drug operation.
That's a win-win.

200
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,750
You know, but the problem is,
with me boxed out of the SCPD,

201
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,748
it's gonna be a lot harder
to get intel on the Scorpions.

202
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,374
Maybe not.

203
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,169
Diaz isn't the only person
who grew up in the Glades.

204
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,210
Well, I was pretty surprised
to get your invite.

205
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,548
Especially to this place.

206
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,097
You remember what I said about
coming here with my girls, huh?

207
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,725
And the new location got an upgrade.

208
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,890
Not fancy enough for the new mayor?

209
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,730
It's perfect.

210
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,735
You okay?

211
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,609
I'm really sorry.

212
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,281
What are you talking about?

213
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,234
Mr. Mayor.

214
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,119
I've been meaning
to congratulate you.

215
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,248
I thought I'd come down here
in person.

216
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,415
I mean, you are the mayor of my city.

217
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,466
And we have a lot in common.

218
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,880
What the hell do you want?

219
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,717
Straight to business. I love it.

220
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,727
Here's an executive order

221
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,977
for a certain piece
of municipal real estate

222
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,853
to be sold privately.

223
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,898
Now, the good news, it's a bargain.

224
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,322
Well, I'm not signing this.
I'm not signing anything for you.

225
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,774
I would reconsider your position.

226
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,109
Really?

227
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,444
I bet

228
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,123
she'd give you that same advice.

229
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,994
I'm telling you right now,
if anything happens to her...

230
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,296
Why would I wanna hurt Laurel?

231
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,581
Hmm?

232
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,176
She's with me now.

233
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:31,555
And she is
such a smart, little thing.

234
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,106
She knows how to pick
the winning side.

235
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,855
I hope it runs in the family.

236
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,938
Let's go, baby.

237
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,528
Come on.

238
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,871
Behind that glass door is where
the Scorpions do their business.

239
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,125
- The problem is, it's sound proof.
- But not laser proof.

240
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,960
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Absolutely.

241
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,264
The CIA would kill to get a laser
microphone with this capacity.

242
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,557
How long is this gonna take?

243
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,931
Just trying to find a signal.

244
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,890
All right, well, let's hurry it up.
I didn't get a severance.

245
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,065
I really shouldn't be gambling.

246
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,110
Got something.

247
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,565
Huge deal going down tonight.

248
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,858
New buyer.

249
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,070
Is trying to get some product
to tide them over for the short-term.

250
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,450
Could be our friend.

251
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,202
They say when it's going down?

252
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,951
No, no, no. I lost the signal.

253
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,748
The big guy is blocking my laser.

254
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,048
I'm on it.

255
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,546
Yo, man.

256
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,883
Yo, man. You think I didn't see that?

257
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,588
You trying to copy my bets, hoss?

258
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,093
You trying to ruin my odds?

259
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,096
What the hell are you talking about?

260
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,179
So we lying now?
That's what we're doing?

261
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,309
- Let me see that paper.
- You're crazy.

262
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,111
Oh, damn.

263
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,905
Uh, you know what, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

264
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,482
Here you go, man. That's yours.

265
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,986
I just get a little crazy
when I lose. Everybody, chill.

266
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,411
I'm leaving.

267
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,282
- You get the location?
- Got it.

268
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,743
Well, let's ruin Diaz's next party.

269
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,254
What if we're wrong?

270
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,212
And those crates are filled with
something other than narcotics.

271
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,264
Like lollipops,
or I don't know, puppies.

272
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,559
I counted a dozen
more guys out front, strapped up.

273
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,307
I'm guessing it's not puppies.

274
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,387
Look, we got to get this done

275
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,564
before the group outside
notices we're here.

276
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,391
And before Diaz's crew shows.

277
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,601
Let's do this.

278
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,369
Still got it.

279
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,826
Still humble, I see.

280
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,619
- Definitely not puppies.
- Or drugs.

281
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,080
The product
the Scorpions are moving is M4s.

282
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,790
You guys still think Diaz
is the buyer?

283
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,336
Yeah. Definitely.

284
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,714
Nobody's doing anything in this city
without his say so.

285
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,472
Diaz's crew is a little early.

286
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,636
Come on.

287
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,520
We got more company.

288
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:31,696
Who are the guys in the suits?

289
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,622
We got to get out of here.

290
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,709
Back door. Over there.

291
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,357
We're trapped.

292
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,730
Blow them all to hell.

293
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,532
Let's go, now!

294
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,469
The Quadrant.

295
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,588
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover.

296
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,594
I never could get anyone to confirm
their existence.

297
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,225
Yeah, well, they are real.
Very, very, real.

298
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,933
We're tracking this one. Cassamento.
Hoping she will lead us to Diaz.

299
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,522
Yeah, well, we were hoping the
Scorpions would lead us to Diaz, too.

300
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,725
Got some intel they were planning
a huge thing tonight.

301
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,812
We just figured it was drugs.
Turns out it was an ambush.

302
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,396
Quadrant wanted the Scorpions dead.

303
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,697
They wanted us dead, too.

304
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,820
It's a good thing you guys showed up
when you did.

305
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,651
You probably want a thank you
or something, huh?

306
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,080
What I want is to apologize, Rene.

307
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,744
My feelings on how you guys
conducted yourselves aside,

308
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,755
things got really out of hand.

309
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,715
And I'm sorry for the part
that I played in it.

310
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,877
Thanks, hoss.

311
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,509
Let's get back to work.

312
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,220
Everyone who thinks the Quadrant
showing up

313
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,597
when Diaz gets control of the city
is a coincidence

314
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,723
raise your hands.

315
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,814
The muscle that they brought in
yesterday were Diaz's guys.

316
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,645
The question is, what are they doing
working with the Quadrant?

317
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,103
A.R.G.U.S. think Cassamento is
planning to move a huge shipment

318
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,438
of weapons into the city.
Kasnian weapons.

319
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,236
Military grade. Much worse than
what we saw tonight.

320
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,535
We think Diaz may be helping her
with that operation.

321
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,197
Wasn't expecting to see you here.

322
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,374
Wasn't expecting to see you either.
Everything all right?

323
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,873
Not really.
Diaz just paid me a visit.

324
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,376
He wants me to sign over a piece
of city property to him. A building.

325
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,298
So why are you here instead
of talking to your boy?

326
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,592
Because I couldn't get in touch
with Oliver.

327
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,551
The Quadrant. What is that?

328
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,884
Just a super powerful,
monolithic, secret organization.

329
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,184
No big deal.

330
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,511
Diaz was wearing that ring.

331
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,562
So Diaz isn't just working
with Cassamento. He...

332
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,268
He joined the Quadrant.

333
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,776
The attack on the Scorpions
was to take out the competition. His.

334
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,073
And I'm guessing
that that city property

335
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,526
will be a really nice place
to store all that foreign ordnance

336
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,407
that Cassamento is planning on
bringing into the city.

337
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,120
This city building that Diaz wants,

338
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,158
where is it?

339
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,253
My men have woken up
from tranquilizer dart.

340
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,331
Time to go see Diaz.

341
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,087
You think he'll give you a reward?

342
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,009
A man can dream.

343
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,092
But I settle for satisfaction.

344
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,090
Enjoy it while it lasts.

345
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,348
Because, Anatoly,
when you are no longer useful,

346
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,855
he'll cut you loose.

347
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,892
Just like Cayden James.

348
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,191
Cayden James made fatal mistake.

349
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,689
Underestimating Diaz.

350
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,816
I do not.

351
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,193
I see him for who he is.

352
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,116
I understand his code.

353
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,580
Diaz doesn't have a code.

354
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,624
He doesn't have honor.

355
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,586
But you working with him,

356
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:21,969
you are betraying everything
that you've ever believed in.

357
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,181
No need to be gentle with this one.

358
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,522
It's pretty quiet around here.

359
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,988
You're really quiet, too.
Should I be taking that personally?

360
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,200
No, hoss. We're good.

361
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,948
That apology you made,

362
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,825
you got fiber, John.

363
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,915
What's on your mind?

364
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,082
I can't stop thinking about dying.

365
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,329
Hmm.

366
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,508
In the middle of the fight,
I just froze.

367
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,132
PTSD, fritz out... I mean...

368
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,841
Actually, it wasn't just so much
about dying as it was about...

369
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,550
Leaving Zoe without a father.

370
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,268
Yeah, you get it.

371
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,057
You got a kid younger than Zoe.
How do you deal with it?

372
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,606
I don't, man. Not out here.

373
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,732
When I put this holster on,

374
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,071
I leave daddy home.

375
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,201
I put the walls of
compartmentalizing up hard, Rene.

376
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,405
You've been out of the game
for a month, over a month.

377
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,951
It'll come back to you.

378
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,076
Just give it some time.

379
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,207
Yo, take a look at that.

380
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,763
If Diaz's plan is
to store the weapons,

381
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,893
why are they bringing the crates
to the truck?

382
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,350
Cassamento's not looking
to move guns into the city.

383
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,978
She and Diaz are using the city
to ship them out.

384
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,313
Turning Star City into a way station.

385
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,611
Curtis, Dinah,
we've seen all we need to see.

386
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,529
Let's regroup at A.R.G.U.S.

387
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,907
You still here, Becky?

388
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,869
Nope.

389
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,835
Sorry. Not Becky.

390
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,843
Or Laurel. At least not my Laurel.

391
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,803
She wouldn't choose a guy like

392
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,972
Diaz.

393
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,762
You think he gives anyone a choice?

394
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,226
Do you?

395
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,100
That's why I'm here.

396
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,644
To tell you
that you don't have a choice.

397
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,975
You have to sign this.

398
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,526
Whatever Diaz wants you to sign.

399
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:47,614
Don't pretend like you give a crap
about me, all right.

400
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:52,111
You proud of yourself for turning
a father's grief against him?

401
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,993
As far as I'm concerned,
you're worse than Diaz.

402
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,870
You have no idea
what he is capable of.

403
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,078
I know what you're capable of.
You can bring walls smashing down.

404
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,207
You really expect me to believe

405
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,085
that you are scared
of a thug like Diaz?

406
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,962
So much more than just a thug.
And, yes.

407
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,137
Yes, I am scared.

408
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,923
And you should be scared, too.

409
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,764
So just sign the damn paper.

410
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,227
God damn it!

411
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,150
I made this so easy for you,
didn't I?

412
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,985
I let you into my home,
set you up,

413
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,937
the law books, everything.
I bet you and Diaz,

414
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,989
you must have just loved that.

415
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,404
Hate me all you want.
I'm sure I deserve it.

416
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,864
But I need you to sign this
or he's gonna kill you.

417
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,830
Now that the daughter act is shot,

418
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,419
there's no need for you
to be in my home,

419
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,751
is there?

420
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,713
All right, so when I get home
tonight, please,

421
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,593
I expect you to be gone, all right?
Please just be gone.

422
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,894
- Quentin...
- Please get out of here, now!

423
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,273
Now!

424
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,903
Those Kasnian weapons
Cassamento imported

425
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,455
are shipping out tonight
for the Eastern Seaboard.

426
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,333
But even with A.R.G.U.S. backing
us up there's no way

427
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,285
we can stop all that ordnance.

428
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,088
- So what's the play?
- The play is we destroy it.

429
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,882
Tag the trucks. Let A.R.G.U.S.
attack them separately.

430
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,052
If Diaz is there,
we're taking him out.

431
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,462
That's the plan, right?

432
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,796
That is still the plan.

433
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:45,770
I won't let anyone split us up
ever again. I promise.

434
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,898
Rene.

435
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:54,900
You good?

436
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,568
I don't think so.

437
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,030
That compartmentalizing you talked
about, it's not kicking in.

438
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,992
- Give it some time, man.
- Maybe.

439
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,910
I don't know.

440
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,295
But what I do know is,
if I go out there like this,

441
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,792
I'm no good to anyone.

442
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,628
Sorry, but I think I might have to
sit this one out.

443
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,551
Wait, what's happening?

444
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,629
Just a tough reentry, that's all.

445
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,469
The three of us, plus A.R.G.U.S.
We'll be fine.

446
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,155
I'll be gone in a minute.

447
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,412
Just wait.

448
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,410
Listen, back there at my office, I...

449
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,920
I've never heard you sound so scared.

450
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,291
It made me realize, you were serious.

451
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,587
Diaz is a monster.

452
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,058
And you can't even imagine
what it's been like.

453
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,060
Okay, back on the Earth you're from,

454
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,559
you got a guy named Damien Darhk,
real son of a bitch?

455
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,900
- Yeah.
- Well, I worked for him.

456
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,189
I'd do whatever he wanted

457
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,946
to keep my Laurel safe.

458
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,529
And then when I betrayed him...

459
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,415
He killed her.

460
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,794
What I'm trying to say is,

461
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,962
I know what it's like
to do a bad thing for a good reason.

462
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,432
You signed it.

463
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,095
One condition.

464
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,351
You let me help you get away
from this guy.

465
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,564
- That's not possible.
- Come on.

466
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,484
I've known a lot of bad men,

467
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:58,774
and they've been filled with anger
and with hate, but not Diaz.

468
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,993
He's not filled with anger inside

469
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,071
because he's not even human inside.

470
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:11,082
I watched him burn a man alive
over a childhood grudge.

471
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,088
If I cross him,

472
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,008
what is he gonna do to me?

473
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,423
Well, I'm not gonna let him do
anything to you, all right?

474
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,130
Yeah, you're gonna protect me
because you're the mayor.

475
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,724
You're not the mayor of anything.

476
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,176
Okay, listen, I'm gonna protect you

477
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,183
because I refuse to let
what happened to my Laurel

478
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,605
happen a second time.

479
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,185
Okay.

480
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,854
So we protect each other.

481
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,086
You say
I betray myself working with Diaz.

482
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,967
I think much on this.

483
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,680
- And?
- You may be right.

484
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:07,051
But I realize
moment things went wrong.

485
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,687
Last year when I trusted you
to bring me into city.

486
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,724
So if I betray myself,

487
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,433
Kapiushon,

488
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,770
it is because you,
you betray me first.

489
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,652
Come on. Diaz in here.

490
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,914
If Diaz and the Quadrant ship even
one of those crates...

491
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,541
They'll be arming their syndicates
with weapons

492
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,672
intended for hi-tech warfare.
Yeah, I got it.

493
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,212
The drone is three minutes out.
It won't circle long.

494
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,221
Okay, folks. We have a window.

495
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,137
Their weapons are equipped with
stealth adapters,

496
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,975
making them invisible to ASMs.

497
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,932
You know what to do.

498
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,355
You guys provide me cover fire,

499
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,766
I'll tag all the trucks by hand
so the drones know where to aim.

500
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,569
I think maybe we should
paint the targets.

501
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,110
Olympic decathlon medalist here.
I got this.

502
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,082
Not having a police presence
to worry about

503
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,458
has made our jobs easier.

504
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,456
The first convoy is ready
to move out.

505
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,682
Not again. This time take care
of them, please.

506
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,005
Go, go, go!

507
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,886
Drone is en route. Panel commencing.

508
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,525
Five down, three to go.

509
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,237
One left.

510
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,959
I guess you're not gonna make it
any easier?

511
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,817
Your friends just blew up
12 million dollars

512
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,985
in next-gen firepower.

513
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,320
I don't have any friends.

514
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,289
Tickles.

515
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,033
You see this man?

516
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,827
Savior of this city.

517
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,792
It's pathetic.

518
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,509
I feel like you can do better
than that.

519
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,674
Stop it.

520
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,976
This is pointless.

521
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,020
You said you had plan for him,
that you need him alive, no?

522
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,812
In Bratva we have ways of dealing
with conflict like this.

523
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,979
We fight with honor,
we don't do this.

524
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,448
You want me to fight him fairly?

525
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,782
Life ain't fair.

526
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,703
Every drop of blood you draw
from prone man

527
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,294
is sign of weakness. Your weakness.

528
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,052
I'm not weak.

529
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:18,847
Let's go.

530
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,152
Thank you.

531
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,858
I not do this for you.

532
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,240
Let's make things interesting.

533
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,876
I put you on the ground,

534
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,879
you leave Star City forever.

535
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,258
You put me on the ground,

536
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,631
I do the same.

537
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,222
That fair enough for you?

538
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,468
Yeah.

539
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,597
You think you're so tough

540
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,774
because you spent five years in hell?

541
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,277
I was born in it.

542
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,426
Come on.

543
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,075
Yield!

544
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,949
Yield or I'll break your neck!

545
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,898
It's like I said,

546
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,938
life ain't fair.

547
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:37,027
You, you have failed this city.

548
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,321
And I'm gonna take it back.

549
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,420
Maybe he won't be so smart
when he wakes up.

550
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,487
Thank you.

551
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,404
Bandage is least I could do.

552
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,873
Not for the bandages, Anatoly.

553
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,042
Thank you for giving me the chance
to take out Diaz.

554
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,214
What makes you think that's what
I was doing?

555
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,881
Maybe I want to see it for myself.

556
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,589
See what?

557
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,594
Which one of you had honor.

558
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,433
Just like you wanted, no?

559
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,691
You allow yourself to be captured,
so I bring you to Diaz.

560
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:05,449
You know, I just thought that I could
count on you to be the man I knew.

561
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,706
That man was my friend.

562
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:18,249
Hurry up with bandages.
I have plan to get you out of here.

563
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,421
He wants to see you.

564
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,851
You know, I'd almost forgotten
how awesome it is.

565
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,105
Being a team, working together.

566
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,228
It's almost like Captain Planet
or the Power Rangers,

567
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,858
or whatever references
you guys understand.

568
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,066
- Star City Rockets.
- Is that like a sports team?

569
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:47,078
I gotta get going.
I got a debrief on my schedule.

570
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,325
Having a day job
has been a definite change.

571
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,907
Hey, John, um,

572
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:57,585
if you ever think about dropping
the ARG and, you know, joining us.

573
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,166
Oh, I hate puns,
especially bad ones,

574
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,795
but he does have a point,
and we are down one teammate.

575
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,922
Guys, look, I've made a decision.

576
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,973
I'm gonna see it through.

577
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,769
But if we need to, it doesn't mean
we can't ever help each other.

578
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,725
And by the way, even if I do
join you guys,

579
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,484
you'd still be down a teammate.

580
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,990
- Yo.
- Hey, what's up?

581
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,742
Is that a cake?

582
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:31,864
Wow. Zoe keeps this up,

583
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,540
you guys are gonna have to
open up bakery or something.

584
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,289
Yeah, this is her biology homework.
I'm letting her sleep in.

585
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,505
She crashed hard after finishing her
leftover mitochondria.

586
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,715
Gummy Worms. Good choice.

587
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,918
What are you doing here, hoss?

588
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,921
Just checking up on you.

589
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,678
Seeing if there is anything I can do
to speed up that

590
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,510
compartmentalizing you were
talking about.

591
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,553
It's been half a day, hoss.

592
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,149
Plus, you guys had a big win
without me yesterday.

593
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,060
It was just a small win, really.

594
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,566
Seriously, with Diaz working
with the Quadrant now,

595
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,150
things are only gonna get worse.

596
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,952
If we're gonna have a chance in hell
of stopping him,

597
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,742
we're gonna need all the help
we can get.

598
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,499
We're gonna need you.

599
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,539
Look, man,

600
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,423
every time I think about
going out there again,

601
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,292
all I can think of is Zoe.

602
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,554
What's gonna happen to her
if something happens to me?

603
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,764
I'll be fine, Dad.

604
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,885
Uncle Curtis and I were just
talking about...

605
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,978
How you both wear masks and go
and fight bad guys?

606
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,814
It's way obvious.

607
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,062
And you and Dinah talk way louder
than you think you do.

608
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,730
Really? Really?

609
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,312
Oh, I can actually hear it.
It's pretty loud.

610
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,188
Sweetheart, come here. Sit down.

611
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,785
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

612
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,495
I don't need to be Wild Dog anymore.

613
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,709
Dad, this is my home.

614
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,412
And I want you to fight for it.

615
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,915
You know, I've been hurt in the past
year twice already.

616
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,215
I know.

617
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,213
And that was scary.

618
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,595
But you taught me to be brave,

619
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,297
and face up
to the things that scare me.

620
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,309
Come here. Come here.

621
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,269
I'll be brave
just like my little girl.

622
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,101
Okay?

623
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,433
Okay.

624
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,606
Now, who we planning on whacking?

625
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,866
That's what I've been thinking of.

626
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,407
Maybe your daddy.

627
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,031
Which is why I came to see you.

628
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,745
Mazel tov.

629
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,460
This is good.

630
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,675
What do you care about
owning this property legally?

631
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,426
It's not about legality.

632
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,675
It's about this.

633
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,934
I needed to know if I could trust
the new mayor.

634
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,598
And what if he didn't sign it?

635
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,058
What if?

636
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,792
We had an agreement if I recall.

637
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,787
I put you on the floor,

638
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,668
you leave the city.

639
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,295
That assumed a fair fight.

640
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,796
Potato, patato.

641
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:36,056
But I have a certain pang
of conscience.

642
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,636
I changed my mind.

643
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,479
You could stay in this city.

644
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,565
For 25 to life.

645
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,864
I'm thinking about moving up
your trial.

646
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,279
How's next week for you?

647
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,208
Don't even think about getting bail.

648
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,708
I got a lot of friends

649
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,668
at the courthouse.

650
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,260
<i>- Mr. Queen.
- Mr. Queen.</i>

651
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,884
<i>A shocking development today</i>

652
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,638
<i>as Oliver Queen's bail was revoked.</i>

653
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,595
<i>Speculation that the former mayor
is secretly the Green Arrow</i>

654
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,601
<i>has multiplied in recent weeks</i>

655
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:28,685
<i>after his decision to terminate
two city officials investigating him</i>

656
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,189
<i>led to his impeachment.</i>

657
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,901
<i>The trial is scheduled to begin
May 3rd.</i>

658
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,862
<i>Jean Loring will represent
the suspected vigilante,</i>

659
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,660
<i>but she has an uphill battle
ahead of her.</i>

660
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,490
<i>If convicted, Oliver Queen
could face a life sentence.</i>

661
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,667
<i>His fate now rests in Star City's
justice system.</i>
