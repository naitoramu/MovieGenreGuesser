1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,588
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,634
You're all this city has,
so stop being so hard on yourself.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,261
That notebook belonged to my father.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,646
I thought that it was my way
to save the city.

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,306
We all want to believe
in Oliver's crusade,

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,474
but I'm pissed that the guy

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,860
who only shares the important information
with his inner circle

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,270
used to be a serial killer.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,064
For a long time, I blamed you
for my parents dying.

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,201
Knowing all this
doesn't make it any easier.

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,158
Nobody followed me.
They don't suspect a thing.

12
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,304
I brought what you asked for.

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,486
Addresses are on the back.

14
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,575
I took those last two myself.

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,082
What, that's it? We had a deal.

16
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,297
I get you the intel, I get to be there
when you take him down.

17
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,220
You think
you can make demands of me?

18
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,173
No.

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,054
No, of course not. I know he's your kill,

20
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,641
but I want to watch him die.

21
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,355
You haven't been listening.
I'm not going to kill him.

22
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,234
I'm gonna make him wish he was dead.

23
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,624
This is incredible, Speedy.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,043
I can't believe you pulled it off,
especially after...

25
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,097
Oh, I thought we decided
not to talk about aliens anymore?

26
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,641
- Right.
- And besides, how can you be so surprised?

27
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,935
I'm Moira Queen's daughter,
and that means

28
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,346
throwing a killer Christmas party
is in my blood.

29
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,227
Mom and Dad would be very
proud of you, Speedy.

30
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,391
Me? Come on, you're the Mayor.

31
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,731
They'd be so happy, they wouldn't know
what to do with themselves.

32
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:26,738
Are you all right? Because,
what the Dominators showed us,

33
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,320
it was a little like losing them
all over again.

34
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,828
They didn't take anything away from me,
they gave me something.

35
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,910
They reminded me how lucky I am
to be a part of this family

36
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,326
and to have you as my brother.

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,835
How sweet.

38
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,587
- Sorry, I'm late.
- No, it's fine.

39
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,343
I know, I know, I already broke
the first rule of being a good date

40
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,381
by not arriving with you,
but I had a crushing deadline.

41
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,048
Glamorous life of a journalist, right?

42
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,512
The dress that you're wearing
makes up for it.

43
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,643
<i>I...</i>

44
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,100
You're his... His date?

45
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,722
Yeah.

46
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,436
Yeah, just... Just for this party.

47
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,569
Which, by the way,
is a definite improvement

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,731
over the previous Mayor's holiday bash.
Nicely done.

49
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,740
Thanks. It's really great to know

50
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,990
that this administration can do,
like, one thing right.

51
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,283
- Be nice, Thea.
- No,

52
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,789
I'm gonna go get a drink now,
talk to you later.

53
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,041
She's... I mean,
she's just being protective.

54
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,081
Mmm. To be fair,
I didn't make the best first impression.

55
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,758
Well, I of all people understand
that sometimes doing your job

56
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,006
means pissing people off.

57
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,466
It just means that you're doing it well.

58
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,844
I see you've reclaimed your optimism.

59
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,349
Oh, thanks to you.

60
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,806
Cheers.

61
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,567
- Is that your second champagne?
- Third.

62
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,483
Are you really that nervous
to finally introduce me to your friends?

63
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,153
I just want them to love you
as much as I I...

64
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,073
...like you.

65
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,251
These are my friends.

66
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,250
Guys, this is my Malone boyfriend.

67
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,090
This is Billy Malone,
my boy... Boyfriend

68
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,004
I'm Curtis, by the way,

69
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,674
the guy awkwardly standing in front of you
waiting to be introduced.

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,934
- And this is my husband, Paul.
- Curtis is my best friend at work.

71
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,595
Well, was, until I was fired
from my own company. Cheers.

72
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,605
I thought you guys were working
on a startup together?

73
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,565
The one he's been putting
all the late nights in on?

74
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,943
The very late nights at the startup, yes!
We, it's just...

75
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,320
The startup is so fun, I mean,
we barely call it work,

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,521
because it's just like...

77
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,065
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

78
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,192
So much fun.

79
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,868
Who needs a fancy party at City Hall

80
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,628
when all the most important people
are right here?

81
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,541
Oh, shucks, John,
you're gonna make us all blush.

82
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,755
Do you think it's a fire hazard
to light the menorah in here?

83
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,048
I think the only hazard's gonna be

84
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,090
if you mess with that table setting
before Lyla gets back with the turkey.

85
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,057
Oh.

86
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,844
- What do you think?
- Nice.

87
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,012
- Cute kid.
- Yeah, he gets it from his mom.

88
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,305
I figured.

89
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,649
Must be weird
finding out about Flashpoint.

90
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,734
Yeah, I'm still not sure
how I feel about that, man.

91
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,990
I should be used to all the unusual things
around here,

92
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,149
especially after last week, but,

93
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,620
I could never imagine a daughter.

94
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,247
Cool car!

95
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,872
Being a father's
the best thing in the world,

96
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,915
especially around the holidays.

97
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,917
Sounds like you know something
about kids, you got any?

98
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,834
Sorry, I'm late, but I come bearing gifts.

99
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,004
We had this tradition in my family
where we all open our presents

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,888
at the exact same time.

101
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,267
Since you guys are the only family I have,
I figured I'd try it with you.

102
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,597
Thanks.

103
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,394
Were you even listening to the rules?

104
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,356
I don't like rules, or listening.

105
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,571
This is dope, Evie!

106
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,273
Wow.

107
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,367
Thanks, Evelyn, it's very sweet.

108
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,527
You're welcome.

109
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,072
You know, the best part is,
this is gonna piss Oliver off

110
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,117
when we hang these up all over the place.

111
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,036
<i>Happy Holidays, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.</i>

112
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,623
My favorite Christmas movie is Die <i>Hard.</i>

113
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,004
It's true. My second favorite
Christmas movie is It's a Wonderful Life.

114
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:24,848
And I was very lucky to be able to
rewatch that movie last week.

115
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,980
It reminded me how much work
I still have to do,

116
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,483
how much work all of us still have to do,

117
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,645
and it inspired me to recommit myself

118
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,611
to making our city, our home,

119
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,743
a better and safer place. Cheers.

120
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,749
Great speech.

121
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,117
Uh...

122
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,665
What she said.

123
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,252
Uh, Felicity, right?

124
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,382
Yeah, you must be the super-hot reporter.

125
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,043
Um, Thank you.

126
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,845
What I meant to say was, this is my,
this is my boyfriend, Billy.

127
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,597
It's nice to see you again, Mayor Queen.

128
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,136
Billy, please call me Oliver.

129
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,888
Hey, um, we're actually gonna head out.

130
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,852
- Everything all right?
- It will be.

131
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,475
L think.

132
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,699
So, you guys want to go on a double date
some time, or...

133
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,277
<i>No. Cook</i>

134
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,918
Paul! Paul, come on!

135
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,629
Tell me the truth. All those nights
you said you were with Felicity,

136
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,381
- what have you been doing?
- Nothing.

137
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,675
- Are you seeing someone?
- Baby, of course not!

138
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,969
- I don't believe you.
- Let me explain.

139
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,854
Curtis!

140
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,272
Get out of here, run!

141
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,951
- No!

142
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,162
Do what you want to me,
just leave him alone.

143
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,759
No!

144
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,433
Help! Somebody help us!

145
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,391
Please! Help!

146
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,854
- Hey.
- How you feeling?

147
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,108
Like someone threw a throwing star at me,

148
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,615
kicked me down a flight of steps,
and knocked me out.

149
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,622
The doctor said you're not
supposed to sit up.

150
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,126
Yeah, well, the doctor
doesn't know me that well.

151
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,332
Not sure I do anymore, either.

152
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,255
I can explain everything.

153
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,384
Great. Let's start with
where you learned to fight like that.

154
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,300
Fight like what? In case you
hadn't noticed, I lost. Badly.

155
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,431
You think I don't know who
that was, Curtis?

156
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,101
That was the Throwing Star Killer.
He's murdered people.

157
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,810
And yet somehow, you're still alive.
How is that even possible?

158
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,815
Oh, my God, Curtis, are you all right?

159
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,068
I'm great. Just a little banged up,

160
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,979
like I always am when I get into
street fights with muggers.

161
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,319
It wasn't a mugger,
it was a serial killer,

162
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,825
the Throwing Star Killer.

163
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,028
I thought you had the Anti-Crime Unit
taking care of this.

164
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,075
We do, Paul, and-and we're working
very hard to catch him. I promise.

165
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,617
<i>Actually, your statement
could really help.</i>

166
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,036
Detective Malone is just outside,

167
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,954
if you'd feel comfortable answering
a few questions?

168
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,081
It's all right, Paul.

169
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,671
Prometheus.

170
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,593
He attacked me, as well "me."

171
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,056
So he knows you're Mr. Terrific.

172
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,517
Yeah. Which means he probably knows...

173
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,431
He knows that I'm the Green Arrow.

174
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,154
If you remember anything else
that could help us, give me a call.

175
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,314
My cell's on there, too.

176
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,524
Thank you, Detective.

177
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,239
I can't believe that this is happening.

178
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,448
Can't you?

179
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,209
You think I haven't figured out
that the tall guy in the black mask

180
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,870
rolling with the Green Arrow is Curtis?

181
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,295
Promise me you didn't tell Paul.

182
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,003
No, but right now,
I'm more worried about you.

183
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,426
If Prometheus is targeting the people
working with the Green Arrow...

184
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,627
I'll be fine.

185
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,546
And I'll feel better if you're
staying at my place

186
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,177
at least until we track down Prometheus.

187
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,305
- We?
- It's my job, Felicity.

188
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,349
If there's a killer out there,
I'm gonna stop him,

189
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,897
especially if he's a threat
to someone I care about.

190
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,182
Billy. Billy!

191
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,857
Everything all right?

192
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,573
No. The doctor was speaking with Curtis,
he's gonna be fine,

193
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,737
but they found a drug in his system
called Dycloserol.

194
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,747
No, never heard of it.

195
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,996
But you have, what is it?

196
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,753
Well, it's gonna take some adjusting,

197
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,257
not trying to catch you
giving me the slip.

198
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,717
I grabbed some Big Belly on the way in,
hope you're hungry.

199
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,759
I lost my appetite. Come look at this.

200
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,771
<i>TB outbreak in Lamb Valley?
Since when?</i>

201
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,772
Since this guy got greedy.

202
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,274
<i>That's one smug-looking
son of</i> a <i>bitch.</i>

203
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,527
Justin Claybourne owns
Claybourne Pharmaceuticals

204
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,656
that recently acquired the rights
to this drug, Dycloserol,

205
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,279
which fights this particular strain of TB.

206
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,944
Let me guess,
as soon as the outbreak started,

207
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,111
he jacked up the prices.

208
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,451
Price went from $10 a pill
to $1,000 overnight.

209
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,078
The people of Lamb Valley,
they're working class,

210
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,743
low income, they can't afford this.

211
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,162
It's disgusting, but not illegal.

212
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,375
Claybourne is on the list.
I'm not worried about illegal.

213
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,793
Just because your father
wrote down his name?

214
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,429
My father explained this list.
These are terrible people.

215
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,722
How would you know that?
I thought he was dead.

216
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,763
I am gonna make sure that Claybourne
stops gouging people.

217
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,303
And what if he refuses to cooperate?

218
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,437
You ask that like he has a choice.

219
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,073
<i>After what seems like a respite
from the serial murders weeks ago,</i>

220
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,360
<i>the Throwing Star Killer strikes again.</i>

221
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,869
<i>Another attack by the Throwing Star Killer</i>

222
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,497
<i>disrupted the annual holiday party
at City Hall.</i>

223
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,000
Maybe we should change
the security codes on the bunker.

224
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,495
Yeah, we did that over an hour ago.

225
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,087
All the good that'll do.

226
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,294
Rene's right.

227
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,208
And you know
how much she hates saying that.

228
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,878
If Prometheus knows who Curtis is,
he knows who we all are.

229
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,513
Maybe Barry could do that
Flashpoint thing again?

230
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,221
Yeah, he does that,
Digg might end up with five kids.

231
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,930
Stuff makes my brain hurt.

232
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,219
How's Curtis?

233
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,387
He's gonna be fine.

234
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,476
Better, now that
the Dycloserol's out of his system.

235
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,641
Prometheus injected him with it
when he attacked him.

236
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,810
Dycloserol. Now, why does that
ring a bell?

237
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,527
Because four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne,

238
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,533
the CEO of the pharmaceutical company
that manufactures it.

239
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,114
And by took him down, you mean killed.

240
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,278
- Right?
- Yeah.

241
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,242
<i>After Claybourne's death,
his company went down,</i>

242
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,328
he had no other family members
to leave it to.

243
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,289
Still, Prometheus using Dycloserol
four years after the fact

244
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,452
can't be a coincidence.

245
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,542
- It does send a message.
- What message?

246
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,873
I'm alive and I'm coming after you.

247
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,758
You think Prometheus is Justin Claybourne?

248
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,048
How's that possible?

249
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,588
Well, in our town, people who are dead
turn out to be secretly alive

250
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,755
almost every Wednesday.

251
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,890
Case in point, the old Claybourne
manufacturing plant

252
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,427
reports heavy usage of water and power
over the last few months.

253
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,936
Doesn't mean it's Claybourne.

254
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,814
Worth checking out. Suit up.

255
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,025
- We're in.
- Copy.

256
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,907
Ragman, are you in position?

257
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,747
If he's in there, he's not getting out.

258
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,287
Nobody makes a move
until I give the order.

259
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,831
<i>Got it.</i>

260
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,257
Hey, he said don't make a move.

261
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,464
Yeah, but he knows I never listen to him.

262
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,263
<i>That could be something.</i>

263
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,136
You keep moving, I'll check it out.

264
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,015
- Overwatch.
- Already on it.

265
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,934
<i>Tracking the transmission
from the sensors now.</i>

266
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,981
- That was fast.
- No, that was impossible.

267
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,231
He's letting me in.

268
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,775
<i>No, you need to pull back, it's not safe.</i>

269
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,079
Five years and he still doesn't listen.

270
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:52,143
Justin Claybourne,
you have failed this city.

271
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,982
Not as badly as you have, Mr. Queen.

272
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,080
Spartan, go upstairs,
Green Arrow needs your help.

273
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,247
Me and Artemis are on the stairwell,
we can get there faster.

274
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,336
You ready for a rematch with this bitch?

275
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,339
More than. Prometheus doesn't scare me.

276
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,708
I've been waiting four years for this.

277
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,300
Let him go, you son of a bitch.

278
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,340
What the...

279
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,721
Evelyn?

280
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,642
- Why?
- Because you're not a hero,

281
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,894
you're a fraud.

282
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,397
This city needs to be saved from you.

283
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,414
Where's Prometheus?

284
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,248
He's gone with Evelyn.

285
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,832
He took her?

286
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,751
He's working with her.

287
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,634
- Stuff from the plant.
- Can you put it over there?

288
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,805
- Where's Oliver?
- He's with Thea, helping her pack.

289
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,098
He wants her to stay here.

290
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,433
Lyla and J.J.
are at a A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

291
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,644
Give me the names and socials
of the people you care about,

292
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,274
I'll make sure they get to the safehouse.

293
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,153
Wait. What other secret information could
Evelyn have told Prometheus about us?

294
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,565
We've got to assume everything.
No one is safe.

295
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,530
This is on me. I should've done
a better job at vetting her.

296
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,693
This wasn't your fault.

297
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,409
Seriously. No one
could've seen this coming.

298
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,035
We don't have time
to play the blame game.

299
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,199
We have to find Claybourne.

300
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,460
We were hoping there was
something here that could help.

301
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,087
- Like ashes?
- Those look like crematorium ashes.

302
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,044
Question is, whose?

303
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,461
Right. Well, I got to go, so you guys need
to run a DNA test

304
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,846
on these ashes and bone fragments,

305
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,725
find out who this person was and why
Prometheus is keeping their remains.

306
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,305
You guys know how to run
a DNA sequencer, right?

307
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,971
No, of course you don't.
Look, who I'm talking to.

308
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,764
Just put some of the bone fragments
onto the slide,

309
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,808
put it in the slot, and the machine
will do the rest. Got it?

310
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,318
Uh, sure.

311
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,693
I'll be back.

312
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,825
Did you get all that?

313
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,820
You're the smart one, remember?

314
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,080
Hey. I thought you were gonna
let the Green Arrow handle this.

315
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,836
No, I'm pretty sure my exact words were,

316
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,967
"If there's a killer out there,
I'm gonna stop him."

317
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,504
Yeah, I was just hoping
that was boyfriend posturing.

318
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,092
I cross-referenced Curtis'
medical records with old SCPD case files.

319
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,761
Prometheus injected him with Dycloserol,

320
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,646
- which was manufactured at the Clay...
- Claybourne Pharmaceuticals

321
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,853
and their plant just came online.

322
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,106
Yeah, I know.

323
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,029
How did you know?

324
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,988
Because the Green Arrow hit it already.

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,408
And we already got everything
that there is to get there.

326
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,571
Why didn't you tell me?

327
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,957
Remember that part about me
not wanting you to work on this case?

328
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,496
Yeah, I'm a cop, Felicity, this is my job.

329
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,835
Yeah, and Prometheus' job is killing cops,
so you need to stay away.

330
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,091
Hey, if you're not gonna do it
for yourself,

331
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,383
can you do it for me?

332
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,798
I'm not letting this go.

333
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,089
Felicity, you know how I feel about you,

334
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,842
but I have to be true to who I am.

335
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,774
I can't believe it.

336
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,559
Evelyn was playing us this whole time?

337
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,727
<i>RORY". Not the whole time.</i>

338
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,272
Rene thinks she went dark
after we all found out about The Hood.

339
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,237
You know, I always thought she had
a sort of Children of the Corn vibe.

340
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,652
<i>Anyway, I was just calling
to give you the heads-up.</i>

341
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,944
Watch your back.

342
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,658
Will do. Thanks, Rory.

343
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,828
Hey, baby, what's going on?
Were you able to find me that ice cream?

344
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,119
- Who's Rory?
- Oh...

345
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,874
Oh, Rory. He's a friend of mine
from my Palmer Tech days.

346
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,169
He saw what happened on the news
and was just checking in on me.

347
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,178
You're the world's worst liar, Curtis.

348
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,097
It's one of the reasons I married you.

349
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,381
What're you talking about?

350
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,221
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

351
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,555
The late nights out, canceled dinners,

352
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,644
the inexplicable accidents.

353
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,942
I can't do this anymore.

354
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,068
You have to tell me what's going on.

355
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,616
How do I put this?

356
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,201
I work with the Green Arrow.

357
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,372
You? You work with the Green Arrow?

358
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,912
Yeah.

359
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,669
- Come on.
- It's not impossible.

360
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,217
You're helping the guy who is going around
putting arrows into people?

361
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,879
Well, yeah, but only bad people,

362
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,797
and only the ones who really
try to put up a fight.

363
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,467
Most guys, we just try to send to jail.

364
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,972
This is completely insane.

365
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,432
Yes, I know that,

366
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,855
but, you know, when you're out there
doing it, it's different.

367
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,021
It feels amazing.

368
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,523
Empowering.

369
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,530
Almost a little inspiring.

370
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,900
You lied to me.

371
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,652
- For months.
- To keep you safe.

372
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,493
To keep me safe? And what about you?

373
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,995
You've been hurt how many times
since you started this?

374
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,502
- Actually lost track.
- Which is why you need to stop.

375
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,833
- Stop what?
- This, being a vigilante.

376
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,122
I made a commitment.

377
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,791
You made one to me, too.

378
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,923
Last time I checked, our vows
didn't include me worrying every night

379
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,555
about whether or not you were gonna
make it home alive the next morning.

380
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,351
Paul...

381
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,728
You can be a vigilante,
or you can be married to me,

382
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,275
but you can't do both.

383
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,399
I can't do both.

384
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,907
Paul, wait...

385
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,708
Think in Flashpoint, I maybe dated her
back in high school?

386
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,540
It's an alternate timeline,
not an alternate reality.

387
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,703
What's that supposed to mean?

388
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,716
It means, and no offense,
but in a multiverse of possibilities,

389
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,252
there's no world where Thea Queen
goes outwith...

390
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,011
You know, someone like you.

391
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,797
What's that supposed to mean,
"someone like me"?

392
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,886
It means you're not my type.

393
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,722
<i>- Any news?
- Nothing.</i>

394
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,886
If Claybourne's out there,
he's not showing his face.

395
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,057
Well, maybe his dead friend
will give us some information.

396
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,225
- You get the sequencer working?
- I think?

397
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,652
Oh, good work!
You got the sequencer working.

398
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,273
Great. So whose ashes
was Claybourne keeping as a souvenir?

399
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,408
Claybourne's.

400
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,277
The ashes are his.

401
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,533
So if Claybourne isn't Prometheus, who is?

402
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,419
Thanks to the influx of cash
from our Dycloserol acquisition,

403
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,089
our R & D pipeline's fully funded
for the next two years.

404
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,180
These are exciting times, gentlemen,
and it's just the beginning.

405
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,948
Justin Claybourne,
you have failed this city.

406
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,617
I think you got the wrong guy, pal.
My company makes drugs that help people.

407
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,576
Not the people in Lamb Valley.

408
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,335
It's not my problem if some people
can't afford it.

409
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,871
It is now.

410
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:59,046
Your days of holding
this city's health hostage are over.

411
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,428
Do you understand me?

412
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,181
Okay, okay, yes!

413
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,804
You have until 11:00 p.m. tomorrow
to make this right.

414
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,186
And what happens if I don't?

415
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,820
I'll aim higher.

416
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,036
Jackpot

417
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,024
SCPD! Show yourself!

418
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,009
Cute baby.

419
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,424
Cute, yeah, but why would your boyfriend
send this to you?

420
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,135
That is what I'm trying to figure out.
That, and why men don't listen

421
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,099
when you specifically tell them
not to do something.

422
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,387
Why don't you guys listen?

423
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,397
<i>Okay,
did you ask him why he sent it?</i>

424
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,900
Yeah, texted him right back, no reply.
I'm kinda worried.

425
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,187
Billy says he found it at
the Claybourne manufacturing plant?

426
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,401
Yeah, according to the
GPS tag on his text.

427
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,066
Why would he send this photo?
What's the relevance?

428
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,234
<i>It's what's I'm trying to figure out.</i>

429
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,450
Right after I try to figure out
why men don't listen.

430
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,412
This is so strange. First human remains,
now baby pictures?

431
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,576
Prometheus, he's...

432
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,586
He's leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
for me to follow.

433
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,123
- Try facial recognition?
- Facial recog isn't exactly baby friendly.

434
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,088
Well, try it anyways,
it's kitchen sink time, and

435
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,504
we don't listen because we're stubborn.

436
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,843
Yeah, tell us something we don't know.

437
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,062
Take it Claybourne wasn't impressed
with your Robin Hood act.

438
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,895
No, he wasn't.
So I did some more digging.

439
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,106
Claybourne didn't just price gouge
with his drug, he created the epidemic.

440
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,943
He is connected to something called
the AK Desmond Group.

441
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,948
They are black marketeers

442
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,951
who specialize in creating bioweapons.

443
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,989
What do you think they've
been working on?

444
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,703
Weaponized tuberculosis.

445
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,459
He created the marketplace, Diggle,

446
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,790
and he didn't care
who died in the process.

447
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,002
And now you're gonna kill him.

448
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,509
How can you read what's in that folder
and have a problem with that?

449
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,635
Have you thought about the ramifications
of your actions?

450
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,467
Of actually crossing names off a list?

451
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,381
Of being judge, jury, and executioner?

452
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,801
Men like Claybourne buy judges,

453
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,600
they buy juries.
The law doesn't apply to them.

454
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,732
- I'm not saying you don't do some good!
- So what are you saying?

455
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,813
What I'm saying is that
maybe one day, your actions

456
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,774
might have some unintended consequences.

457
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,450
Got your 911.

458
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,082
911 might've been
understating things a bit.

459
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,494
Detective Malone's been abducted.
ACU thinks by Prometheus.

460
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,661
Why do they think that?

461
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,830
He went out to track down a lead,
didn't come back.

462
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,171
He's missed his last three call-ins,
GPS on his phone's been switched off.

463
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,335
Do you think he's dead?

464
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:29,381
I think that every cop
that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.

465
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,095
Whether or not Billy's alive,
and believe me, I hope that he is,

466
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,760
the ACU and the SCPD,
they need instructions.

467
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,179
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.

468
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,440
I'm not talking about a Be-On-the-Lookout-
Order, I'm talking about a shoot-to-kill.

469
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,980
I don't know
how that'll sit with the public.

470
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,519
I do. They'll love it.

471
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,359
You know why? Because they are as sick
and tired as I am

472
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,651
of watching this psycho murder Star City's
finest and get away with it.

473
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,535
Our cops need to know
that they can fight back,

474
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,991
they don't have to take it easy
on this guy anymore.

475
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,498
Okay, do it, but you pull in
every cop that you can find,

476
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,204
you tell them holiday hours are revoked.

477
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,584
Yeah.

478
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,877
Talk to me.

479
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,172
Facial recognition did kick back
something on the baby photo.

480
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,306
Court records
related to Claybourne's divorce.

481
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,217
The baby is Claybourne's son.

482
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,931
You told me that Claybourne
didn't have any kids.

483
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,892
Not of the legitimate variety.
But the divorce petition

484
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,772
Claybourne's ex-wife filed says otherwise.

485
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,561
There's no record
of the kid's name in the files,

486
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,725
but due to the filing date,

487
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,690
he'd be about 30 today.

488
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,896
Just old enough to put on
a hood and a mask.

489
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,448
Old enough to want revenge on the man
who murdered his father.

490
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,239
Oliver, this isn't on you, man.

491
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:37,577
Yes, it is.

492
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,250
Yes, it is.

493
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,334
You warned me, John. You warned me that
there would be unintended consequences

494
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,998
and I didn't listen.

495
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,169
Prometheus surprised me
at the plant with a move,

496
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,086
a very specific, unique move.

497
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,266
It was taught to me by a woman
that I met in Russia.

498
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,302
You think you and Prometheus
had the same teacher?

499
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,470
I think what he's saying is,
Prometheus had over four years

500
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,980
to learn everything he does.

501
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,311
Right.

502
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,524
Felicity, Billy has gone missing.

503
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,030
Chase thinks that it's Prometheus.
We alerted the police.

504
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,442
We've ordered them to shoot
Prometheus on sight.

505
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,952
Now, we are gonna find Billy,

506
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,455
we are gonna bring him back to you,
I promise.

507
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,117
Let's call Rory and Rene,
we're gonna hit the streets.

508
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,457
If you learn anything, contact me.

509
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,123
Do not engage this enemy
under any circumstances.

510
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,469
I thought you weren't suiting up anymore.

511
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,430
Yeah, well, it's Felicity's boyfriend.

512
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,935
I figured, all hands.

513
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,017
Plus, John told me about Claybourne,
and four years ago.

514
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,150
Speedy, are you about to tell me,
after everything that's happened,

515
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,812
and everything that's happening,
this isn't my fault?

516
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,149
Do you remember when Tommy and I
went to the US Open?

517
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,818
And you tried to land that helicopter
on the grounds

518
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,238
'cause Tommy wanted to impress
Maria Sharapova and then

519
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,372
made Dad blow that huge acquisitions deal?

520
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,748
Because he had to bail me out, yeah.

521
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,832
Pretty sure that was the most disappointed
he's ever been in you.

522
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,667
I'm not seeing the relevance, Speedy.

523
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,709
My point is, Dad wouldn't be disappointed
in who you've become.

524
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,877
It's like you were saying
at that Christmas party,

525
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,921
Mom and Dad would be proud.

526
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,673
They might not be proud if they knew

527
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,475
that I created something like Prometheus.

528
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,854
There're two types of every legacy,

529
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,016
two versions of what we leave behind.

530
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,564
There's the good and then the bad.

531
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,689
You just really have a lousy habit
of focusing only on the bad.

532
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,997
Why are you not still in the hospital?

533
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,001
Rory called me,

534
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,287
told me what happened to Billy.

535
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,581
There's no way I'm sitting this out.

536
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,340
Wow, what did Paul have to say?

537
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,877
Actually, he made it pretty easy.

538
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,639
Give up the team or give up him.

539
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,762
Well, he clearly
doesn't know you very well.

540
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:01,967
What do you mean?

541
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,307
Well, you don't really respond well
to ultimatums.

542
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,392
He just doesn't get it.

543
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,566
I have to do this no matter what.

544
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,478
I have to be true to who I am.

545
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,494
- A singing telegram? Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

546
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,950
My friend loves them and I thought
that I would surprise her.

547
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,581
- Her?
- Just a friend.

548
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,993
But I don't know
where her office buildings are.

549
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,628
She works at the AK Desmond Group...

550
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,505
AK Desmond Group. Hmm.

551
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,087
They're not on the Internet,
like, at all, that's really weird.

552
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,753
- Super weird.
- All right, well, lucky for you,

553
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,091
there is the Internet

554
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,261
And then there is the "lnternet."

555
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,972
And these magic fingers can pull things
out of it, even Google can't find.

556
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,853
Not that I believe in magic.

557
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,479
Or, that I have magic fingers. I just,
I'm really good at, I'm... I can...

558
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,642
Felicity? Please.

559
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,437
Right. Uh...

560
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,617
Mmm-hmm. 1852

561
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,113
West Maple, 30th Floor.

562
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:05,993
- Great.
- What? There you go. Just...

563
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,909
It's... I meant to put it there,
just leave it there. It's...

564
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,123
Thank you.

565
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,958
You can just...

566
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,463
Felicity.

567
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,795
I do believe in magic.

568
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,805
- 1852.
- What?

569
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,517
1852. I just remembered something
I should've thought of a long time ago.

570
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,306
Thought of what?

571
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,521
- I think I know where Prometheus is.
- I'll call the team.

572
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,732
No, I created this situation,
I am going to deal with it alone.

573
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,839
Detective Malone.

574
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,498
Kill that Robin Hood son of a bitch!

575
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,272
You going to tell me again
I failed this city?

576
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,650
You infected the people
in Lamb Valley to turn a profit.

577
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,105
<i>You want to make this city great again?</i>

578
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,529
This is how.

579
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,114
With business, money.

580
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,116
You are sentencing

581
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,449
innocent families, children, to death.

582
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,614
Nobody cares about those people.

583
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,953
They're a blight.

584
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,745
And I'm just thinning the herd.

585
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,629
So am l.

586
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,264
Did you hesitate at all
when you killed him?

587
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,805
Or was he just another name
you crossed off your list?

588
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,066
If you want revenge,

589
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,768
I'm right here.

590
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,148
This is about so much more than revenge.

591
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,013
<i>I've studied you, Oliver Queen.</i>

592
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,842
<i>I know everything.</i>

593
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,138
<i>Who you love, who you trust,</i>

594
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,227
<i>who you've hurt.</i>

595
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:03,019
<i>Do you know how easy it was
to turn Evelyn against you?</i>

596
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,189
<i>How easy it will be to turn them all?</i>

597
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:11,447
<i>You're not a hero, you're a killer,</i>

598
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,363
<i>and I'm going to show them that.</i>

599
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,371
<i>I'm going to show them
how everything you touch dies.</i>

600
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:40,936
<i>Four years I've waited,
to make you answer for your sins.</i>

601
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,613
<i>I told you, Oliver,</i>

602
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,616
<i>everything you touch dies.</i>

603
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,597
What happened out there, man?

604
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,761
Did you kill Prometheus?

605
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,062
Billy. Did you find Billy?

606
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,319
Oliver?

607
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,948
Prometheus staged Billy.

608
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,702
He duct-taped his mouth,
and he put a weapon in his hand,

609
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,332
and he put him in his suit.

610
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,330
Prometheus knew...

611
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,961
- No, Oliver, don't.
- That I was there to kill him.

612
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,339
- Don't!
- And he'd calculated every moment.

613
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,420
Where is he?

614
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,131
Where is Billy?

615
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,383
L killed Billy.

616
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,178
I'm so sorry, Felicity.

617
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,847
I didn't know it was Billy,
I couldn't have known

618
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,313
that it was him. I could...
I couldn't have known.

619
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,237
Oh, my God.

620
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,659
This was Prometheus.

621
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,362
This was all him.

622
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,958
He's trying to prove to me
that everyone, I...

623
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,086
I come into contact with,
everyone close to me dies.

624
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,498
<i>And he's right, he...</i>

625
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,677
I think that, uh...

626
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,674
I think that all of you
should get as far away from me

627
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,093
as you possibly can.

628
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:56,692
Oliver, we are exactly
where we're supposed to be.

629
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,706
Okay.

630
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,797
I know I picked the worst

631
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,879
possible night to come home late again,

632
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,965
but you have to believe me,

633
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:20,507
this was a seriously terrible day.

634
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,728
Which is not going to get any better.

635
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,055
I'm going to my brother's house.

636
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,396
Come on, baby, it's been less than
24 hours since your ultimatum.

637
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,108
That's the thing, I never wanted to be
the guy that makes ultimatums.

638
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,318
You know what's funny?

639
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,780
You were coming home every night, late,

640
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,987
banged up all to hell,

641
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,744
and I've never seen you happier.

642
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,540
I don't want to be the one
to take you away from that.

643
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,087
You don't have to be.

644
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,500
But I also can't live knowing that

645
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,839
every time I see you might be the last.

646
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,130
I love you too much.

647
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,557
Paul, please.

648
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,016
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,970
Paul, please. Please.

650
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:23,953
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Johnny, I need you to come</i>

651
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,200
<i>to the safe house.</i>

652
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,364
<i>Something's wrong with J.J.</i>

653
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,578
Lyla?

654
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,626
Lyla?

655
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,377
Oliver.

656
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,380
What time is it?

657
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,762
I'm sorry. I didn't know
where else to go.

658
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,263
You want to talk about it?

659
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,972
Not really.

660
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,805
Come on. Come in.

661
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,059
<i>Can I get you a drink?</i>

662
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,647
I could use a drink.

663
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,492
<i>Why'?</i>

664
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:04,653
I thought things were getting better.

665
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,288
So did I, but, um...

666
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,500
That feeling never seems to last.

667
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,540
Thank you.

668
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,875
And, why do you think that is?

669
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,678
I was reunited with someone
from my past recently.

670
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,309
I knew their father.

671
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,351
And they told me

672
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,481
that I ruin the lives of everyone
that I come into contact with.

673
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,314
<i>Doesn't matter who they are.</i>

674
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,241
<i>Doesn't matter how much I love them.</i>

675
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,866
<i>If I'm in their life,</i>

676
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,127
<i>that life turns to ash.</i>

677
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,335
I think that's ridiculous.

678
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,177
Everyone's life touches everyone else's.

679
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,759
Sometimes the result is good,
and sometimes it's bad,

680
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,143
but you are only focusing on the bad.

681
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:13,480
My sister
said something very similar to that.

682
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,182
Well, she's a smart woman.

683
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:19,569
Look, no matter what's going on
in your life, Oliver,

684
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,946
<i>shutting people out
is the last thing you should do.</i>

685
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,943
Let me show you.

686
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,928
Hi, Ollie.
