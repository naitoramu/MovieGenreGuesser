00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,574
The name
of the island they found me on

3
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,276
is Lian Yu.

4
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:06,696
It's mandarin for "purgatory."

5
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:10,700
I've been stranded here for
5 years.

6
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:14,537
I've dreamt of my rescue every
cold black night since then.

7
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:19,375
For 5 years, I have had
only one thought, one goal...

8
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:21,294
survive...

9
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,798
Survive and one day return home.

10
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:31,020
The island held many dangers.

11
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:34,106
To live, I had to make myself
more than what I was,

12
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,776
to forge myself into a weapon.

13
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:39,779
I am returning not the boy who
was shipwrecked

14
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,781
but the man who will bring
justice to those

15
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:43,866
who have poisoned my city.

16
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,120
My name is Oliver Queen.

17
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,795
Oliver Queen is alive.

18
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:58,664
The Starling City resident
was found by fishermen

19
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,033
in the North China sea
5 days ago,

20
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,586
5 years after he was missing
and presumed dead

21
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,054
following the accident at sea

22
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,872
which claimed
"The Queen's Gambit."

23
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:08,374
Queen was a regular
tabloid presence

24
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,226
and a fixture at
the Starling City club scene.

25
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:11,727
Shortly before
his disappearance,

26
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,562
he was acquitted of assault
charges stemming

27
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:15,431
from a highly publicized
drunken altercation

28
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,983
with paparazzi.

29
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:20,269
Queen is the son of Starling
City billionaire Robert Queen,

30
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:23,105
who was also on board but
now officially confirmed

31
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:24,740
as deceased.

32
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:31,113
20% of his body
is covered

33
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:32,615
in scar tissue.

34
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,083
Second-degree burns

35
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,618
on his back
and arms.

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,119
X-rays show at least
12 fractures

37
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:39,405
that never
properly healed.

38
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:42,425
Has he said anything
about what happened?

39
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,927
No. He's barely
said anything.

40
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:49,015
Moira, I'd like
you to prepare yourself.

41
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,651
The Oliver you lost
might not be

42
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,302
the one they found.

43
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,333
Oliver.

44
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,626
Mom.

45
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,620
Oh...

46
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:31,474
My beautiful boy.

47
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,412
I've got it.

48
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:56,815
Your room is exactly
as you left it.

49
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,784
I never had the heart
to change a thing.

50
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:00,152
Oliver.

51
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,922
It's damn good
to see you.

52
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,259
It's Walter...

53
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,544
Walter Steele.

54
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:10,596
You remember Walter,
your father's friend

55
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,381
from the company.

56
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:19,105
It's good to see
you, Raisa.

57
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,891
Welcome home, Mr. Oliver.

58
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,527
Mr. Merlyn phoned. He wants
to join you for dinner.

59
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,694
Wonderful.

60
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:29,448
Oliver?

61
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,117
Did you hear that?

62
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:35,905
Hey, sis.

63
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:43,045
I knew it.
I knew you were alive.

64
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,999
I missed you so much.

65
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:50,386
You were with me
the whole time.

66
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,925
Come on, Laurel. We're
lawyers, not miracle workers.

67
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:57,376
We can't win this.

68
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,811
If we can't win
a class-action suit

69
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:00,229
against a man who
swindled

70
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,647
hundreds of people out
of their homes

71
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:02,848
and life savings,

72
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,216
then we're not fit
to call ourselves

73
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:05,384
a legal aid office.

74
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:06,852
And if we
go bankrupt

75
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:07,987
in the process,

76
00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:09,321
we won't be
a legal aid office.

77
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,739
Hunt has an army of
lawyers, and they're

78
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,074
ready to bury us.

79
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,393
You and I against an army.
I love those odds.

80
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:16,412
Why do you
hate me?

81
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,420
And in other news,

82
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:26,021
details
as to the castaway story

83
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:27,739
you've all heard about...

84
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,074
the son of a very
wealthy billionaire

85
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:32,344
will soon become
a legendary story.

86
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,579
Jessica now
has more details

87
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,047
and the complete
castaway story.

88
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:36,048
"The Queen's Gambit" was

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,100
last heard from more
than 5 years ago.

90
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,636
Mr. Queen
has reportedly confirmed

91
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:43,105
he was the only survivor
of the accident

92
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,391
that took the lives of
7 people, including

93
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,726
local resident Sarah Lance.

94
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,362
Survived by her sister,
Laurel...

95
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,205
After 5 years,

96
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,442
everything that was once
familiar is now unrecognizable.

97
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,334
The face I see in the mirror

98
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,620
is a stranger.

99
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,242
The storm's
a category 2.

100
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:37,660
The captain's
recommending

101
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,995
we head back.

102
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,330
All right.
Inform the crew.

103
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,531
Are we in trouble?

104
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,749
One of us is.

105
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,367
Ollie?

106
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,986
Where do you keep
the bottle opener

107
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,171
on this thing?

108
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,457
I'll be there in
a minute, Sarah.

109
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:56,762
You know, son,

110
00:06:56,764 --> 00:07:00,466
that is not
going to finish well

111
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:03,519
for either of them
or for you.

112
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,074
What did I tell you?

113
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:10,559
Yachts suck.

114
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:14,813
Tommy Merlyn.

115
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,116
I missed you, buddy.

116
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,400
Ok. What else did
you miss?

117
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:21,570
Super bowl winners... Giants,
Steelers, Saints, Packers,

118
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,706
Giants again.

119
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,241
A black president,
that's new.

120
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,876
Oh, and "Lost," they
were all dead...

121
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,129
I think.

122
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:31,497
What was it like there?

123
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,185
Cold.

124
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,537
Tomorrow, you and me,
we're doing the city.

125
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,055
You've got a lot
to catch up on.

126
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,924
That sounds like
a great idea.

127
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,059
Good. Then I was hoping
to swing by the office.

128
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,679
Well, there's
plenty of time for all that.

129
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:49,815
Queen Consolidated isn't
going anywhere.

130
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,067
Oh, I am
so sorry, Mr. Oliver.

131
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,121
Dude, you speak Russian?

132
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,190
I didn't realize you took
Russian at college, Oliver.

133
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,575
I didn't realize

134
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,694
you wanted to sleep with my
mother, Walter.

135
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,870
I didn't say anything.

136
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,222
She didn't have to.

137
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,043
Oliver...

138
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,612
Walter and I are
married,

139
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:22,381
and I don't want you
to think

140
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:24,082
that either one of
us did anything

141
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,601
to disrespect
your father.

142
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,753
We both believed that
Robert, like you, was,

143
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,738
uh, well, gone.

144
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,774
It's fine.

145
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:40,532
May I be excused?

146
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,956
Hey, don't forget
about tomorrow, buddy.

147
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,968
1, 2, 3.

148
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,337
It's getting closer.

149
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,089
That's not
very scientific.

150
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,924
What would you know
about science,

151
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:08,010
Mr. Ivy league
dropout?

152
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:09,345
I happen to know a lot
about science.

153
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,063
I know about
fermentation.

154
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,982
I know biology.

155
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:18,320
Laurel's gonna kill me.

156
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:19,688
Oh, she's so gonna kill me.

157
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,075
Your sister
will never know.

158
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,193
Come here.

159
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,911
Ha ha!

160
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,780
Ok, that one was
really close.

161
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:30,749
Sarah, we're
gonna be fine.

162
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:42,544
Sarah?

163
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:45,347
Sarah!

164
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,770
Sarah!
Oliver!

165
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,939
Sarah! Sarah!

166
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:55,841
Gus?

167
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,529
No! No!

168
00:10:00,531 --> 00:10:02,114
No! Dad, she's out there!

169
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,482
She's not there.

170
00:10:03,484 --> 00:10:05,033
Sarah!

171
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,787
She's gone.

172
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:11,623
Oliver, wake up. Oliver?

173
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,409
Oliver!

174
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,166
I'm sorry. I'm so...
I'm so sorry.

175
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,552
Oh, it's ok, Oliver.

176
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:27,055
It's all right,
sweetheart.

177
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:29,141
You're home.

178
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:31,042
You're home.

179
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,463
Where did you
get these?

180
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:06,049
Roxies. Thank you,
daddy's ACL tear.

181
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,254
Ollie.

182
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,389
No one's called me
that in a while, Speedy.

183
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,591
Worst nickname ever.

184
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:17,426
What, always chasing
after me as a kid?

185
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,811
I thought it fit
pretty well.

186
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,580
Maybe it still does.

187
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:23,649
See you at school, Speedy.

188
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:25,935
Sorry about her.

189
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,320
I have something
for you.

190
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:29,322
You did not come back
from a deserted island

191
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:30,623
with a souvenir.

192
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,274
It's a Hozen.
And in buddhism,

193
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,960
it symbolizes
reconnecting.

194
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:36,412
I kept it in hopes
that one day,

195
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,281
it would reconnect
me with you.

196
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,953
A rock!
That is sweet.

197
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,621
You know, I want
one of those

198
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,390
t-shirts that says
"my friend was

199
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,892
a castaway, and all I got
was this crappy shirt."

200
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,314
Don't let him get you
into too much trouble.

201
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,266
You just got back.
Take it slow.

202
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,738
Ahem.
The city awaits.

203
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:07,643
Have you noticed how hot
your sister's gotten?

204
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,529
Because I have not.

205
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,781
♪ it's been
a long night... ♪

206
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:12,832
Your funeral blew.

207
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,333
Did you get lucky?

208
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:15,535
Fish in a barrel.

209
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:18,487
They were so sad...

210
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,705
No.
And huggy.

211
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:20,873
And I am counting

212
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,091
on another target
rich environment

213
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:23,509
for your welcome
home bash.

214
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:24,677
At my what?

215
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,429
You came back from
the dead.

216
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:28,097
This calls for
a party.

217
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:29,599
You tell me
where and when.

218
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,601
I'll take care
of everything.

219
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,856
And this city's
gone to crap.

220
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,141
Your dad sold
his factory

221
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,442
just in time.

222
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:41,227
And why'd you want
to drive through

223
00:12:41,229 --> 00:12:43,613
this neighborhood
anyway?

224
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:44,764
No reason.

225
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:45,948
So what'd you miss
the most,

226
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,066
steaks at the palm,

227
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,317
drinks at
the station,

228
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,469
meaningless sex?

229
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,621
Laurel.

230
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:54,624
Everyone is happy
you're alive.

231
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:57,160
You want to see the
one person who isn't?

232
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,963
Laurel, I just got this
from Hunt's lawyers.

233
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,381
They filed
a change of venue.

234
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:04,083
We are now in front
of Judge Grell.

235
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,585
Hunt funded Grell's
reelection campaign.

236
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,752
Mm-hmm.

237
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,204
He's got Grell in
his back pocket.

238
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,672
You know, it's fun
being your friend.

239
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,390
I get to say "I told
you so" a lot.

240
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,226
No. Adam Hunt is
not smarter than we are.

241
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,677
No, he's just richer
and willing to commit

242
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,895
multiple felonies.

243
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,396
We don't need to go
outside the law...

244
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,398
"to find justice."

245
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,134
Your dad's favorite
jingle.

246
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,936
Hello, Laurel.

247
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:32,612
You went to law school.
You said you would.

248
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:35,615
Yeah. Everyone's proud.

249
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,035
Adam Hunt's
a heavy hitter.

250
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:40,753
You sure you want to get
in the ring with him?

251
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:45,124
Five years and you want
to talk about Adam Hunt?

252
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:48,628
No. Not really.

253
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,631
Why are you here, Ollie?

254
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,049
To apologize.

255
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,051
It was my fault.

256
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:58,638
I wanted to ask you
not to blame her.

257
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,089
For what?

258
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,641
Falling under your spell.

259
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:04,426
How could I possibly blame
her for doing the same things

260
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,645
that I did?

261
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:06,979
I never meant to...

262
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,431
she was my sister.

263
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,284
I couldn't be angry

264
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,402
because she was dead.

265
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,071
I couldn't grieve because
I was so angry.

266
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,656
That's what happens when
your sister dies

267
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,291
while screwing
your boyfriend.

268
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,279
We buried an empty coffin...

269
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,616
Because her body was at
the bottom of the ocean

270
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,969
where you left her.

271
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,940
It should have been you.

272
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,626
I know that it's too
late to say this,

273
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,228
but I'm sorry.

274
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:43,099
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

275
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:45,735
I'd hoped that you'd rot
in hell a whole lot longer

276
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:47,469
than 5 years.

277
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,608
How did you think that
was gonna go, Tommy?

278
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,644
About like that.

279
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,698
Ok, so we took care
of that. Good call.

280
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,199
Now we can make up
for lost time.

281
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,701
If you're not
too sick of fish,

282
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,202
I suggest we find
some leggy models

283
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,154
and eat Sushi all
day. What do you say?

284
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,673
What're they doing?
What the hell?

285
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,928
Hey!

286
00:15:22,557 --> 00:15:24,690
Here, son. Drink.

287
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,945
What the hell
are you doing?!

288
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,147
That's all
we've got.

289
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:32,481
If anybody's making it
out of here,

290
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,899
it's gonna be him.

291
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,038
I'm so sorry. I thought
I'd have more time.

292
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I'm not the man you
think I am.

293
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,827
I didn't build
our city.

294
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,028
I failed it.

295
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,797
And I wasn't
the only one.

296
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,799
Mr. Queen.

297
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,634
Mr. Queen!

298
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,087
Did your father
survive that accident?

299
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:01,377
I ask the questions.
You give me the answers.

300
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,407
Did he make it
to the island?

301
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,742
Did he tell you anything?

302
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,242
Yes, he did.

303
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:36,545
What did he tell you,
Mr. Queen?

304
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,127
He told me
I'm gonna kill you.

305
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,451
You're delusional.

306
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,153
You're zip-cuffed
to that chair.

307
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:04,790
Not anymore.

308
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,014
You killed that man.

309
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,466
You don't have
to do this.

310
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:06,435
Yes, I do.

311
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,103
Nobody can know my secret.

312
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,421
So that's your story.
A guy in a green hood

313
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:21,306
flew in and single-handedly
took out 3 armed kidnappers.

314
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,458
I mean, who is he?

315
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,643
Why would he do that?

316
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:29,246
I don't know. Find
him and you can ask.

317
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:34,051
Yeah. What about you?

318
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,495
You see the hood guy?

319
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:37,456
I saw...

320
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,407
Just movement.

321
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,644
Everything blurry.
I was kind of out of it.

322
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:43,979
Yeah.

323
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,615
It's funny, isn't it?
One day back,

324
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,984
and already somebody's
gunning for you.

325
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,736
Aren't you popular?

326
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:54,523
Were you able
to identify the men?

327
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,842
Scrubbed identities,
untraceable weapons.

328
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,343
These were pros.

329
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,328
Yeah. Well, they
probably figured you'd

330
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,779
pay a king's ransom
to get your boy back

331
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:03,231
or a Queen's ransom,

332
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,133
as it were.

333
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,603
After all, a parent
would do anything

334
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,138
to keep
their child safe.

335
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,809
I don't find your
tone appropriate, Detective.

336
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,528
If Oliver can think
of anything else,

337
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,896
he'll be in touch.

338
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,348
Thank you,
gentlemen,

339
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,566
for coming.

340
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:31,476
Your luck never seems
to run out, does it?

341
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,471
You are different.

342
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,673
Not like you to read
a book.

343
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:06,177
I missed you, Raisa.

344
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,246
No kitchen on
the island.

345
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,832
No. No friends either.

346
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,785
Hey.

347
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:16,821
Thank you.

348
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,426
Do I really seem different?

349
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,162
No. You're still
a good boy.

350
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,131
Oh, I think we both
know I wasn't.

351
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,582
But a good heart.

352
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:28,967
I hope so.

353
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,753
I want to be the person you
always told me I could be.

354
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:39,678
Oliver, I want to
introduce you to someone...

355
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,896
John Diggle.

356
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:42,831
He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

357
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,065
I don't need a babysitter.

358
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:46,318
Darling, Oliver's
a grown man.

359
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,369
And if he
doesn't feel he needs

360
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,553
armed protection...

361
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:50,221
Yeah, I understand,
but this is

362
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,073
something I need.

363
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:57,913
So...

364
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:01,416
What do I call you?

365
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,704
Diggle's good.

366
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:07,122
Dig if you want.

367
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:08,456
You're ex-military?

368
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,741
Yes, sir.
105th airborne

369
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:11,676
of of Kandahar,
retired.

370
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:12,794
Been in
the private sector

371
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:15,297
a little more than
4 years now.

372
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,265
I don't want there to be
any confusion, Mr. Queen.

373
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,800
My ability to keep
you from harm

374
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:20,435
will outweigh
your comfort.

375
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:23,688
Do we have
an agreement?

376
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:27,192
Sir?

377
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:30,862
Sir!

378
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,771
The abduction was unexpected.

379
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,273
It forced me
to move up my plans,

380
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,359
but what I told
the police was true.

381
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:20,745
The man in the green hood
was there in that warehouse,

382
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,647
and he's just beginning.

383
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,071
The suit alleges
that Hunt committed

384
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:54,923
multiple acts of fraud
and theft

385
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,257
against the city's
underprivileged.

386
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,510
Laurel Lance, an attorney
for the city necessary...

387
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:00,011
Adam Hunt...

388
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:02,297
his crimes go deeper
than fraud and theft,

389
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,350
but he's been able to
bully, bribe, or kill anyone

390
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:07,418
who's gotten into his way.

391
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,694
He hasn't met me yet.

392
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:24,652
You remind Grell I put
him on the bench,

393
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:25,954
I can take him off.

394
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:28,105
I will turn him into
a cautionary tale.

395
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,207
Yes, Mr. Hunt.

396
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,708
And this attorney
Laurel Lance...

397
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,610
you said she wasn't gonna
be a problem anymore.

398
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:36,614
I told you to fix
that situation.

399
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,466
Why are you
still here?

400
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:45,122
Unh!

401
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:46,341
Get in the car!

402
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,631
Hey. You missed.

403
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:54,682
Unh!

404
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,571
Aah!

405
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:05,827
Unh! Aah!

406
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,829
What? What?

407
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:10,048
Just... just tell me
what you want.

408
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,335
You're gonna transfer
$40 million

409
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:17,038
into Starling city
bank account 1141

410
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
by 10 P.M. tomorrow night.
Or what?

411
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:21,876
Or I'm gonna take it,
and you won't like how.

412
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:27,682
If I see you again,
you're dead!

413
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,396
He was wearing a hood,

414
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:42,598
a green hood,

415
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,651
and he had
a bow and arrow.

416
00:25:45,653 --> 00:25:47,269
What, you don't
believe me?

417
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:51,273
That maniac put two
of my men in the hospital.

418
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,608
Well, thanks
for your statement.

419
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,329
We'll put out an APB
on... Robin hood.

420
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,314
Hey, pal.

421
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:02,751
I'm not some grocer who got
taken for his register.

422
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:05,120
I go to the front
of the line.

423
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:07,206
Now he said he would be
back here by 10 P.M.

424
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,124
Make sure
you're here first.

425
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:12,661
You can coordinate with Mr. Drakon,
my new head of security.

426
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,837
All right. Well, uh,
thanks for your time.

427
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:30,396
It looks like Queen
was telling the truth.

428
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:32,848
Yeah. Well, there's a first
time for everything.

429
00:26:34,617 --> 00:26:38,687
This hooded guy comes looking
for trouble, he'll find it.

430
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:52,101
Put on your
seat belt, sir.

431
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:53,936
Wouldn't want you
to miss your party.

Ollie, Ollie,
Ollie, Ollie.

448
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:54,112
I missed Tequila!

449
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,240
What the hell's
going on out there?

450
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:07,108
It's across
the street.

451
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,294
Party for the guy that got
rescued off that island...

452
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,963
Oliver Queen.

453
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,622
Hey. Does he wipe
for you, too?

454
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:25,961
Now by my rough estimate, you
have not had sex in 1,839 days.

455
00:28:25,963 --> 00:28:27,763
As your wingman,
I highly recommend

456
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:29,297
Carmen Golden.

457
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:30,516
Which one is she?

458
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,351
The one who looks like the
chick from "Twilight."

459
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:33,852
What's "Twilight"?

460
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:35,687
You're so better off
not knowing.

461
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:46,915
Back in a minute.

462
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:52,671
Ollie, hey!
This party is sick.

463
00:28:52,673 --> 00:28:53,922
Who let you
in here?

464
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,290
I believe it was
somebody who said,

465
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,125
"right this way,
Miss Queen."

466
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,344
Well, you shouldn't
be here.

467
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,379
I'm not 12 anymore.

468
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,330
No. You're 17.

469
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:04,266
Ollie, I love you,

470
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:06,602
but you can't come back
here and judge me,

471
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:08,136
especially for being
just like you.

472
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,856
I know that it couldn't have been
easy for you when I was away...

473
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:14,843
away? No. You died.

474
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,563
My brother
and my father died.

475
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,314
I went
to your funerals.

476
00:29:19,316 --> 00:29:20,616
I know.
No, you don't.

477
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:24,369
Mom had Walter,
and I had no one.

478
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,238
You guys all act
like it's cool,

479
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,657
let's forget about
the last 5 years.

480
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,459
Well, I can't.

481
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:32,160
For me, it's kind of
permanently in there,

482
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:33,629
so I'm sorry
if I turned out

483
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,530
some major
disappointment,

484
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:38,366
but this me is
the best I could do

485
00:29:38,368 --> 00:29:42,387
with what I had
to work with.

486
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,256
Let's bounce.

487
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:47,208
You have
the fun dip?

488
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,394
Yeah. It's right...

489
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:52,064
no. I... I must have
dropped it.

490
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,724
Oh! Oh.

491
00:30:02,726 --> 00:30:04,276
You're here.

492
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:07,112
Tommy. He made the
point that we have

493
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,530
too many years
between us

494
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:12,000
to leave things the
way we left them.

495
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:15,037
Is there someplace quieter
that we could go?

496
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,288
Yeah.

497
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,761
I'm sorry about saying that you
should have been the one who died.

498
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:26,932
That was wrong.

499
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:29,051
If I could trade places
with her, I would.

500
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,222
About Sarah.

501
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,660
There's something that
I've been afraid to ask,

502
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:41,229
but I need to know.

503
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,597
Ok.

504
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,202
When she died...

505
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,323
Did she suffer?

506
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,991
Sarah!
Aah!

507
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:55,961
No.

508
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:58,446
I think about her
every day.

509
00:30:58,448 --> 00:31:01,667
Me, too.

510
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:04,136
I guess we still have
one thing in common then.

511
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:11,510
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

512
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:13,578
If you need someone
to talk to

513
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,131
about what happened
to you, I'm here.

514
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:26,742
Something wrong?

515
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:29,861
I asked somebody
to do something.

516
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:31,346
They didn't do it.

517
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:36,668
Laurel...

518
00:31:43,626 --> 00:31:46,344
You always saw
the best in me.

519
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,880
Right now, that's
what you're doing,

520
00:31:48,882 --> 00:31:51,299
looking at me,
and you're wondering

521
00:31:51,301 --> 00:31:53,101
if that island
changed me somehow,

522
00:31:53,103 --> 00:31:55,336
if it made me
a better person.

523
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,622
It didn't.

524
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,274
Stay away from me.

525
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:01,509
Otherwise...

526
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:05,680
I'm just gonna
hurt you again,

527
00:32:05,682 --> 00:32:09,401
but this time,
it will be worse.

528
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:11,403
Got to roll.

529
00:32:11,405 --> 00:32:16,241
I got 5 years of
debauchery to catch up on

530
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,692
you know what, Oliver?

531
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,548
You're wrong. That
island did change you.

532
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,667
At least now
you're honest.

533
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:40,849
Something I can
help you with, sir?

534
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:46,238
I just wanted a second
to myself.

535
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,522
I would believe you,
Mr. Queen,

536
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:50,826
if you weren't
so full of crap.

537
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,494
Party's this way.

538
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:58,917
It's locked.

539
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,791
You two cover
the elevator.

540
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:07,092
Hang back and be ready.

541
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,410
Stay in the corners
and stay alert.

542
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:18,753
It's past 10:00.

543
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,421
He's never getting
in here.

544
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,652
All's clear.

545
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:34,820
Yeah.

546
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,607
Unh!

547
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:17,913
You missed.

548
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:19,197
Really?

549
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,448
Hunh!

550
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:27,539
He's here!

551
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,959
All units, converge!
All units, converge!

552
00:34:58,621 --> 00:34:59,854
Aigh!

553
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:20,239
Go right, go right.

554
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,373
On me.

555
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:33,836
Lay down your weapons,
or we will open fire!

556
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,288
I repeat, lay down
your weapons.

557
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:51,603
Tell me
you saw that.

558
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:53,522
Ok. Let's go. Move.

559
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:56,775
♪ Girls, girls, girls ♪

560
00:35:56,777 --> 00:35:58,077
♪ Hot babes ♪

561
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,027
Cut it.

562
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:00,612
Search the building
roof to basement.

563
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:02,030
Find him!

564
00:36:02,032 --> 00:36:03,082
Starling City police!

565
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,333
The party's over, kids.

566
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:09,505
Oh, Mr. Merlyn. Imagine my
shock at finding you here.

567
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,924
Did you roofie anyone
special tonight, huh?

568
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:15,294
Detective!
It's a private party.

569
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,995
Yeah? Well, there was an incident
at Adam Hunt's building tonight.

570
00:36:16,997 --> 00:36:18,514
You know anything
about that?

571
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,132
Who's Adam Hunt?

572
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:22,667
He's a millionaire bottom feeder, and I'm
kind of surprised you aren't friends.

573
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:25,437
I've been out of town
for... A while.

574
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,724
Yeah. Well, he just got attacked
by the guy with the hood,

575
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:30,809
the guy that saved
your ass the other day.

576
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,060
The hood guy.

577
00:36:32,062 --> 00:36:33,178
You didn't find him?

578
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,396
I'm gonna offer
a reward.

579
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:37,032
Hey, everybody.
$2 million to anybody

580
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:39,351
that can find a nut bar
in a green hood.

581
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:47,876
Did you even try
to save her?

582
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,294
Ok. Let's go, partner.

583
00:36:49,296 --> 00:36:51,029
Did you even try
to save my daughter?

584
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,331
Sarah wouldn't want this.

585
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,534
It's not.
Partner, let's go.

586
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:57,085
It's all right.
Let's go.

587
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:05,710
It's way too quiet
in here!

588
00:37:05,712 --> 00:37:07,429
This is a party!

589
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:16,104
Some coincidence, I mean, you
asking to have your party here,

590
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:17,856
and Hunt getting robbed
right next door

591
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:21,493
and by the same guy who
rescued us at the warehouse.

592
00:37:21,495 --> 00:37:23,162
If I were you,
Tommy,

593
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:25,581
I'd just be glad
you're alive.

594
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:28,700
What happened to you
on that island?

595
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:30,118
A lot.

596
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,627
What the hell
are you talking about?

597
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:43,348
$40 million doesn't
just up and vanish!

598
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,633
Untraceable?!

599
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:48,420
It is $40 million!
Find it!

600
00:37:50,974 --> 00:37:52,357
How did he do it?

601
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:32,097
There's not enough
for all of us.

602
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:33,599
Save your strength.

603
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:37,519
You can survive
this, make it home,

604
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:41,473
make it better,
right my wrongs,

605
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,358
but you got to live
through this first.

606
00:38:45,111 --> 00:38:47,195
You hear me, Ollie?
You hear me, son?

607
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,834
Just rest, dad.

608
00:39:02,161 --> 00:39:03,512
No.

609
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,644
Dad?!

610
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:20,445
Survive.

611
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:21,446
No!

612
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,576
If hypothetically
$50,000 magically appeared

613
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:37,129
in your bank account,
it might be best

614
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:39,298
for you not to
speak about it...

615
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,969
To anyone... Ever.

616
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:46,805
God bless you, too.

617
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,440
I just got a very
grateful phone call

618
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:51,009
from one of our clients
against Adam Hunt.

619
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,511
Me, too. Heh.

620
00:39:56,567 --> 00:40:02,187
It looks like Starling
City has a guardian angel.

621
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,606
By the way, your
cute friend's here.

622
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:12,030
You left the party
pretty quick last night,

623
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,033
even after I made sure the bar
was stocked with Pinot Noir.

624
00:40:15,035 --> 00:40:16,918
It wasn't really
my scene.

625
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,339
I thought maybe you and Oliver
went mano-a-mano again.

626
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:21,840
I saw you two
head out.

627
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:25,293
There's nothing between
Oliver and I, not anymore.

628
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:28,747
Here I thought the only thing
between you and Oliver was us.

629
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:32,934
I wouldn't exactly characterize
us as an "us," Tommy.

630
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,252
Then what would
you call it?

631
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:35,387
A lapse.

632
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,555
That's quite
a few lapses...

633
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:38,240
your place,
my place,

634
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:41,643
my place again.

635
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,928
Oh, come on, Merlyn. We
both know that you're not

636
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,031
a one-girl type of guy.

637
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,950
Depends on the girl.

638
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:50,819
I have to go
back to work.

639
00:40:52,238 --> 00:40:57,609
Dinah Laurel Lance always
trying to save the world.

640
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:02,047
Hey. If I don't try
and save it, who will?

641
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:07,002
♪ Let's get out of here ♪

642
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:10,639
♪ won't you come along? ♪

643
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,962
She says the island changed me.

644
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:24,403
She has no idea how much.

645
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:27,072
There are many more names
on the list,

646
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:32,661
those who rule my city
through intimidation and fear.

647
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:36,698
Every last one of them will
wish I had died on that island.

648
00:41:46,342 --> 00:41:50,045
The police failed to identify the
men I hired to kidnap Oliver,

649
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:52,097
and they never will.

650
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:54,516
Should we arrange
another abduction?

651
