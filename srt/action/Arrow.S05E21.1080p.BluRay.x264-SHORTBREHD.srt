1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,716
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,179
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,934
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,266
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,897
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,895
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,942
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,650
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,780
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,281
That's why you won't tell me
who Prometheus is.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,996
<i>He calls himself Adrian Chase.</i>

12
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,031
- Who's Simon Morrison?
<i>- Adrian</i> Chase.

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,292
Simon Morrison is his birth name.
That's his real identity.

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,294
Daddy's decided you're gonna
come home with me. I promise.

15
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,418
I spoke to Curtis's lawyer friend.

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,587
- I put things in motion.
- Good for you.

17
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,260
I am getting deeper and deeper
into the mud.

18
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,795
That doesn't mean that you have to quit.

19
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,011
I am broken, okay?
I need you to let me go.

20
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,884
Your resignation's accepted.

21
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,143
I don't wanna do this anymore.
I'm shutting everything down.

22
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,319
- Hey.
- Good morning.

23
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,355
Actually, it's a lousy one.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,566
Tell me.

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,780
Last night,
Judge Balderrama granted retrials

26
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,162
on all the cases that Chase prosecuted.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,947
Well, that's bad, but I mean, he didn't...

28
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,788
What, release them on bail?
Yep, that happened, too.

29
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,748
- Son of a bitch.
- That's what I said.

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,005
And now we've got 36 violent felons
walking around on the streets.

31
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,086
Well, put the most dangerous ones
under surveillance.

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,629
Yeah, it's already done. Listen, Oliver,
where are we on finding Chase?

33
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,965
Right where he is. We're nowhere.

34
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,174
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,

35
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,718
but I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the building.

36
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,885
What? Why?

37
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,429
A suspicious package
was received by your office.

38
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,643
- When?
- Just now.

39
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,228
A large crate that set off the dogs.
Bomb squad's on the way.

40
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,064
Well, any indication
where it was delivered from?

41
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,604
No return address.
But the sender is a Simon Morrison.

42
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,064
Sir, I can't allow you to...

43
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,278
Then resign.

44
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,694
Look, I enjoy getting blown up
just as much as the next guy,

45
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,908
but am I missing something here?

46
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,289
It's Chase.
Simon Morrison's his real name.

47
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,833
Fine, but that's no reason
to get yourself, all of us, blown up.

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,993
- Step away.
- Sir, we can't...

49
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,418
I've got this. Step away.

50
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,797
Don't worry.
He was a bomb diffuser in a past life.

51
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,502
<i>We don't believe
it's an incendiary device.</i>

52
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,043
Snake-cam showed the presence
of concrete and building materials.

53
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,210
That could have set off the dogs.

54
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,424
Concrete?

55
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,555
Sir, protocol still requires
we wait for the bomb squad.

56
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,428
Mr. Mayor?

57
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,898
What the hell?

58
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,240
Who is he?

59
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,581
According to dental records,
Henry Goodwin.

60
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,503
- Ring any bells?
- No, not a note.

61
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,630
He was a Councilman in the Glades
back in'02.

62
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,587
Chase wouldn't have been old enough
to drink back then.

63
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,714
Right. And, so far,
there are no connections

64
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,378
between Goodwin and Chase
that we can find.

65
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,510
I mean, Goodwin was reported missing
in 2002, he was declared dead in '03.

66
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,518
Question is, why would Chase
send Oliver a 15-year-old body

67
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,595
that neither of them are connected to?

68
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,478
No idea. Then again, Chase is crazy.

69
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,855
Okay, pull all the forensics
that you can find.

70
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,446
Try and find a connection
between either Chase, or his father.

71
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,777
- Name's Justin Claybourne.
- Claybourne.

72
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,194
And if there is no connection?

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,078
There has to be a connection.

74
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,248
Chase does everything for a reason.
We need to know what it is.

75
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,624
It's gonna be a tall order, Oliver.

76
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,002
We're already spread thin
keeping an eye on the guys

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,628
that Chase was prosecuting who got kicked.

78
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,506
I have asked Quentin to task the SCPD
with monitoring the dangerous ones.

79
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,965
Which leaves us with the extremely
dangerous ones, I'm guessing.

80
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,385
Ooh, zombie "I can't feel pain"
Derek Sampson has my vote.

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,342
What's he been up to
since getting out of prison?

82
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,260
Partying like a guy
who just got out of prison.

83
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:42,022
Let's stay on him and whoever else
we think are the most dangerous.

84
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,600
What about your office's
newest art installation,

85
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,518
- the concrete councilman?
- Dinah's working the evidence.

86
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,229
She gets a lead, we make a move.

87
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,277
<i>He'!-</i>

88
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,159
How is it going with...

89
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,906
- William?
- Yep.

90
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,326
I'm actually having trouble finding him.

91
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,961
Samantha did a really good job
at hiding herself and William.

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,839
Well, if Felicity Smoak can't find him,

93
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,922
I feel better about Chase
not being able to, so, thank you.

94
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,015
Maybe drinking before flying
not such good idea.

95
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,567
Or not drink enough. I don't know.

96
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,695
Weather's getting worse.
Means we're close.

97
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,447
I pretend that is good thing.

98
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,450
All this time, you never mentioning
you know how to fly. Where you learn?

99
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,365
Yeah, my dad loved vintage planes.

100
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,997
He would take me up all the time.
One of my last happy memories.

101
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,825
I'm guessing this not one of them.

102
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,785
<i>I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.</i>

103
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,874
<i>I didn't save our city. I failed it.</i>

104
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,838
<i>I did a terrible thing.</i>

105
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,377
<i>You can right my wrongs.</i>

106
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,378
<i>You can save this city.</i>

107
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,841
Why you want me watching this?

108
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,265
So you can understand
why I have to go back.

109
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,390
To Starling City,
or to this horrible place?

110
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,228
Ooh. That frown mean you struck out?

111
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,021
Mmm. Not exactly.

112
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,031
Concrete's a proprietary formula.

113
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,443
It's owned by
a specific construction company.

114
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,286
Killer's DNA
is underneath Goodwin's fingernails.

115
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,289
All right, so what's with the loser look?
You can't ID a suspect off all that?

116
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,078
The "loser look" is because
I did ID a suspect off all that.

117
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,549
Now, the bond offering
should pay for all the overtime

118
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,429
I'm asking the SCPD for

119
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,842
in order to keep track
of Chase's violent felons.

120
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,269
Clear the room for a second, please.

121
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,404
I missed you.

122
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,027
Yeah, well, once I heard
that Chase was Prometheus,

123
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,787
- I knew you'd drag me back to town.
- For your protection.

124
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:07,452
And say that. Ollie, I think you know
I can take care of myself.

125
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,336
It has nothing to do
with what you're capable of, Thea.

126
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,336
It has to do with
what Adrian Chase is capable of.

127
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,342
You mean an Oscar-worthy performance
of a decent human being?

128
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,669
As betrayals go,

129
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,510
it makes Isabel Rochev
look like a bad practical joke.

130
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,265
I'm sure. But I...

131
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:27,062
I know Chase is dangerous
and I know you're worried,

132
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,394
but I just...
I wasn't ready to come back yet.

133
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,026
Were you with Roy or...

134
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,695
Like I'd let him see me
in the state I'm in.

135
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,029
What state are you in?

136
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,699
Phrase "hot mess" comes to mind.

137
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,200
I don't know.
I'm figuring it out.

138
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm glad. It's good to see you.

139
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,826
Oliver, I...

140
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,375
Thea. What are you doing here?

141
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,335
It's nice to see you, too.

142
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,498
No, sorry, I just...

143
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,009
It's great to see you, it's just...

144
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,878
Well, it's just bad timing is all.

145
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,220
Maybe we should do this in private.

146
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,471
This regarding Councilman Goodwin?

147
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,891
You know, yeah, I think maybe
we should come back later.

148
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,223
- What is going on?
- Chase sent a 15-year-old corpse

149
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,309
to my office this morning
as some kind of message.

150
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,440
Do we have a suspect?

151
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,851
Yeah, you could say that.

152
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,856
Okay.

153
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,356
Who is it?

154
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,404
It's your father.

155
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,452
This is Chase, obviously.
He's framing our father.

156
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,999
Yeah, but to what end?

157
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,039
The concrete came
from Wellward Construction,

158
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,584
which was a subsidiary
of Queen Consolidated.

159
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,673
And the skin
under the victim's fingernails

160
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,382
matches Mr. Queen's DNA.

161
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,389
And the problem is, all those forensics

162
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,174
passed through a whole lot of labs.

163
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,681
You can't keep this
from going public, can you?

164
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,687
Not for lack of trying, believe me.
I'm sorry, Oliver.

165
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,182
Dinah, I need you to get
DNA and concrete samples

166
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,350
to Felicity and Curtis.

167
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,232
Our father is being framed,
and we need to start to prove it.

168
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,397
Sure, a couple pieces of evidence
can go missing.

169
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,564
And what are you gonna be doing?

170
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,233
Holding a press conference.

171
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,069
I just weathered a scandal.
I need to get out in front of this one.

172
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,627
Okay, I think you should reconsider
doing this whole press conference.

173
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,416
- Why?
- Because this could be

174
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,501
what Chase is manipulating you into.

175
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,383
Just like he manipulated you
into the impeachment

176
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,294
by throwing Green Arrow under the bus.

177
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,087
But like with the impeachment,
I need to tell...

178
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,551
Lie to the press?

179
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,760
Because that's what you're gonna be doing
if we find out that Dad is guilty.

180
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,094
Thea, come on.

181
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,856
Look, I am just saying, what if?

182
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,483
It's not like our parents were saints.

183
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,482
Chase thinks I'm a killer.

184
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,487
What he's doing, this whole setup,

185
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,568
is him trying to convince me
that our father was the same way.

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,158
Our father was a lot of things.

187
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,953
He's not a cold-blooded murderer.

188
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,291
Can't believe you convinced me
to come back to this island.

189
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,377
Fly home any time you want, Anatoly.

190
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,792
You have irony back in America, yes?

191
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,757
To do what I have to do, no one
can know what I've been through.

192
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,970
You mean in Russia?

193
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,350
In Russia.

194
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,978
In Hong Kong.

195
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,149
How do I explain to my family
why I didn't come home sooner?

196
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,988
You know, it's easier
if I'm just a simple castaway.

197
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,819
There's no such thing as simple castaway.

198
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,574
You know what I mean. Just...

199
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,613
It will be easier to keep my cover
if no one is asking questions.

200
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,087
That's a bad omen.

201
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,915
He was my friend.

202
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,334
If that was true,
he would not have tried to kill us.

203
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,341
What are you doing?

204
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,058
Well, this just washed up on the shore
like some kind of sign.

205
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,476
Yeah, that you're crazy.

206
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,191
Come on.

207
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,935
Where are we going?

208
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,982
I'm taking you somewhere to explain
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

209
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,031
I spent a year on this island.
You never told me there was a bar.

210
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,124
Hey. You busy?

211
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,994
Uh. Yeah. I'm just going over
Councilman Goodwin's appointments.

212
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,379
I'm looking for an alibi
for Oliver's father.

213
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,544
I thought you were on freed felon patrol.

214
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,424
Just got some good news,
figured I'd share it.

215
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,630
Please.

216
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,049
Good news is in short supply around here.

217
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,213
Got a court date.

218
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,428
Ha! Finally. You're getting prosecuted.
That is good news.

219
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,137
Funny. It's for Zoe.

220
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,803
Lawyer thinks I can get expedited custody.

221
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,684
Oh, wow, that's terrific.

222
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,432
Huh, good for you, hoss.

223
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,947
I thought maybe, you know,
since you gave me the push, you...

224
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,652
You'd...

225
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,568
Show up for moral support?

226
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,287
It'd be an honor.

227
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,537
Now, get out of here.

228
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,250
- Got your 911 call.
- Gas chromatograph kicked back

229
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,544
something very interesting
on that concrete.

230
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,546
Traces of soil with high levels
of copper concentration.

231
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,515
Yeah, I think you and I
have very different ideas

232
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,597
of what "interesting" means.

233
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,431
Well, I cross-referenced
Queen Consolidated construction locations

234
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,474
with areas in the city
rich in copper, and...

235
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,563
And you think you know
where Goodwin was killed.

236
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,399
Well, nothing concrete.

237
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,563
But yeah.
If Chase is trying to send a message...

238
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,277
It might be saying, "Come find me."

239
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,568
Okay, send this address to Oliver.
I'll meet him there.

240
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,735
What about Curtis and Dinah?

241
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,121
They are staking out Derek Sampson.

242
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
Looks like
Sampson's not finished partying.

243
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,292
<i>Except he's moved on from strippers
to M4 assault rifles.</i>

244
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,839
Should we move on him?

245
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,467
For all we know,
those guns could be legal.

246
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,799
So, if we go in now, the SCPD
might not have enough evidence

247
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,087
to put him back behind bars.

248
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,346
Exactly.

249
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,304
- So, what do we do?
- We wait.

250
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,805
See what his plan is.

251
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,688
Trust me, when it comes to this guy
it's absolutely nothing good.

252
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,683
Anything?

253
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,314
Former Oliver Enterprises.

254
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,855
Used to be a Queen Consolidated
holding company back in the day.

255
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,443
I know, my father brought me here
when I was younger.

256
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,653
Said the building was named after me.

257
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,488
Felicity says it's been abandoned
for about a month

258
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,198
due to some "toxic gas leak."

259
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,658
Chase wanted everyone cleared out.

260
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,912
Seems that way.

261
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,619
Hell of a big building.

262
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,625
If he's in there,
we should get started.

263
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,795
If Chase wanted you here for some reason,

264
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,173
he could've been more specific
about which floor.

265
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,799
Overwatch, can you
narrow the search for us?

266
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,467
Well, normally, yes, but right now

267
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,675
the only heat signatures
I'm reading in there are you two.

268
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,179
- You all right?
- Yeah, wasn't much of a fall.

269
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,231
What's Chase playing at?

270
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,026
I had to ask.

271
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,856
It's concrete.

272
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,360
He's trying to bury us alive
just like Councilman Goodwin.

273
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,959
If you have one of those
smart ideas, I'm in the market.

274
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,214
After all these months,

275
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,217
I refuse to believe
this is Chase's endgame. Overwatch.

276
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,595
Okay. I'm dialing up a rescue,
but it's gonna take a few minutes.

277
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,630
I'm not sure how many more
of those minutes we've got!

278
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,639
Okay. Here we go.

279
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,928
<i>Guys, we got</i> a <i>situation.</i>

280
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,722
- Yeah, so do we.
- Sampson's on the move.

281
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,185
You're gonna have to
let him make it without you.

282
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,395
Oliver and Digg are in trouble.

283
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,568
Chase is going through
a lot of trouble to prove a point.

284
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,778
What the hell is his point?

285
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,822
He framed my father
for the same kind of murder.

286
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,032
Proves the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree, huh?

287
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,572
You both might be killers, Oliver,
but he's a psychopath.

288
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,740
Don't lose sight of that.

289
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,123
Were you assuming that
we're getting out of this?

290
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,535
Yes, lam.

291
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,628
It's Morse Code.

292
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,748
"Get clear."

293
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,103
You two all right?

294
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,938
So we had to move off
the Sampson stakeout?

295
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,144
Yes, because John and you

296
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,190
were re-enacting the paleo version
of my favorite scene from Witness.

297
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,780
Harrison Ford almost getting buried
under the corn in the barn silo.

298
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,943
- That's the one.
- Oh, right.

299
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,283
And for those of us who
haven't seen every movie ever,

300
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,663
they mean it was a trap.

301
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,824
<i>- Who hasn't seen Witness?
- Or</i> a <i>distraction.</i>

302
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,123
I'll bet real money
that Sampson's working with Chase.

303
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,286
Makes sense.

304
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,501
Chase is the reason
Sampson got out of prison.

305
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,629
What did Sampson pull down while
Curtis and Dinah were saving the day?

306
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,918
They broke into a nearby lab.

307
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,428
- To steal what?
- That's the thing.

308
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,304
The chemicals they stole,
torinium and lydracide,

309
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,181
they have absolutely zero street value.

310
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,889
Torinium and lydracide.
Where have I heard those two before?

311
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,349
It's two of the three components
that Justin Claybourne was using

312
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,732
to weaponize tuberculosis
in Lamb Valley five years ago.

313
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,517
You said Claybourne was Chase's father.

314
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,684
He's dredging up the past.

315
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,650
In the case
of Councilman Goodwin, literally.

316
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,151
For a reason.

317
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,282
- What was the third chemical?
<i>- Cyclotrizane.</i>

318
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,442
But it's highly unstable,

319
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,906
so it was banned
from all domestic manufacturing.

320
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,788
Which'll make it incredibly difficult
for Sampson to get his hands on

321
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,918
in case Chase is trying to live out
his dad's evil plan.

322
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,703
- Chase will find a way.
- To what end?

323
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,338
John's right.
I mean, if there's a connection

324
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,751
between Chase's father and framing yours,
I don't know what it is.

325
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,670
We might've found someone
that can help with that.

326
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,555
<i>Darren Coffman.</i>

327
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,011
Last dude Councilman Goodwin saw
before he disappeared.

328
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,926
SCPD interviewed him back in '02,

329
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,187
but we think
they didn't get the whole story.

330
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,892
Coffman was Goodwin's lawyer.

331
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,523
<i>But not just his lawyer.</i>

332
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,111
Coffman also represented Chase's old man.

333
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,910
Mr. Coffman, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

334
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,744
This is my sister, Thea.

335
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,451
<i>DARREN". Pleasure.</i>

336
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,497
Your office didn't mention
why you wanted to see me.

337
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,754
It's regarding the recent reports
about our father.

338
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,963
I never had the opportunity to meet him,

339
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,220
but your father did
some remarkable things for this city.

340
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:06,721
What's happening with his reputation
right now is simply terrible,

341
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,762
but I can't understand
what it could have to do with me.

342
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,897
Reportedly, you were the last person
seen with Councilman Goodwin.

343
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,944
I'm sympathetic to your desire
to identify a suspect

344
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,690
who isn't your father, but...

345
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,113
- What's this?
- I have no idea.

346
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,281
But I was asked to give it to you.

347
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,333
- By who?
- Adrian Chase.

348
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,749
Or, as I knew him, Simon Morrison.

349
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,960
You've been in contact with him?

350
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,546
Why didn't you alert the SCPD?

351
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,756
You've met him. You know why.

352
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,763
The man is terrifying, and smart.

353
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,429
He said you'd seek me out.

354
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,969
And that when you did,
I should give you that.

355
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,140
He said it proves the kind of man
your father truly was.

356
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,942
I know what kind of man our father was.

357
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,354
And he was nowhere close
to Chase's father.

358
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,523
You were Justin Claybourne's lawyer.

359
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,201
You must know something about him,
something about his son.

360
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,704
Attorney-client confidentiality.

361
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,915
I couldn't tell you anything
even if I wanted to.

362
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,452
Actually, I think you want to.

363
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,744
Thea, easy.

364
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,422
What do you know?

365
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,379
"Taiana."

366
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,639
ls that the one you killed Kovar for?

367
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,051
That's my father.

368
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,223
He's the reason I have to go back
the way I have to go back.

369
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,898
That video.

370
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,435
He wants you to save your home.

371
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,313
I do not think <i>kapiushon</i>
is what he had in mind.

372
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,902
Putting on the hood is the only way
I know how to save my city.

373
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,198
I told you, Oliver,
hood is just piece of cloth.

374
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,696
Not that you listen to me anyway.

375
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,160
The hood, Anatoly, is an identity.

376
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,746
One, you think,
channels monster inside you.

377
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,287
And protects the people
that are closest to me.

378
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,248
I do it this way,
my enemies will target the hood,

379
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,504
not the ones I care for.

380
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,503
You are many things, Oliver Queen,

381
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,844
but until today, I did not count
naive as one of them.

382
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,510
<i>The people closest to you will always
pay the most for your sins.</i>

383
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,479
<i>You are paying for your father's.</i>

384
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,228
Who will pay for yours?

385
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,449
I'm gonna destroy it.

386
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,364
Well, don't you wanna see
what's on it first?

387
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,782
- No.
- Why not?

388
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,746
Because Chase wants me to.

389
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,498
I've had my fill
of playing his mind games.

390
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,503
- Yeah.
- Dinah and Curtis

391
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,133
tracked Sampson to Fairbanks Chemical,

392
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,920
a military contractor who sold
a whole lot of cyclotrizane

393
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,087
to the US government.

394
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,348
Text me the address. I'll meet them there.

395
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,764
You want to come with,
for old times' sake?

396
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,638
I think old times should stay old times.

397
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,456
- Keep it going. We're halfway there.
- Hold it.

398
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,501
Pain's just another prison.

399
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,091
And I'm a free man.

400
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,929
To the next batch.
Hurry up, we've got more assigned.

401
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,266
Move out.
Sampson doesn't leave with the chemicals.

402
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,646
Gilmour, you guys coming back
for more of this stuff or what?

403
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,271
Gilmour.

404
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,108
They're here.

405
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,511
Where's your green friend?

406
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,298
I was really looking forward
to killing him.

407
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,659
We need to check to see
if this is cyclotrizane.

408
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:39,822
On it.

409
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,832
Ten'll get you 20,
that's exactly what this is.

410
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,413
<i>One thing at</i> a <i>time.</i>

411
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,244
- Go.
- Hey. Thea called.

412
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,288
She said she needs to talk to you.
Said it was important.

413
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,132
Thea, I thought that we agreed
not to look at whatever's on that drive.

414
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,013
Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders

415
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,016
and just assuming that they're agreements.

416
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,598
- But you have got to see this.
- No, I don't.

417
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,684
It's security footage

418
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:07,851
from the Oliver Enterprises
construction site back in 2002.

419
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,528
Dad must've confiscated it and...

420
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,030
Chase must've found it.

421
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,907
Thea, listen to me.

422
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,408
Ollie, I know what you are about to say,
and I don't...

423
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,371
I don't see how this could be fake.

424
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,491
Please.

425
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,539
Before he died, Dad said to me,

426
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,755
"Oliver, lam not the man you think I am."

427
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,294
And I should've believed him.

428
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,178
Are you okay?

429
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,467
Are you?

430
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,298
No.

431
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,596
But once you find out
Malcolm Merlyn's your biological father,

432
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,105
you can pretty much handle anything.

433
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,439
Between him and Mom,

434
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,359
and being raised by Dad,

435
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,864
it really is no surprise
I turned out to be such a monster.

436
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,279
You're not a monster, and neither was Dad.

437
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,322
Yeah, maybe you should
re-watch that video.

438
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,869
No. Once was enough. That was an accident.

439
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,413
Yeah, an accident
that he tried to cover up.

440
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,717
Ollie, our parents
may have loved us, but...

441
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,257
That love does not make up

442
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,302
for all the terrible things
that they have done.

443
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:11,440
And maybe the most terrible thing of all
was making us just like them.

444
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,817
I have to go.

445
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,323
Are you gonna be okay?

446
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,580
Yeah, I always am.

447
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,667
Okay, let's go over the plan.

448
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:42,009
Ugh, Oliver, we've been over, and over,
and over plan. I'm not that drunk.

449
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,344
Humor me.

450
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,342
I find boat.

451
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,101
Fishermen, most likely.

452
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,058
- Bribe them to sail here.
- In 48 hours.

453
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,688
<i>Da</i>, in two days.

454
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:57,437
You get their attention with bonfire,
then sail away home. A castaway.

455
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,855
Thank you, Anatoly.

456
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,485
Thank me for this.

457
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,192
What do we have here?

458
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,032
Proof that although I think
your plan is crazy,

459
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,491
I'm good enough friend to help.

460
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:10,617
It's from old friend of mine. Former KGB.
Man was chameleon.

461
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,957
This is... This is very smart, Anatoly.

462
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,960
I figured nobody would believe
there is barber shop on island.

463
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,044
Anatoly...

464
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:27,592
Last time we say goodbye, it took us years
before we see each other again.

465
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,770
How about, <i>Ne dumay plokho obo mne.</i>

466
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,099
How about <i>prochnost.</i>

467
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,727
<i>Prochnost. Yeah.</i>

468
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,739
You'll always be my brother, Oliver.

469
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,918
What's going on?

470
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,428
Curtis just finished his analysis
of the cyclotrizane.

471
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,554
Remember how we thought
Chase was following Daddy's footsteps

472
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,886
to recreate his TB epidemic?

473
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,595
Surprise, Chase's plan is worse.

474
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,556
The chemicals Sampson stole
are more refined

475
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,604
than the ones Justin Claybourne used,
and could produce a biological agent

476
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,016
- a thousand times more powerful.
- And without a cure.

477
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,183
How would Chase distribute it?

478
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,023
It's aerosolized,
so pretty much any way he wants.

479
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,778
We have to find out where
Chase is storing this thing,

480
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,109
and stop him before he releases it.

481
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,649
Cyclotrizane degrades pretty quickly.

482
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,488
Which means that it gives off
trackable emissions.

483
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,651
It might.

484
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,780
If they find a location we are gonna
need all hands on deck.

485
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,619
- Where is Rene?
- With Lance.

486
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,408
Said it was personal.

487
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,790
So, how long you known about this?

488
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,458
Lawyer called me this afternoon.

489
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,969
Right, so what's the big deal?
You already knew you had a court date.

490
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,425
But not a hearing.

491
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,134
I thought this was gonna be a cakewalk,
but the judge,

492
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,428
- she wants me to testify.
- So?

493
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,892
So it's gonna traumatize Zoe
all over again.

494
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,267
<i>She's gonna have to listen to me
talk about her mother's drug addiction</i>

495
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,650
and how she got shot?

496
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,071
And everything that
I put her through after that? No...

497
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,361
She shouldn't have to relive all that.

498
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,900
All right, but what's the answer?

499
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,320
You don't show
and she loses her father all over again.

500
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:14,366
- Hoss, you met her foster mom, right?
- Yeah?

501
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,283
She's giving Zoe a good life.

502
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:20,167
I show up to that courtroom,
I'm doing it for me, not for my daughter.

503
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,003
No, if you don't step into that courtroom,

504
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,089
that little girl spends the rest
of her life thinking you didn't want her.

505
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,508
Maybe it's better that way, right?

506
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,799
I mean, come on, we both know
I'm no prize, hoss.

507
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,342
- Come on, man.
- And this is way before

508
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,558
I put on that hockey mask
and started throwing down with human scum.

509
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,222
This is just the nerves talking,
all right?

510
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,435
You're just looking for a way out.

511
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,692
Listen to me, you go into that courtroom,

512
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,194
sure, Zoe's got to relive
some real bad times,

513
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,279
but for the rest of... Look at me.

514
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:52,366
For the rest of her life, the new memories
that she's gonna have...

515
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,908
You get to make sure they're great,
all right?

516
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,419
And you get to decide
how she remembers you.

517
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,044
Please, Rene.

518
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:16,303
<i>I always told myself everything I did,
I did for my family.</i>

519
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,980
<i>That's a lie.</i>

520
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,606
<i>Because what good is a family
without a soul?</i>

521
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,821
<i>You can right my wrongs.</i>

522
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,284
<i>You can be better than I was.</i>

523
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,573
<i>You can save this city.</i>

524
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,208
No pressure or anything.

525
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,709
Is this the video you said
your father left for you?

526
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,876
Yep.

527
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,261
He left one for Thea, too.

528
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,055
I never showed it to her.

529
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,385
Why not?

530
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,428
Because he asked her
to always watch over me,

531
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,097
and I didn't wanna burden her with that.

532
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,475
Hmm. Sounds like
typical Oliver Queen thinking.

533
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,276
Why are you re-watching it?

534
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,450
I wanna know how I missed it.

535
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,445
- Missed what?
- He's a murderer.

536
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,827
I mean, he helped Merlyn
start the Undertaking.

537
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,334
I've never deluded myself
into thinking that he was a saint,

538
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,500
but to take a man's life, cover it up...

539
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,506
It's like I didn't know him at all.

540
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,930
Has it occurred to you that
this is exactly what Chase wants?

541
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,803
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay, the question was rhetorical.

542
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,188
Of course, it's occurred to you.
Of course this is what Chase wants.

543
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,941
Chase wants to destroy the basis

544
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,276
for everything that we're doing here.

545
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:52,030
And that crusade began with my father.

546
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,198
Everything that I've done, everything,

547
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,988
has, in some way, been about honoring him.

548
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,869
Your father inspired you
to save this city.

549
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,337
And you did.

550
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,674
Okay, at this point, who cares why?

551
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,877
You're not a killer.

552
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,804
The people you care about
are not suffering because of you.

553
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:20,309
Their life, my life is better because
you decided to become the Green Arrow.

554
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:26,232
Well, whenever you decide to become
the Green Arrow again.

555
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,518
I know you're right.

556
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,361
I believe that you're right,
but every time I take a step forward,

557
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,777
it feels like the past is pulling me back.

558
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,532
Probably because you're letting it.

559
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,037
Yeah.

560
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,082
Maybe it's time to stop
living for your father,

561
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,788
and start living for yourself.

562
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,538
Just leave the past in the past.

563
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,295
Cyclotrizane emissions trace came back.

564
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,304
Computer's been working on
a probable location...

565
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,840
What is it?

566
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,437
Nice.

567
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,073
What made you decide to put it back on?

568
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,901
Felicity has a way with words.

569
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,238
Dinah and Rene are also on site.
No sign of Chase or Sampson.

570
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,453
Actually, we found Sampson
and his buddies on the roof.

571
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,585
And they've got
their super-toxic gas with them.

572
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,213
Copy. Tell Wild Dog to sit tight
until we get there.

573
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,040
Why'd he say I had to sit tight?

574
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,759
Because he knows you.

575
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,002
Oh.

576
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,147
Go to the roof. Stop Sampson.

577
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:50,853
- What about him?
- He's mine!

578
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,202
And I'm the one that's gotta sit tight?

579
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,403
Terrific, disarm that thing.
We'll cover you.

580
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,905
Okay, please do.
'Cause I don't enjoy being shot.

581
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,236
Go!

582
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,890
Don't worry. I'll make it quick.

583
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,726
And thank you for making me the way I am.

584
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,510
How'd you think you were gonna
beat me, Oliver?

585
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,930
We were trained by the same teacher.

586
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,391
<i>Just one of the many things
that we have in common.</i>

587
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,944
You know, like both our fathers
being horrible men.

588
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,900
I am not my father.

589
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm my own man!

590
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,700
Yeah, a man who's gonna die
knowing that my father's legacy

591
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,363
killed everyone in the city
he loves so much.

592
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,076
Your father's legacy?

593
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,250
That's almost funny.

594
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,706
What are you talking about?

595
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,464
What are you talking about?

596
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,876
What's so funny about my father's legacy?

597
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:28,933
If that son of a bitch even looks like
he's getting loose, light him up.

598
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,682
Copy that. I really want to know
what it takes to kill this son of a bitch.

599
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,931
- Terrific?
- Give me a minute.

600
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,649
Yeah, tell that to the city.

601
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,940
The pressure really isn't...

602
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,230
Helping.

603
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,816
Are we good?

604
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,160
We're terrific.
I've been waiting to use that.

605
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,741
What about Green Arrow?

606
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,292
Goodwin's lawyer,
he represented your father.

607
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,576
I knew that already.

608
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,371
You don't know
what your father asked him to do.

609
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,540
Adrian...

610
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,464
He was going to disown you.

611
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,967
Not because you were illegitimate,

612
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,510
because you're insane.

613
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,895
You're sick and your father knew it.

614
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,355
<i>You've spent all this time trying to honor
the memory of a man</i>

615
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,819
<i>who was ashamed of you.</i>

616
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,406
Now, my father wasn't perfect,

617
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:36,659
but at least I know he never
would have given up on me.

618
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:05,104
Go ahead.

619
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,614
- Do it.
- No.

620
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,943
I'm not gonna kill you.

621
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,615
But I am gonna watch you face justice.

622
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,717
<i>Well, that's</i> a <i>lot
of satisfied-looking faces.</i>

623
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:35,100
And Adrian Chase is warming up a cell
at A.R.G.U.S. as we speak.

624
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,259
Did you want to deliver that news?

625
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,427
- 'Cause I don't...
- That's fine.

626
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,096
Okay, so Oliver dropped
this truth bomb on him,

627
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,061
and then he was just like a marionette
with his strings cut off, so epic.

628
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,692
Great. But there are a lot of bad guys
left on the streets, okay?

629
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,273
Damn, girl, you know how to kill a mood.

630
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,528
Rene's right.

631
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,656
- Oh, say that again.
- You're <i>right</i> for tonight.

632
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,241
We should enjoy the win.

633
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,244
Agreed. So, first round's on me.

634
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,238
Yes-
FELICITY: Woo! Yeah-.

635
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,836
I have something for you.

636
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,287
Hm.

637
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,337
Oh. And here I thought
you could never top the Hozen.

638
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,547
It's a video from Dad.

639
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,928
He made it before he died and...

640
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,931
I should've given this to you sooner.

641
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:21,514
But I was worried that what he said on it
might feel like a burden for you.

642
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,438
You deserve to make that decision
on your own.

643
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,817
After today, I don't think I wanna see
any more videos with him in it.

644
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,196
That's totally up to you.

645
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:38,330
But I don't want you to think that you're
destined to be Dad, or Mom, or Merlyn.

646
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,332
You need to live your own life.

647
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:45,121
And the best way to do that
is to leave the past in the past.

648
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:28,922
Oliver Queen, I'm afraid you're going to
miss your boat home.

649
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,467
Any word from Mr. Ramirez?

650
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,719
Only that he swore
he would be here, Your Honor.

651
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:37,472
The only problem is, he's not.

652
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,225
Which is leaving me with very few options.

653
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,933
Please, Your Honor,
just give him a few more minutes.

654
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,942
And deprive the other people who got here
on time their right to a fair hearing?

655
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,271
Due to a failure to appear,

656
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:56,783
Mr. Ramirez's motion to restore
parental rights is hereby denied.

657
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:20,432
<i>Hello, Thea. If you're seeing this,
then chances are that I'm...</i>

658
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,260
<i>Gone.</i>

659
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:28,394
<i>No matter what's happened,
no matter what you've heard,</i>

660
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,560
<i>I wanted you to know how much I love you.</i>

661
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,443
<i>You're my daughter. My special girl.</i>

662
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,241
<i>I've done some things in my life, Thea,
that I'm not proud of.</i>

663
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,582
<i>But I am proud of you. I always have been.</i>

664
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:52,130
<i>You are gonna grow up to be
a remarkable young woman.</i>

665
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:57,177
<i>Smart, generous, loving,
just like your mom.</i>

666
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:02,724
<i>But the day will come
when your mother and I are gone.</i>

667
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,226
<i>And then it'll just be
you and your brother.</i>

668
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:10,433
<i>And the truth is,
you're stronger than he is.</i>

669
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:16,564
<i>He is going to need to lean on you more
than you're going to need to lean on him.</i>

670
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,691
<i>Oliver, we know, can get through anything</i>

671
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,327
<i>if he has the love and support
of his sister.</i>

672
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,161
I miss him.

673
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,417
I miss both of them.

674
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,633
Every day-

675
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,092
I don't know how to reconcile this...

676
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,387
This man with the one in the other video.

677
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,184
Maybe you don't have to.

678
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,355
Our parents were complex people, Thea.

679
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,729
They had complicated children.

680
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:59,819
What we have to do is
we have to leave the past in the past.

681
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,326
Live our own lives.

682
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,824
Live our own lives.

683
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,665
Doesn't mean that we love them any less.

684
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:15,210
And I have a feeling it's what
they would want for both of us.

685
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,468
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

686
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:28,351
I'd like to talk with everyone
about my father.

687
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,184
Our father.

688
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,694
Based on further investigation,
I can now state definitively

689
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:43,401
that the allegations made
against Robert Queen are true.

690
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,703
<i>My father is not hereto defend himself.</i>

691
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:51,033
<i>And I cannot find the words
to defend his actions.</i>

692
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:55,378
What I can tell you
is that nearly ten years ago,

693
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,632
in a moment of immense courage,

694
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:06,636
Robert Queen chose to sacrifice himself
so that I might live.

695
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:13,890
So that I had the opportunity to
leave behind a better legacy than he did.

696
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,727
So that I might return
and one day serve this city.

697
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,197
Today, we took a step forward.

698
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,155
With help from the Green Arrow
and his team,

699
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,197
the Throwing Star Killer
is now behind bars,

700
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,161
and our streets are a little safer.

701
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,751
<i>Tomorrow, we'll take another step forward.</i>

702
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,911
<i>And the day after,
we will take another one.</i>

703
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:42,335
<i>Because it is time, it truly is time
for us to leave the past in the past</i>

704
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,846
<i>so that our children might inherit
the Star City we have always dreamed of.</i>

705
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,806
<i>The way my father dreamt of a better life
for me and my sister.</i>
