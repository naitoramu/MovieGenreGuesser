1
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:23,857
So, you're-you're not a Fed?

2
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,029
Do you hear that?
That's the old bill.

3
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,754
So unless you want to explain
why you've got

4
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,868
America's favorite invisible
wanker dead on the floor,

5
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,946
give us a fucking hand,
will ya?

6
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,292
Aw, shit.

7
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,726
All right, listen,
I have worked for the Feds.

8
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:00,978
I've worked for loads of people.

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm what you might call
an independent contractor.

10
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,779
You got a problem, you call me,
I solve the problem.

11
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,749
What is that?

12
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,381
That's a problem.

13
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,129
Oh, thank fuck, he's alive.

14
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:31,302
Yes, yes, he's alive!
Okay, pull over.

15
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,028
No, no, no, Hughie,
you don't fucking get it.

16
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,642
- Pull the car over.
- This is a fucksight worse.

17
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,469
He's seen our faces.

18
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,769
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,041
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't do this.

20
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,065
I can't do this.
Let me out.

21
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,486
- Let me out. Pull over!
- Hughie,

22
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,870
you walk away now, and you will
never get payback for Robin.

23
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,278
You'll spend the rest
of your life

24
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,156
sitting on your ass
with fucking regret.

25
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,753
Now, is that what you want?

26
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,755
I know a bloke.
Top man.

27
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,258
He'll know what to do.

28
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,726
Morning, luv.

29
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,941
Frenchie about?

30
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,368
Mmm.

31
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,039
You'll love this guy.

32
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,467
Frenchie.

33
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,893
Oi, Frenchie.

34
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,099
Monsieur Charcuter.

35
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,396
Huh.

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,280
This is a surprise.

37
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,898
Good to see you.

38
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,744
Good to see you, too, mate.

39
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,156
Means you brought that 40,000
you owe me?

40
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,960
I mean, why else would you
show your face around here?

41
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:30,247
Because I've got something
even better for you.

42
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,764
How would you like
to double your money?

43
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,483
The double of zero is zero.

44
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,847
Who is he?

45
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,404
This guy?

46
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,057
Oh, this here is
Hughie Campbell.

47
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,355
We're, uh, working
a little job together.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,530
Ooh.

49
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,778
And he's still alive?

50
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,178
You and I worked together,
and you're still in one piece.

51
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:05,332
Am I?

52
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:10,751
Look, do you want to know
what the fucking job is or not?

53
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,383
Open it.

54
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,223
Who is in there?

55
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,432
Where's your sense of adventure, Frenchie?

56
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,516
You dumb fucks are fucking dead!

57
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,984
Have you any...
Aah!

58
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,824
That's Translucent.

59
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,862
You got Translucent
in your trunk, huh?

60
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,276
Nothing gets past you, mate.

61
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

62
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,330
Go away.
Get him out of here.

63
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,330
All right, all right, easy.

64
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,791
He's chipped.

65
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,211
The Supes could be
on their way.

66
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,726
Homelander could be on his way
right now.

67
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
Wait, he's chipped?

68
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,020
You bring this to my doorstep?

69
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,884
This is not my problem, huh?

70
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,341
Well, it is now.
He knows what you look like.

71
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,926
Look, Frenchie, I need
your help, mate,

72
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,720
and I ain't leaving
till I get it,

73
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,063
or till The Seven show up.

74
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:18,735
Ah, here comes the A-Train!

75
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,487
My man, how you doing?

76
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,449
Look, I brought you something.

77
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,240
- Thanks?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:31,286
I'm sorry, I asked
for Translucent.

79
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,631
Right, but Translucent is
on a secret,

80
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,747
undercover mission right now.

81
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,884
But you got the A-Train, baby.

82
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:44,009
But... my wish was
to meet Translucent.

83
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:48,723
That was my only wish.
He's my hero.

84
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:53,766
Yeah. Um... well, you know,
maybe he can swing by

85
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,822
next week or some...

86
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,857
something...

87
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,783
Fuck.

88
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,371
Um... you know what?

89
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,988
Maybe I can't turn invisible,

90
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,155
but I am the world's
fastest man.

91
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,915
Like, I can outrun anybody
or anything.

92
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,457
That's-that's something, right?

93
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,211
Look, I'll tell you what,
you get better,

94
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,804
and I'll teach you to run
as fast as me.

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,090
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,394
You'll teach me
to outrun cancer?

97
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,226
Yeah.

98
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,727
Oh, my God, turn that off.

99
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,273
How many times do I have
to tell you

100
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,646
that A-Train needs
to be scripted?

101
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,128
- Right.
- When he does not have a script,

102
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,089
- this is what happens.
- I'm on it. I'm so sorry.

103
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,823
- It will not happen again.
- All right.

104
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,034
And where is Translucent?

105
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,534
We know he's not
in the building.

106
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,261
He hasn't triggered any
of the motion sensors.

107
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,263
He's probably out on another one
of his fucking benders.

108
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,157
Doesn't he have a team-up
tomorrow night?

109
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,416
Yeah, with the Deep.

110
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,667
- Get a backup.
- I'm on it.

111
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,878
Okay, go.

112
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,878
Okay.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,170
Hello?

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,390
Black Noir.

115
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,058
We haven't properly met yet.
I'm Starlight.

116
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,185
Well...

117
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,193
I look forward
to working with you.

118
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,196
There she is.

119
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,568
Hi. How you settling in?

120
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,905
Well, uh, it's an adjustment.

121
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,202
That's for sure.

122
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,575
- This is Trevor...
- Hi.

123
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,001
...from Crime Analytics.

124
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,749
So, we have exciting news
for you.

125
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,632
We are sending you
on your first patrol.

126
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,010
It's a team-up tomorrow night.

127
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, that's great.

128
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,049
That's great news.
Thank you.

129
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,933
Hi. Big fan.
There you go.

130
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,614
- A crime itinerary?
- Yep.

131
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,138
Where and when to find
the bad guys.

132
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,312
That's what my department does.
We vet leads,

133
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,810
crunch satellite data,
COMP-STAT.

134
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,402
Better intel than the police.

135
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,517
- Mm.
- You know, thanks, but I'm good.

136
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,864
I-I like to do
my own investigating.

137
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,650
And that is why we love you,

138
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,823
but it's not coming from us.

139
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,571
It's corporate.
To protect you.

140
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:08,993
What if you nab
the wrong person?

141
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,871
There's liability to consider.

142
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,118
The-the Deep is coming?

143
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,751
Yeah,
it's a water-adjacent crime.

144
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,077
Then he should do it himself.
He doesn't need me.

145
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,004
It was gonna be
Deep and Translucent,

146
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:25,173
but everyone on 82 is so excited
to get you out there.

147
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,884
Yeah, it's just, uh, you know,
back in Des Moines,

148
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,715
I always patrolled alone.

149
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,800
And that is why we love you.

150
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,715
But we see at least
a 23% uptick

151
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,934
in social media mentions
and hero hashtags

152
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,394
when there's a team-up.

153
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,444
People love a team-up.

154
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,147
- Love a team-up.
- Mm.

155
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,933
That stuff really
blocks the chip's signal?

156
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,327
Yeah. It's just
R.F. Shielding Foil.

157
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,311
You can get it at Fry's.

158
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,522
You in tech intelligence?

159
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,942
Uh, sales and installation.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,610
Ah...

161
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,321
Oh, what the fuck?

162
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,032
Where am I?

163
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,662
Oi. Morning, sunshine.

164
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,740
- You know who I am?
- Not sure.

165
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,365
I know so many
invisible assholes.

166
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,213
You fucking amateurs!

167
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,843
Fuck!

168
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,626
What the fuck?!

169
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,130
Ooh, mind them bars, son.

170
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,721
You'll only bollocks
yourself again.

171
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,151
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

172
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,585
Uh, okay, what do
you guys want? Money?

173
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,596
We don't want
your fucking money.

174
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,404
What do you think, Frenchie?

175
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,978
You just dropped
the Moby fucking Dick

176
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,573
of problems on my plate.

177
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,487
That's what I think.

178
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,817
Okay?

179
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,413
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

180
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,119
It's hard as diamonds.

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,830
It's nearly impossible
to penetrate.

182
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,410
All right,
how 'bout we suffocate him?

183
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,286
Some Dominicans
already tried this,

184
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,963
way back in '07.

185
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,631
And what happened?

186
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,896
They're all fucking dead now.

187
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,420
That's what happened.

188
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,026
All right, then,
fuck it, electrocution.

189
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,260
We'll just increase the amps.

190
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,820
You already hit him
with enough to drop

191
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,514
a water buffalo, and look.

192
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,564
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him, huh?

193
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,228
No. We need to pierce
the skin somehow.

194
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,977
Well, how the
hell are we gonna do that?

195
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,980
I don't know.

196
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,482
You're gonna kill him?

197
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,531
We didn't bring him here
for a fucking Happy Meal.

198
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,660
I don't... I thought we'd
question him or something.

199
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,489
I don't know, you get a... you
get ahold of someone this big...

200
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,655
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

201
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:08,285
183 times over six months
to get him to talk just once.

202
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,955
Now, we ain't got six months.

203
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,423
I doubt we've even got
six hours.

204
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,587
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

205
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,676
but right now, you're talking
about randomly killing

206
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,562
one of the most famous men
on the planet.

207
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,441
A goddamn national treasure.

208
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:30,818
I mean... people tend to notice
that kind of thing.

209
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,987
And if we let him go...

210
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,197
what do you think The Seven
will do to us?

211
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,778
Hmm?

212
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:42,954
You can't get A-Train if you're
a greasy smear on the pavement.

213
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,166
I'm not a murderer.

214
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,132
That's all right.

215
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,590
I am.

216
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,429
The race is coming up quickly.
How you feeling?

217
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,598
Look, A-Train is
a fierce competitor,

218
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,573
but no one can be the world's
fastest man forever.

219
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,887
Let's just say I like my chan...

220
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,493
I'll always protect you.

221
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,687
Your little
hero will never be afraid

222
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,397
with the Junior
Homelander Cuddle...

223
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:13,278
I regret to inform you that I've
located the mayor's Gulfstream.

224
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,316
It's about two miles down at
the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

225
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,861
There are no survivors,

226
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,454
and I've yet to locate
the flight recorder.

227
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,740
Though the jet was fragmented,

228
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,703
there was one engine
fully intact,

229
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,453
and it appears to be
engine failure.

230
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,905
So I'd like to offer...

231
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,875
Whoa...

232
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,513
- Still going strong, huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

233
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,817
I've just been pumping
for 30 minutes,

234
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,301
and I got a quarter of an ounce.

235
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,512
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

236
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,353
Come on, now.

237
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,348
Personally, I think it's amazing
that a woman your age

238
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,442
can have a baby, period.

239
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,729
That is so sweet of you to say.

240
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,572
Oh, no problem.

241
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,899
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

242
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,783
- You heard about that?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,661
No, not yet.

244
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,118
Well, you know,
I could search for him.

245
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,449
Personally.

246
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,754
That's not necessary.

247
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,537
Right.

248
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,499
Hey, did you hear about
the mayor of Baltimore?

249
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,508
Yeah. Yeah.

250
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,129
Heard his plane went down.

251
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,046
Some sort of engine trouble.

252
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,434
Yeah, it's awful.

253
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,721
I saw him on Tuesday.

254
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,434
Had a meeting with him
right here.

255
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,394
Wow.

256
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,774
Well, hug your kids, right?

257
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,941
'Cause you never know
what might happen.

258
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,270
- So true.
- Mm.

259
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,435
You know what's interesting?

260
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,454
The Deep told me, and only me,

261
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,407
that there were, uh,
scorch marks

262
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,948
on the mayor's engine.

263
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:50,712
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

264
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,827
roughly the width of human eyes.

265
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,552
Say what you mean to say.

266
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:03,047
Your brand is hope,

267
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,763
baseball, America...
sunshine.

268
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,466
You don't do vengeance.

269
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,733
Madelyn, I heard him
through the wall of this...

270
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,192
He was blackmailing you.

271
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,402
I am the last person
you need to save.

272
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,862
Yeah, but I-I did it for you.

273
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,242
I know, but did the timing
occur to you?

274
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,621
I have half the Senate
Appropriations Committee

275
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,868
coming tonight.

276
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,007
How did he even know
about Compound V?

277
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,802
We are not going
to talk about that.

278
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,426
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

279
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,232
You do not need
to hide things from me.

280
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,017
I love Vought as much as you do,

281
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,190
- and I can do more.
- You can do more?

282
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,690
You've already grossed
$12.3 billion for us.

283
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,324
Right. So the pricks on 82 can
take all the fucking credit?

284
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,741
Empty fucking suits
with Cornell degrees? Come on.

285
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,370
I'm the one who's out there.
Not them.

286
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:14,909
I'm the one who,
who-who knows the audience.

287
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,206
Who knows what's good
for this company.

288
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,880
I know. I hear you.

289
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,838
I do. But what I need right now,

290
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,180
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

291
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,007
Right.

292
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:33,224
'Cause that's all
I'm good for, huh?

293
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,846
Smile, look pretty,
say my lines.

294
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,194
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

295
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,819
No. No.

296
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,569
You just need
to let me protect you.

297
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,034
- Oh, you're gonna protect me?
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,500
Gods are pure

299
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,251
and they're perfect

300
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,674
and they're above it all.

301
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,013
And they need to stay that way.

302
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,810
Huh...

303
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,515
You're leaking.

304
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,775
Thank you.

305
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,018
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

306
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,403
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

307
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,072
- I'm fine.
- But the police are saying

308
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,570
some wacko drove
into Gary's store,

309
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,411
right through the window,
and then took off.

310
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,117
I-I thought maybe you've been
hurt, or-or kidnapped.

311
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,198
I saw this Dateline
on human trafficking...

312
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,663
Dad, I haven't been
human trafficked, okay?

313
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,174
I-I closed up early. It must
have happened after I left.

314
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,956
But where'd you go?

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,920
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

316
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,921
- Blowing off steam.
- No... now, I called Anthony, all right?

317
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,634
I called everybody. No one's
seen you. Don't lie to me.

318
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,045
Yeah, it's kind of
hard to explain.

319
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,814
Hey, Dad, listen,
I got to, I got to go.

320
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,241
Just, l-listen,
I know you've been taking

321
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,845
Robin's accident real hard.

322
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,286
- It wasn't an accident.
- All-all right, all right.

323
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,150
My point is, you're a good boy.

324
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,937
You're a sensitive boy.
Come home.

325
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,361
Okay? Before you do something
stupid, come home, Hughie.

326
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,031
- I got to go.
- No, w-wait, Hugh...

327
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,158
Oh. Well, I heard
we had a meeting.

328
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,828
So, um,
I'll just leave you to it.

329
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:41,537
Well, we're having a meeting
right now, aren't we, Deep?

330
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,209
You and me.

331
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,634
- Come on in.
- Yeah. Sure.

332
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,823
So, uh, what, uh...

333
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,437
Or is there, is there anything
I can, can do for you,

334
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,904
Homelander?

335
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:16,574
Well, yeah. I-I guess, uh...

336
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,201
Well, you can help me
understand something, Deep,

337
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,203
'cause, uh...

338
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,825
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.

339
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,293
Am I stupid, Deep?

340
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,293
What? No.

341
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,295
No. You're not stupid.

342
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,088
You're-you're smart.
Very smart, right?

343
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,724
Yeah. Okay.

344
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,140
So, what possible reason...

345
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,981
what, uh, razor-sharp
fish instinct...

346
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,019
made you run to Stillwell

347
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,903
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

348
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,111
All right, look, I-I thought...
I thought I, I was, uh...

349
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,783
I-I don't even know... I don't
know what I saw down there,

350
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,372
as a matter of fact. It was, it
was really dark and, uh, muddy...

351
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,989
the water was really muddy.

352
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,786
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

353
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,250
I-I didn't...

354
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:12,251
I didn't really see anything
down there, as a matter of fact.

355
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,759
That's what I thought.

356
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,400
And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

358
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,818
No. Of course not.

359
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,397
Just this once.

360
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,368
Now go fuck Shamu
in the blowhole.

361
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,581
Yeah.

362
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:39,255
Rounds coated in the same carbon
metamaterial as his skin.

363
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,516
Will it work?

364
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,888
Je ne sais pas.

365
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,150
Guys?

366
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,065
What are you doing?
Wait! No, no, no! Wait, wait!

367
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,575
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

368
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,617
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

369
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,833
You stupid, fucking asshole.

370
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,126
I'm invincible.

371
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,590
You stupid motherfuckers.

372
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,797
I'm fucking Translucent.

373
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,223
I'm indestructible.

374
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,240
It's only a matter of time
before they come for me.

375
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,104
You're fucking dead!

376
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:37,272
Well, that was great, guys.

377
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,775
That was awesome.

378
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,488
Frenchie, back later.

379
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,819
Where are you going?

380
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:50,201
Got an idea.
Long shot, might help.

381
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,714
- Now?
- Yeah, well, it's all under control here, isn't it?

382
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,457
Try not to bugger each other.

383
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,215
Ah, fuck me.

384
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,932
Fuck.

385
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:22,605
Oh. Sorry, Ms. Stillwell.

386
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,652
Oh...

387
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,318
Are you Anika?

388
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,325
Ms. Stillwell,
I didn't know that you were...

389
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,697
You look really nice.

390
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,373
Thank you.
Could you please show me?

391
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,211
Yeah. We haven't been able
to ping Translucent's chip

392
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,458
- until about five minutes ago.
- Well, where is he?

393
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,090
Jersey City.

394
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,087
What the hell is he doing
in Jersey City?

395
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,879
Uh... well, he's somewhere
in this ten-block area.

396
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,513
That is the best you can do?

397
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,027
It's possible
the chip's glitching,

398
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,011
- or there's some kind of interference...
- Okay.

399
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,523
Tell security to search the
area, door-to-door if necessary.

400
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,137
But tell them to be discreet.

401
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,813
He is invisible,
so it shouldn't be that hard.

402
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,153
Okay.

403
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,319
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

404
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,901
A water crime.

405
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,566
Fuck me running. I swear to God,

406
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,084
they only call me when
there's trouble at a dock.

407
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:15,157
Or a river or a lake, canal.

408
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,714
A jetty.

409
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:21,708
Fucking idiots.
I could be doing so much more.

410
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,342
But no, Vought just wants me
to make my big pretty dives

411
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,510
into the water and flash
my fucking biceps for Instagram.

412
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,890
I mean, sure, four million hits
a day, but still,

413
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,307
it's fucking demeaning.

414
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,347
What's your problem?

415
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,852
You've had that pissy look
on your face all night.

416
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:46,107
Ooh. What...?

417
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,202
Is this about
the other night again?

418
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,986
Jesus Christ.

419
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,994
Cry me a fucking river,
all right?

420
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,286
I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

421
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,170
Besides, you had
a crush on me, remember?

422
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,999
That gives you no right...
zero right...

423
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,255
to do what you did,
you pathetic asshole.

424
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,427
- Hey. You shut your fucking mouth.
- Or what?

425
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,337
You'll sic a grouper on me?

426
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,545
I'll tell everyone
you're a psycho.

427
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,056
- I'll go to Homelander.
- No, you won't.

428
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,348
See, I asked around; you're not
number two around here.

429
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,983
You're just the fish guy.

430
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,321
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

431
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,607
Me, most of all.

432
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:30,701
I cannot believe
I fell for your crap.

433
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:35,118
- You stuck-up little...
- You ever touch me again,

434
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,039
I will burn your eyes out.

435
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,036
Understand me?

436
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,885
We'll finish this later.

437
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,677
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

438
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,199
I'll always...

439
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:23,168
Hey.

440
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,552
Hey, boys.

441
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,137
Hurry up. Move faster.

442
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,944
You're amazing. That was so
great. That was really good.

443
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,319
- Smile for the cameras.
- What? What the hell is this?

444
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,834
Yeah, stand over him
and say "This is lit."

445
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,688
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

446
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,235
Catch my dive in the water?
It was fucking cherry.

447
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,410
Nice.

448
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,948
Smile at the camera, Starlight.

449
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,804
Congrats
on your promotion, Susan.

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,760
Jesus Christ. Butcher.

451
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,601
Madam Deputy Director, eh?

452
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,927
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

453
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,265
Keep your voice down, and don't
talk about my family.

454
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,441
It makes my skin crawl.

455
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,020
What are you doing here?

456
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,735
Just need a quick dekko
at some of your files.

457
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,027
- My files? What files?
- A couple of Supes.

458
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,072
Big Game, Shout Out.

459
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,075
Translucent, if you got him.

460
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,787
- Why Translucent?
- Eh, nothing special,

461
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,867
- just ticking a few boxes.
- Oh.

462
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,793
So you just broke
into my goddamn house

463
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,041
in the middle of the night?

464
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,583
All right.

465
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,836
I'm trying to find a way
to do the job on the cunt,

466
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,773
and if it's anywhere,
it'll be in Mallory's files.

467
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,047
- Now would you like me to keep talking?
- No.

468
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:59,221
No. Christ. Just don't
fucking say another word.

469
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,761
The Mallory files
are dead and buried.

470
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,306
You're the deputy director
of CIA Operations.

471
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,140
- Dig 'em up.
- No.

472
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,395
- Why not?
- Because of you.

473
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,147
- Me?
- Yes, you.

474
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,979
The director will shitcan anyone

475
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,614
who even goes near those files.

476
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:17,701
You made it suicide
to go after the Supes.

477
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:21,328
What are you even doing back
involved in this?

478
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,237
I mean, you have a death wish,

479
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,035
or are you a glutton
for punishment?

480
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,500
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

481
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,505
Come on... Susan.

482
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,551
Five minutes alone
with a piece of paper.

483
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,345
For old time's sakes.
No one will know.

484
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,314
You-You're really trying
to sell this shit?

485
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,152
- Why, you buying it?
- You think I look back fondly

486
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,688
at the times we fucked
in bar bathrooms?

487
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,783
Oh, come on.
We had a few laughs.

488
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,859
Like the time you sent me
the Edible Arrangement.

489
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,485
And what we had was
you trying to use me,

490
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,453
for a Get Out of Jail Free card
at a time like this.

491
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:08,084
Well, if that's all
it was, then,

492
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,082
what's got you
so hot and bothered

493
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,214
when a simple "fuck you"
would suffice?

494
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,212
Fuck you.

495
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,550
Now get out of my house.

496
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,693
Did I mention this is
life or death?

497
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,731
I'll send an Edible Arrangement
to your funeral.

498
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,715
Hi.

499
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,928
I, um... I thought you
might be thirsty, so...

500
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,150
Well, if you don't want it,
I can always...

501
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,402
No, I want it.

502
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,743
Cheers.

503
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,169
So, listen, um,

504
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:37,587
I need to ask you some
questions about A-Train.

505
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:41,168
When he, uh, burst
through that woman

506
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,335
the other day, Robin Ward.

507
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,006
I-I need to know why.

508
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,064
Where was he going?
What was he doing?

509
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,478
Why? Was she your sister?

510
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,137
Girlfriend?

511
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,396
Girlfriend.

512
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,573
That's what all this
is about? Christ.

513
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,438
What makes you think I know
anything about it?

514
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,796
I know you and A-Train
were tight.

515
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,990
You guys came up together.

516
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,619
What are you, a fucking fan?

517
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:10,947
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

518
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,825
So you give me something,
maybe I can...

519
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,291
What? Hold 'em off?
'Cause they hang

520
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,502
on your every word.
You're the big man around here.

521
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,713
Okay, you don't want to talk,
don't talk. I tried.

522
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:20,923
Good luck.

523
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:24,593
Buddy, my superpower
ain't invisibility.

524
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,053
You know that, right?

525
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,972
It's reading people.

526
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,845
Watching them when
they think they're alone.

527
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,031
I see people for who
they really are.

528
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,532
I see you, too, pal.

529
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,775
Right.

530
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,866
'Cause you know me
so well, right?

531
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,347
Yeah. I know you're trying
your damnedest

532
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,461
to be tough...
it's a little adorable...

533
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:01,999
but the truth is...
you're terrified.

534
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:05,006
Shitting in your tighty-whities

535
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:09,259
'cause you're "in over your head
fucked," and you know it.

536
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,236
Hughie,

537
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,455
I even kind of feel for you.

538
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:40,747
Your girl died, and we do crazy
shit when we got broken hearts,

539
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:43,173
but now every instinct
is screaming at you

540
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,092
to head for the hills, and you
should listen to that instinct.

541
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,183
Unless we kill you first.

542
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,599
How?

543
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,598
I got invulnerable skin.

544
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,600
I'm a fucking superhero, guy.

545
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,944
We fight gangs and terrorists.

546
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,440
We save the world daily.

547
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,954
I've stood in front
of thousands of screaming fans,

548
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,987
all of 'em creaming their jeans.

549
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,492
Uh...

550
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:14,914
Who are you?

551
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:19,422
A water balloon filled

552
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:24,376
with blood and meat.

553
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,590
Homelander's gonna find me,
and when he does,

554
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,221
he's gonna burst you wide open.

555
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,088
I'm gonna make it home
in time for cocktails.

556
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:34,175
'Cause that's who you are,
and that's who I am.

557
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:38,601
You're not the hero
of this story.

558
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,402
And I'm not the one

559
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,438
who's trapped.

560
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,073
Well, good luck.

561
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,124
I tried.

562
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Great chat.

563
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,874
Run for the hills, Hughie.

564
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,190
It looks like we're losing him.

565
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,514
The signal's going in and out.

566
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,305
Keep searching,

567
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:19,347
another 50 feet down
on the right.

568
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,049
Because,
thanks to Samaritan's Embrace,

569
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,554
Asim has a bed,

570
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,426
a ventilated cooking area,
and a laptop.

571
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,274
But our work is not done.
There are millions more children

572
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,940
just like Asim,
who need your help.

573
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,109
For just $9.99 a month.
That is only...

574
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,148
Hi, John.
Thanks for your support.

575
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,413
It's what makes this republic
so great.

576
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,907
Bill. How are the kids?

577
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,580
Hey.

578
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,078
Give
to Samaritan's Embrace today,

579
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,910
and give a child
just like Asim...

580
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:25,456
Could I get a club soda?

581
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,169
Ms. Stillwell.

582
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,419
Senator, what can I get you?

583
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,922
- Jack, rocks.
- You know, we have Macallan 25.

584
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,546
You'd be wasting it.
Whiskey's whiskey to me.

585
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,100
Boy, they're blowing
so much smoke up Maeve's ass,

586
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,689
it's a miracle she doesn't die
of lung cancer.

587
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,938
But you know it's just that,
right? Smoke.

588
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,071
- I'm sorry?
- Everyone loves

589
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:55,028
to bask in their glow,
but tomorrow morning

590
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,450
no one's putting Supes
into national defense.

591
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,370
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

592
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,170
Because God forbid
we could have an advantage

593
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,543
in an armed conflict.

594
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,330
You send a Supe over
the 38th parallel,

595
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,044
Pyongyang's gonna answer
with a nuke.

596
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,924
Then one of my guys
will catch it.

597
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:14,511
You see Robertson over there?

598
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,798
He's got Lockheed in his state
and in his pocket.

599
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:22,763
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

600
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,846
No one wants
to outsource to you.

601
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:29,104
America runs on weapons.

602
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,516
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

603
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,725
But you are the chairman.

604
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:34,735
Where do you stand?

605
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,606
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

606
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,283
And if I was on the line,

607
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:41,662
scare the shit out of me
to have Homelander there.

608
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,120
My heroes are the most
loyal, patriotic...

609
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,371
That's just it.

610
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:49,462
They're your heroes,
aren't they?

611
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,010
Get him a Macallan 25.

612
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:02,104
Why have average
when you can have extraordinary?

613
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,562
Thank you.

614
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,895
Guys, we should get
back to the party.

615
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,668
- What?
- Elena just ordered more booze.

616
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:16,961
- Come on, let's go back.
- No, no...

617
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,046
It'll be more fun at the party.

618
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,255
Please... okay, don't touch me.

619
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,069
No, please, please.

620
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,584
Oh, no, no! Stop!
No, no, no, no!

621
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:24,697
Please, no, no, no, no!

622
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,123
- The girl said no.
- Help.

623
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,792
We're all friends here.

624
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,210
Yeah, it's all good.
It's fine.

625
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,796
Miss, do me a favor
and shut your eyes.

626
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,309
Fucking bitch.

627
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,083
Fucking diamond skin.

628
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,329
- Fuck.
- Merde!

629
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,625
Here.

630
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,593
Here, take it.

631
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,093
What is that?

632
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,346
It will help
with your, uh, anxiety.

633
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,308
It's LSD and MDMA.
This is a candy flip.

634
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,769
It'll smooth you right out.
Take it.

635
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,059
Uh, thank you, but I-I
don't think now is the time

636
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,863
for a major hallucinogen.

637
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,897
Fais-toi plaisir.

638
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,696
What are you exactly?

639
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:54,366
Chemist? Engineer? What?

640
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:58,496
No. I know a little
about a lot of things.

641
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:02,295
I'm a gunrunner by trade,
but, uh, as you can see,

642
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,130
I've developed a certain niche.

643
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:05,716
Killing superheroes?

644
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,061
No.

645
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,176
You can count on one hand
the number of dead superheroes.

646
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,234
Sometimes you can, uh,
incapacitate them.

647
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:20,364
Truly, they are
magnificent creatures.

648
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,690
Mm.

649
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,776
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

650
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,452
It's, uh...
it's never the same twice.

651
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,203
Who pays you to do that?

652
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:33,544
Whoever can pay.

653
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,132
And when you do kill a Supe...

654
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,459
or, you know, any-anyone...

655
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:45,335
um... what's it like?

656
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,143
You know...

657
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,225
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator,

658
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,191
2008.

659
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,903
No more for ten seconds,
I see her, huh?

660
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,954
Stunning.

661
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,607
Five-nine.

662
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,287
Hair so black it absorbed
the light, you know?

663
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,867
Tom Ford pencil skirt,
Louboutin stilettos.

664
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,464
C'est magnifique.

665
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,839
But she had,

666
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,456
uh... she had...

667
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:25,474
I never forget this, you see...

668
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,297
she had dirt
under her fingernails

669
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,303
and callouses on her hands,
and I see this and I say, "Oh,

670
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,846
strange for such a refined woman
like this."

671
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,100
What, you...

672
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,142
You a gardener?

673
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,245
You know, are you a sculptor?

674
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,149
What is this, huh?

675
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,857
And I think about this...

676
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,656
I think about her all the time.

677
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,161
She was the first person
I ever killed.

678
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,209
I carry...

679
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,499
I carry them all with me.

680
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:06,424
It's like scars in a way,
you know?

681
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,270
Okay, Senator, you ready?

682
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,978
Oh, yeah.

683
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:21,858
Oh. Oh, darling.

684
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,147
- Mm-hmm?
- You know I like to watch.

685
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:26,781
No. Can't always be in control.

686
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,568
Sir.

687
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,533
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

688
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,584
Oh, you'll feel
good indeed, baby.

689
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,754
- You ready?
- Oh, I was born ready.

690
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,213
- Mm-hmm.
- Feels like butter, baby.

691
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,625
Get ready, sir.

692
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,723
You're going in.

693
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:52,219
Yee-haw!

694
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,850
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

695
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:54,967
Oh, God.

696
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,563
That-that feels different.

697
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:12,989
Hey...

698
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,871
Homelander.

699
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,288
Starlight.

700
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,327
How are you?

701
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:24,082
Uh, I'm good.

702
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,665
Good.

703
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,511
Hey, is that your, uh,
secret identity?

704
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,388
- Mm-hmm.
- Charming.

705
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,586
Thanks.

706
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,926
Yeah, I-I gave up on mine...

707
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:41,693
oh... a long time ago now.

708
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,807
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

709
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,606
Good night.

710
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,406
No. No, I did not

711
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:04,214
go through eight rounds of IVF

712
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,959
and bleeding nipples
to quit now.

713
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:10,092
I am doing this. Yes.

714
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,720
That little kid is gonna drink
my goddamn milk

715
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,507
if it's the last thing I do.

716
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,575
While scientists
now believe the shell evolved

717
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,999
to help turtles burrow
underground...

718
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,759
What are you doing?

719
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,965
Shocking our invisible friend.

720
00:44:03,016 --> 00:44:05,476
I need him unconscious.

721
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,938
Why?

722
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,225
Because I got it.

723
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,441
Now what the fuck do you want?

724
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,782
What the fuck, Starlight?!

725
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,494
What?

726
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,955
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

727
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,380
Oh, shit.

728
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,248
And so glad you did it
in plain clothes,

729
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,295
so you could blow
your secret identity.

730
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:38,799
Here: "OMG. I recognize
Starlight, that's Annie January!

731
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,433
"I went to Hoover High with her.

732
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,180
# SheWasBulimic."

733
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,399
One, this was stupid.

734
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:52,646
Two, it was really stupid
to do it on camera.

735
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,400
Always look for cameras.

736
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,782
- They were about to rape a girl.
- What girl?

737
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,700
There's no girl in that video.
You get a name?

738
00:44:58,738 --> 00:44:59,858
No, she ran off.

739
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,656
Oh, great. She ran off. Great.

740
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,239
Always get a fucking name,
Starlight. Always!

741
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,995
Well, uh...
They-they said... Hmm.

742
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,827
They-they said she was a friend.

743
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,253
It was date rape, I think.

744
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,291
Great.
Well, she hasn't come forward

745
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,125
and, statistically,
she's not likely to.

746
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,630
So all we really have
is two Delta Betas

747
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,723
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

748
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:21,638
until you beat them unconscious.

749
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,428
They're lying! I, uh...

750
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,181
Aren't I innocent
until proven guilty?

751
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,064
When you're in the big leagues?
You flip it.

752
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,375
I don't know what you were
planning on doing today, hmm,

753
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,479
with your little... cute day,

754
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,316
but you have to cancel
everything, okay?

755
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,839
You're gonna have meetings
with Risk Assessment,

756
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,123
with Crisis Management,
with Legal.

757
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,027
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

758
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,736
Fuck.

759
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:48,746
Am...

760
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,955
Are they gonna fire me?

761
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,300
Just be in Stillwell's office
at 10:00.

762
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,006
What?

763
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,086
Am I fired?

764
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:02,342
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

765
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:06,505
I realize, uh,
how busy you were last night.

766
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,727
These... are fake.

767
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,534
I think we both know
they're not.

768
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,700
Look. I was with a young woman,
all right?

769
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,240
Of legal age.

770
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,623
Her name was Rhonda.

771
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,159
So this isn't possible.

772
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:31,624
They've... obviously
been doctored or something.

773
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,374
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

774
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,706
I should know. I was there.

775
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,502
You what?

776
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,762
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

777
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,434
Oh, Jesus.

778
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,641
That will be all, Doppelganger.

779
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,685
Who the fuck is he?

780
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,649
Anyway, I would love to continue

781
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,689
our conversation
from last night.

782
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,864
This is some dirty fucking pool,
Madelyn.

783
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,574
You're really gonna clutch
your pearls, Senator?

784
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,445
I don't think either one of us
is that naive.

785
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,834
Yeah. It's not...

786
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,961
it's not fatal to be...
homosexual these days.

787
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,039
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

788
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,085
Where your voters live.

789
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,415
Even if I get the bill
out of committee,

790
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,086
nobody's gonna vote for it
on the floor.

791
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:29,135
No one wants your fucking Supes
in the Army.

792
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,180
We'll see.

793
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,647
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

794
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,527
Homelander.

795
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:47,621
Uh...
wel-welcome to Crime Analytics.

796
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,260
Can... Would you like a Red Bull?

797
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:50,744
Have you found Translucent yet?

798
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,285
Oh. Uh, no.
But Security's on it.

799
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:57,329
He's been missing over 24 hours.

800
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,785
- Is he in danger?
- Um...

801
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,836
Do... you even know?

802
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,430
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

803
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,860
What's his last known position,
please?

804
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,974
Why don't I just call
Ms. Stillwell?

805
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,562
- And I...
- No.

806
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:11,847
No, no, no, no, no.

807
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,139
You're talking to me.

808
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,982
Well, I'm not sure

809
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,809
I'm supposed to be talking to...

810
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:20,154
What's your name?

811
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:21,359
- Anika.
- Anika.

812
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,479
Sir.

813
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,685
It's a beautiful name.

814
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,737
Listen, Anika.

815
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:28,869
- I'm the Homelander.
- Mm-hmm.

816
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,776
And I can do whatever
the fuck I want.

817
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:34,036
Okay?

818
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,788
Now...

819
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,460
Translucent's last known
position.

820
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,877
Please.

821
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,062
What the...?

822
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,057
Something doesn't feel right.

823
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,388
Oh, I'll bet.

824
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,983
I'm not ashamed to admit

825
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:59,018
I have outdone myself.

826
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,977
Now, the problem is
the skin, no?

827
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,066
It's, uh, hard like diamonds.

828
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,371
But then I realized, it is just
your shell that is hard, huh?

829
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,866
Like a turtle.

830
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,699
But your insides...

831
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,124
they're like the rest of ours...

832
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,543
soft.

833
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,791
So, how do you get to the...
squishy insides?

834
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,044
Through the mouth? Non.

835
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,876
The stomach acid,
the gag reflex.

836
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:30,432
If I stick something down your
throat, you may vomit it up.

837
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,641
There's truly only one way...

838
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,970
The fuck did you do to me?

839
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,765
He stuck a lump of plastique
up your bum, son.

840
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,151
Ass bomb.

841
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,648
Oh, my God.

842
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,736
Now...

843
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,530
you stick a little finger up
there and try and fish it out...

844
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,905
bang.

845
00:49:56,953 --> 00:50:00,293
I trigger this... also bang.

846
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,711
Savvy?

847
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,669
Oh, please don't kill me.

848
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,341
I'll do anything.

849
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:10,089
I'll tell you about A-Train.

850
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,763
That's what the kid wants,
right?

851
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:14,301
I-I-I-I don't know
where A-Train was going

852
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,675
that night he killed the girl,

853
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,562
okay, but I know
where he was coming from.

854
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,728
What? Where?

855
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,386
Popclaw's.

856
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,845
He fucking... loves her.

857
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,623
He doesn't think anyone else
knows, but I know.

858
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:25,817
I know a lot of things.

859
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,397
But he-he's there every night.

860
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,742
Maybe... now, even.

861
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,046
Popclaw?
That's the hero with the...

862
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,990
the sharp things
coming out of her arms.

863
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,530
Yeah. Real D-lister.

864
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,624
Anyone knows what A-Train
was doing, it's Popclaw.

865
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,039
But that's all I know
about that, I swear to Christ.

866
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,328
But I'll tell you
anything else you want.

867
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,422
Just ask.

868
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,924
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

869
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,934
Just... ask anything.

870
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:57,047
Now, normally, that would be
just what the doctor ordered.

871
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:00,306
But unfortunately... for you...

872
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,189
we're out of time.

873
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,976
No.

874
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,190
No!

875
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,399
Please! Listen, I know shit.

876
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,530
Dark shit!
All the way to the top!

877
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,628
Wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no!
Please, wait, wait, wait.

878
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,612
Listen, I can help you.
I'm fucking invisible!

879
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,132
- We can be a team.
- Butcher!

880
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:16,550
No, please, please, please!
Please, I can...

881
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,284
A moment, s'il vous plait.

882
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:23,622
Here.

883
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,134
What is that?

884
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,297
Homelander.

885
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,587
That's Homelander?

886
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,671
Homelander's here? Oh, shit.

887
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,426
Oh, shit!

888
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,849
He could see us.

889
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,116
He's got X-ray vision. He can
see through the fucking roof.

890
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,140
And super fucking hearing.

891
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,984
You pull that detonator,
he will hear.

892
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,895
Homelander.

893
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,196
We got to throw him
off the scent.

894
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,200
But how?

895
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:00,581
Pittsburgh.

896
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,448
Oh, you cannot be serious, huh?

897
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,495
Deadly.

898
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,959
You know how much
this will cost me?

899
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,579
Put it on the tab.

900
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,141
Guys?!

901
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,153
Where is it?

902
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,107
Back door panel.

903
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,467
Look, the mall shooting's a tragedy.

904
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,171
I'm just saying,
if more people were armed,

905
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,701
maybe I wouldn't have
to save the day every time.

906
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,098
- So, in a situation...
- Hello?

907
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:47,082
Cherie.

908
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,083
It's a burn.

909
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,754
You're joking.

910
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,092
Now?

911
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,167
No joke, I'm afraid.

912
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,256
Fine.

913
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,970
I'll be ready in three.

914
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:03,763
Come on.

915
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,325
Frenchie, I'm getting
shit reception here.

916
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,669
Well, figure it the fuck out,
huh?

917
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,147
Come on.

918
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,220
Evening.

919
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,314
Holy shit.

920
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:49,691
You're the Homelander.

921
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:50,913
I am talking to the Homelander.

922
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:51,977
Mm-hmm.

923
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,861
Sir, I need to see some ID.

924
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:57,818
Get the fuck back in that cage.

925
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,150
Just take it easy. Okay?

926
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,776
You doing out here?

927
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,742
This is my place.

928
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:07,123
We... I'm, uh...
I'm opening a Fogo de Chao.

929
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,161
You know what a churrascaria is?

930
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,075
Yeah.
It's a Brazilian steakhouse.

931
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,383
Sir, I need to see
in the back of the van.

932
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,958
No offense, you got a...
warrant or something?

933
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,875
Well, if you got nothing
back there,

934
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,605
then you got nothing
to worry about, right?

935
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,890
Please get back in the cage.

936
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:32,897
I'm not getting back
in that cage, man.

937
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,647
I do, I am dead.

938
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,979
Yeah, well, if you don't...
you're dead.

939
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,219
Just think.

940
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,850
You kill me,

941
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:09,716
they'll never stop
looking for you.

942
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:13,305
You'll be glancing over
your shoulder your whole life

943
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,772
till they find you,
which they will.

944
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,852
Everything all right, sir?

945
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,982
Look, you let me go...

946
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:59,399
you'll be the hero
that saved Translucent.

947
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,820
It's not too late.

948
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,609
You can still go home.

949
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,783
Back to your life.

950
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,329
Attaboy.
