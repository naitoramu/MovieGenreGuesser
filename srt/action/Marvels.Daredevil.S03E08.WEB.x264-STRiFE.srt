1
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,976
Who are you?

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,437
I'm Daredevil.

3
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,106
Hey, you can't be here!

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,738
Hello, Karen.
It's nice to see you again.

5
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,538
I'm Daredevil.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,842
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

7
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,636
It just works better
with a North Star to guide you.

8
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,575
What if I can't find one?

9
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,724
Then you'll rely
on our structure.

10
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,602
A tidy physical space.
A disciplined vocation.

11
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,146
You will build your life
on pillars of order.

12
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,839
If you'd just wake the hell up

13
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,115
instead of playing right
into Fisk's hands.

14
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,533
He's using you...

15
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,034
- Morning.
- Morning, boss.

16
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,703
...and I think you know it.

17
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,456
So let me ask you this, Agent Nadeem...

18
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,043
Who do you think is the danger here?

19
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,134
The man who attacked the Bulletin
dressed as Daredevil...

20
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,886
he's in the FBI.

21
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,266
Hello, Karen.
It's nice to see you again.

22
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,311
Hey!

23
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,979
Julie!

24
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,067
- Dex, stay away from me.
- Please, just hear me out.

25
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,277
I'm doing this in public
so you'll feel safe.

26
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,239
I'll stay right here.
I'm not coming any closer.

27
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,407
Okay.

28
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,746
I am so, so sorry
about how things ended the other night.

29
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,083
I'm sorry for scaring you.
I just wanted to explain myself.

30
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,670
When we worked together
at the suicide hotline,

31
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,630
I saw the way you were with other people.

32
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,467
Patient, compassionate, and I...

33
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,887
I really need that right now.

34
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,056
My life is out of control.

35
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,643
I have no family,
and I'm about to lose my job...

36
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,769
Please.

37
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,189
I just want to talk. Anywhere you choose.
And...

38
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,235
if you say no, I'll understand...

39
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,737
and I'll never bother you again.

40
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,589
Agent Nadeem.

41
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,344
You're late.

42
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,388
I was early,
but I needed to be sure about you.

43
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,472
What's his name?

44
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,183
Yeah, well,
I need to be sure about you, too.

45
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,228
You have a history of hurting people.
I'm not handing you a federal agent

46
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,112
- if you're gonna kill him.
- I don't do that.

47
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,360
The agents you beat up the other day?
One of them is still in the hospital.

48
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,804
All of them just doing their jobs.

49
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,114
If they'd arrested me,
there'd be no one to take down Fisk.

50
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,867
If you're right about him,
taking Fisk down is our job.

51
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh, really?

52
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,954
Because we both know
where he's sleeping these days.

53
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,081
But I understand.

54
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,460
If there's one thing we agree on, Nadeem,
it's the greater good.

55
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,129
Like house incarceration
in exchange for good intel.

56
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,382
Sometimes you and I have to hurt
one person to save another.

57
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,217
So what's his name?

58
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,264
I need your word that you won't touch him.

59
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,516
My word can't mean anything to you.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,435
But I need to hear you give it.

61
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,398
Well, I need him to testify against Fisk,
so you got it.

62
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,197
We're gonna slip into his place.

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,992
Look for any evidence that ties him
to the Bulletin attack or to Fisk.

64
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,204
If we find any, we leave it where it is.

65
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,248
And we set off his fire alarm
on our way out.

66
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,460
The fire department arrives,
and you circumvent a search warrant.

67
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,170
But if we don't find anything,

68
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,130
- the guy goes on with his life.
- Spit it out.

69
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,507
Who is he?

70
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,136
Special Agent Ben Poindexter.

71
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,810
A small decaf and whatever she's having.

72
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,187
I've got mine. Thanks.

73
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,272
- My regular, Richie.
- All right.

74
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:44,779
So, I don't know how to say this
without it sounding like an insult.

75
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,240
I was never actually into you.

76
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,201
Or... not the way you might have
been thinking, anyway.

77
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,537
I didn't know how to talk to you.

78
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,163
Okay.

79
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,832
I wasn't...

80
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,085
I wasn't stalking you.

81
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:03,923
Although, I completely see
how it could have come across that way.

82
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,510
I just... I wanted to be more like you.

83
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,265
Do you realize
how creepy that still sounds?

84
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:24,735
You are so good.

85
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,614
And kind. And...

86
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,284
You save lives as your job.

87
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,539
The FBI, the army before that...

88
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,709
they helped keep me
on the straight and narrow path.

89
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,297
But now, without that, it's all...

90
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,757
I'm drowning in deep water,

91
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,303
and I don't know whether I'm swimming
for the surface or the bottom.

92
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,474
Dex, you need air. Breathe.

93
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,151
See, that's...
that's what I'm talking about.

94
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,321
You help people right themselves.

95
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,615
I've seen you do it a hundred times.

96
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:16,454
All I'm asking, just treat me like...
someone on the other end of the line.

97
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,001
What happened at the FBI?

98
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,047
The bureau needed a scapegoat.

99
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,936
You know, what you really need
is a good therapist.

100
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,982
I had one. She died.

101
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,484
Oh, I...

102
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
I'm so sorry.

103
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,578
Okay. I'll help you, Dex.

104
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,916
But, please, do not make me regret this.

105
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,712
I promise. Promise I will not.

106
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,342
Excuse me.

107
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,613
Hi. Whoa!

108
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,157
- Did you get any sleep at all?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,241
No.

110
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,080
- You need coffee.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,626
You ever have one of those days
where you're just, like...

112
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,171
You break it down, step by step?
Just, uh...

113
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,010
"Put your feet on the floor, Karen.
Just get to the sink."

114
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,762
Sure.

115
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,682
Generally speaking,
I don't call myself Karen, but...

116
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,310
Actually, no, I don't do any of that.

117
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,144
How are you not at the bottom
of a bottle right now?

118
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,566
Because I have a theory.

119
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,818
Jeez. Must be a hell of a theory.

120
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,071
Fisk is giving up criminals
involved in corruption.

121
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,555
He's planning to step into the void

122
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,617
and become the sole source
of government protection

123
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,161
for all criminals in Hell's Kitchen,
maybe the city.

124
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,872
And that theory
makes you want to not drink?

125
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,917
Yes, because I also have a plan.

126
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,004
No. No, no, Foggy, you don't have a plan.

127
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,346
Do you know what happens
when you make a plan?

128
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,981
Fisk has already thought of it,
and he's made it part of his plan.

129
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,721
Except he has no idea that I'm onto him.
He couldn't.

130
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,515
I discovered this
while looking into Marci's briefs.

131
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,600
More ways than one.

132
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,477
- Foggy.
- Sorry.

133
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,314
The point is she was prepping
for a deposition of a corrupt IRS official

134
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,477
who was providing
fraud and money laundering services

135
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,068
- for the Albanians...
- No, stop.

136
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,779
I can't.

137
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,120
Just one more article, Karen.
That's all it'll take.

138
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,584
All right. What's this?

139
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,836
The terms of Fisk's house incarceration.

140
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,091
If he violates any of these, zappo.
He's back in prison.

141
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,093
"Zappo"? Is that a thing?

142
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,345
Number three is the key.

143
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,223
"Committing or conspiring
to commit a felony."

144
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,850
No, no, wait. What about number six here?

145
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,853
All this stuff about being charged
with a crime that predates the agreement?

146
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,314
- Number six is not the plan.
- We have a good number six.

147
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,943
I mean, Fisk killed his father.
That's murder.

148
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,987
There's no statute of limitations.
And his mother told Ben Urich about it.

149
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,906
A dead woman told a dead guy something.

150
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,451
- That's not proof. It won't stick.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,621
You know what will? Publicizing my theory.

152
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,998
So the FBI sees
that Fisk has violated his agreement,

153
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,722
they're forced to put him back in prison?

154
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,254
And they can't ignore it
if we splash it across the front page.

155
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,588
And by "we," I mean you.

156
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,472
The Bulletin won't just let a journalist
make unsubstantiated claims.

157
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,509
That's not news.

158
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,928
But it is news if a candidate
running for district attorney

159
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,555
makes unsubstantiated claims.

160
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,016
In a public forum.
Debating the incumbent DA.

161
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,310
You're gonna debate Blake Tower?

162
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,729
At the Hell's Kitchen Club.

163
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,314
Well, it's supposed to be
prepared remarks.

164
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,191
- Huh.
- They're endorsing him.

165
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,818
I'm not actually on the agenda,

166
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,154
but Nelson's Meats
is a member of the club, so...

167
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,156
You're just gonna confront him,
out of the blue?

168
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,742
Why not?
I'll catch him when he's not expecting it.

169
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,118
Throw this stuff at him...

170
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,204
Yeah, you get him worked up, emotional.
Provoke him.

171
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,832
It could work.

172
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,753
Yup.

173
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,172
So, you'll cover the meeting?

174
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah, I would. I just, um...

175
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,554
I lost my job. So...

176
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,639
What?

177
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,977
Ellison loves you like family.
What did you do?

178
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,398
I refused to give him
Daredevil's identity.

179
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:56,817
Yikes.

180
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,238
Okay, well,
Ellison wants Fisk as badly as we do.

181
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,784
Just tell him our plan.
Watch how fast he gives you your job back.

182
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,037
Then we'll hook up at the dinner later.
You're my plus one.

183
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,581
I got you the salmon.

184
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,309
Hey. Did the landlord let you in?

185
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,004
Dex.

186
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,715
Thanks for coming.

187
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,970
You made it pretty clear I had to.
What's this about?

188
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,973
I have someone here
who wants to talk to you.

189
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,433
Follow me.

190
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,705
Dex, this is my old friend Andrea Morales.

191
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,833
She's an attorney.

192
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,336
The guys took up a collection
to pay for Andy's services.

193
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,630
Now if you're up for it,

194
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,967
she's going to sue the bureau
for wrongful suspension on your behalf.

195
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,303
- She can do that?
- I can.

196
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,305
And having reviewed
the details of your case,

197
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,181
I fully believe that I should.

198
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,643
She's on a retainer. Starting now.

199
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,811
And I'm not cheap.

200
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,689
The guys must really like you,
Agent Poindexter.

201
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,694
You've had my back through all this?

202
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,071
I don't know how to thank you.

203
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,410
The guy that saved our lives doesn't
ever have to thank us for anything.

204
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,082
Well, figure out the next steps,
and, uh...

205
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,544
I can't wait to have you back on the team.

206
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,215
I've prepared the argument.

207
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,494
You find anything?

208
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,080
He's neat. He likes order.

209
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,667
So does my wife,
but she wouldn't fit in your suit.

210
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,382
Everything I have on Dex
is circumstantial at best.

211
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,176
I just left him. He was solid.

212
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,265
I don't see a decorated agent
falling for Fisk's bullshit.

213
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,267
Yeah, well, that's what Fisk does.

214
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,644
Finds a weakness. Hits it hard.

215
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,896
When you're already on your knees,

216
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,190
you've got no choice
but to fall for his bullshit.

217
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,361
I bet you guys are paying
for his room service, too.

218
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,083
The suit's here. I can smell it.

219
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,960
What, you can smell it?

220
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,506
GSR and latex.

221
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,012
Shit. I can't call a crew to crack that.

222
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,102
What, you can do that?

223
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,646
Not if you keep talking, I can't.

224
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,545
The suit was here. He must've moved it.

225
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,090
Well, it isn't now.

226
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,802
And you smelling eau de suit
won't exactly sway a judge.

227
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,097
I'm telling you, Poindexter's the guy.
It was him.

228
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,017
There's nothing here tying him
to Fisk or the Bulletin.

229
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,938
We got jack shit.

230
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,615
When the crows
come to the birdfeeder,

231
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,367
I kill them with rocks.

232
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,870
What does it feel like
to watch them die?

233
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,332
It probably won't even get
as far as an arbitration.

234
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,626
The government tends to balk
once folks lawyer up.

235
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,255
This is amazing.
How long do you think this will take?

236
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:55,676
If we do everything right,
you'll be reinstated in six months.

237
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,387
- Six months?
- But we'll get you back pay.

238
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,889
I don't care about back pay.

239
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,892
What am I going to do for six months?

240
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,228
I know it seems like a stretch,

241
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,189
but you've got a bright future
ahead of you in the bureau.

242
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,191
Play the long game.

243
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,363
Oh. I'll be right back.

244
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,201
This number has been blocked.

245
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,999
Have you been
doing our exercises?

246
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,464
Yes, but then the neighbor
brought home a box of stray kittens.

247
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,132
They were in the yard.

248
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,221
I killed them with rocks, Dr. Mercer.

249
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,934
I tried not to, but I liked it.

250
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,150
So the guy has issues. Serious issues.
But that doesn't mean...

251
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,869
He's here. You should go.

252
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,705
No, we had a deal.
No evidence, you don't touch him.

253
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,208
- I found evidence.
- The kind that holds up in court.

254
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,668
He's gonna use the suit again.

255
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,545
I got the jump on him.
I can get him to tell me where it is.

256
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,007
- You gave me your word.
- Yeah, well, I take it back.

257
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,839
- We'll never get another chance like that.
- What if you're wrong?

258
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,575
I'm not wrong.

259
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,924
The shot came from across
the alley.

260
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,926
I think it came from downstairs.

261
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,020
He's... He's ricocheting the bullets.

262
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,982
- Go for the front door.
- He's by the window.

263
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,359
He's waiting for a better shot.

264
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,277
How do you know?

265
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,038
He's only got three more rounds.

266
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,961
I'll tell you when he reloads,
and then you go.

267
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,708
Okay.

268
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,089
- He's not calling for backup.
- No. And he won't.

269
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,632
But the neighbor called 911.

270
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,304
God damn it, Dex.

271
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,850
Okay, now. Go, go, go!

272
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,178
Third floor, 2312 King Street.

273
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,097
Two suspects, violent.

274
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,976
Roger that, dispatch. 2312 King Street...

275
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,194
Police! Hands in the air!

276
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,958
I'm FBI. I have ID.

277
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,753
If you look in my pocket,
you'll find my wallet.

278
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,216
Two armed suspects broke into my home.

279
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,057
...tried not to, but I liked...

280
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,814
All right, all right,
everybody, settle down.

281
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,192
We're getting to the good part
of the evening.

282
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,527
You mean dessert?

283
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,781
As if you need
another freakin' cannoli, Mikey!

284
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,409
Our agenda tonight is simple.

285
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,037
Our endorsement of a candidate
for district attorney...

286
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,747
It's Karen.
You know what to do.

287
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,375
Karen? Where the hell are you?

288
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,466
- How did you get up here?
- I checked into a room.

289
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,009
This floor FBI is personnel only.

290
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,970
Hi, I'm Karen Page. I'm with the Bulletin.

291
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,971
We know who you are.

292
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,597
Well, I'd like to talk to him.

293
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,099
Not gonna happen.

294
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,852
Under his agreement,
he's entitled to speak to the press.

295
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,522
Unless you two wanna
make the call to violate that?

296
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,358
Fisk and his lawyers have to sign off
on all press requests.

297
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,320
They tell all you people to screw off.
You're wasting your time.

298
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,198
All right.
Well, why don't you call his lawyers

299
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,701
and tell them I want to give
Mr. Fisk a chance to comment

300
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,412
on a story that I'm writing
about a Marlene Vistain?

301
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,581
That's Fisk's mother.

302
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,665
Shit.

303
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,667
He actually had one?

304
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,338
Go ahead. Call his lawyers. I'll wait.

305
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,345
Prosecutions
aren't the whole story.

306
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,764
The vast majority of our caseload
never sees a jury,

307
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,811
because we bring such strong cases to bear
that defendants plead guilty voluntarily.

308
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:48,189
Which means more bad guys in jail
for less money.

309
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,066
Something we all can agree on?

310
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,367
Until you let them out of prison again.
Isn't that right, Mr. Tower?

311
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,705
Because you sign off
on both kinds of deals, don't you, sir?

312
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,415
Is that Foggy Nelson?

313
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,541
Uh...

314
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,959
Sure is, Mr. Gerlach.

315
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,878
What are you doing, Foggy?

316
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,340
I told your girlfriend if you ain't
on the ballot, you can't speak.

317
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:17,552
But the Nelsons are members, too,
and this is an endorsement meeting.

318
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,596
Members can ask questions,
isn't that right?

319
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,890
It ain't gonna change the vote, Foggy.

320
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,684
You're just holding up dessert
and pissing people off.

321
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,022
I apologize to everyone.
This won't take long.

322
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,732
Said every lawyer ever.

323
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,904
We can be long-winded, sure.
But I'm not billing anyone for this.

324
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,492
I'm running my own
write-in campaign for DA.

325
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,118
Most of you know that by now.

326
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,621
I'm not running 'cause I expect to win.

327
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,999
I'm running to hold him accountable.

328
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,210
Debate is the soul of democracy.

329
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,588
So why aren't you talking
about Wilson Fisk?

330
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,465
Are you running for office, Mr. Tower,

331
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,593
or are you running away
from responsibility for his situation?

332
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,429
We've been here before, Mr. Nelson.

333
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,225
Do you still claim to have no influence
over his release from prison

334
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,185
to live among us here in the city again?

335
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,355
The powers of my office
are limited to state law.

336
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,692
Wilson Fisk's situation is
entirely under federal jurisdiction and...

337
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,975
You mean crimes
he's already been sentenced for?

338
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,861
Of course.

339
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:21,616
But you can prosecute for crimes
he's committing right now, can't you?

340
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,742
What crimes?

341
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,829
The man is locked up in FBI custody
24 hours a day.

342
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,915
In a five-star hotel.

343
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,251
Because he made a deal with the feds.

344
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:36,047
Living in luxury as long as he gives up
major underworld figures.

345
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,843
Which Fisk has done, time and again,
making this city safer.

346
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,679
Or making his competition disappear.

347
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,014
That's right.

348
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,687
Wilson Fisk is informing
on carefully-selected targets.

349
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,940
Using the government as his private army

350
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:58,278
to reclaim his position at the center
of this city's criminal underworld.

351
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,362
This is fantasy.

352
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,741
No, it's a harsh reality.

353
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,705
There are government officials
who are controlled by various criminals.

354
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,290
What Wilson Fisk has done

355
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,209
is take all those criminals
and turn them over to the FBI.

356
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,504
And keep all those corrupt officials
for himself.

357
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:23,595
He's planning to turn himself into a
one-stop shop for bribery and protection.

358
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,722
It's all right here.

359
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,182
Mr. Nelson.

360
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,977
As district attorney,
you can't just pander to a crowd.

361
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,771
You have to prove your case.

362
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,773
- I can.
- No, you can't.

363
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,857
My turn.

364
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,320
At your fancy law firm,
what they teach is, "Create a fiction."

365
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,531
What story does a jury need to hear?
Not what facts.

366
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,451
I have been prosecuting for 13 years,

367
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,454
and I can tell you
this is not how criminal law works.

368
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:53,374
Moving speeches impress a crowd,
but they don't stand up in criminal court.

369
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,836
I don't have your experience, Mr. Tower.

370
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,380
It's true. But then again,

371
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,636
I'm not jaded from doing the same thing
for too many years, either.

372
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,555
I'm still passionate
about what the law can do.

373
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,975
And that's a very powerful tool
to work with.

374
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,604
Because when you get beyond the cold facts

375
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,816
and really get worked up
about what you're doing, you can...

376
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,363
Holy shit.

377
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,156
I can't hear you.

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,660
You can do what, Mr. Nelson?
Freeze up in front of a jury?

379
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,759
We'll be watching.

380
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,476
You gotta be kidding me.

381
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,496
Ms. Page.

382
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,384
I must admit, I'm surprised you're here.

383
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,516
I suppose this qualifies as hard time?

384
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,811
Yes, I'm sure all of this
is offensive to you,

385
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,314
given our personal history.

386
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,651
You mean the times
you tried to have me killed?

387
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,488
Crimes for which I'm still paying.

388
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,910
Yes. It's offensive.

389
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,295
Tea?

390
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,715
No, thank you.

391
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,468
I'm not here for tea.

392
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,856
Sit down.

393
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,361
You came for words, at least.

394
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,322
Yeah.

395
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,117
Let's... Let's have some words.

396
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,798
You are not writing
an article about my mother.

397
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,802
I'm not?

398
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,432
I could.

399
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,184
To what end, Ms. Page?

400
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,436
My distress?

401
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,146
Hmm.

402
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,774
Doesn't actually sound that bad,
now that you say it.

403
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:09,195
I do not welcome intrusions
into my privacy.

404
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,489
Yet you invited me in?

405
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:17,578
You worked for Ben Urich, didn't you?

406
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,288
I believe he mentored you.

407
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,332
Yes, before he was murdered.

408
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,962
A final lesson.
One you seem not to have understood.

409
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,464
Is that a threat?

410
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,009
It's an observation.

411
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,263
Well, you're right.

412
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,600
I'm not here to talk about your mother.

413
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,980
I'd rather talk about what she told Ben.

414
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,610
Actually, really,
rather, what she told us.

415
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:56,701
See, I don't think you know,
but I was with him.

416
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,203
It probably wasn't fair.

417
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:04,167
Two trained journalists
working on a feeble old woman like that.

418
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,837
It's easy to push her.

419
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,174
Get her to say things she doesn't want to.

420
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,800
Your point?

421
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,637
She remembered a lot about your childhood.

422
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,267
They say the oldest memories
stick around the longest.

423
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,981
She remembered a lot of little things.
A lot of... embarrassing things.

424
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:32,403
Seems like there were a lot of those,
weren't there, Willie?

425
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,411
I'm sure your readers at the Bulletin
will be as entertained as you are.

426
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,873
No, we would never print those.

427
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,125
We just pass them around the office.

428
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:49,378
How is it around your office?

429
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,717
I heard about your misfortune.

430
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,303
Before it even happened, I'm sure.

431
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,181
No, the story that we will print

432
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,059
is her very detailed description
of your father.

433
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,144
And how you murdered him.

434
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,564
A hammer.

435
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,402
At that age?

436
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,951
Is there any part of you
that isn't broken, I wonder?

437
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,734
You asked me why I let you in.

438
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:59,323
The reason is, Ms. Page,
I have a few questions of my own.

439
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,868
You are a respected journalist,

440
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,247
but at one time you were
merely a secretary at a law firm.

441
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,249
To Matt Murdock, yes?

442
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,458
Office manager.

443
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,587
Intimately involved in his affairs, huh?

444
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,255
His business affairs.

445
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,506
Of course.

446
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,762
Tell me, so at what point did you learn
about Mr. Murdock's secret life?

447
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,061
Yeah.

448
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,105
Thank you.

449
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,691
Thank you, Ms. Page.

450
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,160
Okay.

451
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,163
Okay.

452
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:49,874
You want secrets?

453
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,294
I can tell you a secret, Wilson.

454
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,255
Okay if I call you that? I feel like
we know each other well enough by now.

455
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,174
- As you wish, Karen.
- Great.

456
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,220
James Wesley.

457
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:08,517
What was it like for you
when he disappeared?

458
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,357
Really, it's those first 24 hours
that are the worst, aren't they?

459
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,028
When you call and you call and you call,
and there's just no answer.

460
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,780
It becomes an obsession.

461
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:27,787
The calling. The never-ending loop
of a ghost's voice mail in your ear.

462
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,914
You worry.

463
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,083
You wonder.

464
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,335
You swear, "God damn it,

465
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,420
if he's still living,
I'm gonna kill him myself."

466
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,800
Is that what it was like for you?

467
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,385
Did you rage at him?

468
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,179
'Cause you thought he betrayed you?

469
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,098
Because I wonder
what would be worse for you.

470
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,016
His duplicity or his death?

471
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,649
He died quickly.

472
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,901
If you were wondering.

473
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,529
Didn't suffer much.

474
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:06,784
You see, Wilson, Matt Murdock isn't
the person you should be worried about.

475
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,662
I killed Wesley.

476
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,208
I shot him seven times.

477
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,378
Because the clip ran out.
He deserved more.

478
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,839
Don't move!

479
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,136
What?

480
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,436
What?

481
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,813
Foggy?

482
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,320
Think of it as a compliment.

483
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,530
That they actually thought
I would try to kill him?

484
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,813
- I had to tell them something.
- No, Foggy, you didn't.

485
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,243
You ruined it. I had him.

486
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,829
Had him? Fisk would snap you like a twig.

487
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,497
At least they'd have it on video.

488
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,126
Was that really your plan?

489
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,380
God damn it, Karen.
Don't turn into Matt on me.

490
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,637
Look, I didn't want him to kill me.
Just come after me.

491
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,514
Oh, good.

492
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,518
- Well, I got the idea from you.
- Me?

493
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,896
All that talk about Tower
and catching him off guard,

494
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,149
and I thought, "Yeah,
just get Fisk to stop thinking

495
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,193
and reacting emotionally instead."

496
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,363
I figured you were thinking
something like that.

497
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,865
Not a bad plan, actually.

498
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,868
Except for the part
where you have to hope the FBI comes in

499
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,620
before that monster beats you to death.

500
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,984
Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

501
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,833
How did you even know I was here?

502
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,668
I know you.

503
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,087
When you didn't come...

504
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,883
I thought of some possibilities
and this was my nightmare scenario.

505
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,593
So I pretty much counted on it.

506
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,012
At least I took my shot.

507
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,263
You took a shot.

508
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,266
Tomorrow, there's gonna be
an army shooting back.

509
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,107
The report, for your insurance.

510
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,817
Thank you.

511
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,390
Come with me.

512
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,563
Yeah, yeah, another late one.

513
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:09,693
I know, babe, but they're filing charges
against the Albanians tomorrow,

514
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,238
and I never reviewed my account.

515
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,325
Yeah, I'm not gonna make it home tonight.

516
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,913
Kiss Sami for me.

517
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,291
I love you, too.

518
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,307
Boss.

519
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,975
Nadeem.

520
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,144
Sorry to wake you.

521
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,315
We need to talk.

522
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,706
After you.

523
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,264
This was here the whole time?

524
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,349
Yes.

525
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
We, um...

526
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,482
I have a problem.

527
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,318
Nadeem knows.

528
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,736
I know he does.

529
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,240
We will take care of the problem.

530
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,165
Dex...

531
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,295
rage cannot stay inside.

532
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:22,177
It needs to go somewhere...
or it becomes a poison.

533
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,388
It will kill you from within.

534
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:30,060
I find that when this rage
cannot stay buried in me

535
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,812
for one more second...

536
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:38,986
that a primal scream...
is the only satisfying release.

537
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,865
Yes.

538
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,285
Yeah.

539
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,188
I like making things happen

540
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,398
without anybody knowing
it's me who did it.

541
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,360
Let's do our exercise. Close your eyes.

542
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,862
He didn't have any parents.

543
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,739
I'm digging a hole.

544
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,033
Spent a lot of time fighting.

545
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,836
Buried my anger in the ground.

546
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:28,952
- Good.
- Angry.

547
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,373
- Now cover it with dirt.
- Okay. But, Dr. Mercer?

548
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,361
- Go ahead and say it.
- I want to open the box.

549
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,003
I promised to keep my mouth shut.

550
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,422
- But you want to say it sounds familiar.
- Does it?

551
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,013
I didn't have anyone either,
but I'm nothing like him.

552
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,851
The tapes make it sound
like he was a killer at a young age.

553
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,269
The guy's a psychopath.

554
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,234
And I had a chance today.

555
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,238
A shot to catch him off guard,
and I blew it.

556
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,199
You did what you thought was right.

557
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,118
You kept your word to Agent Nadeem.

558
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
Yeah.

559
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,332
And how many people will die
because of it?

560
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,397
I don't know if I have the strength
to get through this.

561
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,609
He's so stubborn.

562
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,946
Full of fury and foolish pride.

563
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:48,907
Please...

564
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,577
watch over him.

565
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,291
Keep him from making the same
damned mistake that took you from us.

566
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,836
Our son is too much like you, Jack.

567
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,635
Mom?

568
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,137
Mom.

569
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,391
No.
