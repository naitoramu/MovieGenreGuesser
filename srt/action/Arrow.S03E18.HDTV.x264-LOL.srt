162
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:56,498
Can you give us
a minute?

163
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,265
Hi.
Ohh.

164
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,065
Mom!

165
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,399
I heard what happened,
so I caught the first flight out of Vegas!

166
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,601
So tell me,
what did the doctor say?

167
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:15,945
Absolutely
nothing good.

168
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,409
Ok, ok.

169
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:18,745
Hey.

170
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:19,914
What?

171
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,989
At least you finally
have a boyfriend.

172
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,927
Mom!

173
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:32,102
How did you know
I was still in Starling?

174
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,279
Laurel.

175
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,375
I need your help,
Nyssa.

176
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:43,247
Maseo--
is also in Starling.

177
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,287
He's the one behind the murders
the Arrow is suspected of.

178
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,959
Sarab does my father's bidding
in an effort to force you

179
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,791
to do the same and take
your rightful place as his heir.

180
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:53,527
And do you feel betrayed
by that decision?

181
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,759
[Scoffs]

182
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,966
Not so much that I'd betray him
in turn by helping you.

183
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,132
People are dying,
Nyssa!

184
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:04,131
And what makes you think
that's any concern of mine?

185
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,465
Sara.

186
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,638
What would she
want you to do?

187
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,018
I have Maseo's location.

188
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,018
A building called
Magnuson Plaza.

189
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,754
Yeah.

190
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,290
The company that
owns that building

191
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,955
went belly up
a few months back.

192
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,931
Apparently the League
has been using it as a safe house

193
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,163
and staging ground
for its attacks.

194
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,531
How'd you find this out?

195
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,530
I am daughter of the Demon.

196
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:39,434
Your primary concern
should be the League.

197
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,538
You can place Maseo
in the same cage you put me in,

198
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,336
but my father has
an army at his command.

199
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,167
- One step at a time.
- Oliver...

200
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,303
We're going to have
to spread out

201
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:48,942
if we're going to cover
that entire building.

202
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,044
- Dig, I want you on over watch.
- Copy that.

203
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,243
What about her?

204
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:55,811
Don't confuse my inclination
to provide you information

205
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,146
with a willingness to take up arms
against the League.

206
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,545
We appreciate
what you've done.

207
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,983
We'll take it from here.

208
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,619
Let's do this.

209
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,488
We scoped out every floor,
nothing.

210
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,360
Same with
the parking garage.

211

You think Nyssa played us?

214

Hang on,

217
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,182
Clearly I chose well

218
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,212
selecting you as my heir.

219
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:20,548
Killing me will only win you
the mantle you reject.

220
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,852
It'll stop you.

221
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,284
I have legions who live

222
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,420
only to see my will done.

223
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,956
No, boy.

224
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,228
You have but two choices--

225
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,428
you either ascend
to the calling of Ra's al Ghul

226
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,766
or you will spend the rest
of your days in a cage.

227
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,008
You're not going
to take me prisoner.

228
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,872
No, I'm not.

229
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,910
Man on speaker: This is
the Starling City police.

230
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,910
Put your weapons down
and your hands up.

231
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,446
You are all under arrest.

you're in the clear.

they want me. Now go.

His name is Yao Fei.

325
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:42,204
And how do you know
my sister?

326
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:50,110
Oh, uh, medical school.

327
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,877
She never mentioned
any American friends.

328
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,876
You are American,
aren't you?

329
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,212
I dropped out--
of the medical school,

330
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,579
not of America.

331
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:03,048
So when was the last time
you saw my sister?

332
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,353
It's been a while.

333
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,527
For me, too.

334
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:19,362
Shado and my father
disappeared three years ago now.

335
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:23,390
Police think they were kidnapped,
but no ransom came.

336
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,225
I'm so sorry.

337
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:30,925
The police told me
they must be dead.

338
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,921
If they were, at least
I'd have some closure.

339
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:39,190
But each time the phone rings,
someone knocks at the door,

340
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,126
or when I meet someone
who knew them...

341
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,025
I can't imagine.

342
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,821
You must be tired.

343
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:51,162
Not tired, dirty.
I need a shower.

344
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:54,255
My bedroom's through that door.
There are fresh towels.

345
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,158
You're sure?

346
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,094
Yeah.

347
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,534
I'll entertain
your friend.

348
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:05,237
Thank you.

349
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,261
Listen, I'm a cop,
not a psychologist,

350
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:24,792
but in my experiences,
killers don't discriminate

351
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,662
between guilty and innocent.
They kill because

352
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:30,061
they view themselves
as being above the law,

353
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,492
and the Arrow
is no different.

354
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:35,329
He is a criminal.
And I promise you,

355
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,491
we will find him
and hold him accountable.

356
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,011
Ohh.

357
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,363
You ok?

358
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:41,424
Mm-hmm.

359
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,925
Thanks for getting this.

360
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,826
[Sighs] I ran into
Dr. Lockhart in the cafeteria.

361
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:47,856
I thought maybe,
I don't know...

362
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,023
I could talk him into giving Ray
those nano-thingies.

363
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,495
- Nano-tech.
- He wouldn't even look at me.

364
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,694
Have you seen
this dress? Hello!

365
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:54,861
Mom.

366
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:57,501
The man's an idiot.

367
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,099
I guess...

368
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,033
You're just going to
have to be the one

369
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,462
to inject those teeny
tiny robot things into Ray yourself.

370
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:07,395
Great plan,
except I'm not a doctor.

371
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,234
Even Ray said
that they can kill him.

372
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:11,569
I'm not going to be the one
to risk his life, I'm not.

373
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,472
His life
is already at risk.

374
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,367
What you're saying
is that you don't want to be the one

375
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,173
to take the chance.

376
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,700
If your father
were here...

377
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,205
He would be arrested.

378
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,772
Probably.

379
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:26,548
But right before that,
he would tell you that sometimes,

380
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,811
we got to take
a chance,

381
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,946
particularly for the people
we care about.

382
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:39,185
I don't give a damn about budgets.
This is a manhunt!

383
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,258
Now approve the extra personnel
and the overtime,

384
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,026
and you do it now!

385
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:45,161
[Sighs]

386
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,966
[Both grunting]

387
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,270
[Gasping and choking]

388
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,019
I apologize
for the coarse treatment.

389
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:17,083
I didn't think I'd get you to speak
to me of your own accord.

390
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:21,429
[Scoffs] You're him.

391
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:24,998
Ra's al Ghul.
It's an honor to meet you.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,029
Sara spoke with such love
about her father.

393
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,332
Don't say
my daughter's name.

394
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:34,369
If she'd never met you,
she'd still be alive now.

395
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:37,040
If Sara had not
met my daughter,

396
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,273
she would have
starved to death

397
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,977
on the shores
of Lian Yu.

398
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,809
She was never on Lian Yu.

399
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,848
You suffer
false perception.

400
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,112
One of many,
I'm afraid.

401
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,815
[Exhales]

402
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,988
Listen, what do you want?

403
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,925
To help the city
as your daughter did.

404
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,326
You hunt for the man
they call the Arrow.

405
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,998
Yeah.

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,293
What, you going
to help me find him?

407
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:08,336
You'll be able to
find him easily...

408
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,811
Once I tell you
his name.

409
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:15,846
And why would I believe
just any name that you'd throw at me?

410
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:18,655
Well, because with
this revelation,

411
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:22,162
everything
will become clear.

412
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:25,532
And you will realize

413
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,996
the man you've
been looking for

414
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:30,172
has been right in front of you
the entire time.

415
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,204
The same man who lied,

416
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:36,508
telling you he wasn't
with Sara on Lian Yu.

417
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:43,179
Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

418
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,901
We need to talk.

419
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,463
[Exhales] Aren't you getting tired
of these little chats?

420
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:57,830
Because I know I am.

421
00:21:57,832 --> 00:22:00,135
Then let's cut through
all the crap.

422
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:02,272
You don't think the Arrow's
behind these murders.

423
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:04,744
You're just pissed off because he
kept Sara's death a secret from you.

424
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:06,744
That is not why.

425
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:09,312
That is not why!

426
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:12,110
I mean,
maybe at first.

427
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:14,746
Yeah. But then
I realized,

428
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:17,813
he is the reason
Sara got killed.

429
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,180
Dad, that is ridiculous.

430
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:21,040
No. You, Harper, Sara,

431
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,037
the freak in Central
City, the Huntress;

432
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,572
I got a new guy
flying around the city.

433
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,339
All these masks?
They started with him.

434
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,442
And Sara died only
because she was part of it all, too.

435
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:33,378
You have no idea
why Sara was killed.

436
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,786
She ended up
in the League of Assassins

437
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:40,260
'cause she was
marooned on Lian Yu.

438
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:43,028
'Cause she got
in that boat with Queen.

439
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,996
So what?

440
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,565
Now Oliver's to blame?

either way, same guy.

[Sighs] On some level,
I think I always knew.

good, it didn't matter to me.

and we--we thought
Sara was dead,

I blamed Queen.

And it's funny
how things come full circle, right?

Well, I got
things to do.

I'm thinking of starting

have brain damage.

Yeah.

Speaking of, you must be starving
after all that drama.

648
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,518
I'm going to go find
a hospital nurse

Uh-uh-uh-uh.

You look the way you did when you
were seven years old

655
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,394
and stole your father's electronics
collection to make a super computer.

Oh, my God.

Did you and Ray
just do it in this hospital?

- Did you just have hospital sex?!
- No! Oh!

659
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:49,600
I've always wanted to have
hospital sex!

660
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:51,400
Way TMI! Gross!

661
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,600
What?

662

He told me he loved me.

Ohh.

And you didn't
say it back?

What is wrong
with me?

He's brilliant.

668
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,286
He knows the plot
to every "Doctor Who" episode.

All 34 seasons.

670
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:13,053
He looks like
a Disney prince.

671
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,716
I mean, he's...

672

practically
the perfect man.

You don't love Ray...

674

because you're in love
with Oliver.

[Scoffs] You don't
even know Oliver.

676
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:29,132
You met him for
like ten seconds.

677
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,603
I knew it in five.

678
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:33,467
Honey, you lit up
like Christmas

679
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,037
when he walked in the room.

680
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,781
But he's...
terminally unavailable.

681
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,477
And that was before.

682
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,212
You haven't been
watching the news.

683
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,988
No, no, no, I don't
watch the news, it depresses me.

684
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,884
But here's what doesn't--
my daughter

685
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:50,587
has two men
who are both amazing,

686
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:52,787
which just means...

687
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,362
She has to make a choice.

688
00:33:57,091 --> 00:34:00,592
I want pictures of Queen
distributed through every officer, ok?

689
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:04,199
No, a current one, one with
the scruff he's always wearing.

Oliver: Captain Lance...

I'm here to turn myself in.

Cuff him.

693

Ok, I was able to get you
ten minutes with Oliver,

694
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,239
but let's make it five,
all right?

695
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,672
It would not look good
if any of these reporters

696
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:41,744
caught wind of you
meeting with him.

697
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:50,461
Him, and the three of you?

698
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:53,926
Makes sense.

You shouldn't
be here.

Oliver, neither
should you.

702
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:12,720
What were you thinking?
Were you thinking?!

703
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:14,247
I was thinking
clearly.

704
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,888
I asked Laurel to make a deal--
I turn myself in

705
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,561
and all of you
receive full immunity.

706
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:22,097
No, Oliver.
You are out of your mind

707
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,626
if you think we're just
going to stand here

708
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,563
and let you take the fall
for all of us.

709
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,204
I started
all of this.

710
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,004
It's my fault to take,

711
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,838
and this is the best
way to save lives,

712

including yours.

713
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,816
So stop worrying.
I've been through

714
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:39,652
- far worse than prison.
- This is insane.

715
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,893
How could we live with ourselves
if we let you do this?

Roy, I'm just going
to need you to!

717

The only move that
Ra's has left me

718
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:51,667
is telling
the truth.

how powerful
the truth can be.

the wrong move!

to follow me just
a little further.

They weren't

00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:48,203
You spent a year making me
look like a fool.

807
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:50,699
You spent a year
making me your accomplice.

808
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,034
You have any idea
what you've done, huh?

809
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,369
What you've done to all of us,

810
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,976
to the people you claim
to care so much about?

811
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:59,343
You've made us criminals!

812
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:02,742
You've made us
liars and victims.

813
00:41:02,744 --> 00:41:06,980
You, Mr. Queen,
are not a hero.

814
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,483
You're a villain.

815
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,284
But you know that,
don't you?

816
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:13,956
[Arrow hits van,
brakes squealing]

817
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,989
What the hell
are your people doing?

818
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:17,694
I told them
to stand down.

819
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,261
Well, I guess your word carries
as much weight with them

820
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:21,324
as it does with me.

821
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,429
Get down on the ground!

822
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:28,470
Get down on the ground!

823
00:41:28,472 --> 00:41:31,638
You've got
the wrong guy.

824
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,479
Oliver Queen
isn't the Arrow.

825
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,961
I am.

826
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:47,966

828
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,231
Greg!
Move you head.
