1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,830
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,631
Last night, a group of vigilantes
saved hundreds of lives.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,258
So if we are going to decide
on diverting police resources

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,426
towards stopping them,

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,677
we are not going to do that until
the people of Star City have spoken.

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,218
<i>How the public will decide</i>

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,052
<i>on the issue of vigilantism
is anyone's guess.</i>

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,353
Mayor Queen didn't mention
he was under investigation.

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,431
- Of course he did.
- Which makes us overdue for a chat.

10
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,980
- I'm not the man you think I am.
- No, Mr. Queen, I think you are.

11
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,487
I was able to upload
a critical piece of code

12
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,156
- to Arclight.
- What happens now?

13
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,609
We take the next step.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,703
- Thanks very much, guys.
- Thank you.

15
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,788
That's very generous of you.
Thank you, buddy.

16
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,793
- All right.
- Oh, cranberry sauce.

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,547
- Okay. Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
- Awesome. Happy Thanksgiving.

18
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,253
Nice turnout. You're having fun?

19
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,088
Yeah. I'm really glad we're doing this.

20
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,765
Me too, buddy, me too.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,098
Hey, how do you think Felicity's doing?

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,350
Uh, you should go save her.

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,559
Can you comment on speculation
Mayor Queen converted

24
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,646
Councilwoman Pollard's bill
into a city-wide referendum

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,857
as a distraction from speculation
that he's the Green Arrow?

26
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,318
If I was dating the Green Arrow,
I think I would know.

27
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,404
Besides, the Flash
is much more my type.

28
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,368
Sam, she's a civilian,

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,414
- just give her a little space, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,455
How is it that you don't put an arrow
into one of those people?

31
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,499
- Hey.
- Oh, did Oliver save you?

32
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,461
- He is heroic that way.
- She was doing just fine on her own.

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,799
All right, listen, we're all set inside.

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,471
Rene, he's a complete pain in the ass,

35
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,969
but he's a very good advanceman.

36
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,223
- Detective, what's the tally?
- Um, I got it all here.

37
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,226
Good. Good. All right, listen,
everybody, please gather around.

38
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,979
Gather around. Mayor Queen will be
making an announcement

39
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,903
and then we will be touring the site
of the new SCPD headquarters.

40
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,906
Thank you so much

41
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,158
for being here today, guys.

42
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,821
It means a ton to Felicity,

43
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,205
to William, to myself, that

44
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,829
we can all gather together as a city,

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,707
and help our neediest neighbors
on Thanksgiving.

46
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,623
Across these various food drives,
with your help,

47
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,459
the SCPD has collected enough food

48
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,004
to feed over 1,200 families.

49
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,344
And it is why I am incredibly proud

50
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,222
to be here today at
the unveiling of our new precinct.

51
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,516
A top-of-the-line facility

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,726
for a top-of-the-line police force.

53
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,445
One that might actually make
federal agencies jealous.

54
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,654
Are you here
to tour our new headquarters?

55
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,072
Turn around.

56
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,747
- You're doing this here?
- Oliver Queen, you're under arrest.

57
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,164
On what charges?

58
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,997
Murder, assault,
burglary, and kidnapping.

59
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,917
All stemming from your activity
as the Green Arrow.

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,381
Dad?

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,342
It's gonna be fine, buddy. I promise.

62
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,923
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

63
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,256
<i>Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.</i>

64
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,182
Okay. The Mayor's about to
come in, press in tow.

65
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,559
You'll give the formal salute,
he'll say a few words and...

66
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,562
I want this man processed

67
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,360
and I'm gonna need
an interrogation room.

68
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,529
- This is the Mayor. You can't...
- I'm a Federal Agent,

69
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,981
with a valid arrest warrant.

70
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,907
I want this man bound over
until arraignment.

71
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,531
- Yes, but you are federal. This is...
- Temporary holding request.

72
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,578
I'm gonna need
the ranking lieutenant to sign off.

73
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,874
- Then get him here.
- I'm the ranking lieutenant.

74
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,002
Can I expect my prisoner
to be here when I come back for him?

75
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,622
Could you process the Mayor
through booking, Joe?

76
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,044
<i>Joe?</i>

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,026
You did this in front of my son.

78
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,575
In front of my son!

79
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:14,081
Agent Watson, when I get out of here,
and I will,

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,964
I'm going to sue you
for malicious prosecution.

81
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,333
Express yourself. In the meantime,

82
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,794
you're being prosecuted
for multiple felonies.

83
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,338
You show up after five years

84
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,173
and the hood just "happens to"
show up with you?

85
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,967
That was Roy Harper.

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,517
Wearing the hood at your instruction.

87
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,355
Same way John Diggle's been doing
since I started my investigation.

88
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,432
<i>I've got more than you think I have.</i>

89
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,235
A confession will make this easier
on all of us.

90
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,980
I'd like to see William.

91
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,899
You're not in a position
to make demands.

92
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,950
I demand to see William.

93
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,530
Until then, you get nothing.

94
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,964
You said you weren't
the Green Arrow anymore.

95
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,092
I am not the Green Arrow anymore.

96
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,341
Even the FBI would agree
with me there.

97
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,173
I've kept my promise to you.

98
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,257
You're in jail.

99
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,435
I'll get out of here
as soon as I possibly can.

100
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,811
For now, go home with Felicity
and Raisa will be there

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,938
and I will be there just as soon as
I can. Okay? I just...

102
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,401
I need you to be as strong
as I know you can be.

103
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,282
Okay, buddy?

104
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,451
Come here.

105
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,001
Okay. This is gonna sting.
And by sting, I mean hurt really bad.

106
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,624
Okay, well,
as long as it will stop this.

107
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,546
Well, I can't say 100% that it will.

108
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,625
This is a prototype that
Felicity and I have been developing

109
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,380
to mass-produce her spinal implant.

110
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,841
Spinal as in not sure
if it will work for your issue,

111
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,344
prototype as in, well, prototype.

112
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,470
Let's do this.

113
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,977
Took Felicity's a while to work.

114
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,232
Hey, you guys need to see this.

115
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:12,036
Watson just arrested Oliver in front
of basically the entire world.

116
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,239
...<i>a lot
to be thankful for this holiday season.</i>

117
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,666
<i>At the Thanksgiving food drive this
morning, the FBI arrested Mayor Queen...</i>

118
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,914
- That son of a bitch.
- Pretty much. Yeah.

119
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,629
Did she just do all this now

120
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,251
because she just got through
talking to all of us?

121
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,631
Sorry, she didn't talk to all of us,
she actually never talked to me.

122
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,046
If you've got FOMO about being
interrogated, don't worry.

123
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,598
Think you won't miss out
when we all get arrested.

124
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,266
I actually think we're all
in the clear for now.

125
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,593
No, because cops arrest

126
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,768
up the food chain
in criminal enterprises,

127
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,437
not to say that we're
criminal enterprises.

128
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,480
They don't arrest
the kingpin and his underlings,

129
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,604
they arrest the underlings first.

130
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,855
That's how it works.

131
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,278
I've seen every episode
of <i>The Closer</i>. Twice.

132
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,277
Well, I'm a real life cop
and I observed Oliver's interrogation

133
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,699
and it didn't sound like
we were targets.

134
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,117
That's enough.

135
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,487
We have to focus.

136
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,782
This might be the most difficult
thing we've ever had to face.

137
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,452
If the people think
that the Green Arrow's in prison,

138
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,752
then the floodgates will open.

139
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,418
Now, more than ever,
we have to protect this city.

140
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,043
<i>If the criminals here think
that it's open season,</i>

141
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,424
then this city will become a war zone.

142
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,509
You got us in here so easily.

143
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,560
I didn't have a chance
to kill anybody.

144
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,098
Well, homicide is not
our objective here, Miss Lance.

145
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,558
Two guards inside.

146
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,939
<i>What's the holdup?</i>

147
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,321
Your generation is so impatient.

148
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,400
Why can't you just
savor the anticipation?

149
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,367
Cry havoc and let slip
the dogs of war, Miss Lance.

150
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,834
That was a literary epigram,
Miss Lance, not a directive.

151
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,293
Potato, po-tah-toe.

152
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,629
Now, what am I looking for?

153
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,383
The nano-thermite device is inside
the containment unit at the far end.

154
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,059
They do not have the keys.

155
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,398
- Wait.
- Why?

156
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,268
And don't say
"Savor the anticipation."

157
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,400
Nano-thermite is highly explosive.
Your scream will detonate...

158
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,495
You do see how that
could've gone wrong. Yes?

159
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,042
Yes. But it didn't.

160
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,980
- Tell me what you need.
- I need some sleep.

161
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,190
I think I can do one better.

162
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,905
<i>FBI transfers can get lost.</i>

163
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,037
- Locks can be left open.
- I appreciate that.

164
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,826
But if I make myself a fugitive,
then,

165
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,500
obviously I'm making
William an orphan.

166
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,382
- You got to do it the right way.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,965
- I got to do it the right way.
- Okay.

168
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,298
Good night.

169
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,607
Hand's feeling a bit better.

170
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,610
What you got?

171
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,865
There was a break-in last night
at Sunderland Corp.

172
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,412
Why didn't we get an alert?

173
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,535
Felicity has us wired...

174
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,242
Up the wazoo. I know.
Trying to figure it out.

175
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,669
We're basically
the Big Brother of Star City.

176
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,750
Not in a creepy way.

177
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,923
<i>Okay. This makes more sense now.</i>

178
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,295
Laurel.

179
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,096
Yeah, who works with Cayden James,

180
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,472
who can hack any security system
to bypass any alerts, such as ours.

181
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,551
What did they steal?

182
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,646
Nano-thermite. It's a metastable
intermolecular composite.

183
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,646
A reactive particle, you know,
like mint inside a soda?

184
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,324
Alone, harmless. But together,
kaboom, as in kill lots of people,

185
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,863
not spill grape juice
all over your clothes...

186
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,237
What are they targeting, Curtis?

187
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,696
I don't know.

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,873
Nano-thermite needs to be combined
in order to be combustible,

189
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,076
but once it is, there are
many, many, many possibilities.

190
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,378
- Can you narrow it down?
- No. But Felicity might be able to.

191
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,251
Hey, talk fast. Oliver's arraignment
is in two minutes.

192
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,043
Laurel and Cayden James
got their hands on

193
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,595
a mess of nano-thermite last night.

194
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,092
That means they'll be in the market
for an accelerant.

195
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,390
Yeah, what kind of accelerant?
That's a really long list.

196
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,597
The nano-thermite heist,
did it involve a computer hack?

197
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,054
It involved Cayden James,
so what do you think?

198
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,605
I think that you can back-trace
his hack,

199
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,807
maybe you can get into his system.

200
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,890
Can you come back and do this?

201
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,146
Because you're like,
way better at this than I am.

202
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,226
I got to go.

203
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,405
- Hey.
<i>- Mr. Mayor?</i>

204
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,115
Sam? I didn't realize
you were joining my defense.

205
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,824
- Can a city district attorney...
- He can't. And I'm not.

206
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,743
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor. But considering
that the charges against you

207
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,669
stem from actions taken
within this city...

208
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,922
Is the FBI handing you the case?

209
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,420
Sorry, Oliver.

210
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,638
All rise!

211
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,760
Docket Q-R-2-8-6-1,
<i>State vs Oliver Queen.</i>

212
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,311
<i>Judge McGarvey presiding.</i>

213
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,651
I understand the defense have waived

214
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,524
the reading of charges
in favor of a motion?

215
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,687
Yes, Your Honor.

216
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,653
Defense moves to dismiss
for lack of probable cause.

217
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,244
The photograph with the defendant
wearing the Green Arrow outfit

218
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,616
was debunked a month ago.

219
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,072
We're not relying on that photo.

220
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,493
The FBI has provided definitive proof
that Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

221
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,953
Then let's see it.

222
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,539
Show my whole card during
an arraignment? I don't think so.

223
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,463
Sorry, Miss Loring, but
we're not skipping over steps here.

224
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,302
But good for you, I'm gonna release
the defendant on bail.

225
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,800
Your Honor, the defendant faces
seven counts of murder.

226
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,848
And he's the Mayor
and sole parent of a minor.

227
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,683
<i>Something tells me
he's not going anywhere.</i>

228
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,346
Particularly not with a $5 million bail

229
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,101
<i>and a $500,000 bond.</i>

230
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,608
We're gonna ask for an accelerated
docket and an early trial date.

231
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,318
Please tell William not to worry.

232
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,118
You tell him yourself
when you get home.

233
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,071
I'm sorry, do you have
half a million dollars lying around?

234
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,827
- Actually I do.
- What?

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,332
The first round
of the angel investment

236
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,829
for Curtis' and my start-up
came through.

237
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,333
- No. I can't let you do that.
- I can't let you not let me.

238
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,713
That is so not fair.

239
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,596
It's not supposed to be fair.
But thanks to you,

240
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,932
I might be able to keep my job.

241
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,226
- No tremor?
- Almost gone.

242
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,608
You're a genius, Curtis.

243
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,602
I bet you say that to
all the geniuses.

244
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,692
- What's that?
- Hacker tracker.

245
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,071
Our friend Cayden just infiltrated
security at AmerTek,

246
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,530
which, as it happens,

247
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,206
has 20 different possible accelerants

248
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,034
<i>that could combine and cause,
well, lots of damage.</i>

249
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,253
Wanna say it?

250
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,919
Call in the team. And suit up.

251
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,257
What's this I'm hearing
about Watson having a smoking gun?

252
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,428
She gave it to D.A. Armand.

253
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,719
Yeah, we need to find out what kind
of ammunition they work with.

254
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,018
No, no, no. I'm not risking
Felicity hacking the FBI.

255
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,094
Ooh, too late, also, too little.

256
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,020
Whatever information they have,
they're keeping it offline.

257
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,269
Well, I can check around the SCPD,
see if anybody's heard anything.

258
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,527
Good. Quentin, let's see if
whatever it is came from City Hall.

259
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,689
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Been a while
since I used my detective skills.

260
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,193
You know, on the plus side,
you getting arrested

261
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,741
has done wonders
for your approval ratings.

262
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,363
Yeah, and it's had
the opposite effect

263
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,990
on the anti-vigilante referendum too.

264
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,491
There's a silver lining.

265
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,703
Oh, we got to go. Well, us. Not you.

266
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,877
There's a bad guy or girl
who's breaking into AmerTek.

267
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,292
I'm assuming all those squirelly looks

268
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,877
mean that the girl in question is, what,

269
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,805
- Laurel's evil twin?
- She's working with Cayden James,

270
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,803
a criminal we've been tracking
for some time.

271
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,348
I have been wrestling over
whether or not to tell you.

272
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,557
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

273
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,683
'Cause I don't want anything more
to do with her.

274
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,351
Well, Quentin, now that you know...

275
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,482
I will distract myself clearing
your good name.

276
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,535
Wow. What a warm welcome.
You really know how to treat a girl.

277
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,077
'Tis the season.

278
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,960
I suggest keeping
your lovely singing to a minimum.

279
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,545
There are over a dozen highly
reactive compounds in this facility.

280
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,004
No promises.

281
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,179
Sitrep.

282
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,893
Okay, you got four turkeys
near the entrance and

283
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,940
five more stuffed in on the floor.
All puns intended.

284
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,359
Your window to move is now.

285
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,731
Copy that.

286
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,813
Me and Terrific have
the guys on the left,

287
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,443
you two, the guys on the right.
Move out. Go.

288
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,735
Arrow.

289
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,525
John, what the hell's going on?

290
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,947
- I'm okay.
- No, he's not.

291
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,403
We need to get you out of here. Now!

292
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,238
No. You need to stop Laurel.

293
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,653
Go.

294
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:57,913
Go! Now! Go!

295
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,126
Merry men are approaching
your position.

296
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,176
Robin Hood is laying back
for some reason.

297
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,819
Take cover.

298
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,659
Our objective here
is the package, Miss Lance.

299
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,140
Digg's been keeping this
a secret for months?

300
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,768
With some kind of drugs?

301
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,484
And he told you guys.
And he didn't loop me in?

302
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,064
It was right
when Oliver got home from Kasnia.

303
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,615
And he figured he'd be okay

304
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,818
after Curtis hooked him up
with that prototype thingy.

305
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,406
What prototype thingy?

306
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,288
You might have to ask him.

307
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,001
Hey, speaking of, any word
from Curtis on Digg's condition?

308
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,077
Stable.

309
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,079
They're running tests.

310
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,957
Feels wrong us not being
at the hospital with him.

311
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,964
All of us showing up in his room
right now is the last thing we need.

312
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,045
Well, Digg needs to get back
on his feet pronto.

313
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,552
'Cause we did not exactly
shine out there without him.

314
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,846
What did Laurel steal this time?

315
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,687
Only 100 pounds
of polymer-bonded explosives.

316
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,356
When combined
with the nano-thermite...

317
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:52,027
Well, actually, I don't know
what happens when they combine.

318
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,441
It'll take a little time
for this blood work to come back.

319
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,027
But if I had to guess,
you're suffering withdrawal

320
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,532
from the drug you've been taking,

321
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,450
in combination with
Mr. Holt's experimental treatment.

322
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,535
Is he gonna be okay?

323
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,496
I'll know more once
Mr. Diggle's panels come back.

324
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,798
Thank you, Doctor.

325
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,339
I should have ran
a mountain of tests on you

326
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,890
before injecting you
with that prototype.

327
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,097
It was my choice.
Don't beat yourself up, Curtis.

328
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,054
<i>Felicity.</i>

329
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,396
We have a problem.
We have a massively huge problem

330
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,944
and considering it's in the same week
Oliver's been arrested.

331
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,317
- What is it?
<i>- The nano-thermite,</i>

332
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,615
when combined with the explosive,
creates a thermobaric weapon.

333
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,067
What's a thermobaric weapon?

334
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,362
It disperses what is essentially
a cloud of fire

335
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,243
and then pressure cooks everything
within 200 yards.

336
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,037
I'm guessing we're giving up hope

337
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,744
that Cayden James has to cook
a lot of turkeys for Thanksgiving.

338
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,246
<i>The only good news is that</i>

339
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,582
a thermobaric bomb
is extremely difficult to make.

340
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,509
Yeah. Well, Cayden James could do it,
given his history.

341
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,837
He'll probably detonate it
in a populated area.

342
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,171
Maximize casualties.

343
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,966
Go help Felicity. See if you can
find out where's he's targeting.

344
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,220
<i>Hey, John.</i>

345
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,682
I just heard about
what's been going on with you. And...

346
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,435
I'm really sorry
you've been dealing with this.

347
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,728
Thank you, Felicity.

348
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,943
- Have you told Oliver?
- No.

349
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,865
Really think
that you should tell him.

350
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,702
Look, he just got arrested. I don't
want to add anything to his plate.

351
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,198
John, I think
he'd really want to know.

352
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,617
Not this week.

353
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,001
Thanksgiving Day.
There's a million events going on.

354
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,048
I mean, if you're Cayden James,
what do you target?

355
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,302
- Soup kitchens, parade?
- Door-buster sales.

356
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,297
That's where my mom took me.

357
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,052
Cayden wouldn't guess.
He would be logical, be calculating.

358
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,594
Calculating.

359
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,269
I saw one of his algorithms at Helix
that's based on traffic patterns

360
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,601
and can extrapolate to predict
population movements.

361
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,402
- Maybe if I can recreate it...
- I'm here.

362
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,275
What can I do to help?

363
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,822
You can start by telling me
what prototype

364
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,649
you used to treat John's condition.

365
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,033
Our prototype.

366
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,654
The one we've been developing
to cure paralysis.

367
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,699
You injected our friend with
our company's proprietary technology

368
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,454
and you didn't think to,
I don't know,

369
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,084
involve me in that at all?

370
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,411
I thought Lone Ranger
was just the way

371
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,996
we did things here at Helix Dynamics.

372
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,083
You know, the name of the company
you picked without consulting me?

373
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,341
I'm gonna work
on an algorithm over there

374
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,549
when I figure out
what an algorithm is.

375
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,394
I can't believe you just equated
a company name

376
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,846
to exposing a friend of ours

377
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,808
to an untested procedure,
one you still haven't told me about.

378
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,767
It's the prototype
of your spinal implant.

379
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,104
Well, mine, seeing as how
I'm the one who invented it.

380
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,813
Which is why
I probably don't understand

381
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,648
how you get to be so offended here.

382
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,326
Okay. We don't have time
for this right now.

383
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,906
You should cross-reference
the crowds patterns

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,083
with the bomb's path of destruction.

385
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,378
I'll work on a particle cloud sim.

386
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,958
Could've just told me
you didn't like the name.

387
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,544
It's more than just the name, Felicity.

388
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,801
You picked the product we're making,
we're working out of your loft.

389
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,340
That's called being decisive,
taking initiative.

390
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,595
I didn't do anything in secret.

391
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,892
Can we, maybe, fight about this

392
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,935
when we don't have
a thermobaric bomb to stop?

393
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,226
You don't have to ask me
to do anything,

394
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,558
because that's how
you and I work together.

395
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,903
It's done. Let's hope it works.

396
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,787
I told Felicity
not to bother you with this.

397
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,120
Which part?

398
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,083
You being in the hospital?

399
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,465
The experimental steroid or...

400
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,045
The nerve damage

401
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,427
that has affected you for months?

402
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,761
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I'll be fine.

403
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,772
I didn't want you to worry, Oliver,
which is why I didn't tell you.

404
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,645
No, no. John, you didn't tell me

405
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,687
because you knew I'd never let you
go out there compromised.

406
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,402
And that I'd certainly never let you
compromise the team.

407
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,990
I've been mad at you before,
John, this is...

408
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,250
The first time
I've ever been disappointed.

409
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,376
Oliver, you gave up
the right to judge me

410
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,670
when you gave up that hood.

411
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,998
You don't get to claim the moral
high ground here, my friend.

412
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,503
I'm not, Oliver.

413
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,469
But I apologize to the people
who I endanger.

414
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,717
The team, Oliver.

415
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,383
The team.

416
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,598
My obligation begins
and ends with them.

417
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,021
I don't owe you a damn thing.

418
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,149
For the sake of our friendship,
I hope that's withdrawal talking.

419
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,821
I put on this hood
because you asked me to.

420
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,449
- Don't blame me for this.
- I'm not blaming you, Oliver.

421
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,322
I blame myself.

422
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,962
For putting your needs, your goals,
even your family above my own.

423
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,875
I've done that
from the very beginning.

424
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,926
- That was my biggest mistake.
<i>- That was your biggest mistake?</i>

425
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,922
Mine was trusting you
to be the Green Arrow.

426
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,322
Hey, Speedy.

427
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,285
I miss you.

428
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,535
I miss chatting.

429
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,829
They say that

430
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,249
people in comas can hear

431
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,006
other people talking to them.

432
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,972
<i>If you can hear me,</i>

433
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,383
<i>just wake up, all right?</i>

434
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,552
Please.

435
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,389
'Cause I need you now.

436
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,825
Should we order
our traditional Thanksgiving meal?

437
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,028
I can call Big Belly Burger.

438
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,363
I'm gonna crush my french fries,
and pretend they're mashed potatoes.

439
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,992
Got it.

440
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,500
Maximum damage for a thermobaric bomb
is Starling Stadium.

441
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,830
Today is Thanksgiving.

442
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,836
Yeah. We just covered that
when we talked about

443
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,383
ordering turkey burgers.

444
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,464
I'm saying Billy Joel
is playing there tonight.

445
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,761
Sold-out crowd.

446
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,426
I happen to like
a wide variety of music

447
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,352
and <i>The Stranger</i> is a treasured
piece of rock and roll history. Yeah.

448
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,519
Starling Stadium seats 35,000 people.

449
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:45,228
Guess that sold-out crowd's gonna
get pressure cooked today.

450
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,063
So how do we go in without Diggle?

451
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,193
We have to step it up.
Fight without him.

452
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,986
Yeah, 'cause that went really well
at AmerTek.

453
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,567
We got four hours until showtime.

454
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,944
That's definitely the place,
because Cayden

455
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,525
already has control over the system.

456
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,202
What can we do about shutting it down
or cutting the power or something?

457
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,449
Tried that, didn't work.

458
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,997
That's how I know Cayden
has me locked out of the grid.

459
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,575
I know the saying goes "The show
must go on," but this can't.

460
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,205
I might be able to help with that.

461
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,422
I'll declare a state of emergency
and they will cancel the concert.

462
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,423
- Did you talk to John?
- John and I spoke.

463
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,676
Wanted to apologize to everyone.

464
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,342
I didn't know
about John's injury and...

465
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,300
I should have.

466
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,643
I will have them
shut down the concert.

467
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,641
I wanted to see Billy Joel.

468
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,401
Like I said on the phone, Mr. Mayor,
I'm not canceling.

469
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,030
The cost would be catastrophic.

470
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,066
So would a terrorist attack.

471
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,696
You have no actionable intelligence

472
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,778
or confirmation from law enforcement.

473
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,077
You're asking me to set a match
to millions of dollars on a hunch?

474
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,035
Have you even
brought this to Mr. Joel?

475
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,369
Brought what?

476
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,628
You haven't given me
anything substantive.

477
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,456
I'm trying to save lives.

478
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,416
You're trying to save your ass.

479
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,469
You give me some proof, something
more than your gut to go on,

480
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,970
and I'll cancel. But without it,
we open the gates at 7:00 p.m.

481
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,303
Oh, come on.

482
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,936
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why're you asking?

483
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,192
- 'Cause you don't look it.
- Well...

484
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,314
Well, I get it.

485
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,361
No one wants to believe
someone that they care about

486
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,690
is capable of unspeakable things.
I've been there.

487
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,570
Oh, yeah?

488
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,036
Has your daughter's
otherworldly doppelganger

489
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,658
been on a murder spree lately, Dinah?

490
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,116
Not exactly. No.

491
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,210
But I did find out my ex-boyfriend
is a vigilante.

492
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,504
What, the guy in the ski goggles?

493
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,966
I never thought in a million years
that he had it in him.

494
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,836
And ever since I found out,

495
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,838
I've been trying to reconcile

496
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,174
the man that I loved
with the monster he is now.

497
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,929
Um...

498
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,852
I'm sorry.

499
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:51,982
Um...

500
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,981
Last month when

501
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,856
Laurel attacked the bunker,
I had a chance to stop her.

502
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,988
- What?
- Yeah.

503
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,237
I had a gun on her,

504
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,576
but I couldn't pull the trigger.

505
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,451
<i>Not like I did on Lian Yu.</i>

506
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,504
The point being all those people that
she's been killing you told me about,

507
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,501
they're on me.

508
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,800
That's not anywhere close to true.

509
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,882
Why're you saying that?

510
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,011
I'm hoping it.

511
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,436
Because I had a chance to stop Vince

512
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,477
and I let him go too.

513
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,480
We're good people, Quentin.

514
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,698
And we see the best
in the people we care about.

515
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:46,030
And I, for one, am not ready
to believe that that's a bad thing.

516
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,797
Come back for Round Two?

517
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,465
No. No.

518
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,837
Back to apologize.

519
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,598
You said you put
my family in front of yours.

520
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,684
You did.

521
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,639
Then I asked you to put on the hood
to make things better with my son.

522
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:12,768
And I...

523
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,484
I didn't give
proper consideration to yours.

524
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,855
I'm truly sorry.

525
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,948
I was thinking about William today,
a lot,

526
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,830
you getting arrested in front of him.

527
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,165
- How's he doing?
- Oh, he's fine.

528
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,629
He's a tough kid.

529
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,462
But he is very grateful

530
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,719
and thankful that
you are the Green Arrow,

531
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,597
so I don't have to be.

532
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,635
Don't know how much longer
I can keep doing that.

533
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,636
Especially in the short term.

534
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,391
You get your test results back?

535
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,398
Yeah.

536
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,739
The nerve damage
in my arm spread to my back,

537
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,243
and because of the steroid use,
I caused permanent damage.

538
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,447
If I continue out in the field,
I could end up paralyzed.

539
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,826
John,

540
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,660
I really wish you hadn't
have gone to these lengths for me.

541
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,213
Well, now it's my turn
to apologize to you.

542
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,921
I should have never said
that I was doing it for you.

543
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,255
Remember last year,
when the Dominators

544
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,679
put us into this
"alternate" Star City?

545
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,969
Yeah. Kind of difficult to forget.

546
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,183
We got to see what our

547
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,273
perfect life would be.

548
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,403
Mine was being the Green Arrow.

549
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,948
So you asking me to take the mantle

550
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,568
was not selfish,

551
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,781
it was giving me the one thing in
the world that I never knew I wanted.

552
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:55,992
Well...

553
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:01,089
Felicity thinks that Cayden James
is going after Starling Stadium.

554
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,216
It's gonna be 35,000 people
there tonight.

555
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,136
- You're the Mayor. Shut it down.
- I tried.

556
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,508
Getting arrested is not doing
a lot for my credibility.

557
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,473
What're you gonna do?

558
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,148
I've been working
on a probable location

559
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,693
for Cayden's thermobaric bomb,
but Starling Stadium, it's massive.

560
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,149
We'll have to split up.

561
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,821
Still, who's gonna be calling
the plays out there?

562
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,148
I vote Dinah.

563
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,194
She has the least field experience
of the three of us. No offense.

564
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,495
She has superpowers, tactical
training, and police experience.

565
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:33,992
It's all right, Felicity.
It's all right.

566
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,415
We just cannot have a repeat
of what happened at AmerTek.

567
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,993
Anybody have any suggestions
on how we do that?

568
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,084
I have a suggestion or two.

569
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,317
Overwatch, we're on site.

570
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,861
Any luck locating the bomb?

571
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,154
I'm running a code to find

572
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,079
the building's weakest
architectural joints,

573
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,158
targets of opportunity. So, stand by.

574
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,039
And I'm still trying to get into
the venue's security system,

575
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,665
but Cayden has me frozen out.

576
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,718
Couldn't we pull the alarm here
and evacuate stadium that way?

577
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,671
I'll do it.
Can't risk the SCPD

578
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:32,755
spotting you as the Green Arrow.

579
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,845
I have Overwatch running
interference for me on that.

580
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,431
If there's a cop near you,
you'll be the first to know about it.

581
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,641
Still, better safe than sorry.

582
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,228
Now we're gonna get the closed circuit

583
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,607
<i>Now we're gonna get the Top 40</i>

584
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,033
The bomb is definitely down there.
I'm locking in on it.

585
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,531
About 400 feet up, down corridor 52.

586
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,871
Overwatch,

587
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,793
<i>I see the fire alarm,</i>

588
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,715
but I'm not gonna pull it
like I did in high school.

589
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,343
I'm not seeing you
on any security cams

590
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,424
near an alarm box. How did you...

591
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,426
A magician never reveals
his secret, hoss-ette.

592
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,969
False alarm, everyone. False alarm.

593
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,679
Go back to your seats.
Everything's okay.

594
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,849
The cops aren't letting anyone
out these doors.

595
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,564
That doesn't make any sense,
they can't know it's a false alarm.

596
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,152
Then let's remove any doubt.

597
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,028
Everybody, get the hell out of here.

598
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,075
The police have locked all the doors.

599
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,661
- Why would cops do that?
- Because they're not cops.

600
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,242
Put your damn hands up.

601
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:47,001
Easy, I'm just a fan in a mask.

602
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,628
Overwatch, what's happening?

603
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,882
All you need to know is that there's
no SCPD or FBI folks near you.

604
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,010
Just focus on the bomb. You're, like,
super close, like, 50 yards.

605
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,682
Guys, a little help here.

606
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,892
Terrific, Canary, go.

607
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,600
Make this easy on yourself.

608
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,648
It's cool, hoss.

609
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,987
Overwatch, I'm at the device.

610
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,871
The wiring's all wrong
on the thermobar.

611
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,414
That's not a bomb at all. That's a...

612
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,200
Decoy.

613
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:26,915
Get down!

614
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,253
- You're welcome.
- She did all the work.

615
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,171
I know what you're thinking.

616
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,556
Where's the horrifically huge bomb?

617
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,682
This is going to be
an incredibly insightful evening.

618
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,020
Where is it?

619
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,308
No need to play nice.
Those jerkwads aren't cops.

620
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,484
Get those fans out of there.

621
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,027
Where is it?

622
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,154
Your generation is so impatient.

623
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,659
Why can't you just
savor the anticipation?

624
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,629
There is no bomb. So, relax.

625
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,214
- And all of this?
- To get your attention.

626
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,463
To talk. That's all.

627
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,844
It's not like I have your number.

628
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,760
You're insane.

629
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,179
Thomas Szasz,

630
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,103
the renowned psychiatrist
and psychoanalyst,

631
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,984
says that there is no
such thing as insanity.

632
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,775
Revenge, on the other hand,

633
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,366
is very real.

634
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:40,944
Revenge?

635
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,078
I've never even met you.

636
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:48,952
And yet you cost me
something dear to me.

637
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,375
Someone very dear.

638
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,378
My son.

639
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,716
That's why I've arranged
this little tête-à-tête.

640
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,891
So that when your city burns,
you'll know why.

641
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,158
We ran facial recognition

642
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,116
and none of those "cops"
are on the force. No surprise.

643
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,743
Fake cops, fake uniforms, fake bomb.

644
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,624
That's a lot of trouble to go through
just to have a conversation

645
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,795
with the Green Arrow.

646
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,669
Now, did he really lose his son?

647
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,000
Alena helped connect the dots.

648
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:40,341
There is a boy named Owen Post who
has Cayden James listed as his father

649
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,513
on his birth certificate, but he's
never been known to live with Cayden.

650
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,558
Two months after A.R.G.U.S.
put Cayden into custody last year,

651
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,885
Owen went missing
and was never found.

652
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,679
How does this have anything
to do with the Green Arrow?

653
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:50,934
Or any of us?

654
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,732
We need to keep digging, because
even if we bear zero responsibility,

655
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,434
we need to know why
Cayden James thinks we do.

656
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,612
Guys, a dude I used to code for
just blasted out this link.

657
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,198
It's super-trending.

658
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,489
Yep. Local news stations
are picking it up.

659
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,326
And of course, no one knows
that these cops aren't legit.

660
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,703
Does anyone else find this timing
just a little bit too convenient, right?

661
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,881
The whole city is voting on
the Anti-Vigilante Referendum today.

662
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,128
Guess we know which way
Cayden James wants 'em to vote.

663
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,757
He pulled us in to get those videos.
To sway the referendum.

664
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,087
That's not all he did.

665
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,385
The man has
a real thermobaric bomb now.

666
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,886
Which he doesn't intend to use.

667
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,260
At least not yet anyway.

668
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,016
- Still sounds pretty dangerous.
- Yes, it does.

669
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,143
But it's a problem for another day.
How's the polling going?

670
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,557
It's gonna pass, boss.

671
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,610
Let's prepare a statement.

672
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,235
I'm right behind you.
Just need to finish up with Lance.

673
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,238
You know, if the bomb had been real,

674
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,781
we still would've stopped it
from going off.

675
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,907
Yeah. I know.

676
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,659
It's just good to have
Oliver back in the saddle.

677
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,324
Yeah, that and...

678
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,996
You and I knew
where Cayden was targeting

679
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,079
because we worked
on the trace algorithm. Together.

680
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,622
'Cause we're a good team.

681
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,758
I'm sorry that I named the company
without consulting you.

682
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,962
And I'm sorry
that I picked our first project.

683
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,796
I'm sorry that I took the prototype
without asking you.

684
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,766
So, there's just one more thing
that I'm also sorry about.

685
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,060
What?

686
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,887
You know the angel investment we got?

687
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,639
What?

688
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,727
Evening, everybody.

689
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,276
I think we all would like
to applaud city officials

690
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,988
for conducting today's vote
in such a professional manner.

691
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,706
I believe in my heart that vigilantes

692
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,160
have worked to make this city
a safer and better place.

693
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,496
I also recognize as Mayor

694
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:42,800
that it is my duty to honor
the will of the people.

695
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,965
You have spoken today

696
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,719
and demanded the harshest possible
penalties for anyone

697
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,388
caught engaging in acts of vigilantism.

698
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,892
Some people still believe
that includes me.

699
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,307
But I remain confident that

700
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,735
my innocence will be proven
and I will be exonerated at my trial.

701
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,359
Thank you very much, everyone.

702
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,322
We would've won
had it not been for the video.

703
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,570
You did great out there.

704
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,120
I feel like
I just kicked myself in the teeth.

705
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,073
Maybe it's because you didn't believe
a single word that you said.

706
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,201
Give us a minute.

707
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,751
I'm headed back to Washington.

708
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,379
Something tells me you'll be back
in time to testify at my trial.

709
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,336
The time of vigilantes
is coming to an end.

710
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,638
Because how can you idolize someone

711
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,681
hiding in the shadows
who won't show his face,

712
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,598
who refuses to own up to
his shortcomings and culpability?

713
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,596
That's not a hero.

714
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,184
That's a coward.

715
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,142
What does your boy think of you?

716
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,019
Leave my son out of this.

717
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,274
Doesn't matter what I do, Mr. Queen.

718
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,606
It matters what you do.

719
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,740
Are you okay, Mr. Diggle?

720
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,500
Well, I'm happy as hell
to be getting out of here.

721
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,459
- And it's John.
<i>- William.</i>

722
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,047
It's Mr. Diggle.

723
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,885
And you were the Green Arrow
for my dad. Right?

724
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,091
That's right, William.

725
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,553
But if you were here last night,

726
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:14,891
who was at the stadium?

727
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,054
The Green Arrow wasn't at the stadium
last night, buddy.

728
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,431
Just... Just his team.

729
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,141
Okay.

730
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,192
Hey, man, let's go pull
the car around here for

731
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,191
- "Mr. Diggle."
- All right.

732
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,112
I'm sorry you had to step in.

733
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,789
And I'm sorry
you had to lie to your son.

734
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,575
I don't want to lie to him.

735
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,919
But I can do it if it's temporary.

736
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,623
If I'm just

737
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,842
subbing in for the real Green Arrow.

738
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,802
- What do you mean?
- I mean as soon as you're healed up,

739
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,679
I want you to put that hood back on.

740
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,015
Oliver, I like the way that sounds.

741
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,480
Makes two of us.

742
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,779
- I'm almost ready, Doc.
- Um, actually, I'm here for Mr. Queen.

743
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,481
It's your sister.
Something's happened.

744
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:18,663
Hi, Ollie.

745
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:33,046
Well, that stuffing smells a whole
lot better than this cranberryjello.

746
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,547
William made the stuffing.

747
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,512
- The young man can cook.
- Yeah, just like his father.

748
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,926
Raisa helped me a bit.

749
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,474
Raisa? As in our Raisa?

750
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,679
As in our Raisa.

751
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,900
Yeah. I have a lot to catch you up on.

752
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,438
Yeah.

753
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:51,196
I will save you some stuffing for
later if you want, Auntie Thea.

754
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,277
I would love that.

755
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,950
How'd you make
such a miraculous recovery?

756
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,656
Lazarus Pit water.

757
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:58,908
She's kidding.

758
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,285
For blast victims like Thea
in a minimally conscious state,

759
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,662
the trick is just to find
the right drug to literally

760
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:03,833
wake her brain up.

761
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,913
In this case, a new form of Zolpidem.
It's not even on the market yet.

762
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,167
So more like

763
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,884
cutting-edge neuroscience
than, I don't know, a miracle.

764
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,628
It seems pretty miraculous to me.

765
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:17,847
I missed you very much.

766
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,388
Hell of a Thanksgiving.

767
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,062
I've never had more to be thankful for.

768
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,851
Come here. You too.
