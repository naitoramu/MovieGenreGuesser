1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,546
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,971
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,930
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,265
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,396
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,683
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,935
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,271
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,981
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,148
What are you doing in Russia?

11
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,942
I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

12
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,362
Only people who have power
to get past his army are Bratva.

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,826
We lost one. It's in the air.

14
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,240
You need to divert that missile.

15
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:33,833
That's it.

16
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,624
<i>Tobias Church, he and his crew
tore up Hub City and Blüdhaven.</i>

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,212
Anybody else want to be in charge?

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,922
Church just became our top priority.

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,884
Felicity thinks that it's time
we put together a new team.

20
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,720
Evelyn Sharp. Basically,
a 16-year-old badass in the making.

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,055
<i>Until her parents
met Damien Darhk I'm guessing.</i>

22
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,684
You recruit me too.

23
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,813
You wanna help?

24
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,190
It's my city too.

25
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,359
I don't want to
see you out here again.

26
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,811
You again?

27
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,480
How's the leg?

28
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,987
You call yourself a vigilante?

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,494
You just let the Halcones' top seller
get away.

30
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,285
Now I thought I said that I didn't
want to see you out here again.

31
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,670
You don't listen very well.

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,871
You sound like my ex.

33
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,626
Rene Ramirez, you need to decide

34
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,715
if you want to be a man in a hockey mask

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,672
or if you want to be someone else.

36
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,300
Something else.

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,741
Conahan was struck
with an arrow and a sword.

38
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,372
Literally overkill.

39
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,916
<i>Definitely not Church's M. O.</i>

40
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,118
Totally different than
the Bertinelli murder too.

41
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,208
Ballistics show
that he was shot by his own men.

42
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,543
Well, that had to be Church.

43
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,423
In Hub City,
he killed every crime boss in town

44
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,711
so he could unite everyone
under one super-gang under his control.

45
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,220
How does he do this?

46
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,843
It's all in the core.

47
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,099
So, Curtis,

48
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,605
I'm guessing this wasn't
part of your Olympic training?

49
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,779
Impossible.

50
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,942
It's really hot. I mean, not. It's not.

51
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,324
Curtis, if you think this is hard

52
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,784
wait until I actually start training you.

53
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:17,948
What happens then?

54
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,083
The last guy got an arrow
in the leg before it even started.

55
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,243
That was Roy, right?

56
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,878
Also Roy, but I'm talking about Wild Dog.

57
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,297
And you did put two arrows
in Barry Allen's back.

58
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,627
I'm starting to sense a pattern.

59
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,042
Don't worry.
His bark's way worse than his bite.

60
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,300
And you're gonna get it worse than anyone.

61
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,506
Uh... Thanks?

62
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,388
The people that we're looking at have
at least some experience on the street.

63
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,391
You have the farthest way to go before
I'm convinced that you can do this.

64
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,592
I can do it, sir.

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,477
- Don't call me sir.
- Okay, Oliver.

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,309
Don't call me Oliver especially
in front of the recruits.

67
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,893
We don't know these people
and they can't know us.

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,478
Whoa, whoa! Hold up.
You're going to be wearing a mask

69
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,642
when you training our recruits?

70
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,152
Yeah. And so are you.

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,402
I only wear a mask once a year

72
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,779
and that's if my Halloween costume
calls for it.

73
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:53,158
This is not negotiable, Felicity.
I'm late for a budget meeting.

74
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,488
Yeah.

75
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,952
And I'm sure that kicking things off

76
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:04,621
by lying to everyone is an awesome idea.

77
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:09,004
Well, the original team started off
with Oliver lying about his identity.

78
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,672
And everyone who's not dead or
presumed dead, quit.

79
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,630
Yeah.

80
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,638
Now this trigger was taken from one of the
nukes that fell on Genesis Day.

81
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,980
Our intel tells us that a group of
Chechen rebels is close to obtaining it.

82
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,438
I don't have to tell you what
kind of a nightmare scenario will ensue

83
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,481
if that happens.

84
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,491
Now the mission
is standard retrieval and extraction.

85
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,700
Sergeant Diggle here, will be running
the op, wheels up at 0400.

86
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,160
All right, gentlemen, get some rest.
You're gonna need it. Dismissed!

87
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,842
You good, soldier?

88
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,807
I got through basic training, no sweat.

89
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,224
But this is my first day in the soup

90
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,773
and I don't want to be scared,
but I am a little.

91
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,311
Fear is part of war.
The part that keeps us alive.

92
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,444
See these stripes?

93
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,904
They give me strength, clarity.

94
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,987
Right or wrong, up and down,

95
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,113
they tell me what to do.

96
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,575
Which means that fear can kiss my six.
You understand, soldier?

97
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,086
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Dismissed.

98
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,550
It used to be that the Glades
were the worst part of the city,

99
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,090
but now it seems like
every other part is just as bad.

100
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,852
We've had three hospital closures
in the past eighteen months.

101
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,557
But with a Free Medical Clinic
event like this

102
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,643
we can start to walk back
some of that damage.

103
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:52,107
In a day, we can provide
medical care for up to a thousand people.

104
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,773
Plus, we already have about 30 doctors
and nurses just waiting to volunteer.

105
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,283
We're looking for a company
to cover logistical expenses and...

106
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,193
I don't need to hear any more.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,407
AmerTek is in.

108
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,619
And not just for logistical expenses,
for the whole thing.

109
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,915
Well, that's amazing.

110
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,576
That's, that's incredibly generous,
thank you.

111
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,244
Please, you would be doing us the favor.

112
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,209
And by "us" she means our stock price.

113
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,998
Good PR is worth, literally,
its weight in gold.

114
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,132
Uh, well, we will make sure
this clinic is a success

115
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,966
and that everyone knows
they have AmerTek to thank for it.

116
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,129
Wow.

117
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,052
Thought I'd almost feel bad
about boosting their stock prices

118
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,594
if it wasn't so good
for your approval ratings.

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,559
But actually you should really handle
the press on this one.

120
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,565
Maybe you can?

121
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,272
Oh, God, Ollie, I really thought
that we talked about this.

122
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,813
I can't keep doing everything on my own!

123
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,984
I have faith that you can, but
either way now is not a very good time.

124
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,276
And why is that?

125
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,491
- I'm recruiting a new team.
- Oh.

126
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,993
You okay with that?

127
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, why wouldn't I be? I quit.

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,545
I know, but there's a difference
between leaving and being replaced.

129
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,830
Oh.

130
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,249
It's really cute you think
I can be replaced.

131
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,417
That's not what I meant.

132
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,303
I know. But I actually think
it'll be really good for you

133
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,385
to not be out there solo anymore.

134
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,134
Plus, it would mean you would have
more time to actually be here.

135
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,147
That's the idea. But it's going to take
a minute to get these kids up to speed.

136
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,104
Wait, maybe I should hire my own team
for the office then.

137
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,065
That's also a good idea.
Start looking at résumés.

138
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,238
Hey, Quentin.

139
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
Have you actually heard about

140
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,742
this free medical event
Ollie and I are putting together?

141
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,251
- Rene Ramirez?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,292
Figures there'd be more of you.

143
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,707
Robin Hood needs his band of Merry Men,
right?

144
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,716
Well, I am just here for moral support.

145
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,798
She means she's here to make sure

146
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,055
that the Green Arrow's training technique
doesn't kill us.

147
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,510
He's not going to kill you.

148
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,394
I'm just here to make sure that the
horrible maiming stays a minimum.

149
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,970
I'm Curtis.

150
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,771
Evelyn Sharp.

151
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,729
So wait, there's training? I'm out.

152
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,402
Pretty early to quit, Mr. Ramirez.

153
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,813
I can't quit something I haven't started.

154
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,402
You think you can do this on your own?

155
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,692
I've been doing this on my own
for five months now.

156
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,737
And if you were getting it done
on your own, you wouldn't have come here.

157
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm out of here.

158
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,081
- No mask?
- No chance.

159
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,920
On the line.

160
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,836
Wait. I thought there was gonna be,

161
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,222
I dunno, like an orientation?

162
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,474
Is that what the brochure promised?

163
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,435
- That's hilarious. He's good...
- On the line!

164
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,606
This is simple.

165
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,979
Get past me

166
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,270
and ring that bell.

167
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,984
So, we're playing games now?

168
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,446
Fine. I'll play.

169
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,921
On the line.

170
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,009
At least he's not shooting them.

171
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,472
On the line.

172
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,013
This is stupid.

173
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,144
Still think it's a game?

174
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,647
I came here to work with the guy
who killed Damien Darhk

175
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
not ring a friggin' bell.

176
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,227
This isn't a game.
And if you need further evidence of that

177
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,483
then you walk down to the pier

178
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,943
and you look at the statue
of Laurel Lance.

179
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,279
Now, get on the line!

180
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:20,413
I'd love to, but I can't tonight.
Too much to do for this medical event.

181
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,252
Yeah, it's great, Janet agreed to it.

182
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,382
All right, see you Saturday?

183
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,598
Here you go, bud.

184
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,607
How's the victim?

185
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,910
Victim is Evan Wender. He's in the ICU.

186
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,742
Doctors think that
he was suffocated by something.

187
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,781
Is that lining up
with anything you've found?

188
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,916
You're assuming
I've actually found anything.

189
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,201
What's your interest in this, anyway?

190
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,836
AmerTek is helping us with a charity event

191
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,293
and all of a sudden one of their
Vice Presidents is attacked.

192
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,923
It cannot be a coincidence.

193
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,504
Not in this city.

194
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,171
- I have to go.
- Bye.

195
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,404
Thanks.

196
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,899
We're very sorry
about what happened to Mr. Wender.

197
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,160
But I would like you to know that I've
assigned the Anti-Crime Unit to his case

198
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,289
and I've asked them to make catching
whoever did this their top priority.

199
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,286
Well, I appreciate that.

200
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,493
But in the wake of this recent development

201
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,084
my board of directors, to say nothing
of AmerTek's army of attorneys

202
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,248
have advised us to
pull out of tomorrow's event.

203
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,213
They're concerned that
the attack on Mr. Wender

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,173
could be the start of a larger
pattern of violence.

205
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,556
And if something were to happen during the
Clinic, then AmerTek would be held liable.

206
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,391
What if Star City
agrees to indemnify AmerTek?

207
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,770
Ollie, that could cost millions.

208
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,433
And I will triple
the police presence at the event.

209
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,230
There will be plenty of security?

210
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,898
I will see to it personally.

211
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,272
Well.

212
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,942
I'm going to hold you to that, Mr. Mayor.

213
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,076
Thank you.

214
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,664
So is the plan,
to see to it personally with a new team?

215
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,169
No. They're nowhere near ready.

216
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,545
Then what's the back-up plan?

217
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,716
Me. It's one of the advantages

218
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,047
of having the mayor
moonlighting as a vigilante.

219
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,846
Or the vigilante moonlighting as mayor.

220
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,846
No hostiles, sir. We're a go.

221
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,011
Excellent. Intel was good.
Hostiles are on a shift change.

222
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,397
Bravo Team, you're upstairs,
northwest corridor, second floor.

223
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,057
Alpha Team with me, look sharp.

224
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,366
Alpha Team is here.
Bravo Team, where are you, what's your...

225
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,330
Come on! Move! Move! Move!

226
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,291
How the hell did they know we were here?

227
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,926
On the line.

228
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,846
Here to learn something, man.
Not just get beat up.

229
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,857
I told you, I'm teaching you.

230
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,564
Teaching us what exactly?

231
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,901
Because I actually find myself
agreeing with the scary, weird guy.

232
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,617
The goal of this exercise

233
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,745
is to figure out
the goal of this exercise.

234
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,830
Now, get on the line.

235
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,539
Actually, Green Arrow?
Can I talk to you for a second?

236
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,086
Now?

237
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,009
You know, I thought maybe we could hold
off on the criticism for a little bit.

238
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,592
Oh, yeah, no problem 'cause there's a lot.
Look.

239
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,094
I thought there wasn't any usable footage
from traffic cameras.

240
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,101
Yeah, but who needs traffic cams when you
got KH-ten spy satellites?

241
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,097
Could be a meta.
Or magic of some sort.

242
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,893
Exactly. So Thea may or may not have told
me about your brilliant plan

243
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,278
to protect the Free Clinic
all by yourself.

244
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,656
I won't be all by myself.
I'll have the SCPD and the ACU.

245
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,782
No way!
This is out of both of their leagues.

246
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,119
What?

247
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,787
It's out of their league too.
They're too green.

248
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,666
Some could say the same about you.

249
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,455
I've been waiting five years
to make that joke.

250
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,963
The convention center
has twenty entrances.

251
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,251
You can't be on them all.

252
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,467
Throw them around the perimeter for three
extra pairs of eyes. What could it hurt?

253
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,472
<i>Okay, heads on swivels.
But do not engage under any circumstances.</i>

254
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,604
- Copy that.
- Yes, sir. I mean, I mean, Green Arrow.

255
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,984
Wild Dog, do you copy that?

256
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,067
- We gotta talk about this code name.
- Not now. <i>Stay</i> focused.

257
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,903
You know, it'd help to know where you are.

258
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,067
<i>No, it wouldn't because
you are not going to engage.</i>

259
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,952
Come on, where's the fun in that?

260
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,529
<i>Man,
it would take one major asshat</i>

261
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,493
<i>to make a move against all these people.</i>

262
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,284
<i>Something I learned recently
is this city is filled with them.</i>

263
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,833
It starts at the top, you know?

264
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,383
Pretty Boy Queen here thinks
he's actually saving the city.

265
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,047
Thank you, Officer. Hey.

266
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,096
How are you? Hello.

267
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

268
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,302
What have we here?

269
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh. Her broken bone never set.

270
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,184
Oh. You'll be fine.
I have some experience with that.

271
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,518
Evelyn, check the northwest corridor.

272
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,686
I don't get a code name?

273
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,197
We really thank you for sticking with us.

274
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,526
Oh. Well, I'm glad
that Oliver changed my mind.

275
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,287
It's nice to feel that this company
can still do some good.

276
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,740
Um, sorry I'm late.

277
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,043
If you'll excuse me.
The event is almost over.

278
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,875
Yeah, I know.
It's been that kind of traffic, you know?

279
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,085
Yeah, but you were supposed to watch
the Tenth Street entrance.

280
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,876
But I just said, this traffic,
it's terrible!

281
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,586
Are you okay?

282
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,130
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, you know?

283
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,220
Sorry, it won't happen again.

284
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,552
Yeah, but...

285
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,389
You haven't been drinking again, have you?

286
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,863
<i>Janet Carroll.
You have been judged and found wanting.</i>

287
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,321
He's here.

288
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,583
Son of a bitch!

289
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,374
GREEN ARROW; Overwatch?

290
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,053
I don't see him on any of the security
cameras. It's like he just disappeared.

291
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,259
<i>I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see him</i>

292
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,219
<i>do all that other stuff
that I don't believe.</i>

293
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,771
I'm almost afraid to ask... Actually,

294
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,809
I am afraid to ask.
You know, maybe I'm just afraid.

295
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,066
Is he coming?

296
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,694
He's on his way.

297
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,321
Did he sound unhappy?

298
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,696
Why did you do that anyway?

299
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,657
He specifically told us not to engage.

300
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,038
First, he's not the boss of me
and never will be.

301
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,246
Second, if he thinks I'm just gonna stand
back and watch some little girl get hurt

302
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,251
then he never should've
recruited me in the first place.

303
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,208
I think that's quickly becoming
the majority opinion.

304
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,545
Third, if I hadn't done what I did,
I wouldn't have gotten this.

305
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,050
Wait. Is that a piece of...

306
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,506
Yeah. Ragman.

307
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,012
Now, I may be new at this and all

308
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,843
but isn't that
what you guys call "evidence"?

309
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,131
On the line!

310
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,515
Listen, before you say anything,
I think you...

311
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,473
My instructions were specific.

312
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,479
By not listening,
you put every one of our lives at risk.

313
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,810
You need to calm down.

314
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,145
Now, I know
that none of you are ready for this.

315
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,025
But now I'm not sure
if you're ever going to be.

316
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,859
Because you are reckless. You're useless
if you're not behind a computer

317
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,648
and you are just a little girl

318
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,068
who should be doing something better
with her life.

319
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,579
Okay, that's enough pep talk for one day.
Can I talk to you for a second?

320
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,581
Did you learn nothing from what happened
with Curtis last year?

321
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,587
You know I don't have a bedside manner...

322
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,838
There's having no bedside manner

323
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,000
and then there is being
physically and emotionally abusive.

324
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,386
It took me five years in hell to turn into
someone capable of going out there.

325
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,719
You know who didn't have five years?
Laurel Lance.

326
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,056
And now she's dead.

327
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,017
Well, were those five years just full of
pain and suffering

328
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,931
or did you have someone who taught you?

329
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,353
I had a few people who taught me
and I'm trying to teach them.

330
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,863
What? To take a punch? An insult?

331
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,946
You keep expecting them to do
what you're telling them to do.

332
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,360
And then you're not giving them
any reason.

333
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,279
You just keep jabbing them with
a cattle-prod expecting them to perform.

334
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,791
And the guy that you called reckless
got us our only clue we have so far.

335
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,166
We need to do a full work-up on that.

336
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,331
Yeah, well, I can't, I mean, not here.

337
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,216
The Ghosts
destroyed our Gas chromatograph.

338
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,549
But, uh, I have other methods.

339
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,467
Good. I have to get to City Hall.

340
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,135
What about them?

341
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,264
The city just experienced the equivalent
of a terrorist attack.

342
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,395
Those three can wait.

343
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,395
<i>You should get to the medic tent
when we get back,</i>

344
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,188
<i>but this should hold you for a few hours.</i>

345
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,198
A few hours, why? We're not bugging out?

346
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,860
Our orders are to get that trigger,
that's exactly what we're going to do.

347
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,027
All the men are on the second floor,

348
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,411
we have no idea how
many guys are up there.

349
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,787
Do you remember
what I told you about fear?

350
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,866
- Gets you through.
- That's right.

351
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,455
And so does the chain of command.

352
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,415
We don't have to think about do or don't,
right or wrong.

353
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,628
There's a clarity in that, right?

354
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,633
A peace.

355
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,091
Do you understand?

356
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,261
Fall out.

357
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,474
Secure the south hallways.
I'll take the north.

358
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,098
<i>Contacts will be here any minute.</i>

359
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,266
<i>So let's keep our heads
on swivels, ladies.</i>

360
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,353
Thought you guys were either dead or gone.

361
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,899
Collins took a through-and-through.
He'll fine but...

362
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,157
What the hell is going on here?

363
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,989
Really sorry about this, Sergeant.

364
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,869
You're not here to secure the trigger.
You're stealing it.

365
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,242
Can't steal anything if nobody owns it.

366
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,872
Now, you be careful now, Sergeant.
You just might live through this.

367
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,464
Not that I would normally condone
drinking this much caffeine

368
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,426
but since you are so busy
trying to save the entire city and all...

369
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,886
Add it to the list of vices
I've been meaning to swear off.

370
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,801
Oh! Do I even want to know?

371
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,221
Just as much as I want to know
why you're really here.

372
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,106
You already bought me an Americano
this morning before I got to work.

373
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,144
Ah! And that's why you are the detective.

374
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:31,064
It's been a while since I dated anyone.
Is this a thing now?

375
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,359
No, this is not a thing. This is

376
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,951
a very long, funny story.

377
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:42,083
Do you want to tell me this story?

378
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,494
Yeah, it's why I'm here. Um...

379
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,336
This belonged to my friend's maid.
Cleaning lady.

380
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,300
Your friend's cleaning lady?

381
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,633
She's gone missing.
And he's very worried about her.

382
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,214
You want me to make a report to
Missing Persons?

383
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,553
No, no, no! I was thinking that...

384
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,888
Well, she left this rag behind.

385
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,771
So I was thinking there might be some
evidence left behind on it that, um,

386
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,357
could help my friend locate
her cleaning lady.

387
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,517
I thought your friend was a guy.

388
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,690
Are you jealous?

389
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:14,320
Only insofar as I haven't actually met
any of your friends yet.

390
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,529
Mmm.

391
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,114
And yes, that's a hint
officially being dropped.

392
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,446
Hint noted.

393
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,830
Okay.

394
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,452
So just a quick forensic work-up?

395
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,962
Like, maybe just a quick pass
through the gas chromatograph?

396
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,250
Fine. It's your tax dollars.

397
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,719
You are the best.

398
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,099
Thea, may I speak with...

399
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

400
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,146
- Oh, I was just leaving.
Is everything okay?

401
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,889
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

402
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,933
I was just talking to Thea
about maybe coming aboard,

403
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,727
- helping out with some stuff and...
- Yeah.

404
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,231
Yeah, anyway.
So anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.

405
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,774
- Okay.
- Okay.

406
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,651
Uh, thanks.

407
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,538
- What was that about?
- It's nothing.

408
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,245
Look, we have way bigger problems
on our plate right now.

409
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,910
Because of you we are on the hook
with AmerTek

410
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,545
and the CEO is in the hospital.

411
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,252
Actually, she was just released,
she's fine.

412
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,088
Okay, but she's gonna hit the city
with a multi-million dollar lawsuit.

413
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,879
Well, can you speak to her?
My hands are kind of full right now.

414
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,763
Okay. What else is new?

415
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,344
What is going on with Quentin?

416
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,226
I am 90% sure
he's drinking again.

417
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,432
And I'm 100% sure.

418
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,602
He told me when I saw him last week.

419
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,434
Ollie, I put him to work security
at the event...

420
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,528
The dude in rags came in through the door

421
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,439
he was supposed to be working.

422
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,240
Thea, I'm sorry.

423
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,442
I had no idea
that you were gonna reach out to him.

424
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,782
But why is he talking
like he's going to be working with us?

425
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,697
"I'll see you tomorrow"? What, is that?

426
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,454
He's hurting, Ollie.

427
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,708
But <i>I</i> don't think that putting him

428
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,121
in a position of responsibility
is the best idea for him,

429
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,382
or for us right now. Okay?

430
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,417
I'll talk 110 him.

431
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,388
I have to go. Thank you.

432
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,140
What's going on? Where are the others?

433
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,680
Somewhere not here.

434
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,146
They quit.

435
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,729
This really shouldn't come
as any sort of surprise to you.

436
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,361
It's not surprising.
We chose the wrong people.

437
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,317
- Including me, right?
- Curtis,

438
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,116
do you know what the purpose
of this exercise is?

439
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,493
To figure out the purpose
of this exercise?

440
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,995
No. It's to work together

441
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,656
because that's the only way that you win.

442
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,790
That is what I've been trying
to teach all of you.

443
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,826
Well, maybe there's a reason
why you couldn't.

444
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,460
- We don't trust you.
- That's on you.

445
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,340
No, man, that's on you.

446
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,340
Because you don't trust us.
Because you don't want us.

447
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,301
Okay, this is a setback.
But we can salvage this. Like...

448
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,556
They'll listen to you.

449
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:46,968
Can you just tell them how Oliver usually
approaches things and...

450
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,431
I tried that.

451
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,224
I told them all about how you
and Speedy and Spartan were a family.

452
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,987
And even though you were tough
and scary and even a little abusive,

453
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,031
they clearly trusted you
because they stood by you.

454
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,368
But then it hit me.

455
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,612
No, they didn't.

456
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,117
They left.

457
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,406
And now I know why.

458
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,042
You don't respect people.

459
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,544
You don't know how to have partners.

460
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,581
You don't build people up.
You tear them down.

461
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,838
I thought I could trust you,

462
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,923
we could trust you,

463
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,546
but I was wrong.

464
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,760
And that's why I'm out too.

465
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,484
<i>Figured I'd find you here.</i>

466
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,772
You were right.

467
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,777
Oh. As much as I usually love
hearing those three little words,

468
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,871
gloating right now
would be like kicking a puppy.

469
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,284
I failed these recruits as a leader.

470
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,077
Well, that's 'cause you're not a leader.

471
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,213
Well, in your defense,
you never set out to be.

472
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,921
You never planned
on doing this with partners.

473
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,595
Though, I don't think
you really ever had a way

474
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,801
- around that one.
- How so?

475
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:12,019
When I got to know you, the real you...

476
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,024
I was in awe.

477
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,487
I had never met somebody so passionate,

478
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:28,115
so focused and determined
to make a real difference.

479
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,867
But the recruits

480
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,657
didn't get to see the real you

481
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:37,499
because all you showed them
was this angry guy in a mask.

482
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,958
Like scary angry-

483
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,671
I just thought that if they didn't know
who I was it would make things easier.

484
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,551
How would that make things
easier for them?

485
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,633
For me. Easier for me.

486
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,176
- When I was in the Bratva...
- Mmm.

487
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,768
You never talk about your time in Russia.

488
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,355
Nobody in the Bratva
uses their real names.

489
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,406
Nobody knows anything about anyone's life

490
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,282
before they were Bratva.

491
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,907
- Sounds lonely.
- It's effective.

492
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,708
They teach you that the only person
you can trust is yourself.

493
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,540
That without personal attachment,

494
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,332
there can be no loss.

495
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,261
Laurel,

496
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,431
Thea, Digg, even Roy.

497
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,641
I let them into my crusade,
I let them in...

498
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:36,850
And they left.

499
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,312
I was protecting myself.

500
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,560
I just think you're missing something.

501
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,195
Only one thing?

502
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,034
The reason the original team
worked so well,

503
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,707
was because of the trust and respect

504
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,959
that everyone had for Oliver Queen,

505
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,377
not the Green Arrow.

506
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,383
Oliver is the one who makes a good leader.

507
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,460
He's the one that runs a good team.

508
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,470
He's the one that I chose to stand by

509
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,757
and that I continue to choose to stand by.

510
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,723
I got to take this.

511
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,876
Hey, hey. If we can move them
to the left, we may have a chance.

512
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,291
We need to divert their attention

513
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,797
and then one of us sneaks past
and we ring the bell.

514
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,135
Congratulations, Oliver.

515
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,342
Well, it looks
like we have our work cut for us

516
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,556
getting AmerTek back in our good graces.

517
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,346
Couldn't even get past the reception desk.

518
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,150
So we need
to get this handled with... But...

519
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,984
Just call me back whenever you get this.

520
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,155
I'm sorry I'm late.
It couldn't be helped.

521
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,495
Help it next time.
I don't like waiting.

522
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,285
<i>Are we all set for tonight?</i>

523
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,998
We are if you have the money.

524
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,539
$100 million.

525
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,834
For everything I need
to take over this city.

526
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,303
Mr. Church, I'm selling you

527
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,555
enough ordinance to take over a country.

528
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,517
Argh. Sons of bitches are late.

529
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,348
Go topside. See if you can get a visual.

530
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,858
Don't you just hate it when your plan

531
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,895
to steal illegal nuclear technology
hits a snag?

532
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,401
So that ambush, that was you.

533
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:38,198
You had your own men,
soldiers, brothers walk into a trap.

534
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,738
And I'll carry
that with me till the day I die.

535
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,076
But till that day comes,
I'm going to be a very, very wealthy man.

536
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,995
- You swore an oath, man!
- Then Genesis Day happened!

537
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,216
ISIS. Taliban. Al-Qaeda.
I could take 'em all on!

538
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,169
But what hope does the world have
against men with magic?

539
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,930
All those meta-humans in Central City?

540
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,885
How long before one of them,
manages to tear the world apart?

541
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,438
Sarge, what's going on?

542
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,567
It's all right. No! No!

543
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,445
You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

544
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,941
You know, I've been puzzling out

545
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,781
why none of my contacts have showed up,

546
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,617
fretting that maybe this whole thing
had gotten a little bit sideways,

547
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,076
wondering what to do about it.

548
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:28,745
<i>And you showed up to solve my problem.</i>

549
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,588
Thanks.

550
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,507
So, are you sure that it was them?

551
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,964
Yeah, that son of a bitch
leaves a pretty good impression.

552
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,212
Well, if AmerTek is in bed
with Church, then...

553
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,848
Then maybe that guy in rags isn't so bad.

554
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,759
He's probably trying to take down AmerTek.

555
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,179
So, why is the CEO of a
Fortune 500 company like AmerTek

556
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,895
willing to deal weapons to a crime lord?

557
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,770
Because they are trying
to avoid bankruptcy.

558
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,943
Got the forensics work-up back
on that piece of cloth from Ragman.

559
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,282
Please tell me that's
not what we're actually gonna call him.

560
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,442
What'd you find?

561
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,782
That it is over 2000 years old.

562
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,868
- And radioactive.
- Which means trackable.

563
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,579
If this weapons buy is going down,
this guy's going to try to stop it.

564
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,003
Leading us right
to Janet Carroll and Mr. Church.

565
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,583
Wait. What did you mean when you said

566
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,043
that AmerTek is going bankrupt?

567
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,460
The isotope that made the cloth
radioactive is very specific.

568
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,674
It came from one of the nukes
that Darhk launched on Genesis Day.

569
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,383
Specifically, a nuke manufactured

570
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,264
by a company
called "Atomic Defensive Systems."

571
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,425
They're likely a subsidiary of AmerTek.

572
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,594
Aw! People say he's just a pretty face.

573
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,762
Hmm!

574
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,023
Bottom line is the
subsidiary's connection with Genesis Day

575
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,901
has made AmerTek's stock prices go...

576
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,231
Which explains why they were so eager
to have a big public relations bonanza.

577
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,284
And why they'd be willing to unload
their excess ordinance on Tobias Church.

578
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,444
We need to find our friend in the rags

579
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,238
and hope he leads us to that weapons sale.

580
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,742
Wait! They did just say
that there was enough weaponry

581
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,410
to take down an entire country.

582
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,169
So I would think this would be a good time

583
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,705
for you to test out your new team.

584
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,215
There's no team anymore, Thea.

585
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,211
If I'm going in, I'm going alone.

586
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,517
This is the spot.

587
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,151
<i>There's a crazy amount of hostiles inside.</i>

588
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,356
I say crazy because

589
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,238
that is what you would have to be
to take them on all alone.

590
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,026
All right. You have your merchandise.

591
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,865
And now you want your money.

592
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,288
What kind of dent
can $100 million

593
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,539
make in your balance sheet?

594
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,919
- That's my worry.
- No, I think that's your golden parachute

595
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,708
and I admire that.

596
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,428
Hello, Janet.

597
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,772
Easy. This man's about to
save us $100 million.

598
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:03,991
They all died in fire. Your fire.
Your weapon. All for your money.

599
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,622
Where you at?

600
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,099
What are you talking about?

601
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,979
I'm talking about a KN-zero-eight.
Your pride and joy.

602
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,061
Over 15,000 missiles
launched on Genesis Day.

603
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,773
Only one found its mark. Yours.

604
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,280
No. No. We built those missiles
to keep people safe.

605
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,069
It was Damien, it was Damien Darhk.

606
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,111
Couldn't have done anything
if you hadn't given him the tools.

607
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,917
Your missile killed everyone in my home.

608
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,504
I am the very last living soul
of Havenrock.

609
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,631
And I carry with me a message

610
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,558
from all those souls you killed.

611
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,362
Ragman!

612
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,824
Thank you.

613
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,661
Thank me
by not standing in my way.

614
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:35,824
Let her go.

615
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,203
It's over.

616
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,176
Thank you for coming.

617
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:53,184
Your offer sounded intriguing.
Why'd you make it?

618
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,844
Why did you give up your vengeance
to save my life?

619
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,013
I don't know.

620
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,863
I think it's what my father
would have wanted me to do.

621
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,649
<i>He saved my life.</i>

622
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,237
<i>On Genesis Day</i>

623
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,447
he wrapped me in these rags.

624
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,079
He said they were ancient.

625
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,045
From the time of Devarim.

626
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,753
That they would protect me from the fire.

627
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,258
And they did.

628
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,841
So you see why I have to avenge him?

629
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:35,555
Your father didn't give up his life
so you could become a killer.

630
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,718
You don't know that.

631
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,729
My father gave up his life to save mine.

632
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,059
He made me promise to be better than him.

633
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:49,280
To save this city in a way
that he never could.

634
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,489
It's been nearly ten years since that day.

635
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,330
So far, I've failed.

636
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,283
Why are you telling me this?

637
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,952
Because I don't want to fail anymore.

638
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,621
<i>I can't do it alone.</i>

639
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,086
I need a team.

640
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,755
Let's honor the legacies of our fathers.

641
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,091
Together.

642
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,779
Why, Anatoly? Why kill them?

643
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,781
You rang bell. They did not.

644
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,615
I only rang the bell because of them.
I couldn't have done it alone.

645
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:38,496
But using team was your idea.

646
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,992
You used them to win, huh? Intelligent.

647
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,245
Bratva wants that, Bratva need that.

648
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,332
I never would have done it if I had known

649
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,250
it was gonna cost them their lives.

650
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,044
First part of initiation.

651
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,090
Only person you can trust, yourself.

652
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,147
You seemed
to have re-opened a wound, friend.

653
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,313
What the hell?

654
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,114
Still think you can write
with your cuffs on?

655
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,991
I mean, it wouldn't be much.
Just a signature.

656
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,073
You want to read your confession
before you sign it?

657
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,959
Screw you!

658
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,830
Now, Sergeant,
I am offering you an opportunity here.

659
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,168
I'm not owning up to this. You did this.

660
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,257
Yeah, but I used your gun
to shoot Private Collins.

661
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,095
Apparently, he walked in
on your attempted illegal appropriation

662
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,100
of a WMD for your own personal gain.

663
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,183
I got six men
out there who'll testify to that.

664
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,398
No one will ever believe your story.

665
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,683
I will.

666
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,227
Good luck with your court martial.

667
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,026
Oh, please, come in, sorry.

668
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:01,322
Sit down and I will be right with you.

669
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,871
Okay, thank you for coming.

670
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,965
Um, yeah, well, I almost didn't.

671
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,710
'Cause, you know, l...

672
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,425
I screwed up, didn't I? People got hurt.

673
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,260
Now it seems like you figured it out that

674
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,759
I'm drinking again and

675
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,389
I understand,
I don't wanna be any trouble.

676
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,681
I'm just sorry it didn't work out.

677
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,938
Okay, Quentin, that's...
It's not gonna work for me.

678
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,645
What?

679
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,689
You leaving
and hitting the bottle again, okay?

680
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,528
No! I think we can do better than that.

681
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,575
- I've been to meetings.
- Not a meeting.

682
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,074
A job.

683
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,870
How does Deputy Mayor sound?

684
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:51,205
You want to, hire a drunk
to be your deputy mayor, huh?

685
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,586
What, Oliver's approval ratings
are not low enough?

686
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,586
If we were hiring a drunk,
that would be a very good point.

687
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,221
But that is not what we are doing.

688
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,101
We are hiring the former captain
of the SCPD who...

689
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,763
Who just lost his daughter
and is honoring her memory

690
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,307
by dedicating himself
to the city that she loved.

691
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,611
All right, what do you think
about that one?

692
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:21,785
Why, I think
maybe the wrong Queen ran for mayor.

693
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,538
Look, Ollie, he told me you said,

694
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,460
that you needed a reason
to stay sober, so I...

695
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,459
I thought maybe this could be it.

696
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,713
Yeah, maybe it could.

697
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,637
You let Church almost kill you
so that you could recruit Ragman?

698
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,302
I was betting that his heroism
would trump his vengeance.

699
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,311
That's a big risk
to take on a stranger, don't you think?

700
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,269
Yeah. Well, I'm not done yet.

701
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,981
"- Hey.

702
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,069
- Yeah?
- Are you all right?

703
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,064
Yeah. Fine.

704
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,196
Thank you all for coming.

705
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,613
I only came 'cause blondie said
there'd be an apology.

706
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,283
Well, "blondie" made a good point.

707
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,544
You're not just joining up
with the Green Arrow.

708
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,015
You'd be joining up with me.

709
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,689
The Green Arrow is the Mayor?

710
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,600
I had the same cognitive dissonance.

711
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,110
I hope you don't think I'm gonna apologize

712
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,520
for the trash I talked about you.

713
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,859
No more than I'm going
to apologize for the tough training.

714
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,780
But I understand
that you all need to trust me.

715
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,530
This is as far as I know how to go.

716
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,869
You're sort of asking without asking

717
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,955
if we want to come back, right?

718
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,869
That's exactly what he's doing.

719
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,790
Okay, good. Then I'm in.

720
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,004
Me, too.

721
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,715
Wild Dog?

722
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,349
I'll fight any war long as I trust
who's leading me into battle.

723
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,974
But we have got to rethink this code name.

724
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,024
No chance.

725
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,620
Ah.

726
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,743
Can't stay away from me, can you?

727
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,914
You almost killed
the Green Arrow the other night.

728
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,050
If you had, you'd be dead right now.

729
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,051
Who the hell are...

730
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,092
The Green Arrow is mine.

731
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,175
You kill him, you die.

732
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,927
Who are you?

733
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,938
Prometheus.
