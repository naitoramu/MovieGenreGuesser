1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,413
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,997
Anatoly said that you had a plan
to take control of the city.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,215
It's like you're firing Overwatch.

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,044
I need to stop Diaz.
And in order to do that

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,050
I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,257
The impeachment was
just the latest step.

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,637
And what's the next one?

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:21,895
Star City, it's open for business.

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,568
Get your ass out of bed, <i>chillón.</i>

10
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,410
You can look at that picture
all you want.

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,195
Your father ain't never
coming back, Diaz.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,123
I'm getting breakfast.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,669
When I come back, this place better
be clean for inspection.

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,168
No wrinkles on the bed.
Seriously, or...

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,631
You get another souvenir
to help remind you.

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,137
If you do it again,
I'll tell Sister Heller.

17
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,059
You think they'll believe
someone like you, <i>chillón?</i>

18
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:05,972
What...

19
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,391
You want to take a shot at me?

20
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,732
Go ahead. I'm right here.

21
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,528
Give it back! That's my only one.

22
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,075
No family's gonna wanna take you in.

23
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,160
Why would they?

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,707
You're nothing. You're a loser.

25
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,550
I think you need that reminder now.

26
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,268
You know that they
invited us here, right?

27
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,811
Breaking and entering is a bit
disrespectful, don't you think?

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,270
I'm tired of waiting.

29
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,069
You're the one who wanted
to tag along.

30
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,902
To see how you operate,
to see your big job.

31
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,738
So far all we've done is drive in
a car for three hours

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,117
and wait outside

33
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,791
for two more.

34
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:13,173
Patience. It's one of the most
important virtues a person can have.

35
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,093
Meaning?

36
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,598
If you think short-term,
you're gonna drift moment to moment.

37
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,552
If you want something big,
something truly remarkable,

38
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,728
you got to think long-term.

39
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,182
We've been waiting out here
long-term.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,061
Let me put it in perspective.

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,276
I've been working on something
for five years.

42
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,028
What's waiting two hours?

43
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,155
A slap in the face?

44
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,659
Small price to pay for
introduction to the Quadrant.

45
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,991
I thought they were an urban legend.

46
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,710
They're very real.

47
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,338
They control all criminal enterprises
across the entire country.

48
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,503
The four corners.

49
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,919
Yeah, "Quadrant," I get it.
Very clever.

50
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,426
They didn't get that type of power
without patience.

51
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,923
Well, if they're so powerful,

52
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,974
then why didn't you
come with any backup?

53
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,929
I'm not. I got you.

54
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,694
You're early.

55
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,617
My father couldn't make it.
You don't mind, do you?

56
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,948
Let's get started.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,957
We have a lot to discuss.

58
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,124
Indeed, we do.

59
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,502
Hey, you made it.

60
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,929
Yeah. Um...

61
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,225
- I did.
- That's great. I'm glad you did.

62
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,557
What's wrong?

63
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,102
It's just been a while since
we've done any Helix Dynamics stuff.

64
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,808
Yeah, well, we've been busy.

65
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,109
We've been fighting.

66
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,897
Not you and me. Our teams, yeah, but
that's not an issue for me anymore.

67
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,654
Glad it's not for you, but you know,
Rene is still in the hospital.

68
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,576
He's only now just getting out.

69
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,238
I'm sorry. About our teams...

70
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,907
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,705
I'd really like Helix to work.

72
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,377
Looks like you're trying to
stabilize a neural interface.

73
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,542
Yeah, I mean it's just still
really twitchy.

74
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,336
You know,
actually I had a thought about this.

75
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,764
I think the serotonin interface is
a result of the pathogenic reaction.

76
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,343
Star City is open for business.

77
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,181
We have the police, the ports,
the whole city...

78
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,894
We got it wired.

79
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,318
Now, you wanna run merchandise,
you wanna move product,

80
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,236
launder money, anything...

81
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,490
Star City is the place.

82
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:49,745
Assuming we're interested, not saying
that we are, but assuming,

83
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,824
how much are you looking to charge?

84
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,079
It's free.

85
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,046
Nothing's ever free.

86
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,086
I just want a seat at the table.

87
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,089
Of the Quadrant?

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,461
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,505
That seems reasonable to me.

90
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,801
You make the Quadrant
sound like it's a potluck.

91
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,221
As if there's always room
at our table for anyone

92
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,806
with something to add.

93
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,436
But it's not.

94
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,689
We're a family.

95
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:27,867
We're not really that welcoming
to outsiders.

96
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,414
At least, not before we know

97
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,458
that you can operate at our level.

98
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,295
I just offered you a whole city.

99
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,879
Hell, if you can't see
the opportunity in that,

100
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,427
why don't I talk to your father?

101
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,049
He sent me.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,683
We're just looking
for a little something extra.

103
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,803
Call it establishing your bona fides.

104
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,226
What did you have in mind?

105
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,814
This is Robert Baylor,
one of our guys.

106
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,440
The FBI pinched him.

107
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,276
- That's not ideal.
- Right?

108
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:11,244
We need to know where the Federal
Marshals are holding Baylor

109
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,615
so we can get him out.

110
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,700
You want him to audition?

111
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,454
Well, that's not a very productive
way of putting it.

112
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,207
- And yet...
- It will be nothing for me.

113
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,082
It's not a problem. Whatever it takes
to get the deal done, right?

114
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,508
Champion mindset.

115
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,594
You got a john in this place?

116
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,011
It's right over there.

117
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,304
I'm at the location now.
Thanks for the address.

118
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,894
I'd say I owe you one,
but you owe me 20.

119
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,024
He wants contact with the FBI.

120
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,067
So more waiting then.

121
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,237
We have to get a picture of the guy.

122
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,610
Proof of life.

123
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:36,325
They tell you to fetch, you fetch.
So, what's next? Roll over?

124
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,324
Oh! That's right.
You've already done that.

125
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,122
You think I'm giving in
to these people too much?

126
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,078
I don't think it, I know it.

127
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,836
It's just business.

128
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,466
You're okay with all this?
How that guy talked to you?

129
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,300
Cartier is nothing.
He's a stepping stone.

130
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,394
Long-term thinking, remember?

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,971
Yeah, I remember.

132
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,936
How's that working out for you?

133
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,154
Smoke break.

134
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,824
Fetch, roll over, sit. Good boy.

135
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,581
You know that the Quadrant is the
most powerful criminal organization

136
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,708
on the continent?

137
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,836
When I joined with Cayden James,
I gained a city.

138
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,507
When I join the Quadrant,
I'm gonna have an empire.

139
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,733
Okay. Try it.

140
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,230
- Success.
- Yes!

141
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,191
Pathogenic reaction is completely
stabilized.

142
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,280
Yes! Damn, we make a good team!

143
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,746
- Speaking of team...
- No, don't do that.

144
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,243
Why would you do that?
We're having such a good time.

145
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,791
Earlier you said the team thing
wasn't an issue for you anymore.

146
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,791
- Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did. The question is why?

147
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,715
Oliver sort of fired me. I mean,

148
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:16,045
he's saying that he didn't, but,
it sure feels like he did, you know.

149
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,505
Well, sort of fired... He fired me.

150
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,183
Wait. I'm sorry. What happened?

151
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,969
Long story short, Oliver had a run-in
with Vertigo... The pharmaceutical,

152
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,054
not a person,

153
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,482
and he came out of it with this
epiphany that to stop Diaz he has to

154
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,976
"go back to basics."

155
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,770
- Meaning?
- Meaning he's a lone wolf.

156
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,569
- No more Team Arrow.
- So, did he also fire John?

157
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:41,158
No. John left about a week before.

158
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,248
Wow! Okay, well...

159
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,792
I am going to have to try not
to take satisfaction out of that.

160
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,244
Try really hard.

161
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,580
Okay, so it was down to
you and Oliver.

162
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,960
- Mmm-hmm.
- Now it's just Oliver.

163
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,124
Yep.

164
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,131
- How are you doing with all this?
- I'm fine.

165
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,133
You're not fine.

166
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,506
What?

167
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,805
So, none of your people
could find him.

168
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,062
I did.

169
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,143
I'll tell him to start
carving the monument.

170
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,770
They brought your boy
out for a smoke.

171
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,315
Looked more like a guest
than a prisoner.

172
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,823
Honey, ease up.
That's a 30-year-old single malt.

173
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,626
Call me "honey" again,
and I might only break your legs.

174
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,622
Mmm.

175
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,057
I like this one.

176
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,811
So, I held up my part of the bargain.

177
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,227
Time for you to deliver yours.

178
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:56,403
You know, your pretty little friend
makes an inconvenient point.

179
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,903
Seems that Mr. Baylor
has gotten a little chatty.

180
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,983
So what?

181
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,160
So, my father's going to have to
debrief him.

182
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,784
You know, to find out what
he told the Justice Department.

183
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,749
- You want me to...
- Fetch him?

184
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,828
What's a little favor between
future business partners?

185
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,580
So, what's next?

186
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,422
You want me to roll over,
you want me to play dead?

187
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,128
You're absolutely right.
Forget I asked.

188
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,009
Thanks for tracking down
Baylor for us.

189
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,757
We'll take it from here.

190
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,559
You should've asked me
from the beginning.

191
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,429
Are you wasting my time?

192
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,442
I don't react well
when people waste my time.

193
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:41,525
Hey, I had no idea that Baylor would
be cooperating with the Frisbees.

194
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,156
I'm gonna deliver Baylor to you.

195
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,326
Afterwards, I meet your father.

196
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,414
You solve this little problem for us

197
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,995
and my dad will be asking
to sit down with you.

198
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,341
Call me when you've got Baylor.
I'll send over a car.

199
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,335
Hey,

200
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,178
what happened to your hand?

201
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,925
I got angry at someone.

202
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,850
The Quadrant's making you jump
through a lot of hoops.

203
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,310
I hope it's worth it.

204
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,611
Why don't I knock on the door?

205
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,656
Hello, boys.

206
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,429
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.

207
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,307
Are you gonna kill me?

208
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,682
If you keep asking me questions.
On your feet.

209
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,934
Send the car.

210
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,772
Move. Move!

211
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,818
Cartiers take care of their own.

212
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,245
Once you're in, you're family.

213
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,742
That's my expectation.

214
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,698
All those days,
I knew they'd send for me.

215
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,242
I would never snitch.

216
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,541
Sure you wouldn't.
I wouldn't take the chairs, though.

217
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,002
You're lucky you don't work for me.

218
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,052
Baylor, buddy.
Feds treat you all right?

219
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,017
Whoa. I didn't say nothing.
I swear to God.

220
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,183
Tell him in person.

221
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,659
They're gone.

222
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,623
That packs a punch.

223
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,539
What would you have done
if they shot you in the head?

224
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,589
I'd be dead probably.

225
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,725
Getting shot wasn't part of my plan.

226
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,636
Understatement of the year.

227
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,432
You just can't trust anyone
these days.

228
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,440
Dad?

229
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,191
Is it done?

230
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,652
Baylor's off the board.

231
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,157
And Diaz?

232
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,575
Never saw it coming.
Idiot really thought he had a shot.

233
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,990
As if we'd share space
with a thug like him.

234
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,996
Tomorrow we'll send
a crew to Star City

235
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,043
and lean on Diaz's networks.

236
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,420
And we'll make his city ours.

237
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,854
So, this whole plan of yours
has gotten a little complicated.

238
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,565
Anything worth wanting
shouldn't be simple.

239
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,571
Not my philosophy.

240
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,030
Plans are like men. It's best
to avoid the complicated ones.

241
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,248
Ah, shucks.

242
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,201
You think I'm not complicated.

243
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,413
You do realize that

244
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,045
the guys that you wanted to impress
tonight are the same guys that

245
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,342
just tried to kill you.

246
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,794
And I was prepared.

247
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,649
It still doesn't explain what
we're doing back here at their place

248
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,731
when we should be on our way
back to Star City.

249
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,657
Maybe that's the difference
between us.

250
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,870
When you get knocked down,
you give up.

251
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,455
I get up.

252
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,785
I get up.
I just don't get stupid, too.

253
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,632
Must be nice being pretty.

254
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,929
Pout your lips, you bat your eyes,
everybody gives you what you want.

255
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,807
Everything I wanted, I had to take.

256
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,650
Bar's closed.

257
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,606
Everybody move!

258
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,112
Move!

259
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,040
Son of a bitch.

260
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,914
In your enthusiasm to take out
your man,

261
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,956
you forgot I was standing next to him

262
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,836
when you started shooting.

263
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,093
But you're sorry about that,
aren't you?

264
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,762
It wasn't anything personal.

265
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,847
Bullets make things personal.

266
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,969
May I ask you something?

267
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,893
Did you ever have to fight
for a meal?

268
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,568
Not once. Not one time.

269
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:01,946
Mr. Silver Spoon, I had to fight
for every scrap of food

270
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,872
I ate as a kid.

271
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,584
You don't know what it's like
to be hungry.

272
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,873
To want something so bad,

273
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,338
you'd kill for it.

274
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,841
I've killed. Plenty.

275
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,423
Not for survival.

276
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,513
Not when the outcome of your life

277
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,020
hangs in the balance.

278
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,852
It's funny you should
put it that way.

279
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,692
You really got to tell your guys,
creep a little quieter.

280
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,364
There's two to my right,

281
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,202
three more behind me.

282
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,879
That's pretty confident for a thug
who's outnumbered.

283
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,921
You wouldn't think I was outnumbered
if you knew what she can do.

284
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,266
Wow. We really need
to restock the fridge.

285
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,063
Do you think soda can go bad?

286
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,107
I should probably not even answer that.

287
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,610
- Felicity? Hey.
- Mmm.

288
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,737
It's working. Remember?
We high-fived.

289
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,484
Yeah, doesn't mean
it can't be improved.

290
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,865
Sure, so maybe improve it tomorrow?

291
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,663
When you've had some sleep and
some food and some non-expired soda.

292
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,707
Yeah, I just want to make
a couple adjustments here.

293
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,161
Because that's easier than
talking about your husband?

294
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,339
Hey, he's going back to basics,
so, so am I.

295
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,256
You're one who described it
as "getting fired."

296
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,881
I said "kinda" and that was just
shorthand.

297
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,882
As much as I love being
a part of Team Arrow,

298
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,214
as downsized
as it may have become...

299
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,267
It was taking us away from our real
work. Helix, this is where it's at.

300
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,719
And you're not worried about him?

301
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,974
No, he can take care of himself.

302
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,475
And I have been doing this
for over five years.

303
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:56,105
Yeah, in the bunker
with computers and body cams and GPS

304
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,438
so you knew where he was
and what he was doing

305
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,694
and if he was okay.

306
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:05,285
Curtis. Yeah, I thought throwing
myself into work would work,

307
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,407
but it's not working.

308
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,487
I mean, I don't know where he is,

309
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,617
he doesn't tell me
where he is anymore,

310
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,449
I need to know if he's okay.
I'm dying here.

311
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,750
Sorry. News alert.
Shootout in the Glades. Oliver?

312
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,043
<i>The Green Arrow was last
seen in the center of an altercation</i>

313
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,133
<i>moments before the explosion
overtook the area.</i>

314
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,933
<i>SCPD has yet to issue a statement.
We will keep you updated.</i>

315
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,981
You're toying with him.

316
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:41,572
Come on. What's a little fun
between future business partners?

317
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,615
Well, we wouldn't want him to think
that we're wasting his time

318
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,368
by sending him on some fool's errand.

319
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,071
Yeah, that would make anyone furious.

320
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,426
Your daddy buy you this place?

321
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,848
A not-so-shiny toy to distract you

322
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,010
while he's running the real business.

323
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,690
I never got anything from my family.

324
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,814
You know I'm an orphan?

325
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,823
It's true. I grew up
in a real-deal orphanage.

326
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,492
With nuns and...

327
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,990
And everything.

328
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,489
The full package.

329
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,925
There was this older boy.

330
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,720
His name was Jesse.

331
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,265
Jesse thought he was better than me.

332
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,021
And I believed him.

333
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,187
And I was afraid of him.

334
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,276
I'd cry every night.

335
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,993
For years, he treated me like a worm.

336
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,325
Like I was worthless.

337
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,000
Like I was beneath him.

338
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,163
I had to make his bed,
I'd clean our room.

339
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,010
He treated me like
I was his damn servant.

340
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,930
Look at me.

341
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,941
I'm nobody's servant now.

342
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,646
If you cut me, my father will
never give you what you want.

343
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,118
That's prospective, the future.

344
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,367
I'm more interested in the past.

345
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,665
Why did you try and kill him, Eric?

346
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,293
Because I could.

347
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,703
That's not good enough.

348
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,391
Stop!

349
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,094
It was my father's idea.

350
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,021
We were gonna take Star City,

351
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,399
co-op your networks.

352
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,568
Take credit for my sweat equity?

353
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,486
That is so inconsiderate.

354
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,815
It sounds like your
precious little Quadrant

355
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,151
is a bunch of selfish jerks.

356
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,785
They didn't know.

357
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,780
We never told them about you.

358
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,657
What?

359
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,540
My father and I, we never brought
your proposal to the Quadrant.

360
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,415
You're a nobody, so...

361
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,987
Satisfied yet?

362
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,063
No.

363
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,321
You're alive now.
You wanna stay that way?

364
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,163
Tell me when the Quadrant is meeting.

365
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,746
- Tonight.
- Well, isn't that convenient?

366
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,077
You're going to give me
all the details?

367
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,955
They're not just gonna let you in.

368
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,047
I'm not planning on knocking.

369
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:43,973
Somehow we moved past complicated
and straight into crazy.

370
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,066
What I did to Cayden James,

371
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,193
you think that's crazy?

372
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,022
This is manning up.

373
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,158
"Manning up." I hate that phrase.

374
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,368
Okay, let's talk this through.

375
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,992
If the Quadrant is as powerful
as you say,

376
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,665
who knows what kind of firepower
they have in there?

377
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,868
You're selling yourself short, kiddo.

378
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,912
You're better than 10 men.

379
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,255
And if there's more than 10?

380
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,457
Trust me.

381
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,635
While I appreciate
your self-confidence,

382
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,930
you could be overestimating
your powers of persuasion

383
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,929
by just a little bit.

384
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,853
You might not be their favorite
person in the world,

385
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,102
considering what we've just done
to the prince of hair gel.

386
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,524
I said, trust me.

387
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,362
And I would find it
a whole lot easier to do so

388
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,191
if you could just tell me why
it is so important

389
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,776
for you to be a part
of this exclusive club.

390
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,279
There are other ways
you can build your empire.

391
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,329
It's not about empire-building.
It's about respect.

392
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,956
Right, which you want.

393
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,131
And you're willing to disrespect
yourself in order to get it from them.

394
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,627
- That's not how it is.
- Really?

395
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,176
Because that's how it looks
like it is.

396
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,596
Back at that bar,
you were talking about Jerry

397
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,672
like he's still haunting you.

398
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:04,512
Jesse. It's "Jesse." And he does.

399
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,184
Little bastard was right,
I'm a loser.

400
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,943
Well, not anymore.

401
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:18,859
Hey, now you're a king.
Forget about him.

402
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,907
I can't.

403
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:30,754
I was afraid of Jesse for so long
that all I had was my fear.

404
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,675
So I named that fear.

405
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,052
- "The Dragon."
- That's cute.

406
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,348
I've lived with the Dragon
for so long

407
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,642
that it's all I had.

408
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,566
But now being a part of the Quadrant,
I'm gonna have something else.

409
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,033
That type of power,
well, I'll never be nothing again.

410
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,659
You remind me of the guy
that brought me here.

411
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,371
To this Earth.

412
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,547
He had so much hate inside of him,

413
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,251
it took control over him.

414
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,927
I control the Dragon.

415
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,428
It doesn't control me.

416
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,694
We're here.

417
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,405
You coming or not?

418
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,085
Glad you decided to come.

419
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,048
Someone's got to make sure
you don't get yourself killed.

420
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,718
That's why I'm glad.

421
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,568
If the Quadrants are everything
you say they are,

422
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,815
they're gonna see this coming.

423
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:22,775
Maybe. But family can be blinding.

424
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,132
You think they saw that coming?

425
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,943
We got incoming.

426
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,400
That sounds like a little bit more
than the 11 guys he said there were.

427
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,322
Had to soften the beach.
C-4 sends a message.

428
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,830
Why don't you send another one?

429
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,263
Now the beach is soft.

430
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,757
I went through a lot of trouble
to get to this meeting.

431
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,510
It didn't have to be though.

432
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,305
You killed my son.

433
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,181
C-4 killed your son.

434
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,808
Do you have any idea who I am?
Who we are?

435
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,935
Yeah.

436
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,651
It's why I wanted to meet.

437
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,525
If you know who we are,
you know I'm not going to kill you

438
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,355
for what you did to my boy.

439
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,816
Well, that's a relief.

440
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,994
I'm going to send you someplace
far away from here.

441
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,991
To a hospital I own.

442
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:38,293
They know every way there is to keep
a man alive

443
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,745
as other men carve pieces out of him.

444
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,707
Sure.

445
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,710
Sure, you could go that way.

446
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,132
You could try.

447
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:54,893
But if you do,
it'll cost you billions.

448
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,561
Annually.

449
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,849
Take him.
But make sure he doesn't die.

450
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,896
Wait.

451
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,853
He killed my boy.

452
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,609
Frankly, I'm surprised your idiot son
made it this far.

453
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,990
Talk as if your life
depended upon it. Because it does.

454
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,074
Like I said,

455
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,916
it wasn't supposed to be this way.

456
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,591
Mr. Cartier's son

457
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,345
was supposed to arrange this meeting
without bloodshed.

458
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,184
But Cartier Sr., he wanted
to go another way.

459
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,765
Because you're not fit to be
in the same room as us.

460
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,275
You're a street thug.

461
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,528
Not even qualified to work on
one of our crews.

462
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,446
I came to this meeting

463
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,742
because I have
a business proposition.

464
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,031
You know what's happening
in Star City, right?

465
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,872
I see it's falling apart.
I've seen chaos.

466
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:06,047
No, no, no. Controlled chaos.

467
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:13,256
What you see as dysfunction,
I see a machine

468
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,258
running on full efficiency.

469
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:24,566
I control the PD, City Hall,
the ports, the rails...

470
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:31,072
I control everything. And it could
all be yours. All of it.

471
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,112
In exchange for one thing.

472
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,324
One thing.

473
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,037
A seat

474
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,037
at this table.

475
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,254
I don't see an empty chair.

476
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,672
Even if there was one,

477
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,379
I would never sit beside the man
who killed my own blood.

478
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,965
He pushed me to it.

479
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,849
And he pushed and he pushed,

480
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,931
and he pushed.

481
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,984
A man's got his limitations.

482
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,438
And you are mine.

483
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,157
Look at you.

484
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,114
A street thug

485
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,075
who couldn't even keep himself
out of prison. You're nothing.

486
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,712
A loser.

487
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,088
Oh.

488
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,133
Looky here.

489
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,891
That's an empty seat.

490
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:52,738
We are successful because we're
deliberate, disciplined and precise.

491
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,944
We're not animals killing
each other for scraps.

492
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,197
We are civilized. This is not.

493
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,448
But your proposal intrigues us,
Mr. Diaz.

494
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,788
We'd like to hear more.

495
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,268
Let's get started.

496
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,533
What's wrong?

497
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,950
You got what you wanted.
You're not a loser anymore.

498
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,452
You are a legitimate crime lord.

499
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,784
And yet, you still seem on edge.

500
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,211
You think a ring and a seat
at the table changes things for me?

501
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,124
I think we ran a gauntlet
because you thought it would.

502
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,253
It's not over yet.

503
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,389
There's still one last thing
I have to care of.

504
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,973
Can I help you?

505
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,852
Oliver?

506
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,861
<i>There are no survivors
in the explosion that consumed</i>

507
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,662
<i>a city block in the Glades
earlier this evening.</i>

508
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,241
<i>Given the power of the blast,
experts say that</i>

509
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,372
<i>forensics may be required</i>

510
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,203
<i>to determine the fate
of the Green Arrow.</i>

511
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,748
Come on.

512
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,175
Hey, you.

513
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,128
- Oh, my God.
- You okay?

514
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,964
Oh, my God.

515
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,388
I saw the explosion on the news

516
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,140
and you were right
in the middle of it.

517
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,267
Yeah. No, I fired a grappling arrow.

518
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,566
It flew backwards,
right out of there. I'm fine.

519
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,019
- Well, I'm not.
- Okay.

520
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,862
Worrying about you out here is...

521
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,608
Well, it's completely different from
worrying about you in the bunker.

522
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,068
Right, because when
you're in the bunker

523
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,777
you feel like
you can make a difference.

524
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,991
I can. I can make a difference.

525
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:56,250
I can deploy backup. I can do...
I don't know, I can do something.

526
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,455
Out here...

527
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,295
I'm helpless out here.

528
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,845
You aren't helpless anywhere. Ever.

529
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,259
And I'm not helpless either.
All right?

530
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,305
I made a promise
to that guy in there.

531
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,349
I would always come back.

532
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,858
William made an excellent point
when he said

533
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,148
you coming back is not always
going to be your decision.

534
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,108
William does make excellent points.

535
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:31,456
But I made the promise anyway.

536
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,374
I'm making the same promise to you.
Right here, and right now.

537
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,665
Felicity,

538
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,464
I will always come back.

539
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,811
Let's go.

540
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,562
I've been waiting an hour.

541
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,321
Get up the stairs.

542
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,364
I know you hate waiting.

543
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,417
Who's this?

544
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,000
That last thing
I have to take care of.

545
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,374
I've got kids.

546
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,626
They need me, please. Please.

547
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,463
Don't hurt me. Whatever you want,
I can give it to you.

548
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,720
You're lucky if you got two dimes
to rub together

549
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,551
on a good day.

550
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,516
How do you know me?

551
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,015
What?

552
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,686
What?

553
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,156
How do I know you?

554
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:56,457
I've known you my whole life.

555
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,083
What?

556
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:04,715
Laurel, meet Jesse Frederico.

557
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,170
Jesse,

558
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,257
meet Laurel.

559
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,007
I don't think people are supposed
to know that Laurel's working

560
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,592
with a crime lord.

561
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,184
"Crime lord." Crime lord.

562
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:23,730
I love the sound of that.

563
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,198
You really don't remember me?

564
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,411
<i>Chillón.</i>

565
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,662
Diaz?

566
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,999
That is really disappointing.

567
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,380
I thought I made a bigger impression.

568
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,296
On your knees.

569
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,354
Hey, what are you doing?

570
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,942
Getting my payback.

571
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,112
I think that this is
a little bit more than payback.

572
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,623
See that?

573
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,717
I took this from the fire.

574
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,390
I stuck my hand

575
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,056
right in.

576
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,350
I had blisters.

577
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,526
I had raw, cracked skin.

578
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,947
For weeks!

579
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,451
Hey, Jesse.

580
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,992
Hey.

581
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,330
You still like fire?

582
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,556
Ricardo.

583
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,510
I promised myself

584
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,309
when the time was right

585
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,560
that I'd get my payback...

586
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,234
When I wasn't a loser.
