1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,599
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,240
Roy! Roy!
Roy, stop it!

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,955
<i>They're dead.</i>

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,599
<i>We have to
protect him.</i>

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,376
<i>Yeah. As far
as the SCPD is concerned,</i>

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,392
<i>Emiko is the one who
killed those guards.</i>

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,136
Thank you for wiping that
security camera footage.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,550
I could not get there
before the cops did.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,915
I thought that was you.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,336
The Ninth Circle
has Archer.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,080
They are going to use the
intel they get from the assets

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,517
to locate the DNA of the
people involved in Cygnus X-1.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,354
And that DNA could lead them to
exactly where that weapon is.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,433
I copied Archer's
root code.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,876
No. As long as
Archer's out there,

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,816
it could fall into the wrong hands,
and I don't know what

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,672
<i>my legacy's gonna be,
but it can't be that.</i>

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,680
You'll die a villain just like our father,

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,275
and I will be the cause
of both of your deaths.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,589
What did you say?

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,434
I had the chance to warn our
father about the gambit,

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,840
Sara!

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,296
<i>That it was rigged
to explode,</i>

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,720
<i>and I knew about it.</i>

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,439
I let our father die
because he didn't

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,954
deserve to live,

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,157
and neither do you.
Bye, brother.

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,436
Overwatch? John?

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,160
Need some help?

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,360
Tommy?

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,477
Hey, Ollie.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,394
It's been a while.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,793
John!

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,709
Rene?

35
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,913
Dinah!

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,394
Can anyone hear me?

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,512
<i>I'm here!</i>

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,399
<i>I'm here.</i>

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,798
Ohh!

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,676
You OK?

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,075
I'm good.

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,672
Can't say much
for my helmet.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,558
You good?

44
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,917
Well, my Bo staff's smashed,
but other than that.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,196
- Where's Rene?
- I don't know.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,391
- Rene!
- Rene!

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,392
Rene!

48
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,510
Rene!

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,240
<i>You guys want to
get me out of here?</i>

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,431
Rene, are you
in there?

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,670
He's here.
He's here.

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,353
Get him out!

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,639
- You OK?
- Move it.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,439
We can't do it.

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,874
Here. Hurry!

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,456
- Let's try this.
- Grab it, grab it, grab it.

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,836
Grab it. Dinah,
pull on 3, OK?

58
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,336
- OK.
- All right. Ready?

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,999
- Yeah.
- 1, 2, 3. Come on!

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,919
Got you.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,716
What the hell
just happened?

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,176
Emiko just dropped
a building on us.

63
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,714
That's what happened.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,950
We got to get
to Oliver.

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,077
As we lost contact,
he was chasing Emiko

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,270
on the floor
beneath us.

67
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,795
- We have to get there.
- Then we better hurry.

68
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,674
Hey. Quick. Urgent.
I need our uplink gain augmenter.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,800
Uh, more urgent,
I have something to tell you bef...

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,656
OK. Your thing is definitely
not more urgent than mine.

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,070
- Welcome to my thing.
- What are they doing?

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,336
Don't they remember
we're on the same side,

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,416
deputized vigilantes
and everything?

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,576
Well, apparently,
they have a warrant.

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,876
They what?!
H-hi. Excuse me. What...

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,696
an anonymous source sent
us surveillance footage

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,996
of last night's incident
in the subway tunnels.

78
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
Where you see
Team Arrow valiantly foil

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,518
a terrorist attack
just like we told you?

80
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,391
Emiko Adachi didn't
kill those guards.

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,392
Your friend
Roy Harper did.

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Then your whole team
lied to cover it up.

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,554
That's insane.

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,518
Digital forensics
also investigated

85
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,776
that bomb, which you said was
the work of The Ninth Circle...

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,439
- Uh-huh.
- But that file was activated

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,398
from a program
called Archer,

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,597
a program which Smoak
tech owns the patent for.

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,353
Well, technically, yes,
but it was stolen.

90
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
This has to be a mistake.
I mean...

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,056
I agree. I know
this sounds shady,

92
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,136
but trust me...
we are the good guys,

93
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,040
and we are after the bad
guys... well, bad girl,

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,400
who currently has
your captain

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,437
and my husband trapped
under a building.

96
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,576
We haven't received any word
about no buildings going down.

97
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,160
That's because it was
a small detonation

98
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,759
in a chemical plant
outside of town.

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,832
Listen! You can talk
to the team all about it,

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,036
but to get ahold
of them,

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,016
I have to get ahold of a really tiny,
delicate piece of tech

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,856
that is in that box that
lieutenant butterfingers

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
is rummaging through.

104
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,679
I'm sorry,
Ms. Smoak.

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,920
- You're under arrest.
- What?

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,593
- You can't do that!
- Yes, I can.

107
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,830
Turn around!

108
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,834
OK. Just... Let me
give my friend a hug first.

109
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,800
Go ahead.

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,553
Plug your ears.

111
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,754
What the hell
was that?

112
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,519
Oh. It's part
of my new security system,

113
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,114
a remote-detonated
nanoelectric pulse

114
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,360
that I built
into the ceiling.

115
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,856
Oh. Remind me to never
get on your bad side.

116
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,439
- Is Oliver OK?
- I don't know.

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,680
I tried. All I got
was static,

118
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,816
but if I can boost
the signal,

119
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,896
I might be able
to contact them.

120
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,230
You mean if we can.
I'm not letting you

121
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,879
do this alone.

122
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,395
OK. Well, then
let's get out of here.

123
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,517
We do not want to be here
when these guys wake up.

124
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,356
<i>Crime, violence, anarchy.</i>

125
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,272
<i>The terrible disease
that once infected</i>

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,716
<i>the streets of The Glades
has risen again,</i>

127
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,235
<i>but there is a cure
to the vigilante problem</i>

128
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,392
<i>and a chance
for a better, brighter future...</i>

129
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,598
<i>ZETA, powered
by Galaxy One's Archer Program.</i>

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,514
<i>They are the front lines
of a citywide initiative</i>

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,193
<i>to end the vigilante menace</i>

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,036
<i>and restore Star City's
glory once and for all.</i>

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,056
First, Galaxy One puts
a bounty on your heads.

134
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,296
Now they're sending a damn army
of super robots after you?

135
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,879
We are just Keven Dale's
scapegoats

136
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,996
for his larger agenda.

137
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,150
Which is what?

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,914
Turn Star City
into a police state,

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,798
go under Galaxy One's
control.

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,950
We can't let
that happen.

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
Oh, yeah?
And how exactly

142
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,496
are we supposed
to stop them?

143
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,035
By destroying Archer.

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
We tried that
once, remember?

145
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,279
It didn't work then,
and Archer was

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,953
nowhere near as
advanced as it is now.

147
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,616
That's why we have to
find the mad scientist

148
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,280
who upgraded my creation
into Frankenstein's monster.

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,496
You sure that's
a good idea?

150
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,036
No, but if Galaxy One has an army
of Archer-powered assassins,

151
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,874
we don't stand a chance,

152
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,917
Star City loses.

153
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,718
Well,
I'll put the word out to what's left

154
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,029
of the canary
network,

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,474
see what intel
they can find.

156
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,176
You know,
if you need a quick and dirty virus,

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,536
I'm sure I can whip
something up in no time.

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,656
It won't work.
I've tried them all.

159
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,040
But if the network
is still online,

160
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,480
then they can
still track our DNA,

161
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,631
- so we need a plan "b."
- I have a plan "b!"

162
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,750
And all of my plans
include you laying low

163
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,071
and staying safe.

164
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,193
Leave Archer to me.

165
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,594
Thank you.

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,593
You look shocked.

167
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,036
Um, is it the beard?

168
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,430
Uh-uh. You look good.

169
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,954
Yeah, I know.

170
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,033
I must have
a really bad concussion.

171
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,919
Yeah, man. A building
just collapsed on you.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,356
It could be a little
PTSD, too.

173
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,433
That position that
you're in with the rebar,

174
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,958
it is remarkably similar to how
you found me all those years ago.

175
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,554
The night you died.

176
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,869
Yeah.

177
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,871
And I got to tell you, man,
it looks like

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,400
the same thing is
gonna happen to you

179
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,312
if you don't get out
of here, like, right now.

180
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,675
- Yeah?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,199
Ooh. Yeah.
That was close.

182
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,273
Um... you think you want to
pop that thing back in?

183
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,717
- Mm-hmm.
- OK. 1, 2, and 3.

184
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,393
Aah!

185
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,872
- That had to hurt.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,520
You have Oliver
angry face on right now.

187
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,956
Just saying.

188
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,752
I got to get out
of here.

189
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,389
The team might be dead.

190
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,118
Everything we've built
with the SCPD is... Is gone

191
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,759
because of Emiko.

192
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,336
I need to... I need to
get out of here.

193
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,999
I need to find the others,

194
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,560
and we have to stop her.

195
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,313
Um, isn't that gonna
be kind of hard

196
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,550
considering she's
family?

197
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,836
She's not
my family anymore.

198
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,136
Well, I hope you
weren't planning

199
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,516
on using your bow
to get out of here

200
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,592
'cause...

201
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,314
Yep.

202
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,038
Overwatch?
Arsenal?

203
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,351
Does anyone copy?

204
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,216
You know,
I know that you were worried about them,

205
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,879
but they are pretty
resourceful people.

206
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,429
They're probably fine.

207
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's hope you're right.

208
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
I usually am.

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,593
You know, it is insane
that we both had

210
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,194
secret half sisters.

211
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,976
Well, yours didn't try
to kill you, did she?

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,520
Well, you should give
Thea some credit.

213
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,717
I died before she had
the chance to try.

214
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,078
A couple specialty Arrows left,
two explosive.

215
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,231
<i>Seems kind of risky
considering</i>

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,676
<i>the instability
of this place,</i>

217
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,120
especially
without a bow.

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,634
Well, there are solutions
for that.

219
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,638
Speaking of, uh,
what about Emiko?

220
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,837
What kind of solution

221
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,320
are you planning
for her?

222
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,434
The one she deserves.

223
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,036
She let our father die.

224
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,840
He abandoned her,
Oliver.

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
She's been manipulating me,

226
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,598
she's been manipulating
the team for months,

227
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,071
posing as some sort
of hero.

228
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,793
The woman's a murderer.

229
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,952
So now you're gonna
be one, too?

230
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,720
And here I thought that we
were done with all of that.

231
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,474
I don't see another
choice here, Tommy.

232
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,951
It is exactly that kind
of attitude

233
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,271
that's gonna keep you
stuck down here.

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,678
Looks like your mystery
contact is as good

235
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,096
at covering their
tracks as you are.

236
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,158
Ugh. I know, which is
why she's so dangerous

237
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,471
and annoying.

238
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,791
So I think I finally figured out a plan "b"

239
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,078
to keep us hidden from Archer
while we try to destroy it.

240
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,839
Blindspots just like the one
Keven Dale used to mask his DNA.

241
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,336
The only way this is
going to work is

242
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,416
if we copy the exact
root code that was used

243
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
in the original.

244
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,159
OK. Well, how
do we do that?

245
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Well, we'd have to steal it
from Keven Dale's computer

246
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,596
in his office
at Galaxy One.

247
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,478
Uh, I suppose
I could break in.

248
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,439
No, no. I'm sorry.
Not you. Me.

249
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,231
I mean, Keven Dale
already recognizes me

250
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
as a fellow ceo,
and besides,

251
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,394
I think he'd be
a lot more agreeable

252
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,278
to me than... You.

253
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,216
You know, a little flirty flirt
while I hack into his computer,

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,596
and then we'll get
what we need.

255
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,752
- Look. I know it's a risk.
- A big one.

256
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,000
One I am not
willing to take.

257
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,675
We have a plan "a."
Let's stick to it.

258
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,195
Like I said, just
leave it to me.

259
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,000
You know you're still
treating me like I'm 13.

260
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
What do you mean?

261
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,354
Uh, I mean that you're doing
the exact same thing to me now

262
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,193
that you and dad did
all those years ago,

263
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,296
leaving me out of things
and then getting rid of me.

264
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,676
Your father and I,
we never wanted to let you go.

265
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,195
But you did,
and then even

266
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,056
after everything that happened,
you still stayed away

267
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,676
like... like I wasn't even
part of this family.

268
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,480
Ooh. I thought
we had problems.

269
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm just gonna go
do anything else.

270
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,830
William, I am so sorry.

271
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,197
I realize now that we
made a terrible mistake,

272
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,394
a mistake that I am going to
regret for the rest of my life,

273
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,040
but we really thought
we were protecting you.

274
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,914
We just wanted you to
have a normal life.

275
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,990
At this rate, we won't find
Oliver until sometime next week.

276
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,896
Felicity, cutting in and out:
<i>Team Arrow, do you copy?</i>

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,514
<i>Team Arrow, do you copy?</i>

278
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,670
Overwatch,
is that you?

279
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,114
Yes. Are you guys OK?

280
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,736
You have me, Roy, Rene,
and Dinah. We're safe.

281
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
<i>And Oliver?</i>

282
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,071
He was in another part
of the building. We...

283
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
we haven't been
able to contact him.

284
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,816
I'm guessing you
haven't either.

285
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,991
No, but his comm unit is
still online and active,

286
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,856
so if it wasn't crushed,
it means he wasn't either.

287
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,758
- We'll find him.
<i>- I know.</i>

288
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,672
<i>You guys should know
I don't know what</i>

289
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,638
<i>Emiko is planning,
but she gave the SCPD</i>

290
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,552
<i>the footage of Roy
in the subway tunnels,</i>

291
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,994
<i>and they think that
we are behind</i>

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,594
<i>whatever The Ninth Circle
is plotting.</i>

293
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,400
So lying to the SCPD to cover
for Roy was for nothing.

294
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,675
Not to mention
our reputations

295
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,194
and everything
we built this year.

296
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,194
Yeah. Let's move.

297
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,309
You've always been good
at this kind of thing.

298
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,119
Remember when we
were kids

299
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,352
and you learned how to
hotwire my dad's car?

300
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,555
Well, I got grounded
for an entire summer.

301
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,950
Yeah, because you
did it 3 more times.

302
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,114
Then it's a good thing

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,237
I should only have to
do this once.

304
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,040
Uh-huh. You might only
be making this worse.

305
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,816
All the work we've done
to prove ourselves

306
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,480
to the cops,
to the city.

307
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,836
And poof!
It's just gone.

308
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,957
- Along with my job.
- We don't know that.

309
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,600
All we know is that Emiko
tried to set us up.

310
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,360
Well, yeah. She lied about us being
behind The Ninth Circle attacks,

311
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,359
but she was telling the truth about
us covering up those murders.

312
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
We never should
have done that.

313
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,673
Wait. Even if it meant
Roy going to prison?

314
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,989
Two people were murdered.

315
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,675
I'm gonna turn
myself in.

316
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
- It's the only way.
- No, you're not.

317
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,640
You've already taken
the fall for us once, Roy.

318
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Let us help you
this time.

319
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,917
And because of that,
everything you've worked for

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,037
is at risk.

321
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,238
He's right. I'm sorry,
but the SCPD

322
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,736
has already tried
to arrest Felicity.

323
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,056
It's better one of us
takes the fall

324
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,117
than the rest of us spends
our lives as fugitives.

325
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,715
While we're arguing,
Emiko's out there planning.

326
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,632
We need to get out
of here and stop her.

327
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,032
Oh, that can't be good.

328
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,753
Move, move, move!
Go, go, go, go!

329
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,656
All right. Is
everybody all right?

330
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,558
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure.

331
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,200
- Now the lights come on.
- Uh, guys, if the lights

332
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,216
just came on, that means the
emergency generator just came on.

333
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,776
- That's a good thing, right?
<i>- Normally, yeah,</i>

334
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,096
but the building you're in
used to manufacture

335
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,873
some very flammable
chemicals,

336
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,280
and flammable chemicals plus
sparks equals really big boom.

337
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,936
- OK. What about Oliver?
- If you don't turn off

338
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,336
the generator soon,
there's gonna be no Oliver to find.

339
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,353
The entire building's gonna go up in flames,
and you with it.

340
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,119
All right.
Let's keep moving.

341
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,834
Felicity, we're in
the boiler room.

342
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,480
OK. Please tell me
that's not the generator.

343
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,751
Well, if it sounds like
a sick dinosaur, it probably is.

344
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,513
Good news is we still
have about 8 minutes

345
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,096
before it incinerates
the whole building.

346
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,554
And where is it exactly?

347
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,677
<i>Lower level, to your left.</i>

348
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,915
What do we
think that is?

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,310
- C6H6.
- Benzene.

350
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
Guys, that is
really bad stuff.

351
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,552
- How bad?
- Try irreparable nerve damage

352
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,176
with severe convulsions
and a painful death.

353
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,816
But the good news is
it's heavier than air,

354
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,399
so you are safe
on the mezzanine. Heh.

355
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,896
And the bad news is that
generator is not on the mezzanine.

356
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,036
Neither is Oliver.

357
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,296
The ground beneath your feet is airtight,
so it can't get to him.

358
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,936
Well, I prefer my friends alive,
so we're gonna have to find

359
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,112
a new way to get you
to the generator, and fast.

360
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,392
Again, I would like
to point out

361
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,154
how structurally unsound
this building appears to be,

362
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,836
so maybe upping the payload
is not the best idea.

363
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,798
It's a risk
I have to take.

364
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
This is it.
After this, I'm out of options.

365
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,559
Are you, or is this
just typical Oliver?

366
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,834
Now come on, man.
Don't you ever wonder

367
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
why you keep finding yourself
in positions like this

368
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,553
where things just keep
getting worse?

369
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,475
I'm here for one reason and
one reason only... Emiko.

370
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,395
Right. Emiko,
your half sister.

371
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,551
Her being my half sister
doesn't matter.

372
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,792
What matters is finding
her and stopping her

373
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,076
before she hurts
anyone else.

374
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,674
It's a strategy you
should appreciate.

375
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,717
Why? Because of what
my father did to The Glades?

376
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,269
No, Tommy, because
of what he did to you!

377
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,035
Any idea what it's
like to... to...

378
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,876
to run a scenario through
your head a million times,

379
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,590
just wondering
if you could've just

380
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,515
listened to me
a little bit sooner,

381
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,436
but you didn't
because you were blinded

382
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,354
by the fact that
he was your father.

383
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,552
Maybe you'd still be
alive today.

384
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,239
But I didn't listen,

385
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,275
and I didn't make
the right choice,

386
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,034
at least not
until it was too late,

387
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,435
because I was stuck,
Oliver, in my own cycle,

388
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,319
my father's cycle,
just like you are

389
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,835
and just like you
will continue to be

390
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,560
if you don't
break free.

391
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,830
No. No. You're wrong.

392
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,309
This isn't about me.

393
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,596
This is not
about my father.

394
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,752
This is about Emiko,

395
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,435
<i>and the choices that
she made,</i>

396
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,311
they are on her.

397
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,760
Overwatch, any luck figuring
out that alternate approach?

398
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,096
<i>Looks like there's
a room behind the generator</i>

399
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,236
with a failsafe switch.

400
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,437
The air ducts should be
able to get you in there.

401
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,272
All right. Yeah. Looks like we're
gonna have to crawl there fast.

402
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,680
<i>Yeah.</i>

403
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,999
We'll never
make it in time.

404
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,711
- Roy, no!
- Roy, no!

405
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,600
Roy, if you breathe that stuff in,
you're dead.

406
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,799
I know.

407
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,234
Stop! We'll find
another way!

408
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,792
There's not enough time.

409
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,955
No!

410
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,216
Please don't tell me
he just went in there!

411
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,696
Overwatch, tell me
how much time he has.

412
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,154
10 seconds,
maybe 12.

413
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,630
Roy, I'm gonna need
a sitrep. Talk to me, Roy!

414
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,230
<i>Roy? Roy!</i>

415
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,713
He did it.

416
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,999
<i>He did it.</i>

417
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,399
He did it.

418
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,636
<i>- Oh!
- Roy!</i>

419
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,518
Oh. Come on.

420
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,437
Are you OK?

421
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,552
Overwatch,
power's off.

422
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,393
We're headed out
to find Oliver.

423
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,833
Copy that.

424
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,754
I don't know how you ever
breathe on this job.

425
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,718
I don't.

426
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,473
Come on, Oliver.
Where are you?

427
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,555
Hey. Um, Random question.

428
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,997
Did you add another hero
to your justice league?

429
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,316
You I expected.

430
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
Too bad for your friend.

431
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,599
Please don't.

432
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,478
I thought you'd be
eager to join you husband.

433
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,040
Please don't kill me!
I'm pregnant!

434
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,630
This baby
is innocent

435
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,872
just like you were when
Robert left your family.

436
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,914
Please don't kill
an innocent child.

437
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,590
Good to know.

438
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,909
Aah!

439
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,838
I think the concrete
gives up.

440
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,797
I need to get out of here.

441
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,395
You will. Trust me.

442
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,696
What you really need
to worry about

443
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,313
is what happens
when you do.

444
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,713
- Why?
- Everything you've done

445
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,678
this year... working
with the cops,

446
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,399
fighting for the city
without a mask...

447
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,951
you've got a shot at
something we never had.

448
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,918
What's that?

449
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,798
A clean slate.

450
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,438
You can't shed your past,
but you can keep it

451
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,034
from hurting your kids.

452
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,954
That's something our parents
could never give us,

453
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,319
but it is never, ever
going to happen, Oliver,

454
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,790
if you keep seeing red
with Emiko.

455
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,793
As long as she's
still breathing,

456
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,678
my family will never
be safe.

457
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,319
You know this, Tommy.

458
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,235
Then you haven't moved past
your family's mistakes, Oliver.

459
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,994
You haven't broken
the cycle of lies and hate.

460
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,037
You're trapped.
You're trapped

461
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,157
just like you are
in this room.

462
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,195
But you're not here.

463
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,237
You are a...

464
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,119
you are a figment
of my imagination

465
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,240
that has been sent here
to test my resolve.

466
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,840
Won't work.

467
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,273
Looks like you found
your way out.

468
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,512
To stop Emiko,
if I need to be

469
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,753
as ruthless to her
as she was to my father,

470
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,559
so be it.

471
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,199
Good luck finding
your team, Oliver.

472
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,679
You're gonna need them.

473
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,714
Good-bye, Tommy.

474
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,959
Comms just
dropped off.

475
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,878
Yeah.
We should be getting closer to Oliver.

476
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,992
- You need a minute?
- No.

477
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,471
Ugh! Yeah. OK.
Maybe I do.

478
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,994
Why don't you guys
go ahead,

479
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,116
find us a way
downstairs?

480
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,680
We'll catch up.

481
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,793
You must be
a pretty big idiot,

482
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,234
risking your life
like that.

483
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,720
Well, we're alive,
aren't we?

484
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,632
You're lucky to be.

485
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,109
I'm surprised you even care if
I made it out alive or not.

486
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
Of course I care.

487
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,356
You're our teammate.

488
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,671
Maybe I shouldn't be.

489
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,558
You lost everything
to protect me,

490
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,120
and you don't
even know me.

491
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,192
<i>Those guards that
I killed,</i>

492
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,431
they're innocent.

493
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,113
They had families.

494
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,351
What you did back there,

495
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
it was awful,

496
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,392
but we all know
it was the bloodlust, Roy.

497
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
That wasn't you.

498
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,776
No. That doesn't
change the fact that

499
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,837
I put everyone else
around me at risk.

500
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,991
You should have just
let me go to prison.

501
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,509
I was wrong.
We all make mistakes.

502
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,796
I was just pissed because we
had just lost everything.

503
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,519
That doesn't mean
I want you dead.

504
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,160
Maybe it's best if
I am 6 feet under.

505
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,192
Dying is the coward's
way out.

506
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,317
Every day that you
stay alive,

507
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,516
you try to redeem
yourself

508
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,796
for that messed-up
thing you did

509
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,079
because this world
is a better place

510
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,959
with a hero like you.

511
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,632
Now let's go.

512
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,553
Bunker is clear
and secure.

513
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,040
- You OK?
- Yeah. Doesn't seem to be

514
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,032
any permanent damage.

515
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Just rebooting
the system,

516
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,320
get the comms
up and running,

517
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,656
and then I'm gonna check
to see if Oliver's OK.

518
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,876
Uh, let me repeat.
You. Are you OK?

519
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,350
Almost dying?
Nothing I haven't done 100 times before.

520
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,776
- Am I right?
- Well, the first time you've

521
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,234
done it when it's
not just you.

522
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,471
Sadly, no.

523
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,256
William, the poor kid,
I mean, all he ever wanted

524
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,556
was a normal life...

525
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,600
loses his mom,
gets kidnapped way too many times,

526
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,354
the final straw...
being taken hostage by a serial killer.

527
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,911
I mean, how's life gonna be
any different for this kid?

528
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,434
You'll make it
different.

529
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,240
You know, you make
that sound so easy.

530
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,233
Growing up,
my parents,

531
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,791
it's just that they
made my life miserable,

532
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,679
and I promised myself
that I would do better

533
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,319
when I became
a parent, that I would...

534
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,359
I would... I would
just be better,

535
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,798
and I imagined this... this...
this life, and this is not it.

536
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,750
I mean, somehow, I've
done something worse,

537
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,753
and I've created
this life where i...

538
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,031
I can't even keep
my children safe.

539
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,830
Hey. At Smoak Tech,
you defended yourself like a badass.

540
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,071
You will find a way
to protect those kids.

541
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,799
- How?
- Think of it like

542
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,314
a computer program.

543
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,675
How do you secure
a system?

544
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,956
You get a really good
firewall,

545
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,474
and you take it offline.

546
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,552
I can't exactly take my
entire life off the grid.

547
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Well, why not?

548
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,790
I have a company
for one.

549
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,475
Well, luckily, you have
a fantastic cto

550
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,075
who can run it
for you.

551
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,856
You want a different
life for this kid, right?

552
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,839
- Yes.
- Well, then

553
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,391
you're gonna need to do
something different this time.

554
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,039
Yeah.

555
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,194
<i>Crime, violence, anarchy.</i>

556
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,953
<i>The terrible disease
that once infected</i>

557
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,509
<i>the streets of The Glades
has risen again,</i>

558
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,035
<i>but there is a cure
to the vigilante problem</i>

559
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,600
<i>and a chance
for a better...</i>

560
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,176
Thought you were supposed
to go with Felicity

561
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,237
in case her friend
needed convincing.

562
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,879
She took Roy instead.

563
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,274
Guess she's trying
to protect me, too.

564
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,856
You know,
if you're trying to make me feel better

565
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,873
about being abandoned
by our parents,

566
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,110
just don't.

567
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,680
Fine. Have your
little pity party

568
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,876
because mom
benched you.

569
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,416
You know that's not
what this is about.

570
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,999
Then what is it about?

571
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,151
When we rescued her
from Galaxy One,

572
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,232
mom apologized,
you guys seemed cool.

573
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,277
Yeah. I thought
we were, too,

574
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,000
but she's still pushing me
away just like she always has.

575
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
OK. Fine.
So maybe she wasn't there for you

576
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,917
in the traditional
sense,

577
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,959
but mom made sure that your
company was a success.

578
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,713
She was trying.

579
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,679
I didn't need
her money, Mia.

580
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,991
I needed a mother.

581
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,656
To this day, Felicity
still hasn't told me

582
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,637
why she kept me out
of her life for so long

583
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,476
or... why she wanted
no part of mine.

584
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
Look.

585
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,317
When I first found out
mom was keeping secrets,

586
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,359
that she was still
being a vigilante,

587
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,955
I didn't wallow and
feel sorry for myself.

588
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,710
I confronted her,
demanded answers.

589
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,237
Maybe it's time
you do the same.

590
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,075
John?

591
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,833
Oliver!

592
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,754
Oh.
Thank god!

593
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,754
<i>Let's keep moving.</i>

594
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,715
We're lucky this is
still standing.

595
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,439
- Which way?
- East.

596
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,591
Felicity said it was
the best way out.

597
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,320
Oh.
It definitely is.

598
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,029
Hi, brother.

599
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,560
Emiko, you have
one last chance

600
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,960
to stand down!

601
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,271
Funny, I was gonna
say the same to you.

602
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,114
Hyah!

603
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,914
This place is
about to explode!

604
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,320
Oliver, we have to
go now!

605
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,993
Not without her!

606
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,429
Oliver, now!

607
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,396
- It's over.
- Is it?

608
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,352
I know
about your baby.

609
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,312
Your family's
gonna die.

610
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,039
I made sure of it.

611
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,553
Oliver, don't.

612
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,839
Oliver.

613
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,870
John!

614
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,999
Oliver.

615
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,877
<i>Oliver.</i>

616
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
<i>Oliver!</i>

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,799
What was that?

618
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,200
How would I know?

619
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,920
I'm just a figment
of your imagination...

620
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,432
But if I had to guess,

621
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,196
I'd say it's a reminder
of what it feels like.

622
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,639
Seeing my loved ones die?

623
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,036
Seeing my family
be threatened?

624
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,553
What about that don't
I already know? God.

625
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,936
Well, then you know
exactly what it feels like

626
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,519
to be your father.

627
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,796
The fear, how that
leads to vengeance,

628
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,473
how that leads
to cruelty.

629
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,552
It's why he abandoned
Emiko.

630
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,677
It is why she is
trying to kill you now.

631
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,831
Look, Oliver.
I know that you think

632
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,416
that you have broken
your father's cycle,

633
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,557
but as long as you are
giving in

634
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,395
to your worst impulses,
you are never going to be free.

635
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,200
What am I supposed
to do?

636
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,478
Just tell me what
I'm supposed to do.

637
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,952
Lean in to the best
parts of yourself...

638
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,000
<i>your loyalty,
your selflessness,</i>

639
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,118
<i>your courage,
your compassion,</i>

640
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,999
and show that side
to Emiko.

641
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,990
You are living proof
that people can change,

642
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,078
and you have got to find a
way to see that in her, too.

643
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,991
I don't know
if I can.

644
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,797
That's OK. That's the risk
you got to take.

645
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,473
<i>He should be
in there!</i>

646
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,472
<i>Oliver!</i>

647
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,393
Looks like
our time's up.

648
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,719
You know, Tommy,

649
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,597
I miss you
every day.

650
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,956
I know,

651
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,153
but I'm always
with you.

652
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,155
Time to wake up now.

653
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,438
Hey!
He's over here!

654
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,672
- You OK?
- We're gonna get you out.

655
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,216
I thought we lost
you there for a second.

656
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,833
Yeah, so did I.

657
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,031
Oh, thank god
you're alive.

658
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,396
Hey. Are you and the...
Are you OK?

659
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,199
Yeah. Yeah,
we're fine.

660
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,033
Emiko did pay us
a visit, though.

661
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,395
Emiko was here?

662
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,318
If she left
without killing you,

663
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,880
- you got off easy.
- Yeah. Too easy.

664
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,599
She must have been
after something else.

665
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,096
- Our thoughts exactly.
- Yeah, but we checked,

666
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,296
and the only things missing are
a few Arrows from the armory.

667
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,152
Why would she need
Oliver's Arrows

668
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,936
if we already got blamed for
the attack at the subway?

669
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,456
She must have had
something else planned.

670
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,896
Yeah, but Emiko thinks
she killed us.

671
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,416
How could she pin a second attack
against a group of dead vigilantes?

672
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,056
Well, the public doesn't
know that you're dead yet.

673
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,390
Just got an apb.
Green Arrow sighted

674
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,278
outside of SCPD,
shots fired.

675
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,656
At least now we know
what she was after.

676
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,000
Oliver,
we walk in there,

677
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,390
we're going in
as wanted criminals.

678
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,836
Let's gear back up.
We've got to move fast.

679
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,750
Ah. William,
right on time.

680
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,056
After our last meeting,
I'd hoped to hear from you again,

681
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,912
but I never expected
it to be so soon.

682
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,200
Well, you know
what they say...

683
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,799
strike while
the iron's hot.

684
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,474
I hope you don't mind,

685
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,896
but I was so excited
when you said you

686
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,400
<i>wanted to discuss
our ZETA program</i>

687
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,509
that I invited the man who
inspired it to join us.

688
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,750
Mr. Harris.

689
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,400
Mayor Ramirez. Heh.

690
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,711
You two know each other?

691
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,712
By reputation.

692
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,838
I bought Harris Consolidated
the day of its ipo.

693
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,436
- Smart man.
- Well, we've done well enough.

694
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,512
Speaking of
my profit margins,

695
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,080
who do I have to
sleep with to get

696
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,496
Harris Consolidated in
on those ZETAs?

697
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,956
I mean, your commercial
was impressive,

698
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,111
but stopping vigilantes?

699
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,350
It's microthinking.

700
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,040
<i>If you really want this
program to be profitable,</i>

701
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,679
<i>you have to think macro.</i>

702
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,150
I mean, imagine what
an army of ZETAs

703
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,476
could do
on a grander scale,

704
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,438
and with Harris
consolidated's global reach,

705
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,434
why, Galaxy One could change
more than just Star City.

706
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,474
It could change
the world.

707
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,960
If you'll excuse me
a moment, gentlemen,

708
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,256
something's come up which
requires my immediate attention.

709
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,476
Of course.

710
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,832
Have you lost
your damn mind?

711
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,070
You nearly blew
my cover.

712
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,936
I'm sorry.
It was a calculated risk I had to take

713
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,110
to access Dale's files.

714
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,496
Is that why you've been
checking your watch?

715
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,816
<i>You've been hacking
him this whole time?</i>

716
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,160
And now I have
his blindspot code.

717
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,392
We should get out of here
before Dale figures that out.

718
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,439
Seems I
already have, Mr. Harris,

719
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,273
or do you prefer Clayton?

720
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,919
<i>Such a pleasure
to finally meet the son</i>

721
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,196
<i>of Oliver Queen
and Felicity Smoak.</i>

722
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,675
As for you, Mr. Mayor,

723
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,755
<i>I'm afraid we've reached the
end of your political career.</i>

724
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,035
Seize them.

725
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,239
So you're the fool
who's responsible

726
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,800
for this whole
Archer mess.

727
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,440
And you're the kid Felicity
went into hiding for.

728
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,000
I can see you got a lot
of your mom in you.

729
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,714
Well, that's not all you're gonna
see if you don't step back.

730
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,599
Alena has agreed
to help us destroy Archer

731
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,592
for real this time,
isn't that right?

732
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,856
Well,
now that you've frozen my bank account

733
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
and shredded
my passport,

734
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,077
yes, I have.

735
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,350
I'm sorry
about your canaries.

736
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,397
<i>I never meant for Archer
to be used like that.</i>

737
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,996
And how exactly did you
mean for it to be used

738
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,878
after you stole it
from Smoak Tech

739
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,519
and sold it
to Galaxy One?

740
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,160
It started as a
software licensing deal

741
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,709
till Keven Dale turned it
into a hostile takeover.

742
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
<i>Once he had Archer,
he threatened to use it to hunt</i>

743
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,877
and kill everyone I loved
unless I disappeared,

744
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,838
so that's what
I did

745
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,958
to protect them.

746
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,635
Why don't you get
to work taking down Archer,

747
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,757
so we can all come
out of hiding?

748
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,555
I guess 3 genius brains
are better than 1.

749
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,077
Speaking of geniuses,
where is William?

750
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,755
I spoke to him right
after you and Roy left.

751
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,960
Oh. Where the hell is he?

752
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,715
Mom, what's wrong?

753
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,240
That sequence that
William ran

754
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,710
to steal Keven Dale's
blindspot code,

755
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,314
I think he used it.

756
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,616
How? I thought you said he could
only use it if he actually went...

757
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,393
frak!

758
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,032
By the authority
of Galaxy One,

759
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,032
<i>you are under arrest.</i>

760
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,160
Oh, my god.
It's a slaughter.

761
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,996
What happened?

762
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,634
I thought it was you.

763
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,958
Somebody dressed like you stole
the weapon from the subway.

764
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,235
Spread out and find
Emiko.

765
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,913
Wild dog, on me.

766
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,429
Hyah!

767
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,920
Raah!

768
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,195
Hyah!

769
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,556
Emiko!

770
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,199
You just refuse
to die.

771
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,240
Emiko has the weapon,
and she's up on the roof.

772
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,749
Copy that.
We'll meet you there.

773
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,718
Emiko, stop!

774
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,957
Don't make me
do this.

775
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,072
You are supposed
to be dead,

776
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,356
but this will be
even better.

777
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,080
You can watch me burn
your city to the ground.

778
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,800
Haven't you seen
enough death?

779
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,916
Your mother,
our father.

780
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,715
<i>I want you to be
better than him.</i>

781
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,835
I want you to help me...

782
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,480
help me end our family's
cycle of violence.

783
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,631
We are not family.

784
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,240
Do it. Kill me.

785
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,114
No.

786
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,320
She has
