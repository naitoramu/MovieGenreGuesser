1
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,380
After the attack
at the Bulletin

2
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,630
and the horrible tragedy
at the Clinton Church,

3
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,710
what will it take before people realize
that Wilson Fisk was set up by Daredevil?

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,380
People are beginning to realize
Fisk was the victim of a smear campaign.

5
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,890
Daredevil was the one behind it all.

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,430
And what about Daredevil's apologists
like Blake Tower and Karen Page?

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
- She should be in jail.
- We have breaking news

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,150
that Fisk has invited
many of New York's most powerful figures

9
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,730
to the Presidential Hotel
for some kind of surprise announcement.

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Oh.

11
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,160
Kidnapping me
will get you nothing.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,290
- What is Fisk planning?
- Planning?

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,750
I scouted his hotel. Extra security.

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,920
Preparations for some big event.
What is it?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,380
What Fisk will do to me
is infinitely worse...

16
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,510
Things are about to get very bad for you.

17
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,470
What is Fisk planning?

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,930
Do you mind if I come in?

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
Marriage?

20
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,740
He's been planning the ceremony
for months.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,080
He's gonna charm the press and the public
and make Hell's Kitchen love him again.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,580
- Do I look that nervous?
- Yes, a little, but it's charming.

23
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,720
I never knew that I could feel this way
until the day that we met.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,470
I didn't think that I was capable,

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,850
that there would be someone...

26
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,900
that I would care for
more than my own life.

27
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,570
That her happiness would be
more important than anything else.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
And then...

29
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:28,790
a terrifying thought occurred to me
that perhaps my feelings were a trick.

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,460
The self-deception of a vain man.

31
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,550
That the only reason why I love you

32
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,590
is because of the way
I see my reflection in your eyes.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,140
That thought, it fills me with dread.

34
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,770
The fear that...

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,690
that I don't deserve you...

36
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,820
and that I am broken.

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,700
Don't you understand we're all broken?

38
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,490
The point is to find the person
whose broken pieces fit with yours.

39
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,790
You're gonna tell me everything.

40
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,080
I wanna know where everyone is gonna be.

41
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,090
Anyone who could stop me.

42
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,630
Stop you?

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,260
From killing Fisk.

44
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,760
He controls all of the FBI agents
who are guarding him.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,220
The hotel is a fortress.

46
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Is that a no?

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
- You'll never get to him.
- Sounds like a no.

48
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,530
I can give you something better!

49
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,820
I'm listening.

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,700
I witnessed Ms. Marianna
order the murder of Agent Nadeem.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
And Fisk ordered many.

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,040
Agent Winn. Julie Barnes!

53
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,130
I could testify!

54
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,550
I know about Winn and Nadeem.

55
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,180
Who's Julie Barnes?

56
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,180
The rose.

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,190
I think.

58
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,230
Tell me again
how you ended up dangling off a building?

59
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,030
I tripped.

60
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,450
Get him out of here.

61
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,920
I thought "ambulance chaser"
was a figure of speech.

62
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,420
Not one of your best burns, Detective.

63
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,550
I'm not in the mood to be clever today.

64
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,170
Yeah, me neither.

65
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,260
We had him, Foggy.

66
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,220
We were this goddamn close.

67
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
I know.

68
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,600
Instead of locking up that bald asshole,

69
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,390
I had to tell Mrs. Nadeem
she'd never see her husband again.

70
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,520
How did that happen?

71
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,650
I don't know.

72
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,030
Listen.

73
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,950
Something's been brought to my attention.

74
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,240
As an officer of the court,
I'm compelled to report it.

75
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,290
I have reason to believe

76
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,210
that someone's gonna try
to murder Wilson Fisk today.

77
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,290
Someone, huh?

78
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,210
About what time is this going down?
I wanna have some popcorn ready.

79
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,670
Need I remind you
of your obligation to protect and serve?

80
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,840
Stick your obligation up your ass, Nelson.

81
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,970
If Fisk disappears,
all his bullshit goes with him.

82
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,140
And the FBI agents on his payroll
just fold back into the mix.

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,060
Including the one who shot Ray.

84
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,350
Don't think of it as protecting Fisk.

85
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,610
Think of it as protecting
the case we can build

86
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,610
against the shitbags who helped him.

87
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,320
Once we get them,
they'll turn faster than old milk.

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,030
Still, with Fisk gone,
we'll get 'em eventually.

89
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,200
Brett, please.

90
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,290
This certain someone
we're talking about...

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,330
he's angry.

92
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,420
But I know he'll do the right thing
if I can just slow him down.

93
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,590
Give him time to think.

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,970
I'll beef up the perimeter
around the hotel.

95
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,640
- But I'm sending in my C team.
- Thank you.

96
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,770
I'm talking rookies and retirees.

97
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,480
After the body
of Supervisory Special Agent Winn

98
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,980
was found in the Hudson,

99
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,070
search divers also recovered
the murder weapon.

100
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,990
The registered service sidearm
of fellow FBI agent Ray Nadeem.

101
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,540
When agents went
to take Nadeem into custody,

102
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
he drew a weapon to resist arrest

103
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,830
and forced his fellow agents
to kill him in self-defense.

104
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,960
Sadly, we may never know
what kind of mental instability

105
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,170
drove Ray Nadeem
to commit this senseless act.

106
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,590
But our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of all the agents

107
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,510
who have been impacted by these events.

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Press is calling me a liar.
FBI is calling Ray mentally unstable.

109
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,520
Ray's grand jury testimony is sealed,

110
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,900
so Fisk is just throwing up smokescreens
until people forget and move on.

111
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Yeah?

112
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Well, unless Matt figures out
some way to stop him,

113
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,990
he's going to get away with it.
With all of it.

114
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,910
You mean unless Matt kills him.

115
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,620
Shouldn't have warned Mahoney.

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,670
If the police have Fisk surrounded,

117
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,710
maybe Matt won't be able
to go through with it.

118
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,500
Or maybe he'll get arrested. Or worse.

119
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,420
Karen...

120
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,670
Look, I'm not saying that I want
him to kill Fisk. I don't want that.

121
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,010
What if it's the only way?

122
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,680
It's, uh... It's not murder
if it's self-defense, right?

123
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,810
Technically, plotting to kill someone is
the exact legal opposite of self-defense.

124
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,270
You know what I mean.

125
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,610
I get it.

126
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,780
Our best shot at taking down Fisk
died with Nadeem.

127
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,570
But yesterday was also a good day...

128
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,370
...because Matt came back to us.

129
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,120
The real Matt.

130
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,830
Yeah, for, like, a minute maybe.

131
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,290
Eventually, he'll come to his senses.

132
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,250
Matt's Matt because he believes that
everyone deserves a shot at redemption.

133
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,500
Except Fisk.

134
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,720
Everyone. It's a Catholic thing.

135
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,550
That's why he doesn't kill people.

136
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,760
If he crosses that line...

137
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,640
Matt will never be able
to forgive himself.

138
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,270
And being around us will just remind him
of who he was and what he's done.

139
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,820
- Yeah, we'd really lose him, wouldn't we?
- Forever, this time.

140
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Hello?

141
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,830
Yes.

142
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,340
Can I ask why?

143
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,960
Uh, no need. I know where you are.

144
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,380
What? What is it?

145
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,350
The FBI wants me to come in.

146
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
It's Fisk.

147
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,730
- Yeah. It might be.
- Might be?

148
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,650
Foggy, you're not going down there.

149
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,900
I have a life.

150
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm not prepared
to become a wanted fugitive.

151
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,870
Wait, wait, wait. No, just wait.

152
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,660
What if it's a trap
and you don't walk out again? Huh?

153
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,500
Can you run that downstairs?

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,130
Mr. Nelson.

155
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,340
Special Agent Poindexter.

156
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,930
You just won me 50 bucks.

157
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,350
Some of the guys
were betting you wouldn't show.

158
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm always available to help the FBI,
Agent Poindexter.

159
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,310
In fact...

160
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,810
please smile.

161
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,740
There.

162
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,110
Posted to my campaign web page

163
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,030
and the tens of thousands of
police officers that know that I'm here.

164
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,240
With you. Helping.

165
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,580
Relax, Mr. Nelson.
You're not in any danger.

166
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,210
You'll be very useful
when you're the next district attorney.

167
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,340
Why am I here?

168
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,470
- 'Cause Ray Nadeem was a friend of yours.
- A client.

169
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,430
Sad, the way it all turned out.

170
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,930
Even though he's dead,

171
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,760
I can't answer any questions
that would violate privilege.

172
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm not asking you to.

173
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,060
Follow me.

174
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,820
Thank you for coming, Mr. Nelson.

175
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,950
Mrs. Nadeem. What are you doing here?

176
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,540
I came to apologize.

177
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,370
To apologize?

178
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,750
I asked them to call you,
because you were Ray's lawyer.

179
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,630
And I want to fully cooperate
with the investigation of my husband.

180
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,130
What Ray did is...

181
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,140
How could a man I loved
with all my heart...

182
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,350
the father of my son,
turn out to be such a monster?

183
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,480
It wasn't your fault, Seema.

184
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,440
Ray fooled a lot of people.

185
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,940
Nobody here blames you or Sami.

186
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,570
You're still part of the FBI family.

187
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,360
We'll give you the room.
Take all the time you need.

188
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,210
Suck it up.

189
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,290
I'm only doing this because I have to.

190
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,380
- How's Sami?
- He's okay.

191
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,050
With my sister.

192
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,340
I haven't told him yet.

193
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,760
- When did you get here?
- I came as soon as I saw the news.

194
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,940
I didn't want to believe it,
but I know I needed to hear the truth.

195
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,490
I'm so sorry. That...

196
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,200
must have been an incredible shock.

197
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
It was.

198
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,910
But I decided it was the right thing
for me to come in and to cooperate.

199
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,210
That was smart.

200
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,500
Totally the right thing to do.

201
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,760
I was hoping you could help me
figure out how I can help the FBI.

202
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,760
And whether or not Ray's
life insurance policy will still pay.

203
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,180
Otherwise, Sami and I
have nothing to live on.

204
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,930
How will we survive?

205
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,490
I'll help you figure it out, Mrs. Nadeem.

206
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,820
Whatever I can do
to help you and Sami get through this.

207
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,130
What do you want?

208
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,510
I'm coming for you, Dex. And my suit.

209
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Where's Felix?

210
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,680
You'll find out soon enough.

211
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,470
I've got some free time now.
Why don't we meet up?

212
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,640
I have a question.

213
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,770
Did you enjoy the feeling you got
when you killed those birdies?

214
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,230
Is that why you're still killing?

215
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,530
Birdies?

216
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,190
The ones you killed with rocks.

217
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,950
I bet it felt good at first, right?

218
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,950
Then it's never the same after that.

219
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,370
What do you think Dr. Mercer would say
if she could see you now?

220
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,960
Can you hang on a second?

221
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,040
I need a tissue for all the tears
I'm crying over my shitty childhood.

222
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,630
Have you heard
from your friend Julie lately?

223
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,510
You wanna talk to Dr. Mercer, asshole?
Keep talking.

224
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,630
What do you think she'd say if she knew
about the innocent people you killed?

225
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,760
I bet she'd be disappointed, Dex.

226
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,890
If she were still alive.

227
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,310
If you...

228
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,150
If you hurt Julie...

229
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,860
Fisk had her killed.

230
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,610
He killed Julie, so he could replace her
as your North Star.

231
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,580
You should stick
to beating on people in alleys,

232
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,290
because you're not
going to get in my head.

233
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,920
You don't have to believe me.

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,960
Then again, you may wanna ask
how I got Manning's phone.

235
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,380
Don't know. Don't care.

236
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,340
Julie wouldn't approve
of you killing people, Dex.

237
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,090
Stop saying her name.

238
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,100
You said you got some free time?

239
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,850
You may wanna check out 16 Canal Place.

240
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,390
Why?

241
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,150
If you're showing this to Sami,
I need you to stop the video now.

242
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,820
For everyone else...

243
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,200
My name is Special Agent Ray Nadeem
of the FBI,

244
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,540
and under federal law,

245
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,210
I swear that the testimony
I'm about to give is the truth,

246
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,130
whole truth
and nothing but the truth...

247
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,130
and should be considered
my dying declaration.

248
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,720
I'm guilty of a number of criminal acts,
and I was in no way acting alone.

249
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,350
Wilson Fisk coerced me
and a number of fellow FBI agents

250
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,180
into aiding and abetting
a criminal conspiracy...

251
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,270
to extort protection money
from New York crime organizations.

252
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,940
I gotta hand it to you, Fisk.
You know how to put on a show.

253
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:56,280
Agents Arinori, Johnson, Markham, Mockter,
O'Connor and Ramsey all took part

254
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,700
and continue to act as Fisk's operatives

255
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,870
under the orders of our boss,
Special Agent in Charge Tammy Hattley.

256
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,580
There may be others. I can't be sure.

257
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,710
But I personally witnessed

258
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,670
SAC Hattley murder Agent Winn
in her kitchen, using my handgun.

259
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,800
No!

260
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,350
And then witnessed Fisk's aide,
Felix Manning,

261
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,980
remove the body and use this crime
and threats against my family

262
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,690
to blackmail me
into cooperating with Fisk.

263
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,020
I'm not making any excuses,

264
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,650
because I aided and abetted
the worst crime of them all.

265
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,870
I personally drove
Special Agent Ben Poindexter

266
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,370
to the Clinton Church...
dressed in a fake Daredevil suit.

267
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,040
I knew at this point

268
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,130
that Poindexter was the killer
who attacked the Bulletin,

269
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,170
and I knew he was going to do
something horrible at the church.

270
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,050
But I let it happen anyway.

271
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,350
So I'm guilty of aiding and abetting
the murder of Father Paul Lantom.

272
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,140
I'm ashamed of what I've done.

273
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,020
But that doesn't change the fact that I

274
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,610
and everyone I just named
are guilty as hell.

275
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Seems...

276
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,490
you need to get this video
to my attorneys.

277
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,370
And don't try and run.

278
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,290
Go to the FBI and pretend like you
don't know anything about any of this.

279
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,790
Tell them I'm a monster.

280
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,130
It's the only way that you and Sami
can get through this.

281
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm sorry, baby.

282
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,470
I will always love you.

283
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,930
God.

284
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,520
He knew he was gonna die.

285
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,030
Okay, so...
maybe it won't hold up in court.

286
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,750
But if we put this out there,
it'll make Fisk's life a living hell.

287
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,200
Actually, a dying declaration
is exempt from the hearsay rule.

288
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,370
What?

289
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,910
The court says that a person
who believes that they're dying is...

290
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,580
has less incentive to lie.

291
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,130
Therefore, anything they say is...

292
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,210
You're telling me
this is admissible in court?

293
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,010
Every damn word.

294
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,920
It's the silver bullet to take down Fisk.

295
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,180
Shit. The world has to know.

296
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,220
The world and Matt.

297
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,310
When I find you...

298
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,860
Like I said,
Fisk killed her and we both know it.

299
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,980
- You did this.
- Think, Dex.

300
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,900
Who got Julie the job in the hotel?

301
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,490
Who had you followed
when you were stalking her?

302
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,490
It was all Fisk.

303
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,910
You let him turn you into a murderer.

304
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,040
You think he's gonna let
Julie get in the way?

305
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,670
Why are you telling me this?

306
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,920
'Cause Fisk wants to get married tonight.

307
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,010
And I don't think he deserves
a life of happily ever after.

308
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,340
Wonder what
the bride's gonna wear.

309
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

310
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,580
please have your invitations in hand
as you go through the metal detector.

311
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,380
Who does Fisk think he is?

312
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,710
Summoning us here with no notice.

313
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,420
Well, he's the only one who can.

314
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,050
Well, he's really starting to piss me off.

315
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
Oh, relax. Here, have some champagne.

316
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,430
You'll live longer.

317
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,940
- This is what we're running?
- Mmm-hmm.

318
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,740
Well, it's official. Yesterday sucked.

319
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,110
Yes, it did.

320
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,070
But today is gonna make it all worth it.

321
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,700
- What's this?
- Look.

322
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,920
My name is Special Agent Ray Nadeem
of the FBI,

323
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,920
and under federal law,

324
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,630
I swear that the testimony
I'm about to give...

325
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,810
Parking's on 53rd.
We're staging the motorcade... Jesus.

326
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,020
Hey there, Lim.

327
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,350
Dex?

328
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,110
That's Agent Lim.
He's one of the good ones.

329
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,530
- What in the hell...
- Do yourself a favor.

330
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,530
Walk away.

331
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,330
...to be a loving
and faithful husband,

332
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,330
in plenty and in want,
in joy and in sorrow,

333
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,380
in sickness and in health,
as long as you both shall live?

334
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,010
Wilson?

335
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,890
Wilson?

336
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
I...

337
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,440
Repeat the question.

338
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,650
Do you?

339
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,110
I do.

340
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,200
- And you?
- I do.

341
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,740
Then you may.

342
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,190
...we are so glad you could
come and celebrate with us tonight.

343
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,400
It is my honor and privilege
to present to you for the first time...

344
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,070
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson Fisk.

345
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,670
- Hi.
- Beautiful ceremony, Vanessa.

346
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,960
Thank you for coming.

347
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,880
That was a bold move

348
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,760
to sit me next to the prosecutor
who tried to send me away.

349
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,180
I told him to hold my purse.

350
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,610
That must have been
very satisfying for you.

351
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,680
It was. My tax dollars at work.

352
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,850
You never disappoint.

353
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,070
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

354
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,400
we'd like to invite the bride and groom
to the floor for the first dance.

355
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,730
I believe that's our cue.

356
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,280
My name is Special Agent Ray Nadeem
of the FBI,

357
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,200
and under federal law,

358
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,410
I swear that the testimony
I'm about to give...

359
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,580
Everyone's looking at us.

360
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,210
They're staring.

361
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,800
...of criminal acts,
and I was in no way acting alone.

362
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,130
Wilson Fisk coerced me...

363
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,180
My name is Special Agent Ray Nadeem
of the FBI...

364
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,270
What's happening?

365
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,770
...to extort protection money
from New York crime organizations.

366
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,730
Agents Arinori...

367
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,110
Ladies and gentlemen,
this next one's a favorite,

368
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,860
so grab your dance partner
and head to the floor.

369
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,030
You'll handle it, Wilson.

370
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,200
Like you handle everything.
Show them that none of it matters.

371
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,710
Agents down.
Repeat, agents down.

372
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,250
Daredevil is en route to the ballroom.

373
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,680
Sir, there's trouble. Agents are down.

374
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,680
We're under attack.

375
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,230
I'd like to make a toast.

376
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,060
It's Daredevil.

377
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,230
Julie and I wish you the absolute best.

378
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,880
Hold your fire!

379
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,930
- How did this happen?
- Dex knows our security protocols.

380
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,560
That video of Agent Nadeem
is a threat to us.

381
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,940
I'll discredit his testimony
and take care of everything.

382
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,230
- I will handle it.
- Wilson.

383
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,480
I should have never let Dex
get that close to you.

384
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,480
Be angry later. Be smart now.

385
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,070
Listen to me.

386
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,370
We need to run.

387
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,580
You didn't make a mistake marrying me.

388
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,120
I know that. But now, be smart.

389
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,080
For both of us.

390
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,490
Please don't.

391
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,590
Reports of Daredevil attacking the hotel
continue to circulate.

392
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,340
Meanwhile, more and more police
are arriving at the scene.

393
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,260
ESU, you have one job:
Find and stop Daredevil.

394
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,140
The rest of you,
we don't know which FBI agents

395
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,620
- Fisk has in his pocket, so...
- Sure hope this wasn't Matt.

396
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,690
You came back.

397
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,070
Police are on their way up.
Can you shut down the elevators?

398
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,030
- Why?
- So nobody stops me.

399
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,680
It's over.

400
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Run.

401
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,710
- What about you?
- Keep it, please.

402
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,760
I'll meet you downstairs. Go!

403
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,710
Stop.

404
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,600
Stop it, please!

405
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,410
I will never stop hunting Karen Page
or Foggy Nelson.

406
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,870
I will tell the world who you really are.

407
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Wilson.

408
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,920
Vanessa, please go. Please!

409
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,170
You...

410
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,970
You want me to kill you.

411
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,880
No prison can keep me.

412
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,470
You know that.

413
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,600
- Come on, kill me!
- No!

414
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,890
God knows I want to,
but you don't get to destroy who I am.

415
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,940
You will go back to prison,

416
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,570
and you will live the rest
of your miserable life in a cage,

417
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,400
knowing you'll never have Vanessa,

418
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,280
that this city rejected you.

419
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,610
It beat you.

420
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,160
I beat you!

421
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,290
You'll keep my secret,

422
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,840
and you won't harm Karen Page
or Foggy Nelson

423
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,170
or anyone else.

424
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,050
Because if you do,
I will go after your wife.

425
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,850
And I will prove Vanessa ordered
the murder of Agent Ray Nadeem,

426
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,100
and like her husband,

427
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,860
she'll spend the rest of her life
in a cell.

428
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,320
I failed you. I failed you.

429
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,490
No.

430
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,620
Everything that I tried
to build for us...

431
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,370
Vanessa...

432
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,790
today was the happiest day of my life.

433
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,520
All I wanted was you.

434
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,190
Please.

435
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,330
If I agree to your demands, then...

436
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,750
you leave my wife alone.

437
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,920
You leave Vanessa free!

438
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,970
If you keep your word.

439
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,430
Then, it's a deal.

440
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,710
Wilson Fisk, you are under arrest.

441
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,930
I can't move.

442
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,550
He isn't the real Daredevil.

443
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,350
How do you know?

444
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,310
Because he is.

445
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,750
He's alive.

446
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,040
Thank God.

447
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,180
Please, give me a moment
to say goodbye to my wife.

448
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,180
- Did you give one to Ray Nadeem?
- Please.

449
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,440
Please!

450
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,330
Matt should be here.

451
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,540
Well, I'm pretty sure he is.

452
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,010
Last time we spoke,
I confronted Father Lantom.

453
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,260
I was angry.

454
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,180
I'd change that if I could.

455
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,770
If God allowed that, there'd be no future.

456
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,820
- Just people endlessly rewriting the past.
- Yeah.

457
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,400
I think he was trying to tell me that
for a long time.

458
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,580
His last words were, "Forgive us."

459
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,160
Do you think that's possible?

460
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,510
He told me something, years ago,
when this happened, that I never forgot.

461
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,440
See, I was pretty angry at God
and bitter towards his world.

462
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,230
How could a loving God blind me?

463
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,610
Why?

464
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:36,320
Anyway, he told me...
God's plan is like a beautiful tapestry.

465
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,040
And the tragedy of being human is
that we only get to see it from the back.

466
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,540
With all the ragged threads
and the muddy colors.

467
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,460
And we only get a hint at the true beauty

468
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,550
that would be revealed if we could see
the whole pattern on the other side...

469
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,510
as God does.

470
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,980
Anyway, I've been thinking
a lot about it recently, 'cause...

471
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,600
I realize I've made some bad choices

472
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,690
and hurt people
that I love without meaning to.

473
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,320
You don't always know
when you start down a false path.

474
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,990
No, you don't. And that's my point.

475
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,200
I realize that if my life
had turned out any differently,

476
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,200
that I would never have become Daredevil.

477
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,540
And although people have died on my watch,
people who shouldn't have,

478
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,000
there are countless others
that have lived.

479
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:35,130
So, maybe it is all part of God's plan.

480
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Maybe my life
has been exactly as it had to be.

481
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,400
You have a generous heart, Matthew.

482
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,530
To see the good in so much pain.

483
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,650
Not always.

484
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,830
In fact, Father Lantom
used to help me with that.

485
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,460
Help me see the errors of my ways.

486
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,170
I could use someone else
to help me with that now...

487
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,760
once in a while.

488
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,300
I'm a nun, Matthew.

489
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,230
Helping is what I was called to do.

490
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,820
Feels like half of Hell's Kitchen
is here today

491
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,190
to say goodbye to Father Paul Lantom.

492
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,660
Seems fair.

493
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:24,870
He certainly welcomed everyone here,
Catholic or not.

494
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,370
And he expected those of us who were

495
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,000
to, uh, look for ways to do good
in our community.

496
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,630
Not even the kids
got out of that requirement.

497
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,170
I'm sure I'm not the only one
who remembers his "suggestion"

498
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,550
that we give some of our
First Communion money to the poor box.

499
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,680
And that was his way.

500
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,890
To think of the community,
and the, uh... and the individuals in it.

501
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,650
To think in terms of, "What can I give?"

502
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,940
He gave his life, right here
in this church, protecting others.

503
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,990
Standing up to a man who used fear

504
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,450
as a tool to set neighbors
against one another.

505
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,000
If Father Lantom had an enemy,
I would say it was fear.

506
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,340
For me, personally, he spent many years
trying to get me to face my own fears.

507
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,880
To understand how they enslaved me,

508
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,880
how they divided me
from the people that I love.

509
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,760
He counseled me to transcend my fears,

510
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,720
to be brave enough to forgive...

511
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,690
and see the possibilities
of being a man without fear.

512
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,810
That was his legacy.

513
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,780
And now it's up to all of us
to, uh, live up to it.

514
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,460
That was nice, what you said.

515
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,340
Yeah, it wasn't just him, you know.

516
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:04,260
It was you, too.

517
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,470
You helped me see the truth about myself.

518
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,060
Ouch. That had to hurt.

519
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,480
Well, maybe one of these days,
I'll forgive you, too.

520
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,230
Before my funeral, I hope.

521
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,740
I'm glad you told me, Karen.

522
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,700
About Wesley and your brother.

523
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:31,290
Yeah.

524
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:32,950
Well, uh...

525
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,540
I couldn't live with that lie forever.

526
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,170
We're all just trying to do
more good than harm.

527
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,130
And I'd say you're ahead on that score.

528
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,810
I was starting to like the idea
of being married to the DA.

529
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,900
Pretty sure Blake Tower's not married.

530
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,230
Yeah, he'll have to get by without me.

531
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,280
You, on the other hand, are in luck.

532
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,780
The firm will be thrilled
to have you back.

533
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,570
The thing is, Marci...

534
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,160
I'm not sure I want that anymore.

535
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,120
I was afraid you were going to say
something like that.

536
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,750
You're not mad?

537
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,500
We'll talk about it later.

538
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,880
But do I really have to watch you
drive your campaign off a cliff?

539
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,260
Nah. I got that part covered.

540
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,430
...that Wilson Fisk is a malignant tumor.

541
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:31,760
Well, the State of New York
isn't going to make the same mistake.

542
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:36,180
Everyone knows his game now.
Fisk won't manipulate the system again.

543
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,230
Excuse me, Mr. Tower.

544
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,810
Mr. Nelson.

545
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,900
I wanted you to be the first to hear

546
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,200
that I'm officially dropping out
of the race for district attorney.

547
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:54,160
The way you stood up to Wilson Fisk
was an inspiration to us all.

548
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,830
I'm gonna be voting for you.

549
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,370
Thank you.

550
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,630
- Hey there, Matty!
- Uncle Timmy.

551
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,760
- How are those briefs doing?
- Still stapled together.

552
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,300
Attaboy.

553
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,850
Of course, we're gonna
have to buy sunscreen by the bucket.

554
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,810
Better than that rock salt.

555
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,770
Enough with the snow and ice.
We're getting out of here.

556
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,860
I can't believe you're finally doing it.

557
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,400
Guess I'll have to get used to the idea
of Christmas in Tampa. Yikes!

558
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,900
Like I'd miss the grandkids at Christmas.

559
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,670
- Speaking of which...
- Hold that thought.

560
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,580
I need to talk to Theo for a minute.

561
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,620
- You know she ain't giving up.
- You don't have to, either.

562
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,790
Me? I don't even have a girlfriend.

563
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,340
I mean on this place.
Tower's taking down Red Lion Bank.

564
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,050
You talked to him?

565
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,390
He's not going to prosecute a sweet
old couple who got screwed by Fisk.

566
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,760
You, though...

567
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,890
What about me?

568
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,350
If you pay back the loan...

569
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,270
they won't file criminal charges.

570
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,690
That's some fancy lawyering, Foggy.
You're really saving my ass.

571
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,190
Eh. Who wanted to be DA anyway?

572
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,860
You're too good-looking for that job.

573
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:12,950
Ow!

574
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,740
So, what are you gonna do now?

575
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,530
Drink these.

576
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,290
Good plan.

577
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,040
Is that a whiskey neat?

578
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,920
- For medicinal purposes.
- Mmm-hmm.

579
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,340
You want me to get you your own?

580
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,220
Oh, this one tastes fine.

581
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,510
- Give Matt his drink back.
- Yes.

582
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,180
So, I guess you guys heard,
Special Agent in Charge Hattley flipped.

583
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,600
- She corroborated Ray's dying declaration.
- I did hear.

584
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,690
Hmm.

585
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,980
So, the FBI is getting an enema,
and Fisk is...

586
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,160
- still breathing.
- Yep. Still breathing.

587
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,990
Headed to prison. Again.

588
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,200
Not exactly what I had in mind.

589
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,210
You trust that he'll keep his word?

590
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,000
I mean, I trust that he loves Vanessa.

591
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,670
Long as she's free, he should stay away.

592
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,380
- And if she gets hit by a bus tomorrow?
- Yeah. Well, then we'll cross that bridge.

593
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,640
So, how long you gonna stick around?

594
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,140
Actually, I was thinking
about moving back into my apartment.

595
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,230
Really?

596
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,900
Well, seeing as the bills are paid,
I might as well.

597
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,730
Okay, so hold on.
You're going to move

598
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,150
- back into Matt Murdock's apartment?
- Yeah, yeah.

599
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,410
I just figured he has
a healthier life-work balance.

600
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:37,660
Hmm?

601
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,450
And... actual friends.

602
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,620
Doesn't have a job, though.
He's kind of a mooch.

603
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:45,870
Semi-decent lawyer, though.

604
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,960
Ooh... "Semi-decent"? Ouch.

605
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,210
You do break the law.
A lot. And often.

606
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,130
Objection. Sustained.

607
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,140
I have a crazy idea. I need a new napkin.

608
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,900
- Okay. Well, he's writing something.
- Apparently.

609
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
What?

610
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,370
Oh, he just wrote
all of our names, didn't he?

611
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,950
How can you know that?

612
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,370
- 'Cause I was thinking the same thing.
- Okay. Okay, guys, I'm not a lawyer.

613
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,130
You're one hell of an investigator.

614
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,750
Yeah, and way more stable
than Jessica Jones.

615
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,650
All right, so what? What does that mean?

616
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,470
We go back to helping people
out of a crappy office,

617
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,970
getting paid in chickens?

618
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,060
I think Theo would let us
work out of here, to start.

619
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,350
At least we'd have a place
to sell the chickens.

620
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,650
So what do you think?

621
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,190
Why the hell not?

622
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,650
To Nelson, Murdock & Page.

623
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,070
- Page, Murdock & Nelson.
- Hang on a minute.

624
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,740
That actually has a nice ring to it.

625
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,590
Doctor, if this fails,
he'll be permanently paralyzed.

626
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,890
T8 and T9 are falling apart.

627
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,890
Even using cadaver material,
reconstruction is hopeless.

628
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,140
I disagree.

629
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,310
The Cogmium steel
reinforcing framework is...

630
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,230
Can't replace
pulverized vertebrae, Dr. Oyama.

631
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,730
The patient knew the risks.

632
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
We continue.
