1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,546
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,052
Russia is your home. Let me go save mine.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,055
<i>People are gonna wanna know
where I've been for the past five years.</i>

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,183
<i>It's easier if I'm just a simple castaway.</i>

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,354
I'm afraid you're going
to miss your boat home.

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,936
What's so funny about my father's legacy?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,113
He was going to disown you.

8
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,610
With help from the Green Arrow
and his team,

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,204
the Throwing Star Killer
is now behind bars,

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,077
<i>and our streets are a little safer.</i>

11
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:37,546
<i>Former District Attorney Adrian Chase
faces multiple counts of capital murder,</i>

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,747
<i>among other charges.</i>

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,460
<i>SCPD spokesperson Alison Rou
credits the Green Arrow</i>

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:46,172
<i>with bringing the man known as
the Throwing Star Killer to justice.</i>

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,390
Well, it looks like the Green Arrow
is a hero again. Whoever he is.

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,595
Yep. And the mayor
ain't doing too bad, either.

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,432
The Sentinel's got your approval rating
back up to 70%.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,018
What? Was it ever that high?

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,937
No, it was wasn't.
Um, anyway, listen, if you'll excuse me,

20
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,648
I gotta go find Rene
and remove his head from his ass.

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,320
- Wait, what?
- He missed a hearing

22
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,777
about possibly getting his daughter back.

23
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,032
- Hey, Quentin?
- Yeah?

24
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,284
If you need any help with that,
just let us know, okay?

25
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,081
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, will do.

26
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,535
Oh, by the way, um,
I'm sorry I almost forgot.

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,917
Happy birthday, Mr. Mayor.

28
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,457
Thank you.

29
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,919
We should go get a drink tonight.

30
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,929
We haven't celebrated your birthday in...
I can't remember how long.

31
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,928
Remember the last time
we celebrated yours?

32
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,426
Oh, God, we decided
we would never talk about that again.

33
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,853
Four years?

34
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,310
You've changed a lot, Speedy.

35
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,527
We both have.
Just not sure I have for the better.

36
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,982
I'm sure.

37
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,648
Look, Thea, uh,

38
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,154
being happy doesn't mean
you don't have issues.

39
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,986
It just means that you're working on them.

40
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,490
When did you become all Zen-like
and well-adjusted?

41
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,870
We should celebrate that tonight,
as well as your birthday.

42
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,954
I appreciate that,
but I already have plans.

43
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,381
With who?

44
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,677
Please say "not Susan Williams."

45
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,971
Um, it... NO, uh, with Felicity.

46
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,682
As in a date?

47
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,228
As, uh...
As in I don't know if it's a date.

48
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,979
But you're hoping that it is?

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,229
It's dinner.
People go to dinner.

50
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,860
See, I don't believe you,
but I find it incredibly cute.

51
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,099
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

52
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,095
Happy birthday. Everything hurt.
Everything hurts here.

53
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,736
Yes!

54
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,529
I love the cake,
where did you get it?

55
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,026
Lord Mesa Bakery.

56
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,273
What's up with number six?

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,532
Is that for the number of members
of the team?

58
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,076
- It's cool.
- Actually, I ordered the cake

59
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,529
for a six-year-old because I wasn't sure

60
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,206
that I could order a Green Arrow cake
for a grown man.

61
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,581
Well, hey,
Oliver's a child at heart, right?

62
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,546
That is the concussion talking,
yep, for sure.

63
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,043
I'm really sorry about that, Curtis.

64
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,757
No, that's okay. But you should know

65
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,882
that if I'd had my T-Spheres,
I would have...

66
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,383
Would've what?

67
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,134
Would have still been on the floor.

68
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,926
I'm very sorry.

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,763
Mmm.

70
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,599
I was worried
this might've got hurt.

71
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:44,808
What is it?

72
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,069
They are sound modulators
that I've been working on for Dinah.

73
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,648
Not only will they be able to
focus her canary cry,

74
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,567
but they will be able to override
any kind of sonic dampeners.

75
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,152
- Yes.
- She's coming, right?

76
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,905
Yeah. She said if work didn't go too late,
then she'd swing on by.

77
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,573
Thank you.

78
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,953
- Cake. Here you go.
- Yes!

79
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,162
Lyla couldn't make it?

80
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,665
She and J.J. are visiting
her sister in Chicago.

81
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,959
- Oh.
- We're good, man.

82
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,172
We'll patch things up.

83
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,888
I'm late, aren't I?

84
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,886
That's all good. Didn't miss much.

85
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,184
Just Oliver flipping Curtis
over his shoulder.

86
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,724
I told you a surprise party
wasn't a good idea.

87
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,144
How's Rene?

88
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,690
He's not home.

89
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,397
There's a couple of days' worth
of newspapers

90
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,989
piled up outside his apartment.

91
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,192
- You're worried about him.
- Yeah, well, you know,

92
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,736
Rene may come across
as an irresponsible idiot,

93
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,908
but that's... No, it's just 'cause

94
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,531
that's what he wants
people to think of him, you know.

95
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,706
Yeah.

96
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,375
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

97
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,706
We're gonna do a toast in
about five minutes. So, champagne, and...

98
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,504
- Club soda.
- All right, you got it.

99
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,422
Really nice wrapping.

100
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,711
Thank you.

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,596
Thank you all so much
for doing this. Cheers.

102
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,009
Cheers.

103
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,513
I almost forgot what it was like
to celebrate a birthday.

104
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,265
That's because we're usually

105
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,934
saving the city from being destroyed
this time of year.

106
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,059
Uh, it's like summer break for you guys.
What are you gonna do, huh?

107
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,776
I've always wanted to see Florence.

108
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,064
The city in Italy,
not the woman or her weird machines.

109
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,904
I'm gonna teach J.J. how to fish.

110
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,119
Few days with my son on the water,
that'll be heaven.

111
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,739
I was thinking the Pacific Crest Trail.

112
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,580
For a night. For, you know,
just one night under the stars,

113
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,744
and then definitely
a manicure-pedicure afterwards.

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,797
What about you, Oliver?
We know you got City Hall and all, but...

115
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,713
Yeah, it keeps me busy.
But I need to buy some socks.

116
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,467
Everybody has their thing.
I need socks bad.

117
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,299
<i>Socks it is.</i>

118
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,766
<i>Hey, we all need socks.</i>

119
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:46,973
Uh, well, I think we could all use
another piece of cake, right?

120
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,976
- Yeah, sure.
- You know, actually, I'm good.

121
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,320
Had about three or four slices myself.

122
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,609
- You need cake, son.
- Oh, okay.

123
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,815
- You need to go.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I need that, yeah.

124
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,617
Oh.

125
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,323
That was subtle.

126
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,078
So subtle.

127
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,999
I guess since the dinner
at Chez Marta was a ruse,

128
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,118
they think we deserve some alone time.

129
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,452
Do we?

130
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,506
Well, I mean, I didn't know if it was a...

131
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,922
We can take it one step at a time.

132
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,004
I would like that very much.

133
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,805
This is hard for you, huh?

134
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,512
Hypothetically dating my ex-fiancée?
No. It's...

135
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:28,355
Wow, no, I meant summer vacation,
as they are now calling it.

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,024
It's incredibly hard.
It's borderline impossible.

137
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,813
We won.

138
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,603
Oliver, we won.

139
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,648
Just take a step back, you know.

140
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,862
You can put your feet up,
no matter the state of your socks.

141
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,158
You could just, God forbid, relax.

142
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,662
Yeah.

143
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,500
My government heard rumors of this place.

144
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,004
An island prison built by the Chinese.

145
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:05,555
It's incredible that you should lead me
here of all places.

146
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,638
I killed you.

147
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,482
Almost.

148
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,320
But nothing ever really dies.

149
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,148
There are always echoes.

150
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,992
You'll learn that soon enough.

151
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,413
The KGB call this the Red Death.

152
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,999
It's an interrogation drug

153
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,494
meant to break men
by inducing psychological anguish.

154
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,832
It's why you followed me
halfway around the world?

155
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,254
Torture?

156
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,550
Murder creates intimacy between men.

157
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,549
So, I'd appreciate an honest answer.

158
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,682
If your intention was to return home,
why leave from here?

159
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,559
Honestly?

160
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,894
Go to hell.

161
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,896
That's an interesting response.

162
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,241
If my Chinese is correct,

163
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,406
this place is called purgatory.

164
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,870
You know the Catholics
consider purgatory to be

165
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,461
the immediate state
following physical death?

166
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,265
Konstantin...

167
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,887
When I kill you this time,

168
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,311
I'm gonna make sure you're dead.

169
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:44,616
When we're done, the only person you'll
want to kill is yourself.

170
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,904
I'm just saying, you could've taken
a big knife

171
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,662
and cut the tension between you two.
And by tension, I mean sexual tension.

172
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,409
Yeah, I know what you meant, Curtis.

173
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,292
And then the way you guys dressed up
for each other? Ooh! Sizzle! Sizzle!

174
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,170
Okay. Can you please stop?

175
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,963
You're worse than a shipper
on a soap opera.

176
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,421
Okay, well, look, I'm here.

177
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,926
I hope Dinah's still up,
I think her neighbors are asleep.

178
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,678
That's the whole point
of this modulator anyway.

179
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,806
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no" what?

180
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,518
- I think she was robbed.
- Do you need backup?

181
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,859
Yeah, probably, but I'm here now,
so I gotta make sure she's okay.

182
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,786
Hello?

183
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,196
Dinah?

184
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,334
If there's someone in here,
you should know that I know martial arts.

185
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,618
Curtis, what's going on?

186
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,711
On, my God.

187
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,671
Curtis? Curtis?

188
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,624
<i>Curtis?</i>

189
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,859
Clear.

190
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,361
We got Curtis' phone
but no Dinah and Curtis.

191
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,693
Okay, well, if Curtis and Dinah
are missing,

192
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,032
I guess we can presume that Rene
didn't skip out on his daughter.

193
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,204
Whoever did this is good.

194
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,031
We know who's doing this.

195
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,658
It's Chase.

196
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,077
He's picking us off, one by one.

197
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,249
Not to state the obvious,

198
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,375
but Chase is currently under surveillance
24/7 in an impenetrable glass box.

199
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,425
<i>There's no way
he got out to do this.</i>

200
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,715
Look, he had to have help.

201
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,222
I hate to say this, but what if this was
Chase's plan all along?

202
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,724
Get himself caught, lull us to sleep.

203
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,018
Yeah. Well, consider me officially woke.

204
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,270
<i>Okay, Chase has worked
with Evil Laurel before,</i>

205
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,684
<i>but she's currently locked up
at A.R.G.U.S.</i>

206
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,107
<i>and there is no way
that Evelyn is doing this all by herself.</i>

207
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,392
John?

208
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,732
Isn't that League?

209
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,442
It's Talia al Ghul.

210
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,744
Contact Thea and Lance,
we need to get them some place secure.

211
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,700
There's an A.R.G.U.S. safe house
across town we can use.

212
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,872
Okay, you get them there
and then meet me at the bunker.

213
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,792
Where you going?

214
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,379
It's time to talk to Chase.

215
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,262
<i>Where are they?</i>

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,757
- Adrian, where are they?
- Who?

217
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,470
- You know damn...
- You know damn well who!

218
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,264
You're right. I do know.

219
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,897
Just like I know your every move,
while it seems like you know none of mine.

220
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,103
Tell me where they are.

221
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,313
Or what?

222
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,812
We've already established
that you think you won't kill me.

223
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,404
Kind of weakens your leverage.

224
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,614
I'm gonna find them
and I'm gonna get them back.

225
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,078
Is that what you came here to tell me,
or are you just wasting time?

226
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,836
See you later.

227
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,800
Oh, pain. It's fascinating, isn't it?

228
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:55,094
Some men will do anything to avoid it,
others will embrace it.

229
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,967
Even revel in it.

230
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,472
Like you.

231
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,643
That's why you're so formidable.

232
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,191
Pain is not a new experience to you.

233
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,526
Then stop wasting my time.

234
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,491
That was my epiphany for true retribution.

235
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,702
I couldn't merely cause you pain.

236
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,537
I had to wake you up.

237
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,294
Open your eyes, make you see.

238
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,462
The pain you suffer is still with you.

239
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,879
This drug will help set it free.

240
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:44,144
Every cut, every bullet, every wound,

241
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,850
like you're feeling it all
for the first time.

242
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,363
Am I still wasting your time?

243
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,045
Freeze, jerk-wad!

244
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,089
<i>Sorry.</i>

245
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,672
I knew it was you, but what if
it wasn't "you" you. You know?

246
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,347
Multiple Earths, evil twins, et cetera.

247
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,050
Et cetera being the scariest thing
I've said all day.

248
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,218
I hate this thing. Oh.

249
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,766
<i>I'm a little on edge.</i>

250
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,104
I'm actually really looking forward

251
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,223
to being holed up
in an A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

252
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,563
I don't want you in the safe house.
I want you down here with me.

253
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,361
- What? No. Why?
- I can run comms remotely.

254
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,357
Okay? And if Malcolm Merlyn
has proven anything,

255
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,862
it's that when it comes to
the League of Assassins,

256
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,033
locks are more like suggestions.

257
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,613
I can handle Talia al Ghul
and whatever acolytes she's fighting with.

258
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:47,707
Where I need you is down here with me,
so that both of us can try to stop Chase.

259
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,412
Is this...

260
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,374
And this might sound
a little self-serving,

261
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,586
but is tactic the only thing
behind me staying down here?

262
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,966
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,881
Of course not. Okay?

264
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,263
The thing that's clear, though,
to me right now is that I...

265
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,888
I let my guard down. And I shouldn't have.

266
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,098
No one could have
seen this coming, Oliver. No one.

267
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,939
I saw it coming.
I knew something was wrong.

268
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,277
I knew it. Here. And I ignored it.

269
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:21,612
And then I second-guessed myself, and now,
everyone that I love is in danger.

270
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,280
Including, maybe...

271
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,825
- My son.
- No. I couldn't find him.

272
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,918
There's no way they're going to.
Not Chase. Not Talia al Ghul.

273
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,119
William's gonna be fine.

274
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,626
I appreciate that.
But you can't know that.

275
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,961
You can't.

276
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,009
William is the purest part of me.

277
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,341
And now he's in danger,

278
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,511
maybe because of something
that the worst part of me set in motion.

279
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,641
- How'd it go?
- Thea and Quentin are not happy about it,

280
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,147
but they're secure.

281
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,110
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- What's going on?

282
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,859
I had A.R.G.U.S. triple-check
on Black Siren, she's not in her cell.

283
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,147
That's not a coincidence.

284
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,482
Quentin doesn't know about her.

285
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,993
It's why Chase will send her right there.

286
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,366
We need to get the safe house
on the phone now.

287
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,378
God, you know what the worst part
about a safe house is?

288
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,172
It's not being able
to use your cell phone. That's just...

289
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,377
That's barbaric.

290
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,550
Well, yeah, normally I'd chalk that up
to millennial nonsense,

291
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:22,718
but I know what you mean.

292
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,389
I'm chomping at the bit to speak to
that judge on Rene's case right now.

293
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,802
Well, what could you say?

294
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,390
That Rene was kidnapped by some psycho
that's in jail? That...

295
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,851
I gotta do something, Thea.

296
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,360
I know what it's like to lose a daughter,

297
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,234
and hell if I'm gonna
let that happen to Rene.

298
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,401
Right.

299
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,822
Agent Kosinski. Hello?

300
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,704
Hey, Sharon, we got a problem
with the comms in the...

301
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,209
Stay here.

302
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,368
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

303
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,162
but I'm sure as hell
not staying here waiting.

304
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,714
You read my mind. Let's go.

305
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,551
It's a tranq dart.

306
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,026
Stop right there!

307
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,731
Stop, turn around slowly. Turn...

308
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,909
Hi, Daddy.

309
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,420
No, it can't be.

310
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,753
It can be. Daddy, it can.

311
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,712
Don't worry.

312
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:46,969
I'll explain everything.

313
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,428
Just don't take your gun off her, Quentin.

314
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,437
Thea, Thea...

315
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,561
You know it's not what it seems.

316
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,267
Okay, Ollie told...

317
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,243
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

318
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,290
What do we know?

319
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,303
You mean besides this being
the horror version of Groundhog <i>Day?</i>

320
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,634
Look, the security camera footage
is grainy,

321
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,263
but it's good enough to see Black Siren
giving her best Laurel impression.

322
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,811
We know there was
a second attacker. Who do we think it was?

323
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:34,978
Well, the A.R.G.U.S. agent

324
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,978
that gave Black Siren
her "get out of jail free" card

325
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,937
said that he was blackmailed by a woman
wearing black, so could be Talia...

326
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,111
It was Evelyn.

327
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,360
Agent Kosinski got a positive ID
before he got tranqed.

328
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,483
So these kidnappings are what? Payback?

329
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,655
Before Chase tortured me,
I told him that the team was my strength.

330
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,863
He's trying to take it away.

331
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,957
So his lady friends can come after you
instead of him?

332
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,329
That doesn't sound very satisfying.

333
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,037
Chase doesn't think I can game out
what he's planning, but it's obvious.

334
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,164
Yeah. Obvious to a murdering psychopath.

335
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,167
And present company excluded.

336
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,553
He's trying to leverage our friends
to make me set him free.

337
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,012
That's crazy.

338
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,845
Which would be consistent for Chase.

339
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,347
- You two have to leave the city.
- What?

340
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,350
You gotta leave the city.
You gotta leave the state.

341
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,513
And you can't tell me where you're going.

342
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,227
Oliver, we're not leaving.
We're not going anywhere.

343
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,395
We're not abandoning you.

344
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,063
I understand
that you're not abandoning me.

345
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,031
You're doing
what I'm asking you to do, because...

346
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,865
Chase knows how I think.

347
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,660
<i>He knows that if he puts
the two of you in danger,</i>

348
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:36,037
and he's gonna try to, that my instinct
will be to pull you close.

349
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,166
So do something he's not expecting.

350
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,910
Split up.

351
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,503
No, that's...

352
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,463
What about you?

353
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,804
If I don't have to worry
about the two of you,

354
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,925
then I can put my focus
towards finding the others.

355
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,641
You get this son of a bitch, Oliver.

356
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,976
I will.

357
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,943
<i>KOVAR". You're strong.</i>

358
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,899
Like a piece of iron.

359
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,953
You think you can resist any pain
because you have.

360
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,120
But the worst pain is up here.

361
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,584
Locked away, deep inside.

362
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,301
That's what the drug is for.

363
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,429
To show you everything. Your sins.

364
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,182
Your failures.

365
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,767
I think you made your choice.

366
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,357
No!

367
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:47,770
Your guilt.

368
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,698
<i>Oliver! No!</i>

369
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,619
Your bloodlust.

370
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,121
Your inhumanity.

371
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,975
That gun, it only has one bullet.

372
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,016
You can waste it on me,

373
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,070
but I think we both know

374
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,155
who's responsible for your pain.

375
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,159
I've seen the strongest man

376
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:43,539
resist for up to 12 minutes
before ending his suffering.

377
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,254
<i>Such is my respect for you that</i> I...

378
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,332
I think you can last for, uh...

379
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,505
14 minutes.

380
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,386
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

381
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,177
<i>You're going to do it, aren't you?</i>

382
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,521
Because you are not strong
and you know you deserve to die.

383
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,786
Let me help you understand.

384
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,289
I'm not going to kill you.

385
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,417
I am never going to give you

386
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,801
the satisfaction of being the man
that you think I am.

387
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,425
You're never getting out of here.

388
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,559
Not today.

389
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,229
Not tomorrow. Not ever.

390
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,061
Do you understand?

391
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,896
No, I don't.

392
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,736
But only because you're wrong.

393
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,737
I told you, Oliver. Everyone in your orbit
suffers as the price for your sins.

394
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:05,162
And the only way to keep them
from paying that price is to let me go.

395
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,755
I'm gonna find another way.

396
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,671
Find it quick.

397
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,140
They're transferring me to Idaho tonight.

398
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,766
And once that happens,
this offer's off the table.

399
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,476
I don't want to see that happen, Oliver.

400
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,434
Like I told you,

401
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,275
I think that you're one loss away
from getting destroyed.

402
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,441
Who would it be, I wonder?

403
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,452
Thea or Felicity?

404
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,161
Maybe someone else.

405
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,664
I mean, look. I don't understand,
all right? But that was Laurel.

406
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,795
No, Quent, it wasn't.

407
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,545
It looks like her and it sounds like her...

408
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,966
No, that was my baby girl, all right?

409
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,802
She's back. Just like with Sara.

410
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,637
Listen, there...

411
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,181
It is hard to explain, but there are
these other Earths, okay?

412
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,560
Parallel universes.

413
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,524
You're talking crazy. Listen to yourself.

414
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,821
I know.
I know how crazy it sounds, trust me.

415
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,147
But it is real.

416
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,695
<i>It's real.</i>

417
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,070
Just as real as meta-humans and aliens.

418
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,330
So, that wasn't Laurel?

419
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,211
It was a Laurel.

420
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,333
It's just not the one that we knew.

421
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,839
Okay, now, look. She's very convincing.

422
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,844
And I need you to remember that,

423
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,351
because that is exactly why
Chase has brought her here.

424
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,685
Let's go.

425
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,562
Where are we going?

426
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,023
That's a surprise.

427
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:09,119
Felicity, I already have major anxiety.
You going silent on me is not helping.

428
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,117
You know,
my mom's really big into intuition.

429
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,621
Like, stars, signs, horoscopes,
Ouija boards, even.

430
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,713
I always thought it was
either stupid or ridiculous.

431
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,461
Never really took it seriously.

432
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:19,750
Until now, right?

433
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,714
Yeah. I have this really bad feeling,
like right in the pit of my stomach.

434
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,051
What's it telling you?

435
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,224
We never should have left Oliver alone.

436
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,758
I agree with you, Felicity.

437
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,594
Leaving Oliver feels wrong,

438
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,426
but maybe that's why
it was the right thing to do.

439
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,717
You do realize
how backwards that sounds, right?

440
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,223
I do realize that, but this is Chase
we're dealing with, remember?

441
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,728
Yeah. I know. But what if we overthought
it and now Oliver's vulnerable?

442
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,155
I see your sense of hospitality
remains intact.

443
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,361
You are not welcome here, Malcolm.

444
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,038
Do you aim to cut off
my other hand, Oliver?

445
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,410
Maybe.

446
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,788
You gonna tell another person
about my son?

447
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,541
Last time I was down here,
I saved your life.

448
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:43,252
Do you really think that gives you a pass
for serving up William to Damien Darhk?

449
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,962
I'm sorry about that.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

450
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,513
I let my emotions get out of hand.

451
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,133
<i>That is all in the past.</i>

452
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,809
The only thing I'm concerned about now
is saving my daughter.

453
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,145
What's that?

454
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,698
Angry woman with two swords.

455
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,617
You getting major Isabel Rochev
flashbacks right now?

456
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,778
- Yep.
- You remember how we handled that, right?

457
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
Yep.

458
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,801
We gotta get out of here.

459
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,886
That worked better with Rochev.

460
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,518
Digg.

461
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,818
Told you I had a bad feeling.

462
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,128
John? Felicity?

463
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,875
They're gone, Oliver.

464
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,129
- Damn it!
- They were taken alive. Focus!

465
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,380
I would've thought you would have tagged
your, your pets by now.

466
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:15,468
They're my friends, Malcolm, and Curtis
did put tracking nanites in Felicity,

467
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,351
but they were rendered useless
when Chase set off an EMP.

468
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,726
Well, I'll give him this much.
He's 50 moves ahead.

469
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,229
But the question is, to what end?

470
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,280
He wants to leverage me
into breaking him out of prison.

471
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:35,113
And my daughter?
Your sister isn't sufficient leverage?

472
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,577
You've blackmailed people, Malcolm.

473
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,117
How often have you kept up
your end of the bargain?

474
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,378
And quite frankly, I am surprised

475
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,124
that someone like you is willing
to give in to a man like Chase.

476
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,551
I will give in to someone
if it gets Thea back.

477
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,215
The fact that she hates me
doesn't make her any less my daughter.

478
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,259
Something you learned last year,

479
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,061
friends are one thing,
but family is family.

480
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,227
And your child?

481
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:07,023
You would do anything,
absolutely anything, to keep him safe.

482
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,481
A little while ago, I worried that John...

483
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,533
That the personal connections that I had
were making me vulnerable.

484
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,328
Because as long as there are people
in my life that I care for,

485
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:20,078
I have to be something else
to protect them.

486
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,250
That's something
that I can't leave in the past.

487
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,754
I admire you, Oliver.

488
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,254
It takes a special kind of idiot
to actually get dumber with time.

489
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,593
Lam not in the mood, Malcolm.

490
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,097
Human connections are what keep us human.

491
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,639
And it's sad that
it's a sociopath

492
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,470
who's gonna have to point this out to you.

493
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,311
You can't live on an island.
You've already tried.

494
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,860
But you are always gonna
have people in your life, Oliver.

495
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,441
<i>And they will always need you.
Better or worse, baggage and all.</i>

496
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,323
And if you can't accept that,

497
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,245
well, your past is gonna stay your anchor.

498
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,868
- Yeah?
- Mr. Queen,

499
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,168
<i>the marshals are here
to transfer the prisoner.</i>

500
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,791
<i>You said you wanted to know.</i>

501
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,497
Thank you, I'm on my way.

502
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,131
I'm going to ensure that
Chase's prison transfer goes smoothly.

503
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,429
We're very capable people,

504
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,303
and we're gonna find a way
to rescue everyone.

505
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,607
You're not real.

506
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,731
I am as real as your conscience.

507
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,650
Remember? Survive.

508
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,823
My dying wish for you
after I gave my life for yours.

509
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,576
<i>But you squandered my sacrifice,</i>

510
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:47,332
and now my daughter,
my dear Shado, is dead.

511
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,509
Yao Fei, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

512
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,507
Apologies won't bring her back.

513
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,671
<i>And it won't bring the others back.</i>

514
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,971
Please, stop.

515
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,597
Taiana, Akio, Sara...

516
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,847
Everyone you've lost
over the past five years.

517
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,816
And all of those you have yet to lose.

518
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,190
This isn't real.

519
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,484
It's not real, you're in my head.

520
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,117
And who better
than you knows the truth?

521
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,408
What truth?

522
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:28,127
That those closest to you
are fated to suffer for your sins.

523
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:34,549
But you can save them, Oliver.

524
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,880
By making the same sacrifice

525
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,305
I made for you.

526
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,430
I love what you've done
with the place.

527
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,106
You got shipping containers
as nice as this on Earth-2?

528
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,478
Everything's exactly the same
as it is here, Dad.

529
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,364
Don't call me that.

530
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,111
You're Laurel, but you're not my Laurel.

531
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,036
- Is that too tight?
- You care?

532
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,035
You think this isn't hard for me?

533
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,787
Doesn't much look like it.

534
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,703
I owe my freedom to Adrian Chase.

535
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,544
In exchange, I give him my help

536
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,046
and his assurance that you won't get hurt.

537
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,965
Chase's assurance?

538
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,923
My Laurel wouldn't be that stupid.

539
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,553
I know.

540
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,645
You loved her, and I know you lost her,

541
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,687
and I know how
it makes you feel seeing me.

542
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,976
You've got no idea.

543
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,743
Don't worry, sir. If custody's threatened,
we have orders to shoot on sight.

544
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,497
Tick-tock.

545
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,670
You're not pulling my strings
anymore, Adrian.

546
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,264
At least you admit that I have been.

547
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,931
Hey, but just so that we're clear,

548
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,889
the moment I get on that transfer chopper,

549
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,941
my friends have orders to kill yours.

550
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,356
We'll see about that.

551
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,240
Think you're about to get a phone call.

552
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,683
<i>Hello?</i>

553
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,397
<i>Hello?</i>

554
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,726
<i>Somebody help me.</i>

555
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,564
<i>Please help me.</i>

556
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,734
<i>Please, please.</i>

557
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,555
I need the van!

558
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,053
Sir, what are you doing? Stop!

559
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,355
He took your son, didn't he?

560
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,653
How'd you know?

561
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,076
Like minds. Here.

562
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,216
Something funny, nut-bag?

563
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,886
Not yet, but soon.

564
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:15,019
See what I mean?

565
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,829
This would be easier
if we could kill them.

566
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,335
Then it's not gonna be easy.

567
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,256
<i>We're compromised.
Take the prisoner out!</i>

568
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,839
They're targeting Chase.

569
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,302
Go, I'll cover you.

570
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,180
Really!

571
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,149
Chase!

572
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:10,992
Thanks for the assist, pal.

573
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,489
Where is my son?

574
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,162
No! No! That wasn't the deal, Oliver.

575
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,989
That wasn't the deal.
I said you let me go,

576
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,540
and I keep your loved ones safe.

577
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,205
But I'm not gone yet.

578
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,050
Why did you involve William?

579
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,299
That's my boy.

580
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,887
He's an innocent.

581
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:42,399
So was my wife, man, but you involved her.

582
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,313
I already told you, Oliver,
everyone that you care about suffers.

583
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,739
Everyone.

584
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,072
I'll see you on the boat.

585
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:21,097
Okay, Chase's helicopter flew to an
abandoned airfield in Dawn Valley, Utah.

586
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,724
Then five minutes later,
this aircraft took off from the same field

587
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,060
at a vector of two-seven-zero.

588
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,611
Due west.
That would take him back to Star City.

589
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,113
Chase seems smarter than that.

590
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,529
I'm trying to track this plane,
but it's not easy without Felicity.

591
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,202
Back before the Undertaking,
some of my associates,

592
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,282
especially those who were
on the wrong end of your bow,

593
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,374
thought that The Hood had computer skills.

594
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,460
I had good hardware
and a specific purpose.

595
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,879
Chase turned off the transponder
on the plane.

596
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,458
Luckily, Felicity has access
to a keyhole satellite

597
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,133
that can track the heat signature
of any aircraft in the world. Which...

598
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,634
Impressive.

599
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,631
Just got lucky.

600
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,933
- You expecting someone?
- Yes, I am.

601
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,101
Because Chase is working with

602
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,303
at least Black Siren, Evelyn Sharp,

603
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,433
Talia al Ghul, and whatever army
she's currently controlling.

604
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,313
So you called in reinforcements?

605
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,775
If I wasn't such a confident individual,
my ego might be bruised.

606
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,153
Malcolm, your ego is what I'm going to
need you to keep in check.

607
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,654
<i>Why'?</i>

608
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,447
Who did you reach out to?

609
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,995
Husband.

610
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,249
Mr. Merlyn.
I assume you still have no title.

611
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,337
- No.
- Malcolm...

612
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,844
- I will not work with her.
- I told you.

613
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,471
I'd sooner slice her throat.

614
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,968
Try to, you mean.

615
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,847
Malcolm, you said you were willing to do
whatever it takes to get Thea back.

616
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,854
So, here we are!

617
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,689
Fine.

618
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,979
But does she know?

619
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,152
Know what, Mr. Merlyn?

620
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,529
One of the people we are up against

621
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,527
is your sister.

622
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,332
Nyssa, I wanted to explain it
to you in person.

623
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,620
We have Chase at C-one-thirty.

624
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,625
Flew out over the coast
banked southerly 12 degrees, which...

625
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,049
Which means...

626
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,381
What does it mean?

627
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,222
I know where he's taking them.

628
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,190
Why would your adversary
bring them here?

629
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,819
For that matter,
how did he even know about this place?

630
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,407
Talia.

631
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,576
She researched me.

632
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,412
Probably told Chase everything.

633
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,742
Ironic.

634
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,077
When I was a little girl,
my father told me to visit this place.

635
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:53,415
It's where I found Sara.

636
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,259
Please, don't.

637
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,020
I'm sorry that I have to.

638
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,231
But it's better for everyone.

639
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,784
This is the only way
to make sure that...

640
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,294
That I don't infect everyone that I love.

641
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,629
But we love you in return for it, Ollie.

642
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,800
We need you home.

643
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,466
<i>Please come home to me, Ollie.</i>

644
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,306
To Thea, and your mother.

645
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,969
Please, we need you.

646
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:53,025
If you don't, then your father
and my sister will have died for nothing.

647
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,015
- Diggle! Felicity!
- We're okay, you okay?

648
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,968
We're fine.
Little north of pissed off, though.

649
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,178
- Rene, Dinah, where are they?
- Not with us.

650
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,190
Relax.

651
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,486
Enjoy the weather.

652
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,735
Miss Smoak.

653
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,702
Anybody ever tell you
how much you suck at life?

654
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,033
No.

655
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,197
Care to be the first?

656
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,657
Why are we here?

657
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,576
So you recognize this place?

658
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,913
That's good.

659
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,044
Oliver's gonna come for us.

660
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,217
Yeah, I'm counting on it, sis.

661
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,552
Sounds like Chase is using us as bait.
He wants to draw Oliver out.

662
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,560
Numbers aren't exactly in his favor.

663
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,853
He faced worse odds before.

664
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,055
Yeah.

665
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,723
With the help of you and John.

666
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,109
Roy and Laurel. Thea.

667
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,360
The rest of us.

668
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,937
Curtis is right,
Oliver can't do this alone.

669
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,415
I need your help.

670
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,885
Hey, kid.

671
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,268
I'm glad you came back.
