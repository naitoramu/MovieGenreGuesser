My name is Oliver Queen.

After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,846
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:10,098
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,632
Now others have
joined my crusade.

To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:17,485
But to the rest
of Starling City,

I am someone else.

be interested in hiring someone
with your expertise.

is make things

our phone system?

29

how difficult it is

to ping a clone off a hacked
transband multiplex?

31
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:25,003
No, but only because you
weren't speaking English just now.

33

Might have escaped
your notice,

53
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:50,906
but Amanda Waller
doesn't have a sense of humor.

Oh, really?

55
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,992
Then why'd she drag
me off of Lian Yu

56
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:55,377
and bring me all
the way to Hong Kong

57

- to become her hit man?
- To become her operative.

58
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,474
Obviously she needs you
for something

59
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:02,178
or she wouldn't be threatening
my family to assure your compliance.

60
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:04,753
The target will be entering
our line any moment.

61
00:03:13,597 --> 00:03:16,314
The target will walk 10 paces
through the roof garden

62
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,267
and arrive at his hotel suite.

You know, Sara used
to have a stuffed animal.

69
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,680
It was this old,
worn out shark

70
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:51,016
that she got
from the Starling Aquarium.

71
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:53,351
Every time something awful
would happen to her,

72
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:57,305
I would always find her holding
that stupid little shark

73
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,107
close to her chest.

74
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,477
And now that my sister's dead,

75
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,564
again the only thing
that I can think about

76
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,733
is finding that dumb
stuffed animal

77
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:11,286
and putting it in her arms.

78

I'm sorry.

00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:18,210
You have nothing
to apologize for.

00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,412
Hey, whoever
did this,

81

died on "The Gambit,"

00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:27,836
the only thing
that I could do

85
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:29,337
was scream at the ocean.

86
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,755
I had so much anger and rage,

87
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,507
and I didn't know
what to do with it.

to sit here and wait?

No. Now you take

Your father is
going to need you.

Telling him now,
it would kill him.

At least now if we wait until
we catch whoever did this,

I had him, Diggle.

Where's Roy?

He ditched his burner.

I'm searching the city

for his target?

One of these days
it's going to be me.

This life that
I've chosen...

It only ends one way.

to spend your life

waiting to die?
I'm sorry.

424

I'm not going
to wait with you,

425
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,684
because if there's one thing that
today has taught me,

426
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,819
is that life is precious.

427
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:03,191
And I want so much more
in mine than this.

want to kill you?

what you may have heard,

Imagine how rare homicides
by bow and arrow are.

437

Yeah, the guy
was a sicko.

give me something useful,

facing an obstruction charge.

You know, I think I want
to talk to your boss,

they were also shot by
with arrows.

And they're too dead
to tell me why.

Can't.

What do the two of them
have to do with you?

We were all
working on a deal!

But nobody was supposed
to know about it.

455
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,426
Ohh! Ohh.

456
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:13,311
What kind of deal?

457
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:15,263
To build
an oil pipe line.

458
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:18,350
For Amertek. It's--

Leave a message.

460
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:46,343
Hey, Thea, it's me. Again.

461
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:49,813
And... I don't know
if you're getting these messages,

462
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:51,615
but I would really
like to talk to you.

463
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:54,067
So please, just...

464
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:56,486
call me back.

465
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:59,156
Bye.

an angle on Lacroix.

Where's Felicity?

468
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:09,132
Hmm.

469
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,834
She needed some air.

470
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:12,169
And what do you
need, Oliver?

471
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:15,589
I just need Thea
to call me back.

472
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:25,432
That's not going
to happen.

473
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:31,321
Why? What do you mean?

474
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:47,537
It was during the siege.

475
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,040
We were going to run away together,
but I couldn't leave

476
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:50,832
without helping you fight.

477
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:52,856
And when I came back,
she was gone.

478
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,799
I didn't say anything
because this is my fault.

479
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:00,717
She knew I was lying
to her the entire time.

It's an oil company
based in Starling City.

- Not long.

Three to Kelso, one more to Burke,
two more to Kaufman.

All from a subsidiary
from Amertek in Qurac,

514
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,190
which just happens to be the largest
untapped oil field on the planet.

Yeah. Looks like Amertek was trying
to strike an oil deal.

to stop it.

None of this explains
how Sara was involved.

she worked in Qurac.

called Tom Weston.
