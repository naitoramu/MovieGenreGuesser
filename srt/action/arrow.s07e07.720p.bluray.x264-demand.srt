1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,912
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,196
<i>After 6 years
of being a vigilante,</i>

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,112
<i>the only way
to achieve my goal</i>

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,272
<i>and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.</i>

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,752
<i>Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.</i>

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,990
<i>I am no longer a hero.</i>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,917
<i>I am inmate 4587.</i>

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,472
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,474
Hmm?

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Felicity, don't.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,279
We need him
to help Oliver.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,875
I made a deal
with the feds, a trade...

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,191
Diaz for your husband.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,600
Oliver's coming home?

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,790
Why'd you kill dunbar?

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,109
I didn't kill
that guard.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,376
Your blade says you did.

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,959
Guards found
prints on it.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,032
Turner, you're
going to the hole.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,999
W-wait. You got
the wrong guy.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,594
If you hadn't found
Turner's Blade,

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,040
it would have been
all over for me.

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,077
You were in the hole,
Stanley,

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,439
so how'd you know
it was Turner's Blade?

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,910
I guess I must have
heard it somewhere.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,632
Good morning, 4587.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,518
A beautiful day.

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,595
Be ready for an escort

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,479
to receiving and
releasing in 6 hours.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,435
As of this afternoon,

31
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,637
you will be a pain
in someone else's ass.

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,270
Ricardo Diaz.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,396
Did you know Queen's
getting out of here today?

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,513
I did, actually.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,679
He told me...

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,440
When I told him how
much I was gonna pay.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,437
Get me a change of clothes.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,078
Get rid of them.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,356
I got a score to settle.

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,440
I can't believe it.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,079
You're gonna get out
of here,

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,471
be able to eat real food,
not this crap.

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,239
I'm really happy
for you, man.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,720
I mean, I'm gonna miss you,

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,029
but the Green Arrow

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,157
never should've been
put behind bars.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Remember when I told you

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,636
that I was wrongfully
accused?

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,076
I was thinking maybe now
that you're getting out,

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,595
you could ask your
friend Laurel

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
to help with my appeal, too.

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,116
Stop.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,714
I know. It's a big ask,

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,474
but, honestly, I don't know
how long I can survive

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,880
in here without you.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,755
Stanley, I'm not
gonna help you, OK,

57
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,714
because in here is

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,150
exactly
where you belong.

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,469
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,112
You killed dunbar, and
then you manipulated me

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,317
into blaming Turner
for it.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,920
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,117
Oliver, we're, like,
best friends.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,998
We were never friends.

65
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,558
I was just doing what
the Green Arrow always does

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,960
to bad guys.

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,096
I don't kill
innocent people.

68
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,270
But you hurt them.

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,917
Remember what you did
to yorke?

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
To those other guards
to get sent to level 2?

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,398
Prison changes people.

72
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,153
It didn't change me.

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,750
When I get out of here,
I promise you...

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,750
You will face justice

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,876
for what you did.

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,670
If you do that,

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,991
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life in here.

78
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
I know.

79
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,238
That's what you deserve.

80
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,551
Don't do this.
Don't do this to me.

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,355
I heard the news...
early release.

82
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,999
You're a lucky boy.

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,595
Too bad Turner
wasn't so lucky.

84
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,079
You know, after today,

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,073
you're never gonna see
my face again.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Tossers like you

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,592
don't stay on
the outside for long.

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,275
Wouldn't be surprised if you
was back here pretty soon.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,076
This ain't good-bye, Queen.

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,230
Turner.

91
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,075
You have a death wish
or something?

92
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,354
I'm gonna find my way
out of here.

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,717
And when I do,
I'm coming for you.

94
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,556
I know that you didn't
kill officer dunbar.

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,993
I made a mistake,

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
and I'm sorry.

97
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,272
What the hell do I care
if you're sorry?

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,875
I'm getting released.

99
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,279
I'm gonna make this
right for you.

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,158
Of course you're
getting out today.

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,833
I'm gonna speak with
Lyla Michaels

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,990
at A.R.G.U.S.,

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,233
and I'll just see if we

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,033
can make some kind
of deal, OK?

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,837
Yeah, I know how much
promises are worth

106
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,151
to people like you,
especially when you

107
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,833
make them to people like me.

108
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,479
That's not true.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,075
Yeah. You think
I'm a criminal...

110
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,629
you said it yourself...

111
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,632
and criminals
belong behind bars.

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,995
Isn't that right?

113
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,075
I think that years ago,
you saved Lyla's life.

114
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,470
Now, I don't know

115
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,120
if you can be that kind
of hero again...

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,035
But I think you deserve
the chance to try.

117
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,720
I have to go.

118
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,916
I'm gonna
make this right.

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,471
Get up, 4587.

120
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,514
You got a visitor.

121
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,756
Hello, Oliver.

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,714
Huh.

123
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,155
I see that prison life

124
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,311
hasn't been treating
you so well.

125
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,993
You listen to me
very carefully.

126
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,400
I don't think you're
in the place

127
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,517
to be giving demands
right now...

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,359
Not unless you want

129
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,079
a whole bunch of
innocent people to die.

130
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,309
When I heard that...

131
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
You were getting
released today,

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,150
it felt as if...

133
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,789
My last chance at payback

134
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,599
was getting away.

135
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,317
And I couldn't have that.

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,234
So that's your play?

137
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,516
You're gonna come after
me in a federal prison?

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,795
Mm-hmm.

139
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,480
See, I've been in and out
of places like this

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,793
my whole life.

141
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,273
I know how to handle
guards like that.

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,515
Do you, brother?

143
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,078
They don't see you as
Green Arrow in here.

144
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,790
You're just a number.

145
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,189
It's pretty dehumanizing,
isn't it?

146
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,976
Bet you weren't
thinking about that

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,198
when you were locking
these people up in here.

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,355
Well...

149
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,714
I'm not gonna do
that to you.

150
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,270
I'm gonna end you.

151
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,879
You're going to die today.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,909
And I'm gonna be the one
who's gonna do it.

153
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,760
But before that...

154
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,595
I'm gonna make you suffer...

155
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,874
The way you made me suffer.

156
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,838
And when I'm done with you,

157
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,470
oh, I'm just gonna,
you know,

158
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,112
pay a little visit
to Felicity...

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,913
Yeah...

160
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,716
And little William.

161
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,271
And I'm gonna make sure

162
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,797
that this time,

163
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,437
I finish the job.

164
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,079
Hey! Get in there!
Get in there now!

165
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,800
Hey! Let me go!

166
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,712
That's Ricardo Diaz...

167
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,040
Get over there!
Get him! Pickup!

168
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,315
That's Ricardo Diaz!

169
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,555
Hey, you,

170
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,154
where do you think
you're going?

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,957
You're lucky we didn't
throw you in the hole,

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,520
inmate.

173
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,552
I don't care if this
is your last day.

174
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,074
As long as you are
in here,

175
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,197
you will still
follow the rules.

176
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,475
You don't understand.

177
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,915
That was Ricardo Diaz.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,356
He is here inside
the prison.

179
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,557
You need to let me
help you stop him.

180
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,233
Slabside is a level 4
supermax facility.

181
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,470
That doesn't matter.

182
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,710
We have 50 officers
on duty,

183
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,792
each one of them
a trained professional.

184
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,997
Trust me.
We have it covered.

185
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,037
Trust me.

186
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,351
That is not gonna be
enough against him.

187
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,873
You only have a few hours
left in here, inmate.

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,158
I suggest you stay
quiet until then.

189
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
Diaz is here?

190
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,918
Oliver, please talk to me.
What are we gonna do?

191
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,277
I know you're still mad
about the dunbar thing,

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,397
but this is Diaz.

193
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,755
I mean, everyone deserves
a second chance, right?

194
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,716
Oh, my god. You're
"shawshanking" out of here.

195
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,354
Oliver, you got to
take me with you.

196
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,159
Stay out of this!

197
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,959
4587, stand down.

198
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,670
If you are not gonna call
for backup, then I will.

199
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,274
Let me go.

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,639
You don't want this.

201
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,914
I said, stand down.

202
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,269
Whoa.

203
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,790
Kiss your
early release good-bye.

204
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,715
Target's on
the third floor.

205
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,076
Initiate lockdown
procedure now!

206
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,320
<i>Lockdown, level one...</i>

207
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,073
Secure perimeter door now!

208
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,032
<i>Lockdown, level one.</i>

209
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,236
Hey! Are we gonna
be here all day?

210
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,437
You are gonna be
here as long as we say.

211
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,079
You got that, inmate?

212
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,799
Inmates!

213
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,315
Look at yourselves.

214
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,116
You're on your knees.

215
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,760
You're cowering before
men who are weak...

216
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,598
Men who are
beneath you.

217
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,598
I've been where you are.

218
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,512
I know how it feels

219
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,590
to be treated like
an animal.

220
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
You can only take that
for so long.

221
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,639
Hey, why don't
you zip it, pal?

222
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,390
Hyah!

223
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,639
Stand up!

224
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,150
These guards,
they imprisoned you.

225
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,993
Yeah.

226
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,794
They disrespected you.

227
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,553
Yeah!

228
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,711
They taunted you.

229
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,632
Yeah!

230
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,359
You all want
to make 'em pay?

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,556
Yeah!

232
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,235
You all want
to make 'em pay?

233
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,913
Yeah!

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,229
Make 'em pay!

235
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,437
Yeah!

236
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,679
No sign of 4587.

237
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,432
You made quite
the mess there, Queen.

238
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,079
Taking out prison guards
doesn't seem

239
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,073
a very Green Arrow
thing to do.

240
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,992
I guess this place
really has changed you.

241
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,959
I don't have time for this.
Ricardo Diaz is here!

242
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,158
And he will not think twice
about killing us all.

243
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,357
No, he won't think
twice about killing you.

244
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
You see, I just met him.

245
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,875
He seems
a reasonable chap.

246
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,872
Of course you're working
for Diaz.

247
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,792
No. I don't work
for anybody.

248
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,636
You see,
me and Sampson,

249
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,235
we got our own
plans, as per usual,

250
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,198
but I could
always take

251
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,431
a little time out
for a bit of fun.

252
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,514
Aah!

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,480
Ugh!

254
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,193
Aah!

255
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,315
Been waiting to do that
for a long time now.

256
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,232
Bad move, Turner.

257
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,479
Sampson...

258
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,279
That was your
femoral artery.

259
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,635
You've got
maybe 6 minutes

260
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,359
before you
bleed out.

261
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,673
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

262
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,909
You're not going
after them?

263
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,753
I've got better
things to do.

264
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,956
Thanks for your help.

265
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,633
It doesn't mean I like you.

266
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,200
Turner...

267
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,118
How did you get out
of your cell?

268
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,998
How did you get out
of yours?

269
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,557
What are you looking for?

270
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,550
Ricardo Diaz broke
into the prison.

271
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,719
People usually break out
of prison.

272
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,513
He wants to kill me,

273
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,559
and he will kill as
many people as he has to

274
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,552
in order for that
to happen.

275
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,552
I thought I had a lot
of enemies.

276
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,632
Don't have a signal.
Come on.

277
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,555
<i>Hello. Are you having
technical difficulties?</i>

278
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,194
<i>It's a little, uh,</i>

279
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,000
<i>little going away present
from the Longbow Hunters.</i>

280
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,312
<i>They jammed the signal,
so no calls in and out.</i>

281
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,790
You are so predictable,
you know that?

282
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,712
You're trying to make
a call for help?

283
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,593
You're
trying to save the day?

284
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,680
Ohh.

285
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,189
I have someone here that
wants to say hello to you.

286
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
Go ahead.

287
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,352
Don't do anything he
tells you to do.

288
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,555
Try again.

289
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,517
You have failed this city,
Oliver Queen.

290
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,439
Diaz, that's enough.
Let him go!

291
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,871
You speak
and people do as you say?

292
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,279
<i>That's how it goes?</i>

293
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,591
Doesn't matter if you're
right or wrong?

294
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,519
Not this time.

295
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,359
Not anymore.

296
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
How's that feel?

297
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,954
How's it feel, somebody
else playing god?

298
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,236
This is between
you and me,

299
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,550
and no one else
needs to die, OK?

300
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,036
<i>Wrong!</i>

301
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,634
<i>Wrong again.</i>

302
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,679
I want you to spend
the last hours

303
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,674
of your pathetic life
knowing

304
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,594
that these men, they died...

305
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,149
they died because of you.

306
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm coming for you.

307
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,594
<i>But will you make it
in time to save the guards?</i>

308
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,240
<i>It was hard enough getting
through a few prisoners.</i>

309
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,232
I wonder what it's
gonna be like

310
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,030
going against
the entire prison.

311
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,154
Keep your head down.

312
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,856
They're not gonna mess
with me. They know better.

313
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,519
It's not about them.

314
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,896
Diaz knew we were
in the locker room,

315
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,593
which means he's
watching us.

316
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,056
There are only two rooms
with camera access.

317
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,514
There's the main
security room...

318
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,637
no way he got in there.
It's too fortified.

319
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,235
Then he's in the control
room in the mess hall.

320
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,515
That's where we
have to go.

321
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,080
There's no "we."

322
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,310
I saved your ass

323
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,536
so you could get me
a deal with A.R.G.U.S.

324
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,000
Doesn't mean we're
some kind of team.

325
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,595
Did you hear Diaz?

326
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,239
He's killing hostages.

327
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
You said I was wrong
about you?

328
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,952
You said you've
changed?

329
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,074
Prove it.

330
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,679
The only way to
the mess hall is

331
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,910
through the cell block.

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,320
It'll be 10 times worse
in there.

333
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,536
This place is already
a powder keg,

334
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,119
and it's about to blow.

335
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,396
It's the only way to
the mess hall.

336
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
These inmates are
gonna kill them.

337
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,680
And if we don't get out of
here, they may kill us,

338
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,877
and, clearly, we'll never
make it to the mess hall.

339
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,350
I'm not gonna let
innocent people die.

340
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,153
Uh!

341
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,118
Hyah!

342
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,998
Uh!

343
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,349
Come on.

344
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,832
Thanks, Queen.

345
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,752
Where are the rest
of the guards?

346
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,216
A few of them made it
to the panic room.

347
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,630
Some were taken to
the mess hall.

348
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,154
Diaz set the inmates loose.

349
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,074
He convinced them
to gather up the guards.

350
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,200
Listen, a few of my buddies
have already died.

351
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,311
It's like Diaz is
killing them for sport.

352
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,199
How many inmates
in the mess hall?

353
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,953
Last I heard, around 30.

354
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,076
You good to walk?

355
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,196
Yeah, I'm good.

356
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,680
All right.

357
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,955
Take them
to the panic room,

358
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,997
and I'll meet you at
the commissary.

359
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,480
Not the time for
a snack.

360
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,416
If we're gonna fight our
way through 30 inmates,

361
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,715
we're gonna need weapons.

362
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,472
I really, really need
to talk to you.

363
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,516
Oh, good.
You're awake.

364
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,320
I'm sorry about
the sedative.

365
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,936
I was just trying
to get your attention.

366
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,680
It's OK. I... I understand,
Stanley.

367
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I was just, um...

368
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,631
Busy trying to stop Diaz from
killing everyone in the prison,

369
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,435
you know?

370
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,480
So, honestly, Stanley, I
think I could use your help.

371
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Really?

372
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,076
Yeah. Really.

373
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,472
Just, why don't you
untie me,

374
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,237
and we'll make a plan
and you can be my sidekick?

375
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,879
Ohh! Heh.

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,992
Actually, I already
have a plan.

377
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,496
You know how to get
out of here

378
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,670
through the morgue,
right?

379
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,070
So why don't we
escape this place,

380
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,879
you... you and me?

381
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,078
Yeah, we could,
but what about Diaz, right?

382
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,480
Who cares about Diaz?

383
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,671
These people deserve whatever
he's gonna do to them.

384
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,830
You know that.

385
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,195
Yeah. I...

386
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,112
I can't leave all
these people to die.

387
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,952
You were gonna leave me.

388
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,600
You were gonna
abandon me

389
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,875
to brick and Sampson,

390
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,270
and I shouldn't even
be in here.

391
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,000
I did nothing wrong.

392
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,719
Hey, come on.

393
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,794
It was just because

394
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,315
you were going to
attack me. OK?

395
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,754
Why would I attack you?

396
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,196
Because you're
the Green Arrow,

397
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,555
and you fight bad guys,

398
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,279
and you think
I'm a bad guy.

399
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
And you just think

400
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,711
that I'm what everyone
says that I am.

401
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,393
How could I?

402
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,870
I don't... I don't know
what people say.

403
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,191
That I'm a killer,

404
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,915
that
I'm a monster,

405
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,311
that everything I did,
everything I did...

406
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,720
that whole dunbar thing.

407
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,792
It was just like
the dunbar thing. I...

408
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,954
I didn't have a choice!
I didn't have a choice!

409
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,111
And all those people
had it coming.

410
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,836
You killed other people
before dunbar?

411
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,833
Honestly, what you and I
do is not so different,

412
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,036
right?

413
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,237
So, like, we make
such a great team.

414
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,760
So why don't we just
get out of here,

415
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
maybe we could work
together again?

416
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,232
Oh!

417
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,033
Why'd you do that?

418
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,673
What the hell
took you so long?

419
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,352
It's a long story.

420
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,669
How are felton and Miller?

421
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,558
They're safe.

422
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,314
I can't believe

423
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,710
I'm working with
the Green Arrow.

424
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,519
You aren't.

425
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,799
Hey, maybe... maybe prison
has changed me,

426
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,837
compromised my
judgment of people.

427
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,400
You sure that's
a bad thing?

428
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,400
Look...

429
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,950
No offense.

430
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,639
But the old Green Arrow,
he wasn't the best.

431
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,712
He saw the world
in black and white,

432
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,712
but now you...
you know

433
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,917
there's gray
out there, too.

434
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,151
Maybe that makes you
a better hero.

435
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,480
Yeah.

436
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,877
And I know it's
bad for you,

437
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,616
but do you really think
you're gonna stop Diaz

438
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,960
with a can of soda?

439
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
We're about to find out.

440
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,519
Are you planning some
kind of light show?

441
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,829
Something like that.

442
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,400
It's nice to know
someone hates Queen

443
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,233
as much as I do.

444
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,839
If it wasn't for him, I'd
still be running Star City.

445
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,559
Yeah, me, too.

446
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,678
He's a cockroach.
He refuses to die.

447
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,239
Diaz!

448
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,790
Look who decided to
come to my party.

449
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,076
Let those guards go.

450
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,515
I told you...

451
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,876
The only thing I wanted was
to see you suffer...

452
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,553
Before you die.

453
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,030
You're not gonna get
what you want.

454
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
No?

455
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,476
Uh!

456
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,269
Ooh. I've been
waiting to do that

457
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,591
for a long time.

458
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,431
Well, get your shots in
while you can

459
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,237
because I'm gonna see to it

460
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,277
that you spend
the rest of your life

461
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,592
eating your meals
in a spot just like this.

462
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
I promised myself

463
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,355
I'm never gonna
die in prison.

464
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,437
And I'm gonna take
you with me.

465
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,512
Are you sure about that?

466
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,756
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

467
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,230
<i>Queen!</i>

468
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,839
Queen!

469
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,556
Calling for help won't save you!

470
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,394
This place...

471
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,918
Is gonna be ash

472
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,914
long before anyone gets here.

473
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,835
<i>System overload.</i>

474
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,320
Come on.

475
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,960
- Get up! Get up! Come on!
- Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go!

476
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,679
Get going.

477
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
What the hell happened?

478
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,115
Diaz has
some sort of device.

479
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,840
It must have triggered
an electrical fire.

480
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,160
The whole place is
gonna go up.

481
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,078
You need to get them
to the secure courtyard.

482
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,389
What about you?

483
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,630
I'm going after Diaz.

484
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,236
You'll need this.
No half-measures.

485
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,239
Just the two of us?

486
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,551
Aah! Uh! Uh!

487
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,277
Hyah!

488
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,590
I'm a lot stronger now.

489
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,071
Uh! Ohh!

490
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,073
Uh! Uh!

491
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,751
Prison's made you weak.

492
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,673
Come on.

493
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,991
Come on.
Get up.

494
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,959
Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,509
You're not
surviving this.

496
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,800
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

497
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,194
I guess what you
and Felicity have

498
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,600
in common, huh?

499
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't you say her name.

500
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,271
Felicity.

501
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,276
Do you know she tried
to kill me?

502
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,320
She put a gun
right to my face.

503
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,397
She was about to pull
the trigger.

504
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
I don't believe you.
That's not her.

505
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,238
It is now.

506
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,232
<i>It's what you made her.</i>

507
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,634
Arrow's little sidekick.

508
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,315
How did you find out
about this place, Dover?

509
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,552
I could ask you
the same question.

510
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,160
Well, the only way out
of this place is

511
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,396
through the morgue.

512
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,358
But you don't have
to be dead.

513
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,636
Actually,
I think you do.

514
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,271
You shouldn't have been
so mean to me.

515
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,995
Turner...

516
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,435
Thanks.

517
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,874
For what?

518
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,760
Without you, we
would all be dead.

519
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,114
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
