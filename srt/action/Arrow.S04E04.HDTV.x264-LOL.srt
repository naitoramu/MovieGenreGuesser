1
00:00:01,164 --> 00:00:03,150
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:04,739
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:06,841
I returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:08,843
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,445
But my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,681
I had to become
someone else.

7
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:15,183
I had to become
something else.

8
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,200
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,117
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,219
I am not going
to kill you,

11
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,855
but you need to trust me,
or we're both dead.

12
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:27,824
What this city needs
is someone willing to stand up

13
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:29,058
in the light of day,

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,994
not a guy lurking
around in the shadows.

15
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,629
I'm going to run for mayor.

16
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,597
What a pleasant
surprise.

17
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,566
I want you to bring
my sister back to life.

18
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,368
Even if Sara went into the Pit,
even if it worked,

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,237
what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

20
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:47,076
We are in uncharted
waters here.

21
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,846
I suggest...
You prepare yourself for the worst.

22
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:57,287
Leave a couple
of those on the table, Junie.

23
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,289
I thought you said we were
delivering 40 kilos.

24
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:03,526
So they'll get 38.
Dumbasses can't count, anyways.

25
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,561
Whoa!
Get down, now!

26
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:06,996
SCPD! On the ground!

27
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,971
Clear!

28
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,006
Clear!
All clear!

29
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:22,512
We're good
to go here.

30
00:01:22,514 --> 00:01:24,981
SCPD, hands in the air!

31
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:28,151
Relax,
we've got this.

32
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:29,552
What are you guys
doing here?

33
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:31,487
We didn't hear a call
from ESU to go out.

34
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,723
You guys aren't supposed
to be here, either.

35
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,358
Yeah, well,

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,894
we got a tip
from one of our CIs.

37
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,702
Sons of bitches!

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,206
Let's go.

39
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,230
<font color=#00FF00>♪ Arrow 4x04 ♪</font>

Original Air Date on October 28, 2015

41
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:03,219
Well, this is
horrible.

42
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:06,356
What type of secret
lair has windows?

43
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,524
Well, you know,
Oliver said he wanted

44
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:10,660
to do things differently.

45
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:14,564
I think I just saw a cockroach.

46
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,100
Listen, about Oliver--

47
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:20,203
No, look, it's fine.
He still thinks

48
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:21,771
we spent the weekend
at a spa.

49
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:25,942
But why can't we
tell him about Sara?

50
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:27,710
Sara, she needs more time,

51
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,879
and I don't need
Oliver's judgment.

52
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:33,483
Just a couple more days,
and she'll be back to herself.

53
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:34,784
I promise.

54
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:37,067
Guessing he didn't tell you
what we're doing here, either.

55
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,083
No.

56
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,238
He just had a perma grin
on his face the whole way here.

57
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,538
Ok, now I'm worried.

58
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,707
He said he had some
big announcement to make.

59
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,445
Oh, my God, wait,
where is it?

60
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:49,579
Why aren't you
wearing it?

61
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:52,716
Wearing what?

62
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:54,618
Uh...

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,954
What is that
you wanted to tell us?

64
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:02,259
And why are you
telling us here?

65
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,227
Remember
this office?

66
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:07,464
Yes. This was Sebastian blood's
campaign office.

67
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,166
And now it's mine.

68
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:11,568
Anyone who's qualified
is afraid to run,

69
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,236
for a good reason.

70
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:15,105
But I can
protect myself.

71
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:17,007
So...

72
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,642
I'm running
for mayor.

73
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:23,480
Uh, don't everyone
congratulate me at once.

74
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:25,282
Oh, you're
serious!

75
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,551
Yes! The other week,
Lance was saying

76
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:30,120
that this city
needs someone

77
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:34,291
to stand up, who isn't hiding
behind a mask. It needs a leader.

78
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:36,159
But why does that person
have to be you?

79
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,495
I mean, don't get me wrong,
but you're not a politician.

80
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:40,897
Well, maybe that's the best reason
for me to be elected.

81
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:43,200
What are you going
to do for a staff,

82
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,736
or campaign manager--money?

83
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,471
Money part's taken care of.

84
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:50,140
Palmer Tech has funded enough
to kickstart the campaign.

85
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:54,077
Another decision my board of directors
are going to be thrilled with.

86
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,312
What platform
are you going to run on?

87
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,913
I'll figure it out.

88
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,782
What qualifies you
to be mayor?

89
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,417
I care about
the city.

90
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,985
But you can't say
that you're going to run

91
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:04,387
because being the Green Arrow
isn't enough.

92
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,189
I'm working on that.

93
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,657
We are going to brush up
on those answers

94
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,326
before the first
press conference.

95
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:10,961
Obviously.

96
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,462
I kind of thought

97
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:15,098
everyone would be
a little bit more supportive.

98
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,768
Oh, it's not that we're not supportive,
Oliver, it's just that--

99
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,504
we just want to make sure that
you're not in over your head.

100
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:22,706
Maybe the other announcement
will go over better.

101
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,008
Ok...

102
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,350
Ha!

103
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:35,852
For real?

104
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:47,831
There's a reason we had
Felicity buy Blood's campaign office.

105
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,833
Blood also needed
his own lair.

106
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:50,967
Don't--don't worry,

107
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,637
I--I burned
a lot of incense.

108
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,949
Oliver, how did you--

109
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,117
How did you do this
all by yourself?

110
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,385
Oh, I had help.

111
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,087
He had a lot of help.

112
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,057
Cisco and S.T.A.R. Labs.

113
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:16,827
Four polycarbonate
cases, each keyed

114
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,995
to your individual
biometrics.

115
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:22,065
Ha! God, I didn't even think you could
pronounce "biometrics."

116
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,600
I had some
design input.

117
00:05:23,602 --> 00:05:26,036
Wow.

118
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:27,871
Oliver,
this is amazing.

119
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,207
Well, when I set up
shop in the foundry,

120
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,108
it was just me.
That's not the case anymore,

121
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,110
so I thought we could
use a little more space.

122
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,412
What was that?

123
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:37,581
What--did it break?

124
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,014
No.

125
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:39,817
You ok?

126
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:42,586
Yeah, I'm just not used
to this chair yet.

127
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,054
I'm feeding police
emergency services

128
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,922
and Homeland Security
radio transmissions

129
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:48,859
through a processing
algorithm 24/7.

130
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,560
This way, if anything
happens in the city,

131
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,429
we will--we will
know about it.

132
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:55,365
Two police detectives
found shot to death

133
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:56,666
responding
to a code three.

134
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:57,901
Um, there's no record

135
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:59,603
of them calling
dispatch for back-up.

136
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,404
Which means either
their comms failed

137
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,139
or they were ambushed
the moment they arrived on the scene.

138
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,641
Thea and I will do recon,
see if there's anything

139
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:06,309
the CSI missed
at the crime scene.

140
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:08,278
All right.
I'll talk to Lance.

141
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,413
Maybe skip the part
about running for mayor,

142
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,182
because I'm pretty sure
you're not going to have his vote.

143
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,050
That'll have to change.
Can't run the city

144
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,952
without the help
of the SCPD.

145
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,488
Ok.
Hmm.

146
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,524
What did Thea think
that you were wearing?

147
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,627
No idea.

148
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:26,463
Fast track ballistics
and have CSI dust

149
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:27,998
every shell casing
for latents.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,233
Ok, forensics recovered
this SIM card.

151
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,801
Probably belongs
to one of the doers,

152
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,803
but CSU says they need 48 hours to
get a full work-up.

153
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:36,406
What? How is evidence
in a crime scene

154
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:39,276
where two detectives
were killed not a top priority?!

155
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:40,710
We don't have
the manpower.

156
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:43,146
Ohhh.

157
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:45,115
You spend
more time here now

158
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,217
than when you were
getting collared for hitting paparazzi.

159
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,852
You got a moment for me?

160
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,854
Yeah.

161
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:52,689
So these visits, are
they going to be a, uh,

162
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,124
weekly thing?

163
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,620
Well, I was trying
to help with, um...

164
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,066
What's that?

165
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,996
I wouldn't know.

166
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:01,364
City hall has cut
my budget so tight,

167
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,500
I can't get evidence
turned around before I'm 80.

168
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,901
I'm hoping that's something
I might be able

169
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,836
to help with eventually.
Yeah?

170
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,672
I've decided
to run for mayor.

171
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,207
Really?

172
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,909
And I know
it's a long-shot,

173
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:14,244
but it would mean a lot if you would
endorse my candidacy.

174
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,545
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

175
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,013
After what happened
to the last few mayors,

176
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,916
I'm hoping you win
in a landslide.

177
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,686
Till then, I'm trying
to catch a cop killer

178
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:26,289
and I don't have time to wait for my
understaffed crime lab.

179
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:34,230
I want you to wait
till nightfall to light a fire.

180
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,733
Otherwise, you're going
to draw attention.

181
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,069
All right,
there's fresh water

182
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:41,571
coming off a stream
at the base of the hill.

183
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:44,074
There's edible plants
maybe 50 feet to the north.

184
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:46,209
Hey, do not eat
the red berries,

185
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:49,079
and do not let
anyone see you.

186
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,914
Why are you
doing this?

187
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,949
Risking your life
to save mine?

188
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,050
It's complicated.

189
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:55,919
They may think
I'm dead,

190
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:58,088
but they're going to come
looking for you.

191
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,357
They're not going to come looking for me.
I'm going back to camp.

192
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,092
I've watched
those men.

193
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,526
They're like brothers
to each other.

194
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,261
They have
a history, a bond.

195
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:07,263
You're not
one of them.

196
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,632
That's why you're going
to have to do something for me.

197
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:13,136
And you're not
going to like it.

198
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,674
Ahem!

199
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:19,242
All right,
so I figured it out.

200
00:08:19,244 --> 00:08:21,978
It's Neal Adams
in data processing.

201
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,914
He won the archery medal
3 years running at his summer camp.

202
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,449
He has a problem
with his temper,

203
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,984
and he likes
the color green.

204
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:29,819
You think that Neal Adams is
the Green Arrow?

205
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:31,023
He's--he's 5'2!

206
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:31,789
Lifts?

207
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,758
I am not telling you
who he is!

208
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,526
Oh, and B-T-Dub,
next time you want to prank your boss--

209
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:37,894
worst career move,
but whatevs--

210
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,062
you might want to
try a little harder.

211
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:40,663
And you lost me.

212
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:42,932
I've been receiving
these all week.

213
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,367
Ok, well,
I didn't send this,

214
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:45,869
and trust me,
if I were going to prank you,

215
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,170
it would be
a lot more creative.

216
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:48,371
This code is from 2013.

217
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:49,773
But the IP address
is coming

218
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,408
from Palmer Tech,
from a terminal here

219
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,742
in your work space.

220
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:53,943
I believe
the term is,

221
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:56,479
you are so busted.

222
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:57,814
I'm not busted.
I can't be busted.

223
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,516
I didn't send you
two-year-old code.

224
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:02,919
Though it is elegant.

225
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,754
And familiar.

226
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:07,090
Hmm?

227
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,692
I was going through some
of, uh, Mr. Palmer's old prototypes,

228
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,194
and I found this.

229
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:14,431
That was Ray's.
I mean...Mr. Palmer's.

230
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,332
I mean, this has code
that's like identical

231
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,834
to what you have
on the phone.

232
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,169
I mean,
the question is,

233
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,570
why is Mr. Palmer's
prototype OS

234
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:22,539
sending you texts
on your phone?

235
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,643
Ray must have connected
the prototype's computer

236
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,144
to the company's
local area network.

237
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:30,313
It did!
It uploaded a crash log.

238
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,215
I mean, the equipment's
programmed

239
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:35,652
to record the user's voice right before
a fatal malfunction.

240
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:37,053
Sorry.

241
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,988
Poor choice of words.

242
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,859
The point is, is that
Mr. Palmer's last recorded statement

243
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:46,196
could shed some light
on how he died.

244
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:47,831
Looks like
it's password protected.

245
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,667
I already know how he died.
I don't need to re-live it.

246
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:51,239
But--

247
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:52,403
But, Ray and I were close.

248
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,071
We were, um, friends.

249
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,840
He died 6 months ago.

250
00:09:56,842 --> 00:10:00,276
I don't really want to open that
particular wound.

251
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,628
It did it again?

252
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:05,382
Nope.

253
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,050
Different mystery.

254
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:12,956
Lance gave us a SIM card
recovered from the crime scene.

255
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,624
Where's Laurel?

256
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,693
She said she had something she
needed to deal with.

257
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,262
Wow, it's a good thing you guys aren't
short handed these days.

258
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,464
This SIM card
isn't from a cell phone.

259
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,867
Looks like some kind
of walkie with GPS.

260
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,902
GPS as in we can track it?

261
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:27,904
As in, I can figure out
all the places it's been

262
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,105
and triangulate from there

263
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,874
to determine...

264
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,242
Where it came from.

265
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:34,310
Gear up.

266
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,084
Fifth floor is clear.

267
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:43,286
Yeah, this place
is completely empty.

268
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,288
I think I found something,
third floor.

269
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,090
Headed your way.

270
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:52,595
Every door here
is open or unlocked,

271
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:54,197
except for this one.

272
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:05,714
Clear.

273
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,211
It's not empty.

274
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:09,846
M4s, Kevlar,

275
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:12,415
flash bang grenades.
Some of this stuff is military-grade.

276
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,485
Well, do you think
we found the Ghost's armory?

277
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,054
No.

278
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,756
Wait...

279
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,891
Star City
police department.

280
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:25,628
The people who killed
those detectives were police officers.

281
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,702
All right,
all right, I'll bite.

282
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:34,771
What are we doing
down in your basement?

283
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:36,639
It's better
if I just show you.

284
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:40,677
After what happened between
us last year,

285
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,745
I swore that I would
never keep secrets from you again,

286
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,981
especially when it has
to do with our family.

287
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:47,850
Family?

288
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,088
Baby?

289
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:03,727
How is--
how is this even possible?

290
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,243
The League of Assassins.

291
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:06,810
They have something
called the Lazarus Pit.

292
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:08,612
It can bring someone
back from the dead.

293
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,148
Back from what? From the--

294
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,016
this isn't back, Laurel.
Look at her. Look--

295
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:14,718
look at my baby.
I--I don't--

296
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,953
Dad, she's alive.

297
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:18,021
Your daughter
is alive.

298
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:22,492
This isn't my daughter.

299
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,194
Daddy, it is.

300
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:26,563
She's just been
gone for a really long time.

301
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,534
It's ok.

302
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:32,603
She'll remember
who she is.

303
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:35,572
We just have
to be patient.

304
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:38,642
And we'll help her find
her wait, right?

305
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,679
Do you remember me?

306
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:46,016
I'm Laurel,
your sister?

307
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,384
Look.

308
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:49,519
There's me,

309
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,455
and this is you.

310
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:53,557
Do you see that?

311
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,492
And who is that?

312
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,361
Is that Daddy?

313
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,033
We're your family.

314
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:04,968
We love you.

315
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:09,373
Who--who am I?

316
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,709
She's speaking

317
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:13,977
because she's
remembering.

318
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:18,615
Laurel!

319
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,754
You all right?
I'm fine!

320
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:25,222
She just...

321
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:27,624
She needs
more time.

322
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:32,029
I think you better add "get an entirely
new police force"

323
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,864
to your campaign
platform.

324
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:37,134
It's not the entire
force, but...Yeah,

325
00:13:37,136 --> 00:13:38,902
we don't know
who's compromised.

326
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:40,107
Except for Captain Lance.

327
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:40,923
Yeah, well, Captain Lance

328
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:42,873
is Mia right now.
I think it's safe to assume

329
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,968
that whatever help
we're going to get,

330
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:44,838
it's right here in this room.

331
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:46,444
I'm working on something.

332
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,111
Cisco said

333
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:50,013
we were still working out
some of the kinks.

334
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,615
In the last two months, there's
been a huge spike

335
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:54,484
on gangs stealing
drug shipments from other gangs.

336
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,720
Yeah, but it's not these gangs,
it's these bad cops.

337
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:58,155
Who steal the drugs
to sell them back

338
00:13:58,157 --> 00:13:59,823
to the gangbangers
they stole them from.

339
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:02,154
So these corrupt cops
are taking down big drug scores.

340
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,360
Mm-hmm.

341
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,507
Let's give them one.

342
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,331
How?

343
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:07,031
That depends on how
close you are

344
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:08,699
with your former drug dealer.

345
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,903
Oh.
Depends which one.

346
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:14,172
We're going
to need some money.

347
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:16,240
Don't you mean
more money?

348
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:18,543
Mm-hmm.

349
00:14:25,084 --> 00:14:27,685
Queenie.

350
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,073
I haven't seen
you in forever.

351
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:29,838
This your boyfriend?

352
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:31,503
Bodyguard.

353
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:32,990
Didn't realize
the Queens

354
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:34,892
could afford that kind of
help these days.

355
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:37,428
Well, I recently
came into my inheritance

356
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,031
and was hoping
to throw a party with it.

357
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,599
So can you
help me out?

358
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:42,733
To the tune of...

359
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,001
80 keys?

360
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:45,309
You know how
I like to party.

361
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,709
I might have
a hook-up.

362
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:50,079
But he doesn't
take credit cards.

363
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:52,549
Let me make a call.

364
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,061
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

365
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:06,396
Ah, yeah,
phone's been off.

366
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:07,664
What, are you
going to tell me

367
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,666
you're running
for president now?

368
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:13,069
Your detectives aren't dead
because of gang violence.

369
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,073
They were killed by cops.

370
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:16,373
What are you talking about?

371
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,042
The SIM card that you gave us;
It led to the killers' armory,

372
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,911
and all the equipment, the weapons,
it was all SCPD-issued.

373
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:24,047
Who is it?

374
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,381
It could be anyone
in the department.

375
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,984
These guys have been
taking down drug busts.

376
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:29,819
So I've had Thea procure
a couple kilos of cocaine--

377
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,422
Your mayoral campaign's off to
a fantastic start.

378
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:35,825
We're keeping the drugs
in a warehouse on Meldrum.

379
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:38,428
I need you to subtly
get the word out.

380
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,430
All right.

381
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,932
Listen, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

382
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,535
I want to be there
when they show.

383
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:47,003
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

384
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:49,005
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
I really give a damn,

385
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,474
because if I got bad
cops in my precinct,

386
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:54,844
I'm going to be there
to bust 'em.

387
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,686
The hell
happened to you?

388
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:06,222
The woman tried
to escape.

389
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,924
We chased her, but she
went through a minefield.

390
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,626
Thought I heard
an explosion earlier.

391
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:10,803
That one got Richards.

392
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:12,062
Son of a bitch.

393
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:14,497
I caught her...
Eventually.

394
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,833
Made it memorable.

395
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:20,803
What, I'm supposed
to kill her, right?

396
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,772
Her, yeah.
Richards, not so much.

397
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,973
I didn't kill Richards.
I told you--

398
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:27,010
A landmine.
I know.

399
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,544
You know
what's funny?

400
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:30,680
We've been here
months without a problem,

401
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:34,651
and here you come and two guys get
wasted by landmines.

402
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,119
What's that supposed to mean?

403
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,454
It means
I want to see her.

404
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,923
The woman.

405
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:42,091
I want to see
the body.

406
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:44,894
Ok.

407
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,098
I know this is
a trap and all,

408
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,266
but something
about the drugs,

409
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,801
the club...

410
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,636
Makes me feel like I'm back in
high school again.

411
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,872
What?

412
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:09,375
Just thinking about how much
I hate raising a daughter in this city.

413
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:10,943
Heads up!

414
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,012
I'm reading a truck
closing in on your position.

415
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,314
The make matches a profile
for an ESU strike vehicle.

416
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:16,749
Copy,
we're ready.

417
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,218
Two minutes out.
Captain Lance.

418
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,454
What, I don't get a code name like
the rest of you?

419
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:24,390
Detective...
Get ready.

420
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:30,062
Target's on site.
Let's go.

421
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,768
We've got multiple
Tangos, move!

422
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,787
Move out!

423
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:29,522
Oh!

424
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,375
You ok?

425
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,410
The training, the equipment,

426
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,512
those were cops.

427
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:56,649
And no, I'm not ok.

428
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,175
You have got
to be kidding me.

429
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:10,325
Oh, no, um, not to complain,

430
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:12,294
but you do know that
you just brought a police captain

431
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,762
into our secret lair?

432
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:16,198
Don't worry; I got enough to put you
away for 25 years.

433
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,500
Kidding.

434
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:20,469
Captain Lance isn't the police
we should be worried about.

435
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:23,171
Wow. No wonder there's
corruption on the force.

436
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:24,873
Everyone else has got
better resources.

437
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,341
I don't know.
Those ESU

438
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:28,810
had some pretty
fancy toys tonight.

439
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:31,480
That definitely weren't
standard police issue.

440
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:33,081
Well, they were
police issue, all right,

441
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,084
but just not standard.
Those were specialized

442
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:37,819
anti-vigilante
task force gear.

443
00:19:37,821 --> 00:19:39,755
I thought the task force
was disbanded.

444
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:41,490
Yeah, I might have
reinstated that,

445
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,859
um, last year.

446
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:44,880
How many officers are there?

447
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:46,062
40 or so.

448
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:48,530
Well, that definitely
narrows things down a bit.

449
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,998
We should check
their conduct records.

450
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,666
Maybe that'll narrow it
down a little bit more.

451
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,570
Yeah, that's going to take a little bit
longer than usual.

452
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:57,773
Well, I can give you
unrestricted access

453
00:19:57,775 --> 00:20:00,142
to the department's
computer network.

454
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:02,010
Might speed things up
a little.

455
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,745
I'll see what I can
dig up at the precinct.

456
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:15,290
Looks like 80 keys here.

457
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:17,692
Idiots baited the mouse
trap with real cheese.

458
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,561
Because they knew we'd
sniff them out otherwise.

459
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,763
Well, it's a good thing
we decided to pack the special gear.

460
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,532
We weren't the only ones showing up
with a little surprise tonight.

461
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:25,100
Captain Lance?

462
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:27,135
There's no way he didn't
peg us as cops.

463
00:20:27,137 --> 00:20:28,580
We got to take him out.

464
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,273
We don't kill cops.

465
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,674
Tell that to the two gold
shields we wasted last night.

466
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:33,942
They were in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

467
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,977
I'm not killing fellow
officers in cold blood.

468
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:39,114
Our advantage was the force
thought we were gangbangers.

469
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:40,849
We should put this
to a vote.

470
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,185
My vote? Nine millimeters,

471
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:46,421
and the only one
that counts.

472
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:50,525
We are not criminals.
Let's all just try to remember that.

473
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:52,661
We went this route
because the city is dying,

474
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:55,430
and we need to be able
to provide for our families.

475
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:59,734
Still doesn't change
the fact that Lance is a problem.

476
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:02,537
No, he's not.

477
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,073
He's a solution.

478
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:06,308
Curtis?

479
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,476
There you are!

480
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:09,044
Why haven't you been
answering my texts?

481
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:10,645
Your texts were
"911," "OMG,"

482
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,614
"ASAP," and five
exclamation points.

483
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,616
I do not have time
to respond to something

484
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:17,018
that doesn't contain
at least one actual word.

485
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,321
I need your help
with Mr. Palmer's crash log.

486
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:20,655
I thought I told you
to let that go.

487
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:22,357
Look, I've tried brute
forcing a password,

488
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,725
but nothing works.

489
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:25,160
But there is a subkernel

490
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,661
that contains
a programmer note.

491
00:21:26,663 --> 00:21:28,096
Oh, my God, this must be
what talking to me is like.

492
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:31,266
And that programming note suggests that
you know the password.

493
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:34,002
I mean, which makes sense,
right? You and Mr. Palmer were friends.

494
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:37,005
Yeah, I know the password.

495
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,040
You do? So tell it
to me so we can--

496
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,376
No! I...

497
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:45,113
I do not want to listen
to a recording

498
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:48,850
of my ex-boyfriend's
final moment before he died.

499
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,522
You and Mr. Palmer
were together?

500
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:57,559
Now do you understand
why I don't want to hear his voice?

501
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:00,262
No.

502
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:07,269
My brother died
six years ago.

503
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:10,105
Pancreatic cancer.

504
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:13,942
To be
able to hear

505
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:18,847
something from him I've
never heard before...

506
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,483
God, I'd--I'd
give anything.

507
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,093
Captain Lance.

508
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,262
What a pleasure it was
to receive your message.

509
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:35,764
And for you
to initiate contact,

510
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,566
well, made me feel
like our relationship

511
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,134
took an important
step forward.

512
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,335
I need your help.

513
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,870
I'm sorry,
say that again.

514
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:43,338
It's for my daughter.
Not the one

515
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,639
that you're holding
over me as leverage.

516
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:46,775
Sara, the one
you lost last year.

517
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,610
Yeah, she's back.

518
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:50,946
This thing called
the Lazarus Pit.

519
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:53,215
I'm sure
you've heard of it.

520
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,616
What, you did your
homework on me;

521
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,151
you don't think I
did a little digging around on you?

522
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:57,886
You used to be
a member

523
00:22:57,888 --> 00:22:59,154
of the League
of Assassins.

524
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,122
What is it you want,
Mr. Lance?

525
00:23:01,124 --> 00:23:03,024
It's my daughter.

526
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:03,810
She's not right.

527
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,194
She's--she's come back
and she's different.

528
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:06,394
She's crazy!

529
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:08,230
It's a miracle
she came back at all.

530
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:11,900
It doesn't feel like a miracle.
All right?

531
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:13,735
Now you know
about this stuff.

532
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:14,736
Is there anything
I can do?

533
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:16,137
Is there anything
that you can do?

534
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:18,039
I can give advice,
father to father.

535
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,575
I can tell you that if it were
my daughter,

536
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:23,044
I'd put her down.

537
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:27,816
She's my baby girl.

538
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:29,551
No, she isn't.
She may look like your daughter,

539
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:31,753
but she doesn't
possess her soul.

540
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,491
The most loving act
you can commit

541
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:39,594
is to return Sara
to her final rest.

542
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:42,564
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:57,212
Ohh.

544
00:23:57,214 --> 00:24:00,315
Oh, I am so glad
we came back.

545
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,443
You all right?

546
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,306
Hmm?

547
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,389
You're doing that,

548
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,658
um, crinkly thing
with your eyebrows.

549
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,559
Oh, just, um,
ha, no,

550
00:24:11,561 --> 00:24:13,628
just something at work.
It's no big deal.

551
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,831
Um, this work.
Big deal.

552
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,033
Liza Warner.

553
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:19,501
I pulled her SCPD
personnel file

554
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:22,137
using my computer
at Palmer Tech since ours is fritzing.

555
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:26,074
One of the original recruits to the
anti-vigilante task force over 3 years ago.

556
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,209
Hand-picked by then
Detective Lance.

557
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,211
Do we think
she's a suspect?

558
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:31,846
I think that Sergeant Warner

559
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:33,748
has deposited over
a quarter of a million dollars

560
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,717
into offshore bank accounts
in the last three months.

561
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:36,918
Where can we
find her?

562
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,586
I am working on that.

563
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:41,489
I used the network access
that Captain Lance gave us

564
00:24:41,491 --> 00:24:44,025
and I turned on every uniform
and squad car camera

565
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,428
on the force
in the last 12 hours.

566
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,831
I'm running facial recognition
looking for Warner.

567
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,599
Do you see something?

568
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,068
No, someone.

569
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,836
Pause.

570
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:59,607
Zoom in.
Mm-hmm.

571
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:02,711
The man that Lance
is talking to...

572
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,080
That's Damian Darhk.

573
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:15,719
Aye yi yi.

574
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:17,295
Oh, jeez. Heh.

575
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,131
You know I got a heart
condition, right?

576
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,768
For years, you've looked at me
with such contempt.

577
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,837
Utter disdain.

578
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:30,474
So I'm wondering...

579
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:33,711
Do I have that same
look on my face now?

580
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:36,580
What the hell
are you talking about?

581
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,082
I'm talking
about you...

582
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,017
and Damian Darhk.

583
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:46,190
Ok, it's, it's--

584
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:49,427
I didn't know
if you knew who he was,

585
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:53,364
or what he's been
doing to this city.

586
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:57,068
And now I see this
look on your face.

587
00:25:58,104 --> 00:26:00,871
You know.

588
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:04,675
It's complicated.

589
00:26:04,677 --> 00:26:06,444
No, it's not.

590
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:09,613
Do you have any idea how many
people he's killed?

591
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,082
Yeah, I got more
of an idea than you.

592
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:12,483
And listen, you,
you of all people,

593
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,085
you don't get
to come in to my house

594
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:15,486
and pass judgment on me,
all right?!

595
00:26:15,488 --> 00:26:18,189
No, you always held yourself out
as better than me.

596
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:22,493
More righteous.

597
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,204
And you were.

598
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,767
Until tonight.

599
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,770
Actually, it's been a little more than
two months now,

600
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:35,473
me working with Darhk.

601
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:38,642
It started out benign.

602
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,778
He said he had resources;

603
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,948
he had people, money.

604
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,984
He held himself out
as just another guy

605
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,452
who wanted to help this city.

606
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:52,723
And we needed the help.

607
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:55,459
You weren't here.

608
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,329
By the time I figured out
who he was,

609
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:00,464
what he was...

610
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:02,633
That's when
he threatened Laurel.

611
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,702
Laurel can take care of herself. You see
what she does out there.

612
00:27:04,704 --> 00:27:06,637
That's what I thought
about Sara, too--

613
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:07,872
Stop, stop it!

614
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:09,907
Stop hiding behind
your daughters!

615
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:12,309
They would be ashamed of what
you're doing right now.

616
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,611
You don't know what
I'm going through.

617
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:17,148
You were the main reason behind me
running for mayor!

618
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,684
A part of me

619
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,453
has always
wanted you to see

620
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:26,323
what kind of man
I really am.

621
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,926
I didn't expect

622
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:32,663
to wind up finding out what kind of
man you really are.

623
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:41,372
What are you going to do?

624
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:45,876
I don't know.

625
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,849
How'd you do it?

626
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:53,918
Kill the woman.
How'd you do it?

627
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,119
Strangled her.

628
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:57,354
I thought you said
you made it--

629
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,390
what was that
word--memorable.

630
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:02,359
Ah, she won't forget it.

631
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,928
What?

632
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,529
You going to propose?

633
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:08,065
You don't sound like a guy who
just committed his first murder,

634
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,801
and I'm guessing you didn't have
too many opportunities

635
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:13,103
in that posh boarding
school you grew up in.

636
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,172
You think I'm lying?

637
00:28:15,174 --> 00:28:18,242
I think if you're not, then you're
a stone cold killer.

638
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:21,045
Even if you didn't off her, even if
you're messing with me--

639
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:24,148
which I do not
recommend...

640
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,716
I see it
in your eyes.

641
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:28,085
Reiter saw it, too.

642
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:29,753
It's probably why
he recruited you.

643
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,155
Saw what?

644
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:33,424
You are one
dark bastard.

645
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:36,160
Something very cold
inside of you.

646
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:38,195
You're terrified of it.

647
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:41,198
Ok, Conklin,
tell me something.

648
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,369
If I'm this dark person...

649
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:47,871
Shouldn't you
be afraid of me?

650
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:49,540
Nah.

651
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:52,243
I'm the exact
same way.

652
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:54,745
If you're lying to me, you're going
to find that out.

653
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:07,424
Nice sign.

654
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:09,827
Arrived this morning.

655
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:12,296
You all right?

656
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:14,398
Just thinking.

657
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,900
About?

658
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:21,639
Going to Sentinel
Games as kids.

659
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:23,474
Do you remember
Papp Stadium?

660
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:24,908
Oh, yeah.

661
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,144
I loved the popcorn.

662
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:29,847
Every time a Sentinels
player hit a homer,

663
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:32,816
every single person
in that stadium stood and cheered.

664
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,819
Every single one.

665
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,388
United.

666
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,057
And I wanted
to run for mayor

667
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,028
because I wanted to be
the leader of that city.

668
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,829
Wanted?

669
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:50,134
Thea, I don't know
if that city exists anymore.

670
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:53,504
I think that it might be
beyond saving.

671
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:55,939
So what
are you saying?

672
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:59,443
That I don't have
to run for mayor.

673
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:30,040
I'm sorry, baby,
but you're not her.

674
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:38,649
You're not her.

675
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,051
Dad!

676
00:30:46,392 --> 00:30:49,026
Dad, what the hell
are you doing?

677
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:51,295
I'm doing what
I got to do.

678
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:56,033
You got not idea what terrible things
I would do for both of you.

679
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:59,303
No, no, you are not
going to kill your own daughter.

680
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,971
She's not my daughter!

681
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,273
Dad, it's Sara.

682
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:08,679
It's ok.

683
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,717
Oh, God.

684
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,586
Dad.

685
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:18,463
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

686
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:19,151
It's ok!

687
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:20,051
What am I doing?!

688
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,217
Look at me, it's ok.
It's ok.

689
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:23,193
What am I doing?

690
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:26,096
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

691
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:28,332
I'm sorry.

692
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:33,404
Captain Lance.

693
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,172
Liza. What--
what are you doing here?

694
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:36,540
I heard you were
looking for me.

695
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,008
Thought I'd make it
easier for you.

696
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,444
What the hell
are you talking about?

697
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:55,125
Dad!

698
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:18,406
Ever been here before?

699
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:21,209
It's the SCPD's contraband
disposal facility.

700
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:23,144
Thousands of pounds
of Slam, Vertigo,

701
00:32:23,146 --> 00:32:26,414
heroin, all incinerated.
That's just literally burning money.

702
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,350
Yeah, and the site requires the precinct
captain to gain access,

703
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:30,919
and that's
not happening.

704
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,487
What was your plan, Quentin?

705
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:34,022
You have to know
the city's dying.

706
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:36,724
Were you just going to stay at your desk
until there was no city left.

707
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,092
I'll tell you what I
wasn't going to do--

708
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,994
I wasn't going to
dishonor the badge like you have.

709
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:41,596
I'm no Saint, but at least
I'm not a criminal.

710
00:32:41,598 --> 00:32:43,598
Neither am I.
I'm just a desperate cop

711
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
that got backed into
too tight a corner.

712
00:32:57,514 --> 00:32:59,047
What do we know?

713
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,815
Liza Warner and her posse

714
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:02,083
took Lance outside
of Laurel's apartment.

715
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:03,718
We need to find
my father.

716
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,654
I'm working on it.
Just a little hampered.

717
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:08,990
I think I got something
before the latest glitch.

718
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:11,459
Captain Lance's ID was just to access
the SCPD contraband

719
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:13,394
disposal facility
3 minutes ago.

720
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:18,633
Thank you, Quentin.

721
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,535
Sorry about all the paperwork
you'll have to fill out

722
00:33:20,537 --> 00:33:22,203
when they find you.

723
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:23,872
Word of advice--put
a bullet in my head now

724
00:33:23,874 --> 00:33:25,540
'cause I am coming after
you with everything.

725
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,809
By the time they find you,
we'll be long gone.

726
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,445
We're leaving this city
like everybody else.

727
00:33:48,365 --> 00:33:51,466
New frequency, same cry.

728
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:58,072
Let's get out of here!

729
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,512
Sergeant Warner,

730
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:06,581
you have failed this city.

731
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,084
Is that all you got?

732
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:12,754
Nope.

733
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:46,487
Get out of here.

734
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:55,663
All I got to do is push
and I'll sever your spinal cord.

735
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:56,998
Aah!

736
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,666
But you're not going
to do it, Liza.

737
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:01,636
You said you're
not a criminal.

738
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:03,504
You kill that man,
you are.

739
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:04,872
I told you I wasn't
a criminal.

740
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:07,642
But I also told you
I was desperate.

741
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:10,411
We all are.

742
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,814
Living in this city,

743
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:15,049
dealing with what we're
dealing with right now?

744
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:15,664
We're all desperate.

745
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,756
We've all been made
to do desperate things.

746
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,023
Terrible things.

747
00:35:23,326 --> 00:35:25,059
But I got to believe

748
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:27,462
that we are not
beyond redemption.

749
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:32,000
And I got to believe
that this city can still be saved.

750
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:34,936
'Cause once
we stop believing,

751
00:35:34,938 --> 00:35:37,639
that's when this
city really dies.

752
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,941
And us, us, right
along with it.

753
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:44,012
Maybe, just maybe,

754
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:46,848
we start saving
our home

755
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:50,084
by saving
ourselves first.

756
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:53,187
And that means facing up
to our mistakes.

757
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:55,857
That means
facing justice.

758
00:35:57,127 --> 00:36:00,328
You put on
that uniform

759
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,664
'cause you
believe in justice.

760
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,699
Ask yourself,
Warner...

761
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:08,269
Is that still
the case?

762
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,476
Do what
you got to do.

763
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,682
I guess you know
your Miranda rights.

764
00:36:33,574 --> 00:36:36,174
You got your own key
or something?

765
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:38,410
What you said to Warner
saved my life.

766
00:36:38,412 --> 00:36:42,013
I...I didn't know you had such a way
with words.

767
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:43,915
Well, I don't do encores.

768
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,485
You believe
what you said?

769
00:36:46,487 --> 00:36:48,687
Yeah.
Every word.

770
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:53,091
Especially the part
about facing justice.

771
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:55,961
When One Police Plaza
opens this morning,

772
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,863
I will be there
turning myself in.

773
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:00,031
I can't
have you do that.

774
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:02,734
We haven't been
able to get close to Darhk.

775
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:05,637
You have.

776
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,974
I'd like you
to stick around.

777
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,343
Stay on the inside.

778
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,445
Wow.

779
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,266
Well, that's only a smart plan
if you can trust me.

780
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,300
I trust the man who said
we can't stop believing

781
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,871
we can save this city.

782
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,566
Like I said--

783
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,934
stone cold killer.

784
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,135
You satisfied?

785
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,271
Get rid of the body.

786
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,575
This cave might be
useful for something.

787
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,722
It's ok.

788
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,691
You're ok.

789
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,661
How did you--
where did you learn to do that?

790
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,530
I learned it here.

791
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,900
I haven't always
been alone on this island.

792
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,860
Son of a bitch.

793
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,534
Oh, my God,
he's here.

794
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:00,336
Hi.

795
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,472
How you doing, man?
Oliver Queen.

796
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,574
Hi there.

797
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,343
It's, uh,
absolutely wonderful

798
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,812
that--that all of
you are--are here.

799
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,814
Just--just wonderful.

800
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,883
And surprising.

801
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,485
So, what do you think?

802
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,422
Um, hey, did you--
did you hire all of these people?

803
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,192
No, that's what makes
them interns, Ollie.

804
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,927
Where did we get all
of these interns?

805
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,329
Easiest way to get
a lot of followers on social media

806
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:31,000
is to own a very
successful club.

807
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:35,538
All I had to do was tell them
what I've already known for 3 years.

808
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,774
Oliver Queen is going
to save this city.

809
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,042
What's this?

810
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,510
This your speech.

811
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,380
You're announcing
your candidacy this afternoon,

812
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,783
so you better get your suit
out of moth balls.

813
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,852
Did you write this?

814
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:53,255
I wrote it down.

815
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,724
Just with what you told me,

816
00:39:55,726 --> 00:40:00,396
about this city being united.

817
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,631
United.

818
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,967
That's what
this city used to be.

819
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,402
It's what it can be.

820
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,004
It's what it must be again.

821
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,541
Now, I know that
I'm not the obvious choice for mayor.

822
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,210
I'm--I'm not
a politician.

823
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,979
I signed away
my family's company.

824
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,448
I didn't even
graduate from college,

825
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,417
although, in my defense,

826
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,419
I did go to four of them.

827
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,455
I certainly don't have a traditional
background for leadership,

828
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,157
but I can tell you this--

829
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,126
after five years in hell,

830
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,230
I returned home
with only one goal.

831
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,066
I wanted to save my city.

832
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,734
And with your help,

833
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:40,069
I can.

834
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:43,138
With your help,
we will restore our home

835
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,875
to the shining beacon
we know it can be.

836
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:50,479
But how we're going to get
there isn't a mystery.

837
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,681
We will overcome
our challenges

838
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,084
with help from our friends,

839
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,820
our family,

840
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,022
our loved ones.

841
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:07,529
I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.

842
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,898
Those we trust,

843
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,669
and those we will need to trust again
in order to prevail.

844
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,373
Because the only way that we are
going to return our home to greatness

845
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,009
is to do so together.

846
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,191
United.

848
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:12,807
Greg!
Move your head.
