1
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,361
It's time to go.

2
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,841
Did you hear me? This is
an evacuation. You understand?

3
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,001
- You have to come with me.
- Why?

4
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:43,201
Because they told me,
so now I'm telling you.

5
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,601
Everyone in this village,
everyone.

6
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,761
It's not safe here.
There's radiation in the air.

7
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,321
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:51,121
Do you know how old I am?

9
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,041
I don't know. Old.

10
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,001
I'm 82.

11
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,681
I've lived here my whole life,

12
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,081
right here,
that house, this place.

13
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:05,801
What do I care about safe?

14
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,361
I have a job.
Don't cause trouble.

15
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,401
Trouble?

16
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,161
You're not the first soldier
to stand here with a gun.

17
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:19,001
When I was 12,
the Revolution came.

18
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:23,121
The Tsar's men,
then Bolsheviks.

19
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:25,641
Boys like you marching in lines.

20
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,081
They told us to leave.

21
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:31,441
No. Then there was Stalin
and his famine.

22
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,601
The Holodomor.

23
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,361
My parents died.
Two of my sisters died.

24
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,121
They told the rest of us
to leave.

25
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:43,641
No. Then the Great War.

26
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,161
German boys, Russian boys.

27
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:50,401
More soldiers, more famine,
more bodies.

28
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:53,801
My brothers never came home.

29
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:58,881
But I stayed and I'm still here,
after all that I have seen.

30
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,561
So I should leave now,

31
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,881
because of something
I cannot see at all?

32
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,081
No.

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,761
Just one moment!

34
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,761
It's time to go.

35
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,521
Please stand up now.

36
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:54,281
This is your last warning.

37
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:11,921
It's time to go.

38
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,841
0.4.

39
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:39,041
0.6.

40
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:45,761
15.

41
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:42,441
Legasov.

42
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,321
I'll meet him there.

43
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:44,401
The atom is a humbling thing.

44
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,361
It's not humbling,
it's humiliating.

45
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,881
Why is the core still exposed
to the air?

46
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,961
Why have we not
already covered it up?

47
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:57,681
We want to,
but we can't get close enough.

48
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:01,481
The debris on the roof is
graphite from the core itself.

49
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:05,321
Until we can push it off
the roof, back into the reactor,

50
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,761
it'll kill anyone
who gets near it.

51
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,721
You can see,
the roof is in three levels.

52
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:14,801
We've named them.
The small one here is Katya.

53
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,161
1,000 roentgen per hour.

54
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:19,921
Presume two hours
of exposure is fatal.

55
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:23,961
The one on the side, Nina.
2,000 roentgen. One hour, fatal.

56
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:26,801
We used remote-controlled
bulldozers in Afghanistan.

57
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:30,081
Too heavy.
They'd fall right through.

58
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,281
- So, then...
- Moon rovers.

59
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,721
Lunokhod STR-1s.

60
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,801
They're light,
and if we line them with lead,

61
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:38,441
they can withstand
the radiation.

62
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,601
We couldn't put a man
on the moon.

63
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,761
At least we can keep a man
off a roof.

64
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,081
That is the most important
thing, General.

65
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,801
Under no circumstances
can men go up there.

66
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,441
Robots only.

67
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:52,841
What about
this large section here?

68
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,081
Masha.

69
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:58,161
12,000 roentgen.

70
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,641
If you were to stand there
in full protective gear,

71
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,401
head to toe, for two minutes,

72
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,241
your life expectancy
would be halved.

73
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,481
By three minutes,
you're dead within months.

74
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:10,641
Even our lunar rovers
won't work on Masha.

75
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,761
An amount of gamma radiation
penetrates everything.

76
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,321
The particles literally shred

77
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,321
the circuits
in microchips apart.

78
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:19,641
If it's more complicated
than a light switch,

79
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,441
Masha will destroy it.

80
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,721
It would be fair to say that
that piece of roof

81
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,881
is the most
dangerous place on earth.

82
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,401
So... what do we do?

83
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:39,521
That's what
we wanted to ask you.

84
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,881
Tent 181?

85
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,481
Hey.

86
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,961
It's all right, it's free.

87
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,961
It's a little early.

88
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,721
- Bacho.
- Pavel.

89
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,041
- Yeah?
- Hm.

90
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:36,801
What unit were you in?

91
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,961
Er... they had me in motor pool
in Kiev, but then they...

92
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:43,041
Not this bullshit.
In Afghanistan.

93
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,441
Oh, I erm...
I wasn't in Afghanistan.

94
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,121
I'm not in the military.

95
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:55,041
They're running out of men.

96
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,121
Showers, food.

97
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,681
Those guys,
they dig up the ground.

98
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,081
Those guys, they cut down trees.

99
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:17,961
Those guys, they evacuate
people, I think, like villages.

100
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:23,201
- What about them?
- I don't know them. Fuck them.

101
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,521
Janek.

102
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:30,681
- What do you want?
- Give me an egg basket.

103
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,721
- No, I've only got the one.
- Give me the fucking basket.

104
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:41,121
He's with me. You understand?
Nobody fucks with him.

105
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,281
We make these from lead scrap.

106
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,601
- Put it on under your balls.
- Now?

107
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,161
No, no, you can wait until
the radiation gives you a cunt.

108
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,121
Yes, now.

109
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:56,721
Over your clothes! Fucking shit!

110
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:07,481
- You ever go hunting?
- No.

111
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,801
Well, today's your lucky day.

112
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:15,121
You, me, that ugly Armenian
in the tent, Garo,

113
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,921
we do animal control.

114
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:19,801
Animal control?

115
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,601
Yeah, they're radioactive,
so they have to go.

116
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,481
But it's not hard.
They're mostly pets.

117
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,281
They're happy to see you.

118
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,961
They run right up to you. Bang.

119
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,921
We load the bodies on the truck,
dump them in a pit,

120
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,841
bury them in concrete,
and then we drink.

121
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,881
As much vodka as you want.
Plus 1,000 roubles.

122
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,801
Let's go get you a gun.

123
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,081
Yes?

124
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,161
I need to see
the following documents.

125
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,321
They're listed
as permission only.

126
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,441
I'm working for
the Central Committee.

127
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:16,521
Comrade.

128
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:54,001
She can have that one.

129
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,681
Thank you, comrade.

130
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,521
<i>- All clear.</i>
- Bring up the cameras.

131
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,681
- Signal?
- Acceptable.

132
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,481
Running on-board diagnostics.

133
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:51,681
Tell me when
we're ready to move it.

134
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:55,001
To think,
that's what we put on the moon.

135
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,721
Not that one.

136
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,881
I know not that one.

137
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,241
This rover was in storage.
They can build two more.

138
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:07,521
That should cover
Nina and Katya.

139
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:09,561
And Masha?

140
00:19:09,721 --> 00:19:11,761
The Central Committee
have informed me

141
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:13,521
that they may have
found something

142
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,641
that could work up there
from the outside.

143
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:18,921
- American?
- Of course not.

144
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,121
It's a German police robot.

145
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:23,681
But West German,
so, as you can imagine,

146
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,841
that wasn't
an easy conversation to have.

147
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:29,521
Diagnostics complete. Ready to
engage main power and motor.

148
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,401
Begin.

149
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,681
Can we move it?

150
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,601
Valery, was that... a smile?

151
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,561
I see your condition has
improved, Comrade Dyatlov.

152
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,561
No. Leave.

153
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:25,761
I need your help.

154
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:35,921
Akimov initiated AZ-5.

155
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:38,841
- When you gave the order...
- Order? What order?

156
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:43,241
Toptunov called it out,
Akimov pressed it.

157
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,601
It was the only good decision
they made, incompetent morons.

158
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,841
Can you confirm
that the reactor exploded

159
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,121
after they attempted
to shut it down?

160
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,561
How do I even know it exploded,
huh?

161
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,881
I found this
in the state archive.

162
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,001
Written in 1976.

163
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,241
It's about the operation
of RBMK reactors

164
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,801
under extreme conditions.

165
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,321
So?

166
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:29,641
The names of the authors
have been redacted

167
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,601
and two pages have been removed.

168
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:35,681
Well, the state must protect
its secrets, comrade.

169
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:38,001
Do you dare suggest otherwise?

170
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,521
They made a mistake.

171
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:44,961
They didn't redact
the table of contents.

172
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,441
The missing pages
apparently refer to

173
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:00,561
a positive void coefficient
and AZ-5.

174
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,081
Does that mean anything to you?

175
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:05,281
What are you after?
Why are you asking me this?

176
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,561
You worked with this reactor,
you know it more than I.

177
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:09,521
So everything's my fault, then?

178
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:13,121
- Is that what this is?
- I'm not here to blame you.

179
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:15,081
I'm here to find out
what happened.

180
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:16,921
And whether
you realise it or not,

181
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,081
I'm your best chance
to avoid a bullet.

182
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:23,801
Can you help me or not?

183
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,881
I have no idea
what would have gone here.

184
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,761
Void coefficients
have nothing to do with AZ-5.

185
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:39,801
There, now you can go.

186
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,281
- You're not even curious?
- What for?

187
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:46,841
What, you think the right
question will get you the truth?

188
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:49,321
There is no truth.

189
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,921
Ask the bosses whatever
you want, you'll get the lie.

190
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,121
And I will get the bullet.

191
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:27,001
I only have two rules.

192
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:31,761
One, don't point this gun at me.
That's easy, right?

193
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,257
You can point it at this piece
of shit, I don't give a fuck.

194
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,761
Never me.

195
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:40,801
Two, if you hit an animal
and it doesn't die,

196
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:43,281
keep shooting until it does.

197
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,201
Don't let them suffer.

198
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,201
Or I'll kill you. Understand?

199
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:50,961
I mean it.

200
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,761
I've killed a lot of people.

201
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:01,281
Good. Then we're ready.

202
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:42,321
Once we start, they'll run
inside where they feel safe.

203
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:44,601
So we go door to door.

204
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,841
OK?

205
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,401
Good.

206
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:40,201
Hey. Do your job. Door to door.

207
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,961
Go. Go.

208
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:36,361
Go away. Go!

209
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:32,601
- Don't let them suffer.
- Sorry.

210
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,321
Sorry.

211
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:38,481
You're dragging that
to the truck.

212
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:15,081
You gonna eat?

213
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:27,161
Drink.

214
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,681
Again.

215
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,361
Look...

216
00:29:46,401 --> 00:29:48,841
..this happens to everyone
their first time.

217
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:51,881
Normally, when you kill a man.

218
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,241
But for you, a dog.

219
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:58,241
So what? There's no shame in it.

220
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:01,721
You remember your first time,
Garo?

221
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:05,121
My first time, Afghanistan.

222
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:11,401
We were moving through a house
and... suddenly a man was there

223
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,641
and I shot him in the stomach.

224
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,361
Yeah, that's a real war story.

225
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,641
They're never any good stories,
like in the movies.

226
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:22,761
They're shit.

227
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,201
A man was there - boom, stomach.

228
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:30,641
I was so scared,
I didn't pull the trigger again

229
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:32,801
for the rest of the day.

230
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,161
I thought,
"Well, that's it, Bacho.

231
00:30:38,441 --> 00:30:40,481
You put a bullet in someone.

232
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:44,441
You're not you any more.
You'll never be you again."

233
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:50,681
But then you wake up the next
morning and you're still you.

234
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:55,761
And you realise...
that was you all along.

235
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:58,681
You just didn't know.

236
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:11,121
The happiness of all mankind.

237
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:15,921
What?

238
00:31:17,121 --> 00:31:20,321
"Our goal is the happiness
of all mankind."

239
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,801
Yeah.

240
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:36,481
I'm happy. I'm happy every day.

241
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,561
All right. Back to work.

242
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,521
Come on.

243
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,361
It's here.

244
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:33,641
Push it over.
Hang on, hang on.

245
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:38,441
Easy now. Careful.

246
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,401
Pull it.

247
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,241
Joker.

248
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:52,721
What the Germans named them.
"Joker".

249
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,601
- Is it ready?
- It's ready.

250
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,121
Good signal.

251
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:46,601
Cameras? Motors?

252
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:51,401
Motor's good. Signal's good.

253
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:54,441
All right, let's take this easy.

254
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,921
Forward one metre,
reverse one metre.

255
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,321
Forward one.

256
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:05,801
Germans.

257
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,241
Reverse one.

258
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:22,881
Did you lose the signal?

259
00:35:27,481 --> 00:35:30,321
It's not the signal,
it's the vehicle.

260
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:32,161
It's dead.

261
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:45,561
Of course
I know they're listening!

262
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:47,601
I want them to hear!
I want them to hear it all!

263
00:35:47,681 --> 00:35:49,241
Do you know what
what we're doing here?

264
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:52,081
Tell those idiots
what they have done!

265
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,841
I don't give a fuck!

266
00:35:57,161 --> 00:36:00,721
Tell them, don't tell
Ryzhkov! Tell Ligachev!

267
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:03,081
Tell fucking Gorbachev!
Tell them!

268
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:28,561
The official position
of the state

269
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:30,881
is that a global
nuclear catastrophe

270
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,361
is not possible
in the Soviet Union.

271
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:34,761
They told the Germans

272
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,481
that the highest detected
level of radiation

273
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:39,721
was 2,000 roentgen.

274
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:43,241
They gave them
the propaganda number.

275
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:47,361
That robot
was never going to work.

276
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:53,401
We need a new phone.

277
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:34,801
What if we don't clear it?

278
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,121
We have to clear it.

279
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:41,321
If we don't clear the roof,
we can't build a cover over it.

280
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,361
If we can't cover it,
that's 12,000 roentgen.

281
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:49,721
Nearly twice the radiation
from the Hiroshima bomb.

282
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:53,681
- Every hour, hour after hour.
- I know, I know, I know.

283
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,761
What about lead?

284
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,201
We could... I don't know,
we could melt it

285
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,561
and pour it from above,
like a coating.

286
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:04,401
First, we've already used most
of the lead we had to line...

287
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,361
There's lead sheeting
around the instruments

288
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,281
in the other reactor buildings.

289
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:10,961
The soldiers are stripping it
for their armour.

290
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:13,081
Are you serious?

291
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,121
Even if,
we're still talking about...

292
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:19,441
boiling metal in a helicopter.

293
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:22,001
And it's lead, Boris.
It'll weigh a ton.

294
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:27,281
What if we shoot the graphite
into the hole?

295
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:30,161
We've got high-calibre bullets,
exploding bullets.

296
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:32,321
They wouldn't just ricochet,
they'd push.

297
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:34,281
You wanna shoot
exploding bullets

298
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:36,281
at an exposed nuclear reactor?

299
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:38,521
- Well...
- No, no, no.

300
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:40,801
Let's go light that roof
back on fire.

301
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:43,201
It was so easy
to put out the first time.

302
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:46,321
What are we talking about here?

303
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,241
We need another robot.

304
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,921
One that can withstand
the radiation.

305
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,361
I've asked. There is nothing.

306
00:38:57,441 --> 00:38:59,121
The Americans?

307
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:01,321
If the Americans
had that kind of technology,

308
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:03,161
do you really think
they'd give it to us?

309
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:05,961
And the Central Committee
would never stoop to ask.

310
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,961
You know it, I know it.

311
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:10,401
There are no robots.

312
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:18,481
Bio-robots.

313
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,401
What's that?

314
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:28,081
We use... bio-robots.

315
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,201
Men.

316
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,361
A lot today.

317
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:05,201
Where do they get their food?

318
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:09,801
They eat the chickens.

319
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,081
Then they eat each other.

320
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:23,721
Door to door.

321
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:34,761
Pavel!

322
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,441
Pavel!

323
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:50,961
Did you not hear me?
I'm talking to you.

324
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,041
Fuck.

325
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:01,321
Just go outside.

326
00:43:07,201 --> 00:43:09,001
Go.

327
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:56,801
<i>Comrade soldiers,</i>

328
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:59,401
the Soviet people have
had enough of this accident.

329
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,001
They want us to clean it up

330
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:03,601
and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

331
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,961
<i>Because of the nature
of the working area,</i>

332
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:08,081
<i>you will each have
no more than 90 seconds</i>

333
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:09,521
<i>to solve this problem.</i>

334
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:12,641
<i>Listen carefully
to each of my instructions</i>

335
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:15,081
<i>and do exactly
as you have been told.</i>

336
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:19,561
<i>This is for your own safety
and the safety of your comrades.</i>

337
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:22,921
<i>You will enter reactor
building 3, climb the stairs,</i>

338
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,481
<i>but do not immediately
proceed to the roof.</i>

339
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:27,481
<i>When you get to the top,
wait inside,</i>

340
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:30,561
<i>behind the entrance to the roof,
and catch your breath.</i>

341
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,681
<i>You will need it
for what comes next.</i>

342
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:36,001
<i>This is the working area.
We must clear the graphite.</i>

343
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:39,441
Some of it is in blocks weighing
approximately 40 to 50kg.

344
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:41,561
They all must be
thrown over the edge here.

345
00:46:41,721 --> 00:46:45,281
Watch your comrades,
moving fast from this opening,

346
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:49,001
then turning to the left
and entering the workspace here.

347
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:52,601
<i>Take care not to stumble.
There's a hole in the roof.</i>

348
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:54,401
<i>Take care not to fall.</i>

349
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,841
<i>You will need to move quickly</i>

350
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:58,001
<i>and you will need
to move carefully.</i>

351
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,401
<i>Do you understand your mission
as I have described it?</i>

352
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,561
<i>Yes, Comrade General.</i>

353
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,601
<i>These are the most important
90 seconds of your lives.</i>

354
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:09,681
<i>Commit your task to memory,
then do your job.</i>

355
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:53,881
It's time to go. After
90 seconds, I will ring a bell.

356
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,201
When you hear it,
return immediately,

357
00:47:56,361 --> 00:47:59,801
drop your shovels in the bin
and proceed to decontamination.

358
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,001
Above all, while on the roof,
throw your debris over the rail.

359
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:05,561
Do not look over the rail.
Is that clear?

360
00:48:05,721 --> 00:48:09,841
Very well.
On my mark: ready, go.

361
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:19,361
Comrade soldier.

362
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:21,441
You're done.

363
00:50:31,921 --> 00:50:34,401
Time to go.

364
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:48,681
Oh. Your glove.

365
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:09,641
Mummy! Mummy!

366
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:12,601
Sorry for all this.

367
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:17,201
We needed to speak to you
somewhere without...

368
00:52:17,361 --> 00:52:20,001
They're going to put
Dyatlov on trial.

369
00:52:20,161 --> 00:52:22,281
And Bryukhanov and Fomin.

370
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:25,601
We're going to be asked to...
give expert testimony.

371
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:27,121
All three of us.

372
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:30,321
But before that happens...

373
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,481
The Central Committee's
sending Legasov to Vienna.

374
00:52:33,641 --> 00:52:35,721
It's the headquarters
of the International...

375
00:52:35,881 --> 00:52:38,961
Atomic Energy Agency.
I know what's in Vienna.

376
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:42,281
What are they asking you to do?

377
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:45,121
Tell the world what happened.

378
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:51,721
Well, then,
you'd better know what happened.

379
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:53,601
I've constructed a timeline,

380
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:57,641
minute by minute,
second by second in some places.

381
00:52:58,681 --> 00:53:00,361
Every decision,
every button push,

382
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:02,121
every turn of a switch.

383
00:53:02,281 --> 00:53:06,121
- And? Are they guilty?
- Yes.

384
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:08,401
Of gross incompetence,

385
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:12,121
violation of safety regulations,
recklessness beyond belief.

386
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,201
But the explosion...
I'm not sure.

387
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:17,321
What do you mean
you're not sure?

388
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:20,081
I've analysed the data.

389
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:22,361
Toptunov was telling the truth.

390
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:25,721
They shut the reactor down
and then it exploded.

391
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:29,641
I think this article
may have the answer.

392
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:33,681
But two pages have been removed.

393
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:40,921
You've seen this before.

394
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:42,921
Please believe me
when I tell you

395
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,921
that I had no idea
it could cause an explosion.

396
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:48,601
- None of us knew...
- None of you knew what?

397
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:53,561
In 1975,
at an RBMK reactor at Leningrad,

398
00:53:53,721 --> 00:53:55,321
a fuel channel ruptured.

399
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:57,201
The operators pressed AZ-5,

400
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:59,881
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

401
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:02,681
for a brief moment, it went up.

402
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:04,281
How is that possible?

403
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,841
This is the question posed
by my colleague named Volkhov.

404
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:10,041
He's the one
who wrote this article.

405
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:12,001
When an RBMK reactor
runs at low power,

406
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:16,281
it's notoriously unstable,
prone to swings in reactivity.

407
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,121
Under normal circumstances,

408
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:20,081
the control rods
can compensate for that.

409
00:54:20,241 --> 00:54:21,521
Under normal circumstances.

410
00:54:21,681 --> 00:54:24,161
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during a test.

411
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:26,401
They pulled almost
all the control rods out

412
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:27,721
to bring the power back up.

413
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:30,441
This is what Volkhov learned
from Leningrad.

414
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,161
If the boron control rods

415
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:34,401
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

416
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:35,841
when they're put back in,

417
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,921
the first thing that enters
the core isn't boron.

418
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:41,601
It's graphite.

419
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:46,241
The control rods
have graphite tips

420
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:48,681
that displace water and steam.

421
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:53,121
So the reactivity doesn't go
down, it goes up dramatically.

422
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,361
Why on earth
would they press that button?

423
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:58,241
They didn't know.

424
00:55:00,281 --> 00:55:02,601
Volkhov warned the Kremlin.

425
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,721
Ten years ago.

426
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:07,961
But there could be no doubt

427
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:11,321
about the supremacy
of the Soviet nuclear industry.

428
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:13,281
Oh.

429
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:16,361
The KGB classified it.
It's a state secret.

430
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:20,601
When I saw the reactor
blown open,

431
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:23,081
I still didn't think
it could be this flaw in AZ-5.

432
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:26,961
Because the flaw
will not lead to an explosion

433
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:29,721
unless the operators
have pushed the reactor

434
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:31,881
to the edge of disaster.

435
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,521
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

436
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:37,081
But not only their fault.

437
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,441
No.

438
00:55:40,481 --> 00:55:42,961
Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

439
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:48,721
You can't possibly be
that naive.

440
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:51,561
There are 16 RBMK reactors

441
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:54,681
running in the Soviet Union
right now.

442
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,841
We have to fix them.

443
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:59,521
The only way to do that
is to go public.

444
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:01,561
Force the Central Committee
to take action.

445
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:04,641
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

446
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,441
that is obsessed
with not being humiliated.

447
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:09,801
We can make a deal with the KGB.

448
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,961
You'll leave this information
out in Vienna

449
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:15,001
and they quietly let us fix
the remaining reactors.

450
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:18,921
A deal with the KGB?
And I'm naive.

451
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:23,721
They'll go after your family,
they'll go after your friends.

452
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,321
You have a chance
to talk to the world, Valery.

453
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:28,201
If that chance was mine...

454
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,681
But it isn't, is it?

455
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:34,001
I've known braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

456
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:36,281
Men who had their moment
and did nothing.

457
00:56:36,441 --> 00:56:37,601
Because when it's your life

458
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,081
and the lives
of everyone you love,

459
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:42,841
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

460
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:45,001
It leaves you.

461
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:49,121
And all you want at that moment
is not to be shot.

462
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:55,601
Do you know the name
Vasily Ignatenko?

463
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:58,161
No.

464
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,961
He was a fireman.

465
00:57:01,121 --> 00:57:03,281
He died two weeks
after the accident.

466
00:57:04,081 --> 00:57:06,161
I've been looking in
on his widow.

467
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:09,921
She gave birth. A girl.

468
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:12,441
The baby lived for four hours.

469
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,401
The radiation
would have killed the mother

470
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:17,321
but the baby absorbed it
instead.

471
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:19,361
Her baby.

472
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:23,361
We live in a country
where children have to die

473
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,001
to save their mothers.

474
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:28,161
To hell with your deal.

475
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:32,161
And to hell with our lives.

476
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:36,401
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

477
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:55,241
Congratulations, comrades.
You are the last of 3,828 men.

478
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:58,161
You have performed
your duties perfectly.

479
00:57:58,321 --> 00:58:00,601
I wish you good health
and long life.

480
00:58:00,761 --> 00:58:03,401
All of you are awarded
a bonus of 800 roubles.

481
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:05,281
- Thank you.
- I serve the Soviet Union.
