1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,360
A moment of your attention, please.

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,080
Let's see.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,280
As you already know,

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,560
we've released your colleagues.

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,640
So nobody has been deceived here.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,600
We've kept our promise.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
Promise, my ass.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,600
And, likewise,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,720
I swear that the million euros

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
will be sent to the addresses you gave us.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,120
Lies and more lies.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,120
TUESDAY 03:32 PM

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
We will also keep that promise.
I give you my word.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,280
HOUR 101 OF THE HEIST

15
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Attention to all units.

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,440
-No one gets in without identification.
<i>-Copy that.</i>

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,680
Hey, you!

18
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,360
<i>A clown has entered.</i>

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,000
-Could be him in disguise.
-Another one is entering the E.R.

20
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,520
What the hell is this?

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,840
There are more coming in.

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,960
What the hell is going on?

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,840
Get those people out of there.

24
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,320
You can't be here. Get out.

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,160
GAME ROOM

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
Who wants a super fun crazy rabbit!

27
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,600
<i>Inspector, they put out</i>
<i>an ad for a fake casting.</i>

28
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,120
<i>Lobo, he might be inside the building.</i>

29
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,880
<i>He's entering the room.</i>

30
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
What's going on? Somebody talk to me!

31
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,120
<i>False alarm. It wasn't him.</i>

32
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,240
Inspector, the interview on the TV.

33
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,840
<i>We've verified that there's</i>
<i>no open case against Fonollosa</i>

34
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,400
<i>for human trafficking,</i>
<i>pimping or pedophilia.</i>

35
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,440
<i>Sources say the information leaked</i>
<i>could be part of a scheme</i>

36
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,960
<i>orchestrated by the authorities</i>

37
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,480
<i>in order to reduce</i>
<i>the heist men popularity.</i>

38
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,800
<i>The latest events and</i>
<i>the death of one of the kidnappers</i>

39
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,640
<i>has earned them</i>
<i>the sympathy of the people.</i>

40
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
You missed me.

41
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Let go.

42
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
Listen,

43
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,520
when Helsinki leaves,
we take action, got it?

44
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,960
Is it the right time?

45
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Monica, I'm carrying a gun.
He has a blank one.

46
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What can happen?

47
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,800
Either you tell him or I will.

48
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I'll do it.

49
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,680
The Professor will try
to free Tokyo.

50
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,800
Where are you going?

51
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Hey!

52
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,920
For fuck's sake.

53
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,600
Where the fuck are you going?

54
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,800
What is this, recess time?
Everyone sit down!

55
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,160
I suggest you sit, buddy.
I'm not in the mood.

56
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,280
You know what?
I feel like breaking some skulls.

57
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,880
And yours is the best one to start.

58
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,920
Try my gun.
Maybe it'll help you relax.

59
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Arturo.

60
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
Little Arturo.

61
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
You've got a toy pistol
and I've got a bad fucking temper.

62
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,680
-What are you doing?
-A toy pistol?

63
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
No.

64
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Doesn't look like it.

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why don't we test it?

66
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,920
I'll give you three seconds
or so help me God...

67
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,600
-Make it one.
-Three.

68
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,920
Two.

69
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
One.

70
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Surprise.

71
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,640
Cheer up, Rio.

72
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,640
Because

73
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,440
we can be a family again.

74
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,600
Turn around.

75
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,440
I said turn around.

76
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Bitch.

77
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,480
Come on, quick. Get moving!

78
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,720
They're going to escape.

79
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
They're going to escape.

80
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
Who?

81
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,600
The hostages!

82
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
Come on. We don't have all day.
Monica, open the door!

83
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,120
Monica, don't fucking listen to him!

84
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,040
He is taking advantage of you.
Don't do it!

85
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
Quiet or you'll get shot, champ.

86
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,480
Don't listen to him, open the door
and we'll get out of here.

87
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,560
SECURITY SYSTEM
BLOCKING DOOR

88
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,120
Come on.

89
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,040
What's the matter!?

90
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,880
-It's not opening.
-Fuck!

91
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,440
They must have blocked the door.

92
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,480
It was me.

93
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Get back!

94
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Arturo.

95
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,000
Put the gun down.

96
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,960
Put the gun down.

97
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
Little Arturo.

98
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,520
I know you love movies
but this is getting out of hand.

99
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Another step and I'll shoot him.

100
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,680
I may not make it alive,

101
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,640
but I'll make sure
he never smiles again.

102
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
Berlin, calm down.

103
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
Open the door!

104
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
Okay.

105
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,160
Take it easy.

106
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,440
Let's talk like civilized people.

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,920
Let him go.

108
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,520
If you want to get out, I'll help you.

109
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,920
Open the door now!

110
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,520
No one's opening any doors here!

111
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,720
Is that so?

112
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,360
I'll count to five
and then I'll shoot him.

113
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,760
I have nothing to lose
and I don't give a shit.

114
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,680
So it's up to you!

115
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
Five, four,

116
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,080
three, two,

117
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,680
one!

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
How could he have found out?

119
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
He had a remote-controlled GoPro camera.

120
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,840
Bastard.

121
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,760
We're trying to trace the signal.

122
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,760
It's no use. It's too late.

123
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
We've been deceived again.

124
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,080
But you were right.

125
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,720
That son of a bitch tried to kill Angel.

126
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
So Angel must have come pretty close
to get that evidence.

127
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
Maybe they even came face-to-face.

128
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,480
Excuse me, but I'm exhausted.

129
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,800
<i>Leave your message after the beep.</i>

130
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,920
Salva, it's Raquel.

131
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm going to have a coffee at Hanoi.

132
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
If you feel like it,
I could really use someone to talk to.

133
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,480
Antonio.

134
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,520
They left an envelope for you.

135
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,600
-Who?
-I don't know.

136
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,960
It was here when we opened.
What can I get you?

137
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,600
A beer.

138
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,040
How's your day going?

139
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,440
I take it that it's going well.

140
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
It's been awful.

141
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,640
I set up an operation
so I could leave tomorrow with you to...

142
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,960
these beaches, but...

143
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,960
it was a disaster.

144
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,920
-What can I get you?
-The same.

145
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,360
Raquel.

146
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,000
Sooner or later, this will end.

147
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,120
And you and I will meet on a beach.

148
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,120
But you have to choose a place.

149
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,160
Okay. I just haven't had time yet.

150
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,560
Let's see.

151
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
How about we choose it together?

152
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,520
That sounds great.

153
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,120
-Pick one.
-Such responsibility! Let's see.

154
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,960
Palawan.

155
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,440
Palawan? Let's see.

156
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,560
Amazing.

157
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,400
Where is it?

158
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
Palawan it's an island
in the Philippines.

159
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,720
It's southwest of the archipelago,
a little to the north of Borneo.

160
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,000
Its population is 849,000, more or less

161
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,400
and the capital is Puerto Princesa.

162
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,840
<i>Angel must have come close</i>
<i>to get that evidence.</i>

163
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>Maybe they even came</i>
<i>face-to-face.</i>

164
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,600
Have you investigated him? I have!

165
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
<i>...my fucking job.</i>

166
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,200
...the white sand beaches in the tropic.

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,640
You don't like the Philippines?

168
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,760
Yes.

169
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,080
Of course.

170
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,360
Do you mind if I go
to the bathroom for a moment?

171
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,640
Not at all.

172
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,720
Suarez,

173
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
one question.

174
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,960
What color was the wig of the clown
that talked to the kid in the hospital?

175
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,280
Orange.

176
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Are you sure?

177
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,920
<i>For your life to fall apart,</i>

178
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,120
<i>doesn't matter if you're in a bathroom</i>

179
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,600
<i>in a heist,</i>

180
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,760
<i>or at the door of a penitentiary.</i>

181
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,560
<i>You see,</i>

182
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,800
<i>that afternoon, the misfortunes</i>
<i>of three women would sync up.</i>

183
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,680
<i>Raquel suddenly understood</i>

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,600
<i>that she had fallen head over heels</i>
<i>for Spain's most wanted heist man.</i>

185
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,080
She's one of them.

186
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,720
She's with them. You all saw it!

187
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>Monica Gaztambide realized</i>

188
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
<i>that she had just become an accomplice,</i>

189
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,720
<i>and that there would be no turning back.</i>

190
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,200
<i>And me...</i>

191
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>I kept following the instructions</i>
<i>the Professor gave us in Toledo.</i>

192
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
<i>But without any certainty.</i>

193
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
<i>Feeling numb.</i>

194
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,760
<i>Like a bottle thrown into the sea.</i>

195
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,560
<i>Not knowing if someone would pick it up.</i>

196
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,680
<i>If they catch you,</i>

197
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,840
twenty four hours after being detained,
you say you want a deal.

198
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,760
That you will testify only

199
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,240
before a judge,
and they will have no choice

200
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
but to take you
to the National High Court and

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,560
maybe during that travel,

202
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,160
I can do something for you.

203
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,480
<i>There I was,</i>

204
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>on my way to the courthouse,</i>

205
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,600
<i>hoping that my guardian angel would know</i>
<i>the route of the van</i>

206
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,080
<i>and save my life again.</i>

207
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,640
<i>It was hard to be hopeful in a van,</i>

208
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
<i>prisoner and handcuffed.</i>

209
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,880
<i>But it would have been worse to know that</i>

210
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,880
<i>twenty kilometers from there,</i>

211
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
<i>my guardian angel</i>

212
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,800
<i>had just been discovered.</i>

213
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,080
Raquel.

214
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,600
Hi, Alberto.

215
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Have you analyzed the evidence
from the fireplace in Toledo?

216
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,960
Yes. But nothing conclusive.

217
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,640
<i>What do you mean?</i>

218
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,400
They were the remains

219
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
of a sports paper
from a couple of days ago.

220
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,320
So I don't know if it's tainted evidence

221
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
or if the guy reads the paper on Sundays.

222
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,840
Right.

223
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,440
Hey,

224
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,720
how exactly did the fight
with Salva happen?

225
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,880
<i>Damn it, Raquel,</i>

226
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,680
<i>I told you it wasn't a fight.</i>

227
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,760
He grabbed my neck

228
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
in a chokehold and I passed out.
I didn't touch him!

229
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,120
He's a fucking ninja with glasses.

230
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,920
Why are you asking?

231
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
No reason.

232
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,240
And you said he provoked you?

233
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,600
<i>Yes.</i>

234
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,200
<i>He said I shared my brains with my cock</i>

235
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
and my fists, among other insults.

236
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,880
He wanted to fight. But what for?

237
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
I don't know.

238
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,960
Bye.

239
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,320
Alberto.

240
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,360
Nobody touch those trays.

241
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
They're off limits for now.

242
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,040
Get prints off them

243
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,360
and crosscheck them with the ones
from the spoon Agent Rubio brought.

244
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,520
-Are you kidding?
-No.

245
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
And then get the prints
from the co-pilot's inner door handle.

246
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,480
-But...
-Do it!

247
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,440
Remember, we look for a middle-aged male,
with a beard and glasses.

248
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,240
Hey!

249
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,960
Find out who he is
and what he's doing here.

250
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>It was him.</i>

251
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,560
<i>Of course it was.</i>

252
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Do you have a phone charger?

253
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,720
No.

254
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Do you want mine?

255
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,720
<i>It had been him all along.</i>

256
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
<i>Always friendly,</i>

257
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,960
<i>always smiling,</i>

258
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,960
<i>always in the right place.</i>

259
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,320
<i>The only civilian</i>
<i>who had set foot in the tent.</i>

260
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,040
Something's up with your daughter.

261
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,440
<i>The stranger</i>
<i>who managed to get past all her defenses.</i>

262
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,720
<i>And not only as a police agent.</i>

263
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
Salva.

264
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,640
I don't have a gift as wonderful
as these postcards but...

265
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,320
I'll improvise a surprise.

266
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,240
In the ladies' room.

267
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
You go first.

268
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,800
And then I'll go.

269
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,480
Raquel.

270
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,600
It's the middle of the day
and they know us both here.

271
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,040
Salva.

272
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,400
It's the first time

273
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,800
that I'm not wearing a lifejacket

274
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,480
and am diving into the deep end.

275
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Don't tell me

276
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,920
there's no water in the pool.

277
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,560
There's water.

278
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,920
There's water.

279
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,880
Well...

280
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,080
Go wait for me in there.

281
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,640
Hands against the wall.

282
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,160
-Raquel, I don’t know...
-Hands against the wall!

283
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,720
What are you doing?

284
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,000
Are you carrying a gun?

285
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,800
Why would I have a gun?

286
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,760
Turn around.

287
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,360
Put them on.

288
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,240
-Is this a joke?
-Put them on!

289
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,200
Put them on!

290
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,760
You're under arrest for collaboration
in the heist at the Royal Mint.

291
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
<i>You see,</i>

292
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,200
You have the right to remain silent

293
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,880
<i>third time was the charm.</i>

294
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,400
You have the right not to testify
and to be brought before a judge.

295
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,880
<i>And this time she had something</i>
<i>stronger than a suspicion.</i>

296
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,360
<i>She had a grudge.</i>

297
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,360
<i>She felt anger.</i>

298
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,920
<i>She felt poisoned.</i>

299
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
<i>Helsinki felt something similar.</i>

300
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,400
<i>But not because of deception,</i>

301
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,200
<i>but for lack of sleep.</i>

302
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,520
<i>He had slept four hours</i>
<i>in the last five days.</i>

303
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,840
<i>Do you know what happens</i>
<i>when you don't sleep?</i>

304
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,920
<i>Their neural connections break down</i>
<i>like a short-circuit.</i>

305
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,760
<i>They stop secreting dopamine.</i>

306
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,480
<i>They stop processing glucose.</i>

307
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,960
<i>And the only information left in the brain</i>

308
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,160
<i>is survival.</i>

309
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,160
<i>So one thing you can't expect</i>
<i>from a guy who hasn't slept in five days</i>

310
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,720
<i>it's patience.</i>

311
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,480
Come on.

312
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
Take off your clothes.

313
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,720
The t-shirt too.

314
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
I have a wound on my shoulder...

315
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,280
Take it off!

316
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,000
And you try to steal from us.

317
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,640
Shit.

318
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,080
It's what we get for not killing
when we had to.

319
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,440
What will you do?

320
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,800
If I shoot you,

321
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,440
you just die.

322
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,280
You don't suffer.

323
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,160
Now you'll wear two kilos
of explosives strapped to your body.

324
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,760
I'll blow it up,
but you won't know when.

325
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,160
That's a shitload of explosives.

326
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,840
Careful, it could make a real mess.

327
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,800
He has been
a bigger pain in the ass than the police.

328
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,560
Oslo died because of him.

329
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,360
Denver almost died because of him.

330
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,040
With this

331
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,320
we end our troubles.

332
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,840
Right, little Arturo?

333
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,640
If you remove the wire,

334
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,560
it blows.

335
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,320
Don't make sudden movements,

336
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,320
don't sweat,

337
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
don't touch yourself.

338
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,200
Detonator.

339
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,040
If I touch

340
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,920
this button,

341
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,800
Your wife won't recognize you.

342
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
Minced little Arturo.

343
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Do you have a cigarette?

344
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,360
-Do you?
-Monica, you're pregnant.

345
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm pregnant, kidnapped, shot.

346
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,800
And soon accused of...

347
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,520
collaboration in an armed robbery.

348
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,760
Don't think the worst.

349
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,760
Arturo will toss you a line.
He's the father, right?

350
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,680
Which father?

351
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,840
Which father?

352
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,680
The one who pointed at me
like I was a kidnapper?

353
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,720
Which father?

354
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,120
The one who's head I busted in
with an iron rod?

355
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,200
Maybe my colleagues will help me.

356
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,920
I only screwed up their escape plan,

357
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
which I'm sure I'll get tried for.

358
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,960
Why am I so stupid?
What was I thinking?

359
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,080
Come on, give me a cigarette.

360
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,280
Give me a cigarette.
My fetus needs it!

361
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
I swear I'll mess Arturo up
before you sit in any court dock.

362
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,280
You won't mess anybody up.
Take it easy.

363
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,360
She's right, they'll put her away!

364
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,960
If we escape and get caught,
she's going to jail.

365
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,200
If we stay and the cops get in,
it's the same.

366
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,640
One way or another she'll do time.

367
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,720
Shit.

368
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,800
I always make the wrong choice.

369
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,440
I always make the wrong choice.

370
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,720
I messed around with a married man.

371
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,800
I got pregnant.

372
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,600
And then another guy comes in,

373
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,120
shoots me in the leg,

374
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,840
and I go

375
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,480
and fall in love.

376
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,720
You know what we'll do?

377
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,480
What?

378
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,880
You'll come with us.

379
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,440
You crossed the line.

380
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,360
I won't leave you behind. Okay?

381
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,720
-Look, son. Maybe...
-She's coming with us!

382
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,560
She'll take Tokyo or Oslo's place,
end of story!

383
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,560
No, listen.

384
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm just the secretary.

385
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,880
I don't see myself running away
from the police or shooting guns.

386
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,720
Or hiding in who knows where, Cambodia.

387
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,640
A country without extradition laws.
I don't.

388
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,280
It's better to stay.

389
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
And when the police come, I'll say

390
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,680
I did it because I had

391
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
big-time Stockholm syndrome and

392
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,160
that will be an extenuating.

393
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,920
That's what it was, right?

394
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,640
Stockholm.

395
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,680
What?

396
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,080
That sounds nice.

397
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,160
If you come with us, you...

398
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
your name could be Stockholm.

399
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,520
I don't know, man!

400
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,680
Get out.

401
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
DO NOT CROSS
POLICE LINE

402
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,720
Open it.

403
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,480
Get in.

404
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,840
<i>We were all exhausted.</i>

405
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,360
<i>The lack of sleep,</i>

406
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,840
<i>the stress,</i>

407
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,400
<i>or the anguish of years</i>
<i>keeping a secret that,</i>

408
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,040
<i>in that suffocating environment,</i>

409
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,920
<i>was becoming harder to keep.</i>

410
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,280
<i>And all of us,</i>

411
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,840
<i>sooner or later,</i>

412
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
<i>lost control.</i>

413
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,400
<i>Except for Berlin.</i>

414
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,840
<i>He was the only one who stuck</i>
<i>to the resting protocol.</i>

415
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,160
<i>The others</i>

416
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
<i>went crazy.</i>

417
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,280
I have tried being nice.

418
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,320
I tried to give you
what you were promised.

419
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,840
To free you from Berlin.

420
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,000
For this to make sense!

421
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,120
After losing what I have lost,
to give this some meaning.

422
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm kind.

423
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,120
I've been kind.

424
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
And the world

425
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,560
spits in my face.

426
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,600
I have tried

427
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,640
to give you space.

428
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,160
And you fucked me over.

429
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,560
Berlin.

430
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,040
Berlin.

431
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,320
Hey.

432
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
It's been over an hour and a half.

433
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,360
Don't you feel like

434
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,520
killing me

435
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,120
while I sleep?

436
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Just a little.

437
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,400
Hey.

438
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,040
You're laughing.

439
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,800
That means you're
not afraid of me anymore.

440
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,360
Let's say the dose of tranquilizers
I'm taking has neutralized me.

441
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
If everything works out,

442
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,080
which is

443
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,720
unlikely if I don't take the reins again,
but...

444
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,160
if it does all work out,

445
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,920
I'd like to propose a deal,

446
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,080
a romantic venture.

447
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,560
Within a few days
I'll send you a plane ticket

448
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
to a very

449
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,720
distant place.

450
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,360
If you want,

451
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,640
you can come with me.

452
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,960
For a very short time,

453
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,720
a lot of pleasure.

454
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,560
And then,

455
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,680
after it ends,

456
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,880
you get to keep everything I have.

457
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,720
It would be really wonderful

458
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,480
if you fell completely in love with me.

459
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
But...

460
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,640
I don't live on expectations

461
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,560
or false hopes.

462
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,240
I have many flaws,

463
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,520
and I know it.

464
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,560
I could settle for

465
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,800
you being

466
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,240
my partner

467
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,240
until the final voyage.

468
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,160
You and me together

469
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,680
until the end.

470
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,640
You don't get it.

471
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,600
You don't get it.

472
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,080
What do I have to do to get some respect?

473
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,400
What do I have to do?

474
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,880
Do I cut off one of your ears

475
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,960
and send it to your father?

476
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,560
Or shoot you in the leg
so you can't ever dance again?

477
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,080
That's a great idea!

478
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,200
It is time to be pragmatic.

479
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,000
The utopia

480
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,480
of collaboration

481
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,440
has failed.

482
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,360
Nairobi,

483
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,280
I appreciate you allowing me
to take some time off from my duties,

484
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,840
but...

485
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,400
we're all ready for me
to be back in charge.

486
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,480
All yours.

487
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,000
This is a wonderful moment.

488
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,360
Stand up!

489
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,600
I told you

490
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,880
I was going to protect you,

491
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,280
didn't I?

492
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,840
But I've changed my mind.

493
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,960
It's a lot more practical

494
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,840
to torture you.

495
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,320
In concentration camps,

496
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,920
respect is a given.

497
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,200
Well, here it's going to be the same.

498
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,720
You're going to dig the tunnel

499
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,640
until your hands bleed!

500
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,760
At night,

501
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,280
you may cry in pain

502
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,920
in your cot,

503
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,240
but you will keep on digging!

504
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,440
You'll be on shifts without rest.

505
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,320
Otherwise, an epic punishment awaits you.

506
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,160
Just like your leader.

507
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,800
A man who will kill
if he betrays us again.

508
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,360
Who will kill if he ever
yearns for freedom again.

509
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,360
Whose sweat

510
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
kills.

511
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,880
A man of explosive nature.

512
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Now they're going to be scared of you,
Arturo.

513
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,520
Although we've always known
you're "the bomb".

514
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Since you're an outcast,
you'll stay here, secluded.

515
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,240
Helsinki and everyone else, to the tunnel!

516
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,800
Come on, let's go!

517
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
Let's go, quickly!

518
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,720
