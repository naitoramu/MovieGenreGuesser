setting the table,

You know why I came back for this heist?

46
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,910
Before you scattered us all across
the world,

47
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,410
this gang...

48
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,000
was the closest thing to a family
I've had in my whole life.

49
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,450
I've never had a Christmas
like the kind you see on TV

50
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,290
with Grandma, Santa, cookies,
all that shit.

51
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,700
- And Axel's father? Didn't you celebrate...
- No.

52
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,040
You know, I...

53
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,790
I had already given up on the idea...

54
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,000
of having a family.

55
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,540
Completely given it up.

56
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,830
But now I think
there's another way of doing this thing.

57
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,000
I have this urge to be a mother.

58
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,830
But a different one.
I wanna have a bunch of kids,

59
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,160
and a dog and whatever else I want.

60
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,080
What you're saying is beautiful, Nairobi.
Very beautiful.

61
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,080
Y-you...

62
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,790
Would you be the father of my child?

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
- I mean...
- Pardon?

64
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,910
I need to get good genes
to combine with mine. It's very important.

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,580
I look at you in class,

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,290
and I think...

67
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,500
"This man is brilliant,

68
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,200
and he's honorable,

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,040
and so sensitive. Even handsome.

70
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,450
He's a man with ideals."

71
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,120
And I believe in what you do.

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,580
Your perception of me
is very, very flattering.

73
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,830
And honorable...

74
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,080
Well, that's one way to look at it, but...

75
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,290
that's impossible.

76
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,060
Why? Impossible is pulling off a heist
at the Bank of Spain.

77
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,450
I'm not asking you to be a father
if you don't want to.

78
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,200
What I'm asking is a donation

79
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,080
so I can do things differently.

80
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,500
- No strings attached.
- Nairobi...

81
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,160
Listen, I set up the heist
at the Royal Mint

82
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,500
in memory of my father.

83
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580
And this one, for my brother. I'm...

84
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm not one
who doesn't develop attachments.

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,160
I would not ignore, even for a second,

86
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,330
the fact that I have a child out there
somewhere in the world.

87
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,660
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,700
You were the one that built this family.
And you...

89
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,910
you taught us to look out for each other.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,620
You said, "Whatever it takes."

91
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,540
- But what you're asking for is...
- What I'm asking you is the same.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,910
Because a family is there for you,
no questions asked.

93
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,410
That's what binds us.
They will risk their lives for you.

94
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,080
You've got your plan,

95
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,620
but I also have a plan.

96
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,250
You've taught me
that we have to help each other

97
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,000
because that's who we are.

98
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Ágata...

99
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,330
I guess I've asked you
to do more complicated things.

100
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,450
A little bit more, yeah.

101
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,450
And...

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,040
I've done fucked up shit for you
without asking.

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,790
I know. I've asked you...

104
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,660
to take big risks.

105
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,410
SeRÍOus risks.

106
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,750
In fact, much more
than what you're asking me now.

107
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,080
Are you saying that's a yes?

108
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,910
You're saying that's a yes.

109
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,410
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

110
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,830

Thank you! I swear to you,
you're never going to regret this.

113
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,120
We will find the best in vitro
fertilization clinics in the world.

114
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,830
Or, if you want,
we could do it the traditional way.

115
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,160
The traditional way is for sure
off the table.

116
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,330
We'll leave in the hands of professionals.
Okay?

117

- The governor's.
- Exactly.

It must be close to the governor's office.

But why doesn't it show up in the plans?

Mm-hmm.

My official command
was he remain inactive.

272
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,410
He said he didn't give a shit
and plans to defend himself.

273
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
And if he wants to defend himself,
I'm not going to stop him.

Do you have anything against him

No, right?

283

Have you always liked men,

or did this happen
after you became a woman?

345
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,870
First of all,

346
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,660
I've always been a woman.

No.

348
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,250

I saw you rob gas stations.

349

- You weren't a woman.
- How does a woman rob?

350
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,870
Do they scratch people
and pull their hair?

351
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm not a Neanderthal.
What I'm talking about, it's just that,

You can tell.

353
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,830
I went on all these robberies
with Juanito, not a woman.

354
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,160
Right?
Maybe this thing about being a woman...

355
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,000
happened later.

356
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,000
Let me tell you something.

357
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,370
When Juanito
got out of a robbery with you,

358
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,790
- he'd go back home into his room.
- Yeah.

359
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,830
He'd put on a little music.

360
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,620
- He'd roll a little joint...
- <font color="#ff00ff">[LAUGHS]</font>

361
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,410

Italian lipstick. It looked wonderful.

362
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,410
Ferrari red.
And he'd take his little joint,

363
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,250
and he'd lie down on the bed...

364
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,410
and right there in that moment...

365
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,330
alone, relaxed, looking gorgeous...

all day long, doing jobs or whatever?

382

- Of course. What do you mean?

- Stop.

- Wait a second! Okay, hold on.

I'm not the one with a mask on.

508

Let's see. Earlier, hmm,
the two of us had a deal.

509
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,040
You were holding the phone,

510
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,290
then you changed your mind.

511
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,620
What happened?

512
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,080
I made you waste your time
while you were questioning me.

513
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,620
I pretended you were breaking me
little by little

514
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,330
and that I was about to give in.

515
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,000
In the meantime, he slipped
through your fingers. He escaped.
