1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,872
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,077
<i>After 6 years
of being a vigilante,</i>

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,033
<i>the only way to achieve my goal</i>

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,432
<i>and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.</i>

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,230
<i>Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.</i>

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,472
<i>I am no longer a hero.</i>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,917
<i>I am inmate 4587.</i>

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,840
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360
I am Dr. Jarrett Parker.

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,910
I'm here to conduct your
psychiatric evaluation.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,151
- What is your name?
- My name is Oliver Queen.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,391
You kidnapped
and imprisoned the silencer?

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,976
- She's gone.
- How'd you know she was gonna take the belt?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,600
The RFID chip I installed
in it is gonna lead us straight to Diaz.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,638
- Where is Diaz?
- I don't know,

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
but I know who does.

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,879
Everything that goes on here
goes through the Demon first.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
What will you do
after you find this person?

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,991
I will use them
to stop Diaz.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,594
Still resistant.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
Agh!

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>What is your name?</i>

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,035
My name is inmate 4587.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,834
On your feet, 4587.

25
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,399
- Who are you?
- Your new best friend.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,837
Now, on your feet.

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Hold out your hand.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,317
This will be
on you at all times

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,359
to ensure the safety
of yourself

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
and the other prisoners.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,356
Where's Dr. Parker?

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,479
He said you're ready
for phase two,

33
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,998
which means you belong
to me now.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,792
- Move.
- Where are you taking me?

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,794
Down the rabbit hole.

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,474
Welcome home.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,077
<i>Inmate 10-13.
Inmate 10-13.</i>

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,954
No, no.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,638
No, please, please.
No, no.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,160
Where are they
taking him?

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,193
Pray you never find out.

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,430
Your wife is dead.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,520
<i>Friend of yours?</i>

44
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
No.

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,513
Is there a problem?

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,678
No. No problem.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,636
Good. Keep it that way.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,235
When's visitation?

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,720
There's no visitation
down here.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,600
No... what do... what
do you mean?

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,115
It's probably best
that you forget

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,717
about anyone
on the outside.

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,234
They'll eventually
forget about you.

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,296
I read through your
mission report

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,436
from the Switzerland op.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
<i>Director Michaels
signed off,</i>

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,037
but I noticed a few
abnormalities.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,736
Sir, if this is regarding
the 23 minutes

59
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,200
of unaccounted time
in our field log,

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,272
it is because we took
a pit stop

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
for chocolate.

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
When in Rome, right?

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,136
Do you want some?
You should have some.

64
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,176
- Actually, I'm diabetic.
- Oh, OK. Don't have some.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,398
And I was referring to the
intel we got from that mission.

66
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,155
This is Malcolm Byrd,
a black market arms dealer

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,391
specializing in chemical
weapons trading.

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,994
The data we pulled
from the bank

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,680
tipped us off to
an ongoing transaction

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,950
involving a gentleman...

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,077
Dr. Nyambi Somto,
biochemist.

72
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,840
Two weeks ago, Somto
went missing

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,878
along with a cache
of nerve agents banned

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,076
by the Geneva protocols.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,197
We believe that Somto's
trying to sell

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,880
these chemicals to Byrd.

77
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,839
Fortunately, A.R.G.U.S.
already has Somto in custody.

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,552
So mission accomplished.
Yay.

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,189
Not exactly.
Byrd still believes the buy is going on,

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480
which means we can
catch him.

81
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>That's where you
come in, Holt.</i>

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,512
Why is there a mock-up
photo of me

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,273
I.D.ed as Dr. Somto?

84
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,880
We need
an undercover operative

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,360
to impersonate Somto

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,670
and make contact
with Byrd.

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,760
Somto claims he and Byrd
only interfaced online,

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,473
never face to face,
thus the mock-up.

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,474
Uh, why does it
have to be my face?

90
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,116
We need someone who can pull
off a convincing charade.

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,112
You have 14 phds,
including one

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,600
<i>in biochemical engineering,</i>

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,336
and you're fluent
in 5 different languages,

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,953
including Somto's
native tongue.

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,715
6, actually.
Nowadays, I'm more

96
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,872
of a chill in the back
of a van,

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,759
surrounded by monitors
kind of a guy.

98
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,071
Curtis, we don't
need you to engage.

99
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,754
<i>Just put eyes on Byrd.</i>

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,376
Me and my team
will handle the takedown

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,550
and package retrieval.

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Also...

103
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,039
It's an order.

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,634
Remember me?

105
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,034
I need to talk to you.

106
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,475
Hey.

107
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
I know it was the Demon
who hired you to attack me.

108
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,909
Stop talking to me.

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,117
Tell me
who the Demon is.

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,597
- Leave me alone.
- Hey. Hey.

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,879
Ugh!

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,639
It was an accident,
I swear.

113
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,077
Looks like you're
having a relapse.

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,118
We warned you
about this.

115
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,350
You know what
happens now.

116
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,636
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,230
It won't happen again.

118
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,160
Get him up.

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,994
No!

120
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,116
Not through there, please.

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,576
The tracker is now paired with
a facial recognition program,

122
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,319
targeting all CCTV
and traffic cameras

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,296
within a 5-mile radius of the silencer's
location, updating in real time.

124
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,198
So when the silencer
finally finds Diaz,

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,510
we'll get
an immediate alert?

126
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,496
Yeah, as long as you don't
adjust any of the inputs,

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
change any of the settings,
or click any buttons.

128
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,696
I mean, basically,
don't touch anything,

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,056
and, yeah, we will be...
we will be... we will be just fine.

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,878
I'm not sure I needed
an in-person tutorial

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,316
on how to watch
a blinking dot blink.

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,314
Sorry. I'm just
really anxious, you know?

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,039
We're so close
to getting Diaz,

134
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,776
and the last time I saw
Oliver was a while ago,

135
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,760
and it didn't end
so well.

136
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:01,320
Relax. Visiting your
husband is not gonna cause

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,239
our operation
to fall apart.

138
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,639
Although when the
blinking dot disappears,

139
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
that's not good,
is it?

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
- Crap!
- Hey. I wanted it noted

141
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,120
for the record I did not
touch anything.

142
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,896
- Is the signal dead?
- No. It's just faint.

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,736
It's still pinging,
but I'm gonna need to boost the signal

144
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,136
to get a secure lock
on her exact location,

145
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,616
which may take a while,
so maybe I should stay here,

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,696
keep an eye on the
program, you know, just...

147
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,640
you can keep an eye on the
program from the road.

148
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
OK, but the moment...

149
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,536
the signal comes back online,
you want me to call you.

150
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,552
Yes. Look at us,

151
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,976
you know, finishing
each other's sentences.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
- Really...
- go.

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Mm-hmm.

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,353
If not for Oliver's sake,
at least for my own.

155
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,157
<i>I understand you've been
looking for the Demon.</i>

156
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,595
Talia?

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,595
You survived the explosion
on Lian Yu.

158
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,355
- How?
- You know I'm not so easily defeated.

159
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,079
What are you doing
here?

160
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,711
Oh. I ran afoul
of an old foe in Gotham.

161
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,712
What surprised me was to see you here,
a prisoner.

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,376
I believe I taught
you better than that.

163
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,993
Oh, you taught me
many things,

164
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,153
including how
to manipulate people.

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,511
So the attack
in the shower,

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,117
brick's mind games...

167
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,916
you pushed every button
and pulled every string

168
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,680
just to get me down here.

169
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,599
You always were
a quick study.

170
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,989
Where's Ricardo Diaz?

171
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,560
- I don't know.
- Liar.

172
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,599
I'm many things,

173
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,520
but a liar is not
one of them.

174
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,199
You asked how
I survived Lian Yu.

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,596
The answer is barely...

176
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,518
And only with the help of a
drug supplied by your Mr. Diaz,

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,231
<i>so in exchange,
I facilitated an attack</i>

178
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,040
on the man who murdered my father,
left me for dead.

179
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,277
More than a fair trade.

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,756
There was a time,
Talia,

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,991
when aligning yourself with
a man like Ricardo Diaz

182
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,669
would have been
beneath you.

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,594
I do what it takes
to survive.

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,311
<i>Another lesson you
seem to have forgotten.</i>

185
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,239
I taught you to separate
the man from the monster.

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,392
Instead, you exposed
your true identity

187
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,472
for all the world to see

188
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,871
and became the monster you
always feared you were.

189
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,754
What do you want from me?

190
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,314
There is a way out
of slabside,

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,193
and I need your help
to escape.

192
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,034
You expect me
to help you

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,635
after all the pain
and the suffering

194
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,998
that you inflicted
on my family?

195
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,296
What does it tell you that I
would even ask for your help

196
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,357
after what you've
done to mine?

197
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,636
You don't understand what
they do to people down here.

198
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,280
They reform criminals.

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,556
They destroy them.

200
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,875
You and I once stood
on the same side.

201
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,394
We can do it again.

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,712
You stood on the same side
as Adrian Chase...

203
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,875
And my son lost
his mother,

204
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,074
so now I'm here,
trying to save

205
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,517
what's left
of my family

206
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,471
because I'm stuck

207
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,630
in a cycle of violence,
and I have been stuck there

208
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,598
since the moment

209
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,798
you told me what to do
with my father's list.

210
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,838
You don't honestly
believe that, Oliver.

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,512
There's no Oliver in here.
I'm inmate 4587,

212
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,995
so I'm asking you, however
you broke into my cell...

213
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,030
Get out.

214
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,119
Uh, excuse me.
My husband is Oliver Queen,

215
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,856
and as your colleagues have
already triple-checked,

216
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,360
I am definitely
on his visitor's list.

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,993
It's been 20 minutes,
and he's not here.

218
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,710
Inmate 4587 has had his
visitation privileges revoked.

219
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,000
What? What happened?
What are you talking about?

220
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,077
I'm not at Liberty
to say, ma'am.

221
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,311
I'm his wife.
I have a right to see my husband.

222
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,039
I'm afraid you don't.

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,559
- You're Oliver's wife.
- Yeah.

224
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,896
I recognize you from the picture
he looks at all the time.

225
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
You know Oliver.

226
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,074
I'm kind of
his sidekick in here.

227
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,879
Can you give him
a message for me?

228
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,236
Can you tell him that
I have a lead on Diaz?

229
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,976
- He'll know what it means.
- I know what that means.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
He'll be so excited,

231
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,517
but I can't give
him that message.

232
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,520
Why not?

233
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,592
Because he got sent
down to level two.

234
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,669
What's level two?

235
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,479
It's bad,
it's really bad.

236
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,711
It's where they send
the worst of the worst.

237
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,440
But Oliver isn't
the worst of the worst.

238
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
It's kind of a long story,
but he got set up,

239
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,313
and then he had to
stab a guard or two.

240
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,520
<i>It all kind of
happened fast,</i>

241
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,800
<i>and there was
a lot of blood.</i>

242
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,296
No. Oliver... Oliver
would never...

243
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,800
he would never do
something like that.

244
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,056
I don't know
if you've noticed,

245
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,517
but the guards aren't exactly
on the side of good in here.

246
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,016
- I should go.
- Wait just one second.

247
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,076
Sorry about
your husband.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,798
He's the best.

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,036
Target sighted.

250
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,232
Heading into the sketchy
loading dock to confirm.

251
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,312
OK, Curtis. Once you get
firm confirmation,

252
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,949
we'll move in but not before,
so keep it cool, OK?

253
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,117
Sure. That will be easy
to do in wool pants.

254
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,160
<i>We still don't
have eyes on Byrd.</i>

255
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Find out why.

256
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,033
Uh...

257
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,192
You do. Yes,
you do, Curtis.

258
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,239
Yes. Yes. I do.

259
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,436
You speak English.

260
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,080
Bring you entire supply
to the mandrake gallery

261
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,520
tomorrow, 8 P.M.

262
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,955
Monsieur Byrd
will be waiting.

263
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,315
You'll get your money then.

264
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Wait.

265
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,354
A second meeting was not
a part of our agreement.

266
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,752
Do we have a problem,
Dr. Somto?

267
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,677
<i>What are you doing?
Just agree to the meeting.</i>

268
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,800
<i>Curtis!</i>

269
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:02,397
No. No problem
at all.

270
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,960
What the hell
was that?

271
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,520
You said this was
a one-time deal...

272
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,358
meet the guy,
get out, done.

273
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,876
Getting roped into the sequel
was not part of the plan!

274
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,040
We're in the field.

275
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,839
Sometimes, plans
change in the field!

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,832
You, of all people,
should know that!

277
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,430
Look. My days
in the field were over

278
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,637
the day Oliver went
to prison.

279
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,154
I would like to
keep it that way.

280
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,312
Curtis, we still need
to nail Byrd.

281
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,119
We can't do that
without you!

282
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,776
Well, then you better hope I have
a twin or a clone or something

283
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,917
because I am not
doing that again!

284
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
I'm out!

285
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,079
That doesn't make
any sense.

286
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,799
Mr. Queen has
two hours

287
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,440
of visitation
left this month,

288
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,976
so I suggest you get
it straightened out,

289
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,390
or I will have the U.S.
attorney so far up your ass

290
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,336
that you'll have to turn
your head to the left

291
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,714
and cough.

292
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,480
Whew! I mean, no offense
to Black Siren,

293
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
but I actually think you're
scarier as an attorney.

294
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,473
Black siren gets results.

295
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,472
All the D.A. got
was stonewalled.

296
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,438
Prison authorities
insisted that Oliver

297
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,950
already maxed his visitation
allowances this month.

298
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,716
How? I've only
been there once. I...

299
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
something's wrong.

300
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,235
Obviously.

301
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,111
Sorry. Empathy's
a word I'm learning.

302
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,316
It's a work
in progress.

303
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,736
The prisoner that knew
Oliver said

304
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,360
they took him somewhere
called level two.

305
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
We need to figure out
what that is.

306
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,800
We?

307
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,041
Consider it a lesson
in empathy.

308
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,976
OK. I'm accessing
the federal slabside records...

309
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,673
employment,
inmate sentencing,

310
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
infrastructure.

311
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,216
I don't know what's
more amusing...

312
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,357
the fact that you just broke
6 laws in front of me

313
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,240
or that you're forcing me to
feel empathetic about it.

314
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
What? What's wrong?

315
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,714
Wherever they took Oliver is
completely off the books.

316
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,952
There's no record of anything
at slabside called level two.

317
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,313
What the hell
happened to him?

318
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,358
You don't recognize
a dead body?

319
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,953
What goes on
in that room?

320
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,670
That's where they
reform you.

321
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,076
Therapy doesn't kill
people, Talia.

322
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,799
You have a surprising
amount of empathy

323
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,235
for a man
who assaulted you.

324
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,278
He's dead because

325
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,318
of whatever happened
behind those doors.

326
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,477
Then he's one
of the lucky ones.

327
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
- What?
- Those who walk out alive

328
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,630
suffer much more.

329
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,158
You have no idea what your doctor
is really doing down here.

330
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,033
Come on.

331
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,950
Dr. Parker's behind this?

332
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,714
Not so quick
a study after all.

333
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,272
You fell
for Parker's lies.

334
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,136
That's what happens when you fail
to keep your two sides separate.

335
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
You become weak.

336
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,553
Whatever is happening,
we need to stop it.

337
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,071
These people are
criminals

338
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,789
the likes of which you've spent
the past 6 years putting away.

339
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,519
I'm surprised you
want to help them.

340
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,477
But you were the one who pushed
me towards helping others,

341
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,717
towards fighting
for justice.

342
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,354
You had honor then.

343
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,115
That was
a long time ago.

344
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,240
Now all I care about
is getting out of here.

345
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,119
Are you prepared
to help me with that?

346
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,917
Then we have nothing
further to discuss.

347
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,157
I need to see Dr. Parker.

348
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
That's not how it works.

349
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,993
I need his help.
I'm having a relapse.

350
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,512
Hey, Dinah.
Do you have a sec?

351
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,240
Yeah. Uh, is this
about the Hudson case?

352
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,240
Because I would like to
get 3 counts if we can.

353
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,674
Hi, Dinah.

354
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,991
Hi. Wow. OK.
Since when are you two friends?

355
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,936
Well, we decided to start a support group
for women who've been attacked by Diaz.

356
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
Or his assassins.
Do you care to join?

357
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,833
Uh, thanks,
I'll pass,

358
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,639
but, hey, maybe you
should get back

359
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,029
to witness protection

360
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,696
and you should head
on back to Earth Two

361
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,376
before you both remember
you hate each other.

362
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
OK. Real talk. We're working together,
and we need your help.

363
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,794
- We?
- It's called empathy, Dinah.

364
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,216
I'm about 100% sure that's not
what we're dealing with here,

365
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
but what is going on?

366
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,391
Slabside is denying
Felicity access to Oliver.

367
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,336
<i>They're keeping him
somewhere called level two,</i>

368
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,816
but there's no record
of anything at slabside

369
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,776
called level two,
so we dove into the employee records,

370
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,056
- and we found something.
- Yes. A psychiatrist by the name

371
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,117
of Dr. Jarrett Parker
with a "p."

372
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,296
We need you to check to see if
there were any complaints made

373
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,551
<i>to the SCPD about Parker
during his private practice.</i>

374
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,720
Surprised you didn't just
hack into SCPD yourself.

375
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,976
Oh, I did. There was just
nothing in the digital records.

376
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,736
I was hoping to do this
the old-fashioned way

377
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,911
and go through the hard
copies in the SCPD archive.

378
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,758
OK, but what makes us
believe this Parker guy is shady?

379
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,630
Slabside doesn't have a psychiatric
program for their inmates.

380
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,715
Whatever Parker is
doing is not being reported.

381
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,554
Please. If Oliver is in trouble,
we have to help him.

382
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,874
Surprised to see
you here.

383
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,000
Thought you'd be out.

384
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,434
Well, still have
a job to do,

385
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,856
you know, the one
that doesn't involve

386
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,837
possibly dismemberment
and/or death.

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
Since when have you been
afraid of any of that?

388
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,794
- Since always.
- You know what I mean.

389
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,536
You always ran the risk
of dying with Team Arrow.

390
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,016
Why is it any different
now with A.R.G.U.S.?

391
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,872
It just is.
Let's leave it at that.

392
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
No. We can't just
leave it at that.

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,674
You're sidelining yourself.
I want to know why.

394
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,438
I just don't have it
in me anymore.

395
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,280
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

396
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,311
Oliver's in prison.
Even he couldn't outrun the risk

397
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,279
that it takes to be
out there fighting.

398
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,516
This life has cost
me my marriage,

399
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,593
gotten me stabbed,
and people I love shot.

400
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,434
Maybe you and Lyla
and everyone else has

401
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,696
what it takes
to cope with it,

402
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,189
but I can't keep
lying to myself.

403
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,557
Being Mr. Terrific...

404
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,833
It's just not
me anymore.

405
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,958
I've been at war,
seen the faces of men who are done.

406
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Curtis, that is
not you.

407
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,839
Yeah. I am pretty sure
that is me.

408
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,438
14 phds, fluent
in multiple languages,

409
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,240
genius, bronze medal
decathlete.

410
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,869
Mr. Terrific isn't just an
alter ego you can lay aside.

411
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,480
It's who you are,
Curtis.

412
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,793
<i>The only real risk you're running
is denying the truth in that.</i>

413
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,234
Now, I respect your decision
to sit out this mission.

414
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,839
Just make sure
it's the right one.

415
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,431
When did you notice
the rage happening?

416
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,314
When I saw the inmate with
the grim reaper tattoo.

417
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,312
Interesting. Why do you think you
responded so negatively to him?

418
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,870
He was among the group who
attacked me on level one.

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,440
Hmm. Well, the good news is you didn't
give in to your violent tendencies.

420
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,389
You came here.
That means the treatment is working.

421
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,032
Dr. Parker, the main reason
that I didn't do anything was

422
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
he was dead.

423
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,200
I...
I saw him being w-wheeled out of the room

424
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,999
with the blue door.

425
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,749
Unfortunately, some
inmates don't respond

426
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,071
as well as you
to the process.

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,515
When you're breaking
new scientific ground,

428
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
setbacks are inevitable.

429
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,154
It seems like a... ahem...
prisoner dying is

430
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,519
a little bit more
than a setback.

431
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,877
Look at what we've done
together,

432
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,397
h-how we've eliminated
that part of yourself

433
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,756
that was trapped
in a cycle of violence.

434
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,070
Imagine that
on a grander scale.

435
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,640
The world would be
a much safer place.

436
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,591
Right, but people
are dying.

437
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,996
What about them?

438
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,874
That sounds like something
the old you would say, 4587,

439
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,631
the hero who insisted on
righting the wrongs of strangers

440
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,235
at the expense of the
safety and well-being

441
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,399
<i>of the people he loves.</i>

442
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,392
I thought you weren't
that person anymore.

443
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I'm not.

444
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,390
Good.

445
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,711
You need to continue
focusing on yourself,

446
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,678
on the man you
need to be

447
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,193
for the sake
of your family.

448
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,511
If you're unable
to do that,

449
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,199
we'll be forced

450
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,194
to pursue some
other treatment options.

451
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,676
Why is an arrest report from 1985

452
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,560
in the same box as an
employee file from 2002?

453
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
It doesn't make
any sense!

454
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,616
I know, after the department
switched to computerized files,

455
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,360
they just stopped taking
care of this place.

456
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,797
You mean, the SCPD is
late to the digital party?

457
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,314
Wow! Shocking.

458
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,635
Felicity, there may be
some other options.

459
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,976
Now I still have friends
in the FBI.

460
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,151
- I can call...
- because the FBI is known

461
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
for their speed
and efficiency?

462
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,400
Do you have
a better idea?

463
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,075
Yes. I asked the U.S.
attorney to file a motion

464
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,914
compelling slabside to
release all their records.

465
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,639
Oh, and you think
my way is slow!

466
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,274
That could take weeks,
months.

467
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Oliver may not have weeks,
he may not have months!

468
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,391
He may not even have days!
We don't know where he is.

469
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,712
I had no idea what his life
had become in there,

470
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,872
the things that
he's had to do.

471
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,636
Felicity, you've been focused
on catching a homicidal maniac.

472
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
If anybody understands
that, it's Oliver.

473
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,656
And Oliver's the one
who decided to go to prison.

474
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
This isn't on you.

475
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,558
And I was pissed
about that decision.

476
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,157
I should have
visited him more.

477
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,277
I should have been
able to prevent this.

478
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,874
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

479
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,595
Look. I get it, OK,
but trust me,

480
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,400
there is nothing
you could have done.

481
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,399
You have to stop
blaming yourself.

482
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,277
I thought that the worst
thing that could happen

483
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,511
was me losing my
husband to prison.

484
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,115
Well, what if I lose
him permanently?

485
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,157
Ahem. If you still want to get out of here,
we go tonight.

486
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,896
Well,
I'm glad you've finally come to your senses,

487
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,016
though I suspect
your willingness

488
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,839
to conspire comes
with... Conditions.

489
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,831
I need you to help me expose
the truth about Dr. Parker.

490
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,440
And how do you
propose we do that?

491
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,876
The evidence we need is
behind those blue doors.

492
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,236
We break in, we get it,
we escape.

493
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,595
That would be unwise.

494
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,336
You've seen what happens to
people who go into that room.

495
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,400
They come out
in body bags.

496
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
Talia, we are doing
this my way,

497
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,040
or we're not doing
it at all.

498
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,476
You'd risk both our lives

499
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,096
to help these prisoners,
despite knowing

500
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,476
that every last one
is a murderer or worse?

501
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,429
These people are being treated
like they are disposable.

502
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,597
- No one deserves that.
- Tell me, did you feel

503
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,456
that same compassion when you rammed
a sword through my father's chest?

504
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,517
No, because back then,
I still allowed the monster

505
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,399
that you helped unleash
take over.

506
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,399
Don't insinuate that my father's
death was somehow my fault.

507
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,236
I... Ra's' death
was my fault.

508
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,994
I couldn't see past what he
intended to do to my city,

509
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,799
so I didn't stop and think
about his family,

510
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,352
and for that,
I am truly sorry.

511
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,599
I know you hate me...

512
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,272
But I was
your student once,

513
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,833
and we trusted
each other completely.

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,834
We need to find
that trust again

515
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,435
because it is the only way

516
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,239
both of us will get
what we want.

517
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,397
Remember, the area surrounding
this meet is densely populated.

518
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,037
Byrd will not hesitate to leverage
this if he suspects something's up.

519
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,549
Dismissed.

520
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,312
But he won't, right,

521
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,951
as long as you all send
me in there alone?

522
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,194
Curtis, that's the hope,
but don't worry, man. You got this.

523
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,877
Right. I just need to turn off the
part of my brain going, "aah!"

524
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,795
OK. Ready.
What's the plan?

525
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,713
We're gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

526
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,832
The chemical will be
housed in this.

527
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,072
<i>The case contains
a hidden targeting system.</i>

528
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,034
<i>Use it to scan the building
and locate the hostiles.</i>

529
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,880
<i>That way, we'll know exactly
where to hit and how hard.</i>

530
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,750
Once you locate Byrd, hand
off the case and get clear.

531
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,918
<i>We'll launch the attack
on your go.</i>

532
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,192
Dr. Somto.

533
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,796
Targets acquired.

534
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,200
Make the exchange
and get clear.

535
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,080
A binary chemical bomb.

536
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,350
<i>I didn't take you for someone
as crude as a terrorist.</i>

537
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,194
What you call crude
I see as lucrative.

538
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,238
<i>All I needed was
a fall guy,</i>

539
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,074
and you were
far too perfect a mark.

540
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,656
Perhaps you are forgetting
you are standing

541
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,909
right in front
of the bomb.

542
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,312
You've heard of remote detonation,
haven't you?

543
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,640
For someone so smart,
are you really this dumb?

544
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,776
Well, actually,
if I wanted to do something

545
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,917
super-dumb, I'd probably
do something stupid like

546
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,720
tackle you to the ground,
take that tablet,

547
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,240
and shove it
down your throat.

548
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,591
That's our mark.
Get ready to move.

549
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,196
Still a sense of humor.

550
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,955
Quite impressive for
someone about to die.

551
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,479
Guess I'm just
ready for it.

552
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,757
I do have one
request first.

553
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,640
Can you give me a countdown
before you kill me?

554
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,674
First time I've
heard that one.

555
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,117
I wasn't talking
to you.

556
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,517
Too bad for you
I am pretty damn smart.

557
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,158
The bomb's disarmed.
Byrd's down.

558
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,959
- Are you all right?
- I don't know.

559
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,376
Do I still have my legs?
I got so much adrenaline

560
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,760
going right now,
I can't even tell.

561
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,994
Come on, Talia.
Come on, come on, come on.

562
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Hey!

563
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Stop!

564
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,075
About time.

565
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,795
You know, they say
the mark of a great teacher

566
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,520
is when her pupil
finally surpasses her.

567
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,200
Unh!

568
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,280
What... what
are you doing?

569
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:35,976
What I should have done
from the beginning...

570
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,434
let you perish.

571
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,200
- Brace yourself.
- God, I could use a nap.

572
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,071
That's enough of that.

573
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,837
<i>Take them to the room.</i>

574
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,193
Ugh. Yeah. Felicity,
I hate to say it,

575
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,456
but I think we might need to
try a different approach here.

576
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,675
It's not that we're
giving up.

577
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,576
It's just that we need to
figure out another way to...

578
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,795
found him.

579
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,000
During Parker's
private practice,

580
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,197
he was also a defendant
in 3 malpractice cases,

581
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,396
all settled
out of court.

582
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,392
Check this out.
Robert Goodman.

583
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,711
It's one
of his patients.

584
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,793
22-year-old male referred
to Parker back in 2015

585
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,429
after experiencing
several violent outbursts.

586
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,960
Parker promised the parents he
could make their son docile.

587
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,795
Instead, Goodman began suffering
spontaneous bouts of amnesia.

588
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,216
What the hell was this guy
doing to these people?

589
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,755
It's not clear.
Some sort of experimental treatment.

590
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,616
Looks like Parker's
making a career out of it

591
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,200
because I am looking at
about 8 different cases

592
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,919
that are exactly
like Goodman.

593
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Oh, my god!

594
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Felicity, what is it?

595
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,520
"As Goodman's amnesia
became more frequent,

596
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,390
"he eventually lost all sense
of identity and was"...

597
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,680
this is what they're
gonna do to Oliver.

598
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,152
They're going to
erase him.

599
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,999
I'm disappointed
in you, 4587.

600
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,790
<i>It's always so unfortunate
when a study doesn't work out,</i>

601
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,874
but this failure is
especially painful.

602
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,600
You're a monster.

603
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,075
We could have done
such great things together,

604
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,232
helped so many people.

605
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,393
This isn't
helping people!

606
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,992
I misjudged you.

607
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,158
I thought after
our work together,

608
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,240
you were committed to breaking
your family's cycle of violence.

609
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,270
My father pushed
people away.

610
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,232
He kept secrets,

611
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,595
and I made
those same mistakes,

612
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,791
but if I choose
to break the cycle,

613
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,197
I'm gonna do it
my way.

614
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,715
I suggest you hold
very still, 4587.

615
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,840
Unh!

616
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:33,311
My name is Oliver Queen!

617
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,592
Well, it seems
like you've picked up

618
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,160
a few new tricks
without me.

619
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,840
These things are
so barbaric.

620
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,280
Must have
an anti-tampering alarm.

621
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,830
<i>Lockdown procedure initiated.</i>

622
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,754
<i>All inmates should return
to their cells immediately.</i>

623
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,314
I've got the key card.

624
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,877
I've got the file.
We got to go.

625
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,760
We'll not be able
to go quietly.

626
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
<i>Hey!</i>

627
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,396
Where the hell
are you two going?

628
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,360
We're on lockdown.

629
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,796
You're supposed to be
in your cells.

630
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,797
I said, get
back to your cells.

631
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Straight ahead.

632
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,270
Do you think they
realized they're outmatched?

633
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,840
I think
they're about to.

634
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,160
This goes down
to the water.

635
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,313
Right. The only way out
is through the morgue.

636
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,392
Shameful way to
treat your dead.

637
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,671
<i>They went this way.
Over here!</i>

638
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,439
They won't be long.
We must go.

639
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,800
I need you to give
this to Felicity.

640
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
If you stay,
you will die.

641
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,195
If I leave, I'm
a fugitive forever.

642
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,874
I won't do that
to my family.

643
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,351
All those years ago,
you were wrong.

644
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,314
Giving the monster an identity
didn't contain the darkness.

645
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,278
It just gave it power.

646
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,317
Separating
into two selves,

647
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,795
hiding in the shadows...

648
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,196
That was never
the answer.

649
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,920
<i>Someone
barricaded this.</i>

650
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,560
Get something
to break this down.

651
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,632
I will make sure
your wife gets this

652
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,031
and that she knows her husband
is as stubborn as ever.

653
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
I'll hold them off.

654
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Time to go, inmate.

655
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,320
Where are you
taking me?

656
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,960
<i>This whole place is
getting shut down.</i>

657
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,794
You're going back
to level one.

658
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,356
<i>Despite official
denials of the allegation</i>

659
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,115
<i>of prisoner abuse
a t slabside penitentiary,</i>

660
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,636
<i>documents provided by SCPD</i>

661
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,996
<i>detailing the cruel
and unusual practices</i>

662
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,516
<i>of Dr. Jarrett Parker,
a suspect</i>

663
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,592
<i>in the cold case death
of Robert Goodman,</i>

664
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,831
<i>appear to connect
the controversial therapist</i>

665
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,118
<i>to the prison, bringing
those denials into question...</i>

666
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,630
Whoo! One
for team Felicity.

667
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,632
I'm still workshopping
the name.

668
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,797
Question is which
guardian angel do we

669
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,320
have to thank for this
little baby?

670
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,880
Oh, don't know,
don't care.

671
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,833
Oliver is back
sleeping soundly

672
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,720
in his regular maximum
security prison cell

673
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,872
with no evil scientists
trying to fry his brain.

674
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,311
This, plus what we got
from the records room,

675
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,994
is enough to earn Dr. Parker

676
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,790
his own cozy
little prison cell.

677
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,121
You know, slabside's got a real PR
nightmare on their hands right now.

678
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,073
What if we could use that for more
than just shutting down level two?

679
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,710
We can use this to appeal
Oliver's conviction.

680
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,720
We can use it to get
Oliver out of prison.

681
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,680
You suffering
from a relapse, doctor?

682
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,479
Allow me to provide
the cure.

683
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
No!

684
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,016
You haven't made it
home yet?

685
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,157
Ah. Wanted to get the
mission report wrapped up,

686
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,915
make sure there were no
abnormalities for bell to find.

687
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,976
Yeah. Well, mission reports don't
usually take all night.

688
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,753
Besides, this was
an on-the-books op.

689
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,196
Shouldn't be any
abnormalities.

690
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,512
- Then why'd I find one?
- What's this?

691
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,040
Something I lifted off Byrd
before he went into custody.

692
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,510
- Why?
- Lyla copied the bank data

693
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,576
because she suspected A.R.G.U.S.
has something to hide.

694
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,114
That data led us
to Byrd.

695
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,856
If there's a deeper
connection that A.R.G.U.S.

696
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,960
Doesn't want
anyone to find,

697
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,474
I figure we should
know first.

698
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,560
- Worth the risk, right?
- Did you find anything?

699
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,196
Check it out.

700
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,536
It's a painting?
It took you all night

701
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,880
to decrypt
a single image?

702
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,096
Do you realize how many decryption
algorithms I had to run

703
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,400
just to get the drive
to boot up?

704
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,880
This thing's security
had security.

705
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,120
All right. Looks like someone
doesn't want us to see this.

706
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,556
- What's the origin?
- Well, this painting is

707
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,078
<i>from the 19th century by a French
artist named</i> Jean-Léon Gérôme.

708
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,079
The title is "Dante,
he hath seen hell."

709
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,198
- Hidden meaning?
- Pfft. It's art.

710
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,600
There's always
a hidden meaning.

711
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,279
We just need to find out
what it is.

712
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,194
Guess the morgue isn't the only
way out of level two after all.

713
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm just glad I made it
out of there.

714
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,999
Felicity will be, too.

715
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,630
What do you mean?

716
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,320
She came looking
for you in visitation.

717
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,116
<i>I told her
about level two.</i>

718
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Was she OK?

719
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,113
Yeah. She asked me
to give you a message.

720
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,350
What message?

721
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,273
<i>She's got a lead
on Diaz.</i>

722
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,193
She's close to getting him.

723
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,236
That's good news, right?

724
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,878
Well, all this saving
of your husband crap has...

725
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
well, it's made me
very hungry,

726
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,589
so I'm gonna go
get a pizza.

727
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,717
- OK.
- If you...

728
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,880
Want to come or if you're hungry.
I don't know.

729
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,033
Are you asking me out
on a friend date?

730
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,509
No.

731
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,160
Power boost is complete,

732
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,391
which means
we have a signal.

733
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,792
<i>Wha t is the silencer
doing there?</i>

734
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,750
Get what you came for?

735
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
Yup.

736
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,995
Just making good
on an old promise.

737
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,514
Isn't that right,
Anatoly?

738
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,274
Huh?

739
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,520
Greg, move your head!
