one of my men

00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,492
(SEAGULLS GET LOUDER)

310
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,278
Hey! Hey, stay away
from him!

311
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,915
(COUGHING)

312
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:00,801
(GRUNTING)

313
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,748
<i>Well, we anticipate</i>
<i>that Somers' attorney</i>

314
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,302
will try and paint you as blinded
by grief or looking to make a buck.

315
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,122
This isn't about
the money.

316
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,124
I just want justice
for my father.

317
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,928
Emily, there are a lot of people who
don't want this trial to proceed.

318
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,046
Dangerous people.

319
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,897
My mother died
when I was a baby,

320
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,266
and my father has been the
only family I've ever known

321
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:33,768
and they slit his throat.

322
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,638
They are going to
have to kill me

323
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,357
if they want me
to give this up.

324
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,309
Well let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

325
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,777
QUENTIN: And it won't.

326
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,646
What's going on?

327
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,181
What's going on
is that the three of you

328
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,232
are getting around-the-clock
police protection. Okay?

329
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,201
Get used to their faces,

330
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,652
because they're going with you
everywhere you go, no arguments.

331
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,237
I'm a lawyer.
I live to argue.

332
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,356
I'm your father.
I live to keep you safe.

333
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,127
Um, Emily, let's go grab
a cup of coffee, okay?

334
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:02,196
Yes, why not do that? Thank you.
Please, go with them.

335
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:03,464
Stay there.

336
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,051
Protective custody?

337
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:10,054
I seem to recall you trying that
once I discovered boys also.

338
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,472
Didn't work then either.
(SIGHING)

339
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,424
This isn't
a joke, Laurel.

340
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,376
Martin Somers got
attacked last night.

341
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,045
What?
Yeah.

342
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:19,713
By who?
It doesn't matter.

343
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:22,316
Point is, you have whipped
up a storm with these guys,

344
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,885
and until the dust settles
you'll be protected, okay?

345
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,522
End of discussion.

346
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,857
That might have worked
when I was eight.

347
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,908
But it's not gonna
work anymore.

348
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,693
End of discussion,
Laurel!

349
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,078
You're insistent on doing
your job, that's great.

350
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,413
But this is me
doing mine, okay?

351
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,415
And not just as a
father, but as a cop.

352
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,067
These people, they are more dangerous
than you are willing to admit.

353
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,870
And you've made them angry.

354
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,798
Thank you for coming.
Anything for a friend.

355
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,216
We're not friends.

356
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,585
You smuggle drugs,
I let you use my port.

357
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,470
For which you're paid
a lot of money.

358
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,772
I don't get paid enough
to have arrows shot at me.

359
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,091
You need to take
this guy seriously.

360
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:06,894
He is a bigger threat to your
operation than Nocenti ever was.

361
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,197
Except now it's Nocenti's
daughter who's the problem.

362
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:12,033
Unlike your friend with the hood,
we know where to find her.

363
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:13,868
Don't be an idiot.

364
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,237
You take out Emily Nocenti, and
Laurel Lance will never let this go.

365
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,839
She won't stop until
she burns you,

366
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:20,424
me, and then the entire
Triad to the ground.

367
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,244
Then we kill Miss Lance.

368

<i>Attorney for shipping

you get those?

(SIGHING)
Don't you knock?

375
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:48,064
No, wait... Mom said
that there were scars, but...

376
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:57,941
I'm... Oliver, what
happened to you out there?

377
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:04,948
I don't want
to talk about it.

378

(SCOFFS)

379
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:10,220
Of course you don't.

380
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:12,722
You never want to talk
to me about anything.

381
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:14,391
Except for my social life. Wait!

382
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:17,711
Where are you going?

383
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,195
Why should I tell you?

384
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,633
I'm sorry, Thea.

385
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:29,973
I need to get better at talking
about what happened to me there.

386
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:35,528
But I'm not ready yet.

387
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:36,980
Okay?

388
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,084
Do you have a second?

389
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,319
Yeah.

390
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,705
Good.

391
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:48,591
I wanna show you
something out back.

392
00:20:51,963 --> 00:20:55,131
Sometimes, when I
felt... Whatever...

393
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,717
I'd come here.

394
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:05,008
About a month after the funerals,
Mom stopped going out.

395
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,012
Pretty soon, she stopped
talking altogether.

396
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:13,900
The house got so quiet,
so I'd come here.

397
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:17,237
To talk to you.

398
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,692
I mean, stupid stuff.

399
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:25,912
Like what I was doing that day,
what boy I had a crush on...

400
00:21:26,914 --> 00:21:29,716
And then sometimes,
I'd ask you,

401
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:33,036
beg you, to find
your way home to me.

402
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:36,056
Now, here you are.

403
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:39,976
And the truth is, I felt closer
to you when you were dead.

404
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:44,881
Look, I know it was
hell where you were.

405
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:46,850
But it was hell here too.

406
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:51,654
You gotta
let me in, Ollie.

407
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,859
You gotta let
someone in.

408
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,208
(DOORBELL RINGING)

409
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,592
Hi.

410
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:30,927
Are you okay?

411
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:33,146
There are two
cop cars outside.

412
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,065
How am I supposed
to stay away from you

413
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,850
if you won't
stay away from me?

414
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:40,103
I... What are you
doing here, Ollie?

415
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,323
My sister took...

416
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:47,110
She pointed out to me that I have been
distant since I got back and that...

417
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:51,915
It would probably be a good
idea if I let somebody in.

418
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,918
So, you thought you'd start with
the first person you pushed away.

419
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,669
I did that
to protect you.

420
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:58,922
And then I
saw you yesterday,

421
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:00,757
and I realized
that I hurt you.

422
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,560
(SIGHING)

423
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:10,934
Thank you.

424
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:16,973
Wow.

425
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:20,243
This place hasn't changed
in five years. (CHUCKLING)

426
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:23,413
I haven't really had
time to redecorate.

427
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:25,915
I'm a jerk.

428
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:30,653
Before the island, I was a
jerk, and now I'm just a...

429
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,707
I'm a damaged jerk.

430
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:36,042
What's in the bag?

431
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:40,630
I thought about many
things on the island,

432
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:42,432
but there was one thing that
I thought about every day.

433
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,933
I actually
dreamed about it,

434
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:47,103
and I promised myself that
if I ever got a chance

435
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:50,306
to do it again,
I'd do it with you.

436
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:55,979
Eat ice cream.

437
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:03,953
This is as good
as I remember.

438
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:10,560
My mother wants me
to join the company.

439
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:13,930
Yeah. Take my
rightful place.

440
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:18,301
I can't exactly picture you
as master of the universe.

441
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:24,207
You know,
after five years,

442
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,160
I have plans.

443
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:31,097
I have things
that I have to do.

444
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:32,882
I can't do that if I'm...

445
00:24:34,735 --> 00:24:36,269
I don't know...

446
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:39,189
Attending board meetings
and stockholder briefings.

447
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,825
Oliver?
Hmm?

448
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:44,227
You're an adult.

449
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:46,196
You can say no.

450
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,330
Oh, I tried.

451
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,333
Didn't take.

452
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:52,485
Well, then
don't tell her.

453
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:54,988
Show her.

454
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,241
Be the person that you
want her to see you as.

455
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:01,077
Trust me.

456
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:06,049
I have plenty of experience
with disapproving parents.

457
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:08,885
I have been on the receiving end
of your father's disapproval.

458
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:13,022
He blames himself
more than he blames you.

459
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:16,859
He thinks that, you know, maybe
if he and Sarah were closer,

460
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:20,029
she would have told him
about the boat trip.

461
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:22,765
And he could have stopped
her from going with you.

462
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,867
I am sorry.

463
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:26,419
You apologized already.

464
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,241
And it'll never be enough.

465
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,162
(THUD)

623
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:05,967
(GRUNTING) All right.
Ow! Fine, fine shovel. I got it.

624
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:08,486
Whoa! Ow!
WOMAN: He must be drunk.

625
00:35:08,488 --> 00:35:11,322
(CAMERA CLICKING)
OLIVER: I got it. I got it.

626
00:35:11,324 --> 00:35:13,641
<i>Some of you may not know me.</i>
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

627
00:35:17,997 --> 00:35:20,198
<i>Watch some television,</i>
<i>read a newspaper,</i>

628
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,984
<i>I'm kind of famous</i>
<i>right now.</i>

629
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:27,372
<i>Mostly, though, I'm famous
because I'm Robert Queen's son.</i>

630
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:31,159
<i>Uh, but as Walter,</i>
<i>who's my new dad...</i>

631
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:34,045
<i>Huh? Who is... Sorry.</i>

632
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:36,381
<i>As Walter was saying,</i>

633
00:35:36,383 --> 00:35:39,801
<i>I'm not much of</i>
<i>a legacy, per se.</i>

634
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:40,935
Oliver, you don't
have to do this.

635
00:35:40,937 --> 00:35:42,437
<i>No, sit. Sit!</i>

636
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:44,672
<i>Gosh.</i>

637
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:48,560
<i>See, I was supposed</i>
<i>to come here today,</i>

638
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:52,480
<i>and I'm supposed to take my
rightful place at the company.</i>

639
00:35:52,482 --> 00:35:56,851
<i>Prodigal son returns home</i>
<i>and becomes the heir apparent.</i>

640
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:01,689
<i>But I'm not my father.</i>

641
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:04,576
<i>I'm not the man he was.</i>

642
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,244
<i>I'm not half</i>
<i>the man he was.</i>

643
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:09,214
<i>I never will be.</i>

644
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:13,084
<i>So, please,</i>
<i>stop asking me to be.</i>

645
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:19,507

646
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,551
NEWSCASTER: <i>Martin Somers,</i>
<i>the CEO of Starling Port,</i>

647
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:47,704
<i>was arrested last night for
the murder of Victor Nocenti.</i>

648
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:52,758
<i>He is also being accused of accepting cash,
including over $10 million in bribes.</i>

649
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,195
Well, we can pursue the
civil suit if you want,

650
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,929
but the D.A.
now has no choice,

651
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:59,115
with Mr. Somers' confession,
to prosecute him.

652
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,617
He's going to jail, Emily.

653
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,235
For the rest
of his life.

654
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:04,487
Thank you so much
for fighting for us.

655
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,323
Well, thank you for being
brave enough to let me.

656
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,999
Hey.

657
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:18,585
I thought I didn't need
police protection anymore.

658
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:20,637
I thought I didn't need a
reason to see my own daughter.

659
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,787
You don't.

660
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:28,811
Hmm. You look tired.

661
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,564
Yeah, I was filling out reports on
the shootout at the port last night

662
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:35,568
and getting grilled about how
I let that archer get away.

663
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,421
I have to admit,
I'm kind of glad he did.

664
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,740
He brought down
Martin Somers.

665
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:42,158
He hurt a bunch
of people doing it, okay?

666
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,244
He is no hero.
He is an anarchist.

667
00:37:44,246 --> 00:37:46,829
Yeah, well, whoever he is,

668
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,481
it seems like
he's trying to help.

669
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,533
The city doesn't need
that kind of help, okay?

670
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,035
It's like I always told
you, you don't need to go

671
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,587
outside the law to find justice.
Now I believe that.

672
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:58,157
All right? And I promise
you, when I catch this guy,

673
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,825
<i>he's gonna</i>
<i>believe it, too.</i>

674
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:20,906
Well, you saw
for yourself.

675
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:24,460
My son knows nothing.

676
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,630
Robert didn't tell him
anything that could hurt us.

677
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,883
And he has no idea that
the yacht was sabotaged.

678
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,793
All that time on the island,
plotting my return,

679
00:39:56,795 --> 00:40:00,163
I didn't realize
how hard it would be.

680
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:05,718
To reconnect
with Mom, Thea,

681
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,757
Laurel. Okay, I didn't...

682
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:18,231
I didn't know how painful it
would be to keep my secrets.

683
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,902
You asked me
to save the city.

684
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:24,970
To right your wrongs.

685
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:26,806
I will.

686
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:29,442
I swear.

687
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:35,248
But to do that,

688
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,668
I can't be the Oliver that
everyone wants me to be,

689
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,636
which means
that sometimes...

690
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:44,424
To honor your wishes...

691
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,979
I need to dishonor
your memory.

692
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:52,965
I'm sorry.

693
00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:58,054
(SIGHING)

694
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,273
Take it down.

695
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,950
Will you be
going out tonight, sir?

696
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,287
Definitely.

697
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:35,508
(ARROW THUDS)
(SCREAMING)

698
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:43,316
(GROANING LOUDLY)

699
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:47,987
No, no...
