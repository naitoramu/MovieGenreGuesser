So it occurred
to me this morning,

43
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:08,462
what's the one thing
that Queen Consolidated has

44
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,164
that we don't use
to its maximum potential?

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,067
Have you heard of a process
called cogeneration?

47
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,303
I haven't even looked
at a cup of coffee yet.

48
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:19,406
- Well, cogeneration is...
- The repurposing

49
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:22,209
of waste heat given
off by electricity production.

50
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,811
Exactly. It's a principle
of thermodynamic efficiency,

51
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:26,580
which occurred to me
could be applied to a building

52
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:29,349
which generates over
240,000 watts of electricity.

Mm-hmm.

If by "sell" you mean "give away
for free," yes.

322
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:43,809
SCPD just dispatched
a riot squad

323
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,377
to Starling
National.

324
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,345
It's like fighting a fire
with gasoline.

325
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,381
Suit up.

326
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:52,851
[All yelling]

327
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:55,253
[Siren]

328
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:59,391
This group is ordered
to disperse!

329
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,460
[All yelling]
Back!

330
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,228
Back behind the line!

331
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,397
Felicity: Oliver, the riot is getting
out of control.

332
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,333
You need to hurry up.

333
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:11,369
Back! Back
behind the line!

334
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:19,711
Get away
from the bank!

00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:28,620
[All yelling]

336
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,460
The teargas is dispersing them,
but we can't calm

337
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,061
the entire city,
Felicity.

338
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:38,463
The trace led me
to the virus they're using.

339
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,099
It is a mile past complex.

340
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:43,968
I'm combing through now.

341
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,937
No, no, no, no, no, no!

342
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,505
What's wrong?

343
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:50,174
The virus...
I can't stop it!

344
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,310
- How do you know?
- Because it's mine.

345
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:56,714
I wrote it five years ago.

346
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,831
Ok, ok, before
you say anything,

347
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:10,534
just know that I never imagined
the virus being used

348
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,434
for something like this.
I mean, sure,

349
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,970
I could have
imagined it.

350
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,371
I actually have
a very vivid imagination.

351
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,039
Like cronuts!
I had a vision of them before--

352
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,208
Hey.

353
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,243
Relax.

354
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:23,245
Take a deep breath.

355
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,148
Good.

356
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,816
Now start at the beginning.

357
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,385
I was in this,

358
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,020
I guess you could
call it a group,

359
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,023
in college.
We were "hacktivists."

360
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,625
For lack
of a better word.

361
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,594
Civil disobedience

362
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:41,897
via the World Wide Web.

363
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,666
I created this.

364
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,902
This...

365
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,705
Super virus.

366
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,774
That could give us
root access

367
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:54,043
to any infected server.

368
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,145
We could expose
government fraud

369
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,413
and start
virtual sit-ins

370
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,882
and digitally
deface criminals.

371
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:03,352
I guess you could say it was
my first attempt at being a hero.

372
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:06,688
Felicity. [Sighs]

373
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,791
Why didn't you tell me
about any of this?

374
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,528
Do we even know
a fraction

375
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,663
of what happened to you the five years
that you were away?

376
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:17,132
Who else had access
to the program?

377
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:19,668
Myron Forest.
He was my...

378
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,737
I had a boyfriend
in college,

379
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,572
and Myron
was his roommate.

380
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,607
And he was a member
of this hacktivist group?

381
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,209
What about the boyfriend?

382
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,545
Oh, he couldn't
have done this.

383
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:31,780
He's... not
in the picture,

384
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,882
but Myron always had
somewhat of an edge.

385
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,218
Can you get me an address?

386
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,620
Sure.

387
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,493
Just one small problem--

388
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:46,361
not small,
necessarily, but short.

389
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:48,730
Just take
the alleyway entrance.

390
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:51,333
Ok.

391
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,752
Are you ok?

392
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:12,421
[Chuckles]

393
00:17:12,423 --> 00:17:13,856
I've been better.

394
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,158
I talked it over with Myron,

395
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,094
and I'm going to tell them
I wrote the super virus.

396
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:21,063
You can't do that.

397
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:23,765
I can't let you
rot in prison, Coop.

398
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,034
You can't tell them
you wrote that virus...

399
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:28,270
'Cause I already
told them I did.

400
00:17:28,272 --> 00:17:29,905
Cooper...

401
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,641
I always said I'd protect you
from the grues.

402
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,577
- This isn't--
- It's better this way.

403
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,846
I wiped out
those loans.

404
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,382
There's no reason
both of us should be in prison.

405
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,119
I love you.

406
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,687
Love you, too.

407
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,902
Hey. Got a minute?

408
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,874
Congratulations,
you called in a riot squad,

409
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,977
you nearly started one!
And! You did it behind my back.

410
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:10,679
You were busy,

411
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,814
and the situation
at Starling National was escalating.

412
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:14,416
You escalated it, Laurel!

413
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:16,818
Please tell me you can
at least see that now.

414
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,620
Ok.

415
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,889
I'm sorry.

Laurel, baby...

417
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,861
What's gotten into you?

418
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,730
You're angry, you're distant,
you're reckless.

419
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,299
Tell me you're not
boozing again.

420
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,301
No.

421
00:18:32,303 --> 00:18:34,660
Then what the hell's going on?
Because this isn't you.

422
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,478
Look, I haven't said anything
because I was hoping

423
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:38,007
 that you would say something,

424
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,342
because you, sweetheart,
you are in ten different kinds of pain,

425
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:43,178
and you won't talk about it.

426
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,081
I can't talk
about it with you.

427
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:53,021
Ok.

428
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,290
But listen, you don't have
to talk about it with me.

429
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,858
But talk about it
with somebody.

Ahh.

keeps that locked.

434
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:17,279
Or... so they told me.

00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,515
I could never get that
stupid door to open.

What are you
doing here, Ollie?

A super hacker is trying to take over
the city and I'm worried about you.

440
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:35,063
I still get to be worried,
right?

441
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,665
Yes.

442
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,767
And if you
really have to,

443
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,869
you can even be
judgmental--

444
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,205
occasionally. But...

445
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:45,040
Someone told me
recently

446
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:47,943
that a family is
pretty precious.

447
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:51,046
And love,
in spite of everything,

448
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,614
is what makes it
precious.

449
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:56,351
Right now, the Queen family
is just you and me.

450
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,321
So let it just be you and me.

451
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,091
And don't take Merlyn's money.

452

I'm trying to meet you
halfway here, Ollie.

is up to you.

You have failed this city.

to shut down the virus.

You think I'm behind
the cyber attacks?

a Brother Eye to me.

I swear to God, I'm not.

Digital fingerprints
are all over this code.

that doesn't mean I'm the eye guy!

00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:37,486
I am running out
of expletives!

484
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:38,720
We need
to track down

485
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,422
whoever Myron shared
your code with.

486
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,491
I hacked all of his emails
and all his text messages

487
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:44,226
from five years ago
and all I got was depressed.

488
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:46,661
Ok. What
about your ex?

489
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:48,530
- I already told you, he didn't do it.
- Why?

490
00:21:48,532 --> 00:21:50,932
Because he's your ex-boyfriend?

491
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,534
Because...

492
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:55,804
My senior year of college,

493
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,140
Cooper and I did
a stupid thing.

494
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:01,810
He got arrested
and he went to prison.

495
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:04,746
So he went to prison.
Maybe he got out.

496
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:06,014
He didn't.

497
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:09,084
- How do you know?
- Because he's dead.

498
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:13,889
He hung himself
before sentencing.

499
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,457
[Exhales]

500
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,192
Felicity, I...

501
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:21,763
I just really need to be
alone right now.

502
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:34,042
Ah. I'm glad
you're here.

503
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,310
When I launched
my plan to rebrand

504
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,945
Starling
into Star City,

505
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:40,615
I didn't count on
cyber terrorism.

506
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:42,717
I'm looking
for a partner

507
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,319
with whom
to drown my sorrows

508
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,887
and you definitely

509
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,657
look like someone
who could use a drink.

510
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,693
I'm sorry.

511
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,529
My mother...

512
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:57,332
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

513
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:01,503
You ok?

514
00:23:03,474 --> 00:23:05,140
You're an inventor.

515
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:07,375
Did you ever create

516
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:10,212
anything that you didn't
think was important,

517
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:12,013
turns out,

518
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,549
it's very important?

519
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,518
Of course.

520
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,387
Those turn out to be
the best inventions.

521
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:20,989
Not always.

522
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:22,858
You want to talk about it?

523
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,230
Of course
I'd find you here.

524
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:31,533
- Could you just wait one second?
- Wait?

525
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,802
[Scoffs] I'm sorry;

526
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,770
I've already waited two hours for you
at your apartment,

527
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,839
and before that,
it was two hours in that club.

528
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:40,075
[Sighs]

529
00:23:40,077 --> 00:23:43,378
Is there any way that you could be
anywhere else but here?

530
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,686
Thanks, Mom.

531
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:54,422
That wasn't
the least bit mortifying.

532
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:57,292
Only half as bad as parents'
week in freshman year.

533
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:59,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

534
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:03,331
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking
my own daughter.

535
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,101
Because you can't
seem to comprehend

536
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:07,903
that I can't make
the whole world stop

537
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:11,006
because you decided to
show up on my doorstep.

538
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,008
I have responsibilities!

539
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,843
Yes, I know, Felicity.

540
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:16,745
You have work.
You have work, work, work, work.

541
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,580
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

542
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,316
It is so much more
than work.

543
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,251
But all you care about
it my love life

544
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,287
or how much cleavage
I don't show.

545
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,421
That is not true!

546
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,456
That is completely true!

547
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,725
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.

548
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,494
I'm sorry I have
an actual job.

549
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,229
I'm sorry that I don't
dress like a porn star!

550
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:35,697
Which I realize is
a compliment to you.

551
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:37,766
So I'm so sorry
that I am such

552
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,601
a disappointment to you!

553
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:45,974
I'm not as smart
as you, Felicity,

554
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:47,208
or your father.

555
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,377
I know that.

556
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:53,214
Even when you were only six years old,
I could barely keep up with you two.

557
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,317
And...

558
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,919
Maybe I wasn't always
the mother you wanted,

559
00:24:57,921 --> 00:24:59,654
but I was always there.

560
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,923
I stayed and I tried.

561
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:04,492
He...

562
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:07,495
He left me.

563
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:10,999
He left us.

564
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,536
But when I look at you,

565
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:17,405
all I see
is what he gave you.

566
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,608
There is nothing of me...

567
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,711
in you.

568
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:25,080
You know,
it's so funny. I was--

569
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,949
I was always so afraid
that one day,

570
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:31,386
you were going to leave me,
too. [Chuckles]

571
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,925
But now I finally realize...

572
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:39,961
You already did.

573
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:59,742
There are people on the other end
of this thing, right?

574
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:01,043
People we can hit?

575
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:02,444
We need Felicity.

576
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:04,480
I'm here.

577
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:08,284
The super virus
has 3,407 traceable access nodes.

578
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:11,253
Hopefully I didn't
put a firewall in every one, though.

579
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:13,856
Of course I did, because
I'm smarter than that.

580
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,791
Seriously, if I had
two less IQ points,

581
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:17,459
we never would have
gotten in this mess.

582
00:26:17,461 --> 00:26:19,028
Are you all right?

583
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,930
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

584
00:26:20,932 --> 00:26:23,332
Probably back
at my place,

585
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:26,035
wishing she had a different daughter.
It's a long story.

586
00:26:26,037 --> 00:26:28,070
So go see her.
Take an hour.

587
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:29,471
- The city is under attack.
- You're our best chance of stopping it,

588
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,142
but not like this, Felicity.
Your head's not in the game.

589
00:26:33,144 --> 00:26:34,577
I will get it
together.

590
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,946
Your tracer hack's running.
Take an hour.

591
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:39,248
Go talk to your mom.

592
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,717
I do not have anything
to say to her.

593
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,986
You know, earlier today,
Thea told me

594
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:46,689
that she literally
has to put up with me

595
00:26:46,691 --> 00:26:48,857
because family is precious.
And that it's love,

596
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,460
in spite of everything,

597
00:26:51,462 --> 00:26:54,029
that makes it precious.

598
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,933
Go.

599
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,211
Where's Sara?

600
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:11,213
The nanny came
to pick her up.

601
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,449
Said he was from a company
called A.R.G.U.S.

602
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:14,817
I don't know,
I've never heard of it.

603
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:17,620
I think
that's the point.

604
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:19,388
Well, I'm glad
you're still here.

605
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,856
[Scoffs]

606
00:27:20,858 --> 00:27:24,159
You are a terrible liar,
Felicity.

607
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:29,264
Might be the only thing
we have in common.

608
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,000
I have blonde hair.

609
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:33,569
You dye it.

610
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:35,337
You're right.

611
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,206
We're different,

612
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,541
and it's always going to be that way.
And it's not easy--

613
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,577
No, you know
what, it's--

614
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:45,047
it's totally my fault
for just showing up here uninvited.

615
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:47,016
Seriously. I think
I just got so excited

616
00:27:47,018 --> 00:27:49,084
about this free flight.

617
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,410
What?

618
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:52,175
My plane ticket.

619
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,998
I got an email that said
I'd won some contest.

620
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:59,228
Free first class
round trip to Starling.

621
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,330
Email?

622

[Exhales]

623
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:06,368
Mom.

624
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,003
Someone wanted you
to be here.

[Both shrieking]

Mom!

627
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,419
- My baby!
- Mom!

628
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:24,586
Are you ok?

629
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:25,654
I'm ok.
Oh!

630
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:26,955
Oh, thank god!

631
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,458
[Sobbing]

632
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Where are we?

633
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:33,262
[Gasping]

634
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:36,732
Felicity Smoak, just the woman
I wanted to see.

635
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:38,734
What the hell
do you want from me?!

636
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:39,868
Who are you?

637
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,570
You really don't know?

638
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:48,944
I thought you'd never
forget your first love.

639
00:28:57,378 --> 00:29:00,279
You died.

640
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,196
They told me--

641
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,864
That I committed
suicide, right?

642
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,634
The NSA needed a hacker with game
for cyber espionage,

643
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:08,369
and I needed
to not be in prison

644
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,204
for the rest of my life.

645
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,639
Because of what the NSA
wanted me doing,

646
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:15,743
it was... advantageous
for me to be dead.

647
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:17,678
When I found out you died,

648
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,181
I was devastated.

649
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,083
I loved you.

650
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:24,252
I loved you, too.

651
00:29:24,254 --> 00:29:26,254
After I finished my time
with the NSA,

652
00:29:26,256 --> 00:29:28,189
I was going to find you.

653
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,291
To let you in on this.

654
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:31,859
And then I discovered
you'd become this

655
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,328
corporate lap dog.

656
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,498
That broke my heart.
You changed.

657
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,367
If you ever thought I was capable
of doing something like this,

658
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:41,068
you never really
knew me at all.

659
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,670
When you wrote this
virus, Felicity,

660
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:45,339
you knew exactly
what it was capable of.

661
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,275
All I'm doing is unleashing
the true potential

662
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,409
of what you made.

663
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,644
Why?!

664
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:51,545
This isn't who you are!

665
00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:53,447
Five years with the NSA,

666
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,316
you learn a lot about
how the world works.

667
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:58,019
How we can't be saved
or salvaged.

668
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,954
How it's every man
for himself.

669
00:29:59,956 --> 00:30:02,723
You also learn that when
a city bank goes under,

670
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:04,892
say, financial
cyber attack,

671
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:08,629
the mayor will reach out
to the Treasury Department

672
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:11,098
and request an influx
of fresh cash.

673
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,934
Cash which is transported
by armored trucks

674
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:16,637
navigating according to
a closed-end GPS system,

675
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,807
which directs them
to City Deposit.

676
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,642
If the drivers
deviate from the route,

677
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:25,313
the trucks are shut down.

678
00:30:25,315 --> 00:30:27,581
But you're going to hack
into the system

679
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:31,118
and direct the cash
to come here.

680
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,753
It was about money,
and I'm the sell-out?

681
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:33,921
No.

682
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:36,357
No, babe.

You're the one who's
going to help me.

my capabilities.

693
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,816
I could have them go back,

00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,701
Don't train for that.

808
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,369
All right,
train for yourself.

809
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,739
See, now I know
how to teach you.

810
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,445
So what's it
going to be?

811
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,047
Red or black?

812
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,615
Black.

813
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:24,750
Definitely black.

814
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:38,097
It was popcorn,
right?

815
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:40,700
You said you were
meeting me halfway.

816
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,702
This is me
doing my part.

817
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,780
I missed you, Speedy.

818
00:38:57,785 --> 00:39:00,987
Let's not miss
each other anymore.

819
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:04,423
I mean, it was so much easier
to be in each other's lives

820
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,359
when we were
underneath the same roof.

821
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:09,862
So... Why don't you
move in with me?

822
00:39:09,864 --> 00:39:13,132
I mean, clearly I
have enough space.

823
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,800
And I...

824
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:18,504
I swear once the club starts
making a profit,

825
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:21,807
I will donate all
of Malcolm's money

826
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:24,377
to an earthquake relief

827
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,812
charity thing.

828
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,749
I can live with that.

829
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:35,621
You got a TV in here?

830
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,013
Well,

831
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:03,316
I'm officially off.

832
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,184
I mean, my flight doesn't
leave till tonight,

833
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:07,853
but I figured you'd be
working, so we can--

834
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:10,156
we can just
say good-bye now.

835
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,860
You were right.

836
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,298
- About what?
- I haven't always

837
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,599
been appreciative
of you.

838
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,202
You were always
there for me every day,

839
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:24,770
and night.

840
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:27,673
So if I haven't said
thank you enough,

841
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,108
thank you.

842
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,710
[Laughs]

843
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:33,079
But you were
wrong, too.

844
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,814
Mm-hmm?

845
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,883
When you said all you saw
in me was dad;

846
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,053
there was nothing
of you in me.

847
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:42,788
Well, I can't
really explain it,

848
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,057
but over the past two years,
I have been through a lot.

849
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:49,228
And I have learned that I am a lot
tougher than I thought.

850
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,764
That...

851
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:54,500
I get from you.

852
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,537
Don't cry.

853
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,706
So I took another look
at those cogeneration numbers.

854
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,541
You want to...

855
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,776
Oh.

856
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:04,591
Hi again.

857
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:05,712
Hi.

858
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,446
How's that new smart wearable
working out for you?

859
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:08,814
Oh, it's, um,

860
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:10,916
it's a real life saver.

861
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,619
Yeah.

862
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,389
Ray, I can't come
into work today.

863
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,491
I am...
[Coughs]

864
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:22,128
Calling in sick.

865
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,630
"Feel better."

866
00:41:24,632 --> 00:41:26,899
Thank you.

867
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,834
Thank you.
See you later.

868
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,970
[Indistinct chatter]

869
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,344
That's actually
pretty genius.

870
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:41,879
Man: Hello, Sara.

871
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:47,962
What are you
doing here?

872
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:58,673
[Gasping]
