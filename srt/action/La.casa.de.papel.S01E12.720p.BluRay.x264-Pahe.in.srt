1
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:06,721
Inspector, we have found the estate.

2
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,601
This house has to be combed,
each corner.

3
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:15,121
The whole damn plan,
schedules, photos, blueprints...

4
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:17,681
This doesn't make sense.
Call Alberto.

5
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,081
Isn't he the best in forensics?
Well, let him come.

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,601
- Everything they wanted to erase
they really must have burned it there.

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:28,201
I'm taking this to Canillas.
Ah, well, I was just on my way to Madrid,

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,401
I was going to take bus.

9
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,521
I was thinking
what you said before

10
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:35,081
that you want the best for Raquel.
If it were true,

11
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:37,961
you wouldn't be fucking
to his sister.

12
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,041
Piece of shit.
Get out of the car.

13
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,121
Son of a bitch.

14
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:43,521
Ah!

15
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:53,321
You're under arrest
for assaulting a police officer.

16
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:01,921
Give me the revolver.

17
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,081
Tell us what the plan is Chernobyl.

18
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,121
It's me the only one here
who knows the plan,

19
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,921
you're not gonna have a fucking clue
how to get out of this mousetrap.

20
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:24,601
Couldn't it be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship?

21
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:31,841
All right, take off your boots and the overalls!

22
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:33,801
Ah!

23
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,401
Don't shoot!

24
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,561
Tokio!

25
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,121
Fuck!

26
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:45,601
Río, you need to calm down.
- No, you sent Tokio to jail.

27
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:47,881
She's my girlfriend and you ruined her life.

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,121
Maybe you haven't noticed
because you're here against your will,

29
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,801
but you have a syndrome.
Which one?

30
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,441
Stockholm's. That's it,
go on your way

31
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,561
I follow mine and move on.

32
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:01,081
The Profesor, Berlín, they're not here,
you're all alone.

33
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:04,561
And He is the head of all this.
- This is a patriarchy!

34
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,561
- What does that mean?
- It means that I am in charge here!

35
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:09,761
Can I go to the bathroom?

36
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,041
I'm calling you from the police station,
I'm under arrest.

37
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,761
I'm telling you I have a boyfriend.
and you find the time

38
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,201
to beat him up?
- Hey, I didn't do anything.

39
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:23,761
- Really? Come with me.

40
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:28,201
I don't know how he got those bruises,
I swear I didn't touch him.

41
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:29,561
- Remove his handcuffs.

42
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,481
It's good to see you again,
Miss Tokio.

43
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,121
I ask and you answer.
Who is the Profesor?

44
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,681
All right, you've made your choice.
Bad, but you have chosen. Take her away.

45
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,401
Sergio! The Profesor,
his name is Sergio Marquina

46
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,161
and the heist was his father's idea.

47
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,041
And who is the person
on the outside?

48
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,601
I just called to say hello,
Continue interrogating Tokio.

49
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,801
I'm not moving from here.

50
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,401
What do you have to tell me?

51
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,441
We have
a hydrogen bomb in there.

52
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,241
Seventeen megatons.
We'll request

53
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:02,081
unconditional isolated detention.
Lobo, take her.

54
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,801
It was a very bad idea to
talk to the hostages, Río.

55
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:09,321
- You better turn me in like Tokio.
- What you have done is high treason.

56
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,921
- What are you going to do?
- I'll execute you.

57
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,201
- Put the fucking gun down.

58
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:28,881
Check-up call.
Everything is running smoothly over here.

59
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,881
Smoothly? Smoothly
as in Tokio being interrogated

60
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,041
by the police?

61
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,441
As in
you're about

62
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,921
to execute Río?
Berlín, what are you doing?

63
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,321
Profesor, it's Nairobi.
Berlín is is indisposed.

64
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:50,241
So from now on,
I'm in charge.

65
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,601
Let the matriarchy begin.

66
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,081
"If we took a photo
of this moment,

67
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,681
it could be my last memory
of the Royal

68
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,921
Mint of Spain.

69
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,641
Leaving a string of mistakes inside,
a weakened group,

70
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:14,641
and only one with the guts
to pull their weight: Nairobi.

71
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:18,401
What I mean, Profesor,
is that this out of control.

72
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:21,561
The situation here is critical.

73
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:26,161
Tokio played Russian roulette
with Berlín tied up to a chair.

74
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,321
Berlín
turned her in.

75
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,561
And then, Río deserted
and Berlín almost executed him

76
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,881
like some fucking Vietnamese
firing squad.

77
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,401
Ah, Helsinki suffocated Oslo.

78
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,041
He killed him?

79
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:51,361
He was a vegetal. Helsinki says
he would have wanted it.

80
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,361
As you can see, this is
a fucking disaster.

81
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:56,881
So I have no choice
but to take

82
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,241
control
until

83
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:01,761
things get back on track!
- Ask him what the hell he was doing

84
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,121
with the police.
I was at the house in Toledo,

85
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,561
it was a part of the plan.

86
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:08,721
Profesor,
we need to know

87
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,401
what situation we are in.

88
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,681
There are some loose ends,
I'm not going to lie.

89
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:20,121
"I'd say it was the biggest loose end
of all.

90
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,761
Assistant Inspector Ángel
had discovered the Profesor.

91
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,721
He had his fingerprints.
and was in a coma

92
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,601
waiting to wake up and reveal it.

93
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,241
The Profesor was living
on borrowed time.

94
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,241
As was everyone else.

95
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,041
The situation in there
isn't much better

96
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:43,161
from what you say.

97
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,201
Look, you do what you have to do
out there.

98
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,761
I fix things in here,
in the meantime.

99
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,121
I'll put the call through,
probably from the tent.

100
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,161
Inspector.

101
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,921
Before I get to the point
I need to clarify something.

102
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,041
a very important question.
¿From now on

103
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,761
What do I call you now?
Profesor? Sergio?

104
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,881
or Mr. Marquina?
I'll always be the Profesor to you.

105
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,481
That's how we met, isn't it?

106
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,361
You'll always be
Inspector Murillo to me,

107
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:19,281
even if you
become my executioner.

108
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,001
Remember the first time
you made love?

109
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:30,081
Of course I do,
One doesn't forget that.

110
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:34,761
Well, this is my first time
in the world of crime.

111
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:39,561
And no matter what,
I will always

112
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,761
remember it fondly.

113
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,921
You are an enthusiast.

114
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,561
And this world needs people like you.

115
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,401
I hope that when you get out of prison.
fully rehabilitated,

116
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,201
you'll help the country progress.
Because the truth is that...

117
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,081
Where did it happen?
What?

118
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,641
The first time you made love.

119
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,121
In a... In a tent.

120
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:07,321
That's wonderful.
That's a good place

121
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:11,401
for the first time.
The sounds of the countryside, the lights...

122
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:13,881
Yes, that's right.

123
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,961
The rest was, let's say...
experimental.

124
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,041
and... And brief.

125
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:26,201
Well, Profesor,
I'm calling to inform you

126
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,801
that Silene Oliveira
is going into

127
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:31,921
provisional custody without bail
tonight.

128
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,161
What did she say
to make you angry

129
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,481
and skip
the 72-hour custody?

130
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,361
She was trying to be smart.

131
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:41,961
But there's something I don't get.
Why do you let go

132
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:43,961
of your people instead of the hostages?

133
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:47,641
There have been
discrepancies in the group. Nothing else.

134
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,281
You're against the ropes, Profesor.
And you know it.

135
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,561
I admit you're winning,
but this is only one battle,

136
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,721
It's nothing
compared to the war.

137
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,361
He still teases you,
with a riot on his hands.

138
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,281
- He is a rock star.

139
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:31,321
Salva, how are you?
How are you holding up?

140
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,881
Well, I never thought
tying my shoelaces

141
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,721
could be this painful.

142
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,601
It's-it's clear that those bruises
could use some care.

143
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,081
A nurse.

144
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,801
It is a very suggestive proposal.

145
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:52,241
I would really love to take care of you,
but it would have to be at my place,

146
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,081
because I want to see my daughter.
And I understand that it's not

147
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,921
the most romantic date.

148
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:59,081
I can't think of a better date
for tonight.

149
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:00,721
All right.

150
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,241
When you spend years
obsessing about something,

151
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,521
that something is your whole world,
a perfect world.

152
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:18,001
But now the plan
was no longer the Profesor's,

153
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,721
It belonged to all of us.

154
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,441
And we were screwing it up.

155
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,601
For once, the Profesor felt
weakened.

156
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,681
and crawling
into Raquel's arms

157
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,201
seemed like the best refuge.

158
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,161
The only one possible.

159
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,081
Now you're a hostage too.

160
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,641
- What's the matter?

161
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:10,441
- They tried to kill me,
They almost did.

162
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,441
- Why did they want to kill you?

163
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,441
- They turned Tokio in.

164
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,321
And I was going to turn myself in too.

165
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,921
- Alison.
Leave her.

166
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,681
She has lost her mind.
If Tokio shows up,

167
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,721
who knows what could happen.
She won't,

168
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,441
You heard him,
she's been kicked out.

169
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:41,281
What Alison's doing.
could actually be good.

170
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,321
Good for what?
To get out, damn it!

171
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,641
For good.

172
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,801
Is it that hard
to understand?

173
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,641
They have locked up our colleagues

174
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:54,201
when they had promised them
freedom.

175
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,561
Some of us
have been truly humiliated.

176
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,561
They've ruined my relationship

177
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,161
And my future paternity.

178
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:07,761
And about the money
that they had promised us

179
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,441
for staying in this hell...

180
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,481
It's all a lie.

181
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,321
A fucking sham, he confirmed it.

182
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,401
How long are we going to stay
and do nothing?

183
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,201
The thieves
are weakened now.

184
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:27,841
No one can argue.
And if we don't take seize

185
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,641
this opportunity now,
we'll be letting them escape.

186
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:34,081
We have to finish them off.
Muster up all dignity,

187
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:37,801
the courage, that wild animal
we carry inside and...

188
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:42,201
We must do something, I don't know,
steal a gun from them.

189
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,041
What are you saying, Arturo?

190
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:47,041
Where are we going to get
a gun?

191
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,041
- Swapping one of theirs
for a fake one.

192
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,561
If you manage to get
one of the fake weapons,

193
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,281
you could swap it.

194
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:01,241
Then one of them
will be unarmed.

195
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,961
And one of you armed.

196
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,001
Oh, hello, honey.

197
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,561
- Mom, what are you doing here this late?
- Mommy.

198
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:17,161
- Sweetheart, come here, come here.

199
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,561
Oh.

200
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:24,081
But wait a minute. Tell me,
what are you doing up so late?

201
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:27,321
- I wanted to see you before going to bed.
- Me too, baby.

202
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:34,081
- Hello.

203
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:35,881
Hello.

204
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,001
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have made dinner.

205
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:43,281
Because you've come for dinner, haven't you?
- Yes. Well, dinner

206
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,681
and sleep actually. Right?

207
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,201
- Are you dating?

208
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,361
- Oh, dear..

209
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,001
Well, uh...

210
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:59,001
Yes, right? Kind of.

211
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:04,201
But have you asked her?
No, not really,

212
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:09,201
but we have kissed,
which is almost the same.

213
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:10,801
Oh, okay.

214
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:14,441
- Come on, Paulita, honey, let's go.
Come on, you've got school tomorrow.

215
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,841
Let's go to bed.
No, don't worry.

216
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:17,961
I'll tuck her in.

217
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:35,281
Thank you.

218
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:44,561
Did you really hit him?

219
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,481
Well...

220
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:54,841
Yes, I did.

221
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:59,601
Honestly, it infuriated me.
to think

222
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:00,721
he'd hurt you.

223
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,401
I don't like violence,
Never have.

224
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,561
I know it's wrong
and you can

225
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,561
defend yourself.
It's not my business, but...

226
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:09,721
Salva.

227
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,441
I'm glad
you hit

228
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:16,321
the jerk of my ex-husband,
I should have done it myself.

229
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:20,081
Even if it's
politically incorrect to say so.

230
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,361
Well,

231
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,601
Sometimes what's wrong
is the only choice.

232
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,321
I'm speaking from experience.

233
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:44,601
I'm glad you're here.

234
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,521
Well, from now on.
I need everybody.

235
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:41,041
closing bags, non-stop.
He won't say anything about lies.

236
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,521
Arturo, drop the Gandhi crap
or you'll eat shit for breakfast,

237
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,241
lunch and dinner.

238
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,761
- And besides, I can assure you
that I have not lied to anyone.

239
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,801
- Nairobi is in charge now,
so everybody

240
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:02,281
get packing!

241
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,321
Nairobi has a heavy hand
for a woman.

242
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:16,521
- Berlín, we're sinking.

243
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,801
So I believe
that the most important thing right now

244
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:23,921
is that we all get out of here alive.
and without making any more mistakes.

245
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:34,441
You tell me.
Are you with me or against me?

246
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:40,441
- Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

247
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:44,601
catch a tiger by the toe.

248
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:54,281
Well, I'm going with you, Nairobi.
Until the end.

249
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,441
- Ah.

250
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,721
- I will abide by your coup d'etat.
- Ah.

251
00:17:57,881 --> 00:18:01,561
- And I have to confess
that I am turned on

252
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:04,401
at the idea of serving
to a woman who is a goddess.

253
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,481
- Well, you better.
pray to this goddess,

254
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:09,081
because she has your morphine,
Don't forget.

255
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:14,241
That's the office
where they keep the bag

256
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,641
with the fake guns.
So?

257
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:18,041
So one of us
has to get there.

258
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,681
and get a blank gun.

259
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:23,081
And which one of them
will you switch with?

260
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:26,721
Denver.

261
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:29,081
He's the dumbest one.

262
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:33,881
Who's going to take his gun?
Must be Mónica.

263
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,001
When he calls her in
for treatment.

264
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:39,401
And why would she do something like that?
It is a suicidal risk.

265
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,921
Because that punk
shot her.

266
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,561
He's put her in a den
and he took advantage of her fear

267
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:51,481
and desperation
to screw her a few times.

268
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,961
And apparently,
now he left you?

269
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:01,241
Yes..

270
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,401
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:07,841
But that's what happens.

272
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:13,201
Sometimes we feel like changing our lives,
we get our hopes up.

273
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,561
But no heist man
will take you with him.

274
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,721
All right,
I'll go get the gun.

275
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:28,681
Do you have the copies of the
office keys?

276
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:31,961
Oh.

277
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,561
- What is Plan Chernobyl?

278
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,641
- The Plan Chernobyl is a desperate plan,

279
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,481
but very beautiful. It consisted in releasing the cash

280
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:45,201
in balloons from the roof, popping the balloons with gunfire

281
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:48,321
and causing some wonderful rain. Call ingthe media,

282
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,721
radios, television...
- That is to say,

283
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,201
like the Christmas Pageant parade, but with 50 euro bills.

284
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:56,401
- Is that the Plan Chernobyl?
- Thousands of people

285
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,201
picking up the dough,
spreading chaos among the police.

286
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:02,721
Imagine, a billion euros falling from the sky.

287
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:05,961
- And us vanishing amongst the frenzied mob.

288
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:09,481
Very nice.

289
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,841
- You know the Profesor is an idealist,

290
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:14,761
He cares more about the message than the money.

291
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,561
And I didn't say anything
because we must respect the timing.

292
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,721
Wish me luck.

293
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:54,961
Mr. Torres, in my office!

294
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:15,841
Come in, Mr. Torres.

295
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:20,241
Let's see, could we increase the printing rate?

296
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:25,361
- Well, it's possible, but it would be very risky.

297
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,041
to fix it.

298
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:33,561
- Calculate the production rate increase.

299
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:35,321
- All right, Miss Nairobi.

300
00:21:57,961 --> 00:21:58,921
Don Arturo?

301
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:03,361
Get up. Get up, Torres, God damn it, get up.

302
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,361
But what are you doing? None of your business.

303
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,761
Act like I'm not here. Walk to the door.

304
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:09,961
and don't lock it.

305
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,641
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to report you.

306
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:15,841
If they find out I saw you, I'l be in trouble too.

307
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:18,641
Look, you jerk,

308
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:23,161
I have a gun. And if you think of giving me away,

309
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:25,841
the first bullet has your name on it,
do you understand?

310
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:28,641
Excuse me, Mr. Arturo,
but that's one of the fake guns,

311
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:30,961
you left the bag open.

312
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:39,081
Listen, because I won't say it again.

313
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:42,041
When all this is over, and I assure you, it will,

314
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:44,641
at best, a couple of hours,
you're gonna come back here,

315
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:47,201
to your crappy job.

316
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:51,121
And I'll be waiting for you the next day

317
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:55,081
with a fat layoff and a disciplinary file

318
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,161
that will make you shit yourself.
You'll be fucked

319
00:22:57,321 --> 00:22:59,281
until you retire, do you understand?

320
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:02,241
You have three daughters, don't you?

321
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:05,801
And two of them are unemployed,

322
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,761
seven years, if if I recall correctly.

323
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:13,121
So it's up to you. Torres.

324
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,161
Miss Nairobi.
- What is it?

325
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:24,081
- We would increase production
by two million every hour.

326
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,441
- Do it. And the technical stops

327
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,841
will be every six hours, because that's

328
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,841
an extra two million.
- All right.

329
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:39,481
I'll get this off the ground. Mark my words.

330
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,801
Are you worried about something?

331
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:30,241
No.

332
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:37,561
I'm worried it's been the best night of my life.

333
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:48,481
Salva, you've already won me over, you don't need to exaggerate.

334
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,641
It's true.

335
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:54,481
I just wasn't planning on it,

336
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:55,641
I hadn't anticipated it.

337
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,241
Ah, you hadn't anticipated it.

338
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,201
Do you anticipate everything?

339
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,881
Well, let's just say...

340
00:25:16,201 --> 00:25:20,721
That I'm a man who chooses
the clothes he's going to wear.

341
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:21,961
the day before.

342
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:29,841
A man who became obsessed with...

343
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:34,081
With making the best cider in the world.

344
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:40,201
And I studied everything, I studied acidity,

345
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:41,721
fermentation...

346
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,881
Every possible reaction of every ingredient.

347
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:53,121
Year after year after year.

348
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,761
And you can get a bad apple

349
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,041
that ruins the whole barrel.

350
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:04,561
Salva, you're really into cider, aren't you?

351
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,841
It was my father's dream.

352
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:12,081
And...

353
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,801
he died before he could fulfil it.

354
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:21,481
...He wanted to make...

355
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,361
2400 barrels.

356
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:31,681
I understand, I understand the homage, but I don't know,

357
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,721
Why don't you make half? Or half of half.

358
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:39,761
And then focus on your own dreams.

359
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:52,961
Let's go away.

360
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,601
I wrap up this cider thing in a few days

361
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:04,361
and we'll go to the Caribbean.

362
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:17,281
Well, I don't have the cider,

363
00:27:17,441 --> 00:27:21,201
but I have a mother and a daughter.

364
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,161
And a heist to solve. Well, look, we take your mother

365
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:28,201
and your daughter and we'll take them with us.

366
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:31,241
Can't you imagine raising
your daughter on a sunny beach?

367
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:36,561
Raquel.

368
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,321
Raquel, I don't want this to wear off.

369
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,801
I don't want to ignore this... This desire

370
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,641
to feel alive that I've never felt so strongly.

371
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,801
You would cross the ocean with a mother,

372
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:04,801
a daughter and a grandmother?

373
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:07,801
Right now, I would.

374
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:12,841
I have a plan B.

375
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,441
Damn...

376
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,201
It is so crazy that...

377
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:27,881
that...

378
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,441
I can't imagine myself doing anything else.

379
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,201
Finish the heist, do what you have to do.

380
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,601
And then we go.

381
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:02,401
Okay. Okay?

382
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:03,881
Okay. Okay.

383
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:30,681
Everybody listen up!
We're going to solve this heist

384
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:32,921
in 24 hours and get back to our lives,

385
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,921
We've neglected them enough.

386
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:37,601
Suárez, call Chief Sanchez.

387
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:39,601
I won't even let anyone else get killed,

388
00:29:39,761 --> 00:29:41,881
destroyed or caught.

389
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,081
Nairobi, listen, coming as far

390
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,001
as you have is already epic,

391
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,041
so I give you my most sincere congratulations.

392
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:51,161
Listen, I'm going to take you out there.

393
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,081
before they catch you all.

394
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,761
Get Lobo and the rest of the UCO here.

395
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,281
- What are you thinking about?
- I'm starting to think

396
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:01,641
that the man out there is the real brains

397
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,681
of this operation. He drew a trail

398
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:06,521
of clues to lead us to the estate in Toledo.

399
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,321
but I think I know how to catch him.

400
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:11,281
First we'll get the hostages
out of the basement.

401
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:13,641
Well, thank you, because
we don't have enough people

402
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,921
to watch over the hostages. And besides,
we promised them freedom,

403
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,481
So let them have it. We'll release them,

404
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,001
but give me an hour. It's a very big spectacle.

405
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:24,961
for such a small audience.

406
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,161
Yes?

407
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:43,121
I'm going to release 11 hostages

408
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:47,121
under one condition, I want a reporter

409
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,601
and a camera to cover the news from the inside,

410
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:50,841
Live news feed.

411
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,801
Look, I'd like to help with your propaganda,

412
00:30:54,961 --> 00:30:57,961
but I can't force any civilian to go in there,

413
00:30:58,121 --> 00:30:59,921
You know that very well.
- It's true.

414
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:03,081
You're absolutely right, Inspector.

415
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,761
But you don't have to force anyone,
you just have to suggest it.

416
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,721
I'm sure many reporters

417
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:12,321
will volunteer for an interview like that.

418
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:15,921
I'll think about it. Of course. Think about it.

419
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:19,441
But remember, I record these conversations

420
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:22,681
and the last time you refused to release hostages...

421
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,001
it wasn't taken very well by the public.

422
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:29,601
But of course, take your time.

423
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,721
Son of a bitch.

424
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,001
- Oh, God.

425
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:46,761
Well, let's talk about something else.
How can I explain...

426
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,641
Do you like soccer?

427
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,681
- Oh yes, Profesor, in my country soccer is big.

428
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:58,161
Then imagine a soccer match.
- Again with soccer?

429
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:00,641
But a World Cup match.

430
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:04,241
and it's playing Brazil against Cameroon.

431
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,841
Who wins? Easy...

432
00:32:06,001 --> 00:32:09,801
Or rather, who do you want to win?

433
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,681
I'd say Brazil wins.

434
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:15,641
But I'd root for Cameroon, for sure. Cameroon.

435
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,521
Yes, Cameroon.

436
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,681
- Cameron all the way.

437
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:22,481
Look, instinctively human beings

438
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:26,801
always, always side with the weaker one.

439
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,601
The underdog.

440
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:31,521
So if we show the world

441
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:34,761
our weaknesses, our wounds,

442
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:38,641
that we're on the verge of surrendering,

443
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:43,161
It will produce a shudder.

444
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,161
If you're not Brazilian, I think any guy in the world

445
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:48,961
would go with Cameroon. Even some Brazilians guys.

446
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,961
Or Brazilian girls.
Yes, or Brazilian girls.

447
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:53,321
Okay, gentlemen. To Cameroon.

448
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,441
- How does that soccer chant go?

449
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:58,041
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

450
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:01,561
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

451
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,641
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

452
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,161
Cameroon, Cameroon, Cameroon!

453
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,201
Let's move on to Plan Cameroon.

454
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,681
We're gonna release the hostages
we have in the basement.

455
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:17,921
and we're going to get a reporter
and a camera to record it.

456
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,441
We're gonna need someone to be interviewed.

457
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:25,201
And my suggestion is you, Río.

458
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,681
I understand your anger, but we need you.

459
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,561
You can do it without a mask,
you are empathetic...

460
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,681
- You think I'll go out on TV?

461
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:37,841
For Tokio to see me from jail,

462
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:40,681
with a smile doing an interview

463
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:42,961
as if nothing had fucking happened here?

464
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:47,001
Now I'm a hostage. Don't count on me for anything.

465
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,881
- Fuck it, I'll do it, I'm a natural crybaby.

466
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,081
and you can tell just by looking.

467
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,721
- You're no crybaby. You make others cry.

468
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:05,121
I'll do it. If there is not much to talk about,

469
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:06,481
I'll do it.

470
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:11,001
- Could be, but no.

471
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,801
I'll do it with a mask.

472
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:20,401
- With a mask?

473
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,641
On a live interview?

474
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:27,281
But what are we now, ETA?

475
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:30,641
From the Jihad?

476
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:35,321
No, no. This interview has to be done

477
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:39,121
open-faced, so all of Spain

478
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,761
can feel our eyes,

479
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:44,801
our breath,

480
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,801
so that they can understand the pain.

481
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:49,561
And a little bit of the sorrow.

482
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:53,681
- Right. You want to do it.

483
00:34:57,281 --> 00:34:59,521
But you know what the problem is?

484
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:02,921
If there's someone who I've never seen

485
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,001
feel sorrow or pain, it's you, Berlín.

486
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:10,281
- Tokio's gone-- and Río doesn't want to do it.

487
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,201
Don't look down on someone who 's good at his job,

488
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,321
Nairobi

489
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:17,841
I can be a good master of ceremonies.

490
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:20,761
- He's right, he's good at acting.

491
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:29,041
- All right, you'll do it.

492
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:36,361
An interview in exchange for releasing

493
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:40,161
11 hostages...
I don't know, it's more justifiable, isn't it?

494
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,401
We'll be criticised on every front,

495
00:35:42,561 --> 00:35:44,561
but we have to accept it.

496
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:46,521
- Well, let's take the credit

497
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,041
and sell it as a display of transparency.

498
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,721
- You can sell it however you want,
Prieto, but what about the other thing?

499
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:56,001
The operation you want to set up in the hospital.

500
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:58,481
In exchange of what, on what evidence Raquel?

501
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:01,681
A plate of fresh anchovies?
- On the evidence that they have

502
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:04,641
a guy outside who keeps messing with us.

503
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,761
Ángel caught him and they tried to kill him,

504
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:08,361
it wasn't an accident.
- Inspector,

505
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,521
we have all read the forensic report

506
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:12,521
on the accident and there's no evidence

507
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:14,401
of an attempted homicide.

508
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:17,401
We can't forget he was driving
under the influence of alcohol.

509
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:20,521
- Do you want evidence? Let's set up the operation.

510
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:23,841
Let me leak to the press that Ángel, the only one

511
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:26,041
who knows who he is, will wake up from his coma.

512
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:29,041
And I assure you,
before five in the afternoon.

513
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:31,521
that guy will be in the hospital

514
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:34,081
to kill him. But we'll be there to catch him

515
00:36:34,241 --> 00:36:36,281
like cat and mouse.
- You're asking me

516
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,201
to fill an entire hospital with undercover agents

517
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:41,521
like some police comic strip?

518
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,921
- We should focus our efforts here,

519
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:46,921
on the factory. What about the reporters who are coming in,

520
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,041
What if they end up hostages too?
- That interview

521
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:51,201
It's nothing more than a smokescreen, another trick.

522
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,881
to waste our time.

523
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:57,121
Chief, let us for once

524
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,001
be the ones who we set them up.

525
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,641
- Can't you do it with ten?

526
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:05,961
- 20.

527
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:17,401
Mónica Gaztambide, you're up for the treatment.

528
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:27,761
Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

529
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,441
If you take off the jumpsuit,
maybe I can treat you.

530
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,521
Do you mind turning around?

531
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,001
Since we aren't together anymore, right?

532
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,441
Ha.

533
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:12,521
No problem.

534
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,961
Can I? Wait.

535
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:54,921
Now.

536
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:16,641
How's the wound?

537
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,081
It hurts a lot.

538
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:22,001
And it stings.

539
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:36,521
We'll get only chance. And I want him alive,

540
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:40,201
No one fires unless under extreme danger.

541
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:45,041
The first thing we're gonna do is taking Ángel

542
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:48,641
to a safe place. To do this, we will set up

543
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:50,521
another room on a different floor.

544
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:53,761
Once he's relocated, we'll leak the news.

545
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:56,201
of his recovery and the target will soon

546
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,761
be on the move. By that time

547
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,761
it will be essential that everyone is in position.

548
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:04,281
I want each of you to get deep into the role.

549
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:08,081
This is a very complex operation,
so we're going to need

550
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,721
extreme concentration.

551
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:13,881
We'll have access to
the closed-circuit surveillance cameras.

552
00:40:14,841 --> 00:40:17,161
I don't want anybody from security on the floor,

553
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:20,641
not even the hospital's security,
no police cars in the vicinity either.

554
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,401
Let's get that motherfucker a fucking red carpet.

555
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:26,041
into Ángel's room, where, instead,

556
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:28,201
Lobo will wait for him. And Agent Valmaseda

557
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:29,801
will take Mari Carmen's place.

558
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,761
They'll be there ready for a welcome surprise.

559
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:35,761
And remember, we're looking
for a middle-aged male.

560
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:39,841
- There'll be 20 agents and he'll be alone,
it's very difficult for him to escape.

561
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:06,241
Did you get it?

562
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:13,441
Here.

563
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:22,441
It's... It's loaded.

564
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:26,041
It's- It's loaded.
Stop packing the fucking bills.

565
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,001
and stash what you can. We're out of here.

566
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,161
Here, stash them.

567
00:41:31,801 --> 00:41:32,761
Here you go.

568
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,041
Quick.

569
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:37,201
We're going now, this has lasted too long.

570
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:38,681
Fuck that.

571
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,081
Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

572
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:55,721
Fifth day of the heist: one hostage
and two police officers wounded.

573
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:58,801
An explosion, hostages escaped.

574
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:03,161
And now Channel 6 cameras are about to enter the place

575
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,001
that the whole world is watching.

576
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:08,321
- Reporters are heading for the entrance.

577
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,841
- And remember, Cristina, the historical impact

578
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:14,361
of this moment. Hundreds of television channels

579
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:15,481
all over the world are broadcasting our signal.

580
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:17,681
- Cover them until securing entry.

581
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,201
- The first time a television crew

582
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:21,321
goes live on...

583
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:23,761
- They're opening doors. Attention, guards.

584
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:26,161
Stop at the bottom of the stairs as requested.

585
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:29,081
- Special at the Royal Mint, a crucial moment.

586
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:32,801
In less than a minute we'll witness something historic,

587
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:35,321
a reporter and a cameraman from the Channel Six.

588
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:38,761
will enter the site of the heist.
That's as far as the police can go,

589
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:42,281
From this point, on the reporter and the camera

590
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:44,281
will be on their own, unprotected.

591
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:48,161
We've never seen such a thing,
all over the country the streets

592
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,481
are empty.

593
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:16,041
Return to your posts.

594
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:19,241
Hello, good morning.
- Good morning.

595
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:22,281
- I am Andrés de Fonollosa,
thank you very much for being here.

596
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:24,761
- Can you put this on, please?
- Yes.

597
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,361
- We're already getting the signal, we're going live.

598
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:32,121
Inside the factory.

599
00:43:32,801 --> 00:43:34,681
- Mr. Fonollosa, I have to ask you

600
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:37,241
why you've allowed a team of journalists

601
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:38,801
to broadcast live.

602
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:43,121
- This is a turning point for all of us

603
00:43:43,281 --> 00:43:46,081
in here and we needed you here

604
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:48,361
to record it and to make it public.

605
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:50,281
Please come with me. This way.

606
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:53,801
- That's Andrés de Fonollosa, a familiar face

607
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:57,961
to the police. Bank robber, informer
and convicted for human trafficking.

608
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:02,161
- These are the 11 hostages
who are finally to be released.

609
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:06,401
- There they are. I recognize... Manuel García,

610
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,481
Alfonso Martínez and María Cornejo.
It looks like they are going to be released for real.

611
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:14,721
- We're all a little nervous.
- Medical services ready.

612
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:17,721
- like kids waiting for the school bell to ring.

613
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:20,201
I want to thank you all.

614
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:25,921
For the courage and bravery you have shown.

615
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,001
And...

616
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:32,761
You in particular, you and your child.

617
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:36,801
You've proven to be a very strong woman.

618
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,641
- Why have you decided now,

619
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:43,921
after five days of captivity, to release hostages?

620
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,961
- Five days.
It's hard to believe it's been just a few days,

621
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:49,081
Right?

622
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:54,441
You see

623
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,921
We have to confess it's...
it's a very hard time.

624
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:03,041
for us, the situation is critical.

625
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:07,041
We have no choice but to surrender,

626
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:09,081
that's why you're here.

627
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:17,721
This gesture is the beginning
of the end for everyone.

628
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:20,721
Helsinki

629
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,641
It's time, you can go.

630
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:30,441
Thank you.

631
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:40,961
- Snipers ready. Assault Team One,

632
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,921
keep your distance.
- Copy that.

633
00:45:52,961 --> 00:45:55,201
We're going to release hostages in order to negotiate

634
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:58,001
a more favorable surrender for our interests.

635
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:00,121
- Have you made the decision to surrender?

636
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:02,521
- We are aware that we've lost.

637
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,601
Open the doors!

638
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:13,001
- 11 released, we're watching it live.
- They're coming out.

639
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:16,041
- Finally some good news at
the Fábrica de Moneda.

640
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,201
There they are, it's an exciting moment.

641
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,881
Looks like the heist men are giving in.
But there are more headlines,

642
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:27,041
big one. Fonollosa has admitted

643
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,881
that the situation is critical,
that they have no choice but to surrender.

644
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:36,681
His literal words were:
"This is the beginning of the end

645
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,721
and we are aware that we have lost."

646
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:44,961
I don't know if you've ever seen a corpse.

647
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,561
For some of us it's the first time too.

648
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:55,041
You've come here to tell the truth.

649
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:58,161
Here it is, this is the truth.

650
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:01,321
We've been beaten,

651
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:07,161
we have been defeated.
It is important that you confirm it,

652
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:08,481
please.

653
00:47:12,401 --> 00:47:15,281
- Yes, he doesn't have a pulse, he's dead.

654
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:17,961
- The hostages who escaped hit him in the head,

655
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:19,761
He died within few hours.

656
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:22,881
It's possible that for the people, out there,

657
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,961
this man is no more than a thief.

658
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:31,401
But to us he was a companion and a friend.

659
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:35,001
No one prepares you for that, no one. It's one of the reasons

660
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:37,561
why we've decided to release hostages.

661
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:41,281
Some of us here thought

662
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,561
we weren't going to make it out alive, but, frankly,

663
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:44,961
I never thought it would be him.

664
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:48,041
- What do you mean, there were people in the group

665
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:51,401
willing to sacrifice themselves?
- No, no, no.

666
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:56,041
No, not at all. We're simple people,

667
00:47:56,721 --> 00:47:58,961
We have gone through hardship

668
00:48:01,201 --> 00:48:03,521
of all kinds, just like anyone else.

669
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,041
Including terminal illness.
And we've had

670
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:10,281
to take desperate action like this.

671
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:12,441
in order to leave something for our families.

672
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,161
Leave something to our loved ones.

673
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:23,441
Sorry..

674
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:34,881
As I matter of fact,
I have a degenerative disease.

675
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:36,401
called Herbert's myopathy.

676
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,521
The police knew it.

677
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:42,961
That didn't stop them from spreading lies about me.

678
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:46,761
And I want to tell you something. I may be a thief,

679
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:50,241
I've always been, I've robbed banks,

680
00:48:50,401 --> 00:48:53,241
I've robbed jewellery stores, robbed mansions...

681
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:55,321
But I've never sold anyone.

682
00:48:59,721 --> 00:49:01,601
I've never sold a woman.

683
00:49:02,881 --> 00:49:06,601
I'm not a pimp who traffics,

684
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:10,281
or rapes minors, I'm not.

685
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:14,161
Ask the police, when you leave,

686
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:16,241
in which files are these cases.

687
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:20,001
- Do you mean that the police
have lied to the public?

688
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,121
- The police lie.

689
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,041
They lie to the public.

690
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:28,721
They've lied to my friends,

691
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:31,161
They've soiled my family's name.

692
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,281
I'm a thief.

693
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:43,201
But I have every right in the world not to be defamed.

694
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:49,081
I have the same right as anyone to die in peace.

695
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,481
And with dignity.

696
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:57,921
I can't go on with... Cut, please.

697
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:01,681
"That morning we were
a trending topic worldwide,

698
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:05,041
people went silent in cafeterias and taxis."

699
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:07,241
Fonollosa says the police are lying,

700
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:10,521
that they have been lying about his past.

701
00:50:11,161 --> 00:50:13,241
And dares them to come up with legal files.

702
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:16,881
"We were the Cameroon team
barefoot against Brazil.

703
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,881
and everyone wanted us to win."

704
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:21,441
We're now going to our news colleagues,

705
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,281
Cristina Saavedra, go ahead.
- Breaking newsr:

706
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:27,161
Deputy Inspector Ángel Rubio
could awake from his coma.

707
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:31,001
He was kept in an induced coma
after a traffic accident.

708
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:34,241
The Deputy Inspector suffered an accident

709
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,081
on road M-506, when his car crashed.

710
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:39,881
into a construction booth in one of the lanes,

711
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,521
causing it to roll over multiple times.

712
00:50:45,601 --> 00:50:48,721
Profesor, have you seen us on TV?
Nairobi, I want you all to be one,

713
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:51,041
like a rowing team, okay?

714
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:55,201
I want you to tell Río that
I'm going to get Tokio out of jail.

715
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:58,361
no matter what.
That is my Profesor, yes, sir.

716
00:50:58,521 --> 00:50:59,641
Put Berlín on.

717
00:51:01,121 --> 00:51:02,081
Berlín.

718
00:51:02,881 --> 00:51:04,001
- Me?

719
00:51:05,401 --> 00:51:06,521
- Yes.

720
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:11,961
- Thank you.

721
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,241
Yes?

722
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:22,201
Deputy Inspector Rubio
is waking from his coma.

723
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,961
What are the odds of that being true?

724
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:26,361
I don't know.

725
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,881
That's elementary police work:

726
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,761
Saying that he's waking from his coma

727
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,641
to lure you in.

728
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:36,161
That doesn't even work on sitcoms.

729
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:43,921
And if it isn't?

730
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:49,681
He's the only one who knows who I am,

731
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:52,281
the only loose end.
What room did they put him in?

732
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:53,921
Room 119

733
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:56,761
It's a trap.

734
00:51:57,401 --> 00:52:01,241
Yes, it's a 90% chance it's a trap.

735
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:05,441
Ninety-nine percent.

736
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:10,281
But are we going to leave
one percent to chance?

737
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:14,601
No, you'll have to make sure.

738
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:16,801
And if it isn't, finish him off.

739
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:22,921
Get into a hospital in which, surely,

740
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:25,401
there'll be 50 cops waiting for me.

741
00:52:27,361 --> 00:52:29,081
Sergio, think, damn it.

742
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:32,561
You spent half your childhood in a hospital.

743
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:36,081
What's the way to get into a trap
without getting caught?

744
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,481
knowing that the cavalry is waiting for you?

745
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:51,961
That would be

746
00:52:55,841 --> 00:53:00,241
by making the cavalry run away.

747
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:19,041
One moment of attention, please.

748
00:53:19,601 --> 00:53:24,401
Let's see, as you already know,
we've released your colleagues

749
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:26,721
who chose freedom, so here

750
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:30,321
no one has deceived anyone,
we have kept our promise.

751
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:32,041
The promise, my ass.

752
00:53:32,201 --> 00:53:35,401
And likewise, I swear that the million euros

753
00:53:35,561 --> 00:53:38,321
will be sent to the addresses you gave us.

754
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,761
Lies and more lies.

755
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:43,361
We'll keep that promise too,
I give you my word.

756
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:41,041
Attention to all units, no one gets in

757
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:42,881
without identification.
- Copy that.

758
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,201
Hey, you.

759
00:54:52,721 --> 00:54:53,841
- A clown has entered

760
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:57,561
- Could be him in disguise.
- Another one is entering the E.R..

761
00:54:58,881 --> 00:54:59,841
- What the hell is this?

762
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:06,041
- There're more coming in.

763
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:08,161
- What's going on?

764
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:13,241
- I've been called too.

765
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:24,161
Get those people out of there.

766
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:27,881
You can't be here, get out

767
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:21,441
Who wants a funny crazy rabbit?

768
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:28,001
Inspector, they put out
an ad for a fake casting.

769
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:38,641
- Lobo, watch out, he may be inside the building.

770
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:01,761
- He's entering the room.

771
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:08,521
- What's going on, somebody talk to me!

772
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:22,761
- False alarm, it wasn't him.

773
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:50,721
Inspector, the TV interview.

774
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,241
- We've verified that

775
00:57:53,401 --> 00:57:55,681
there is no open case against Fonollosa

776
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:58,121
for human trafficking,
pimping or pedophilia.

777
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:00,361
For some sources the information leaked could be

778
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:03,241
part of a scheme orchestrated by the authorities

779
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:05,841
to reduce the popularity of the heist men.

780
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:09,041
The latest events, as well as the death
of one of the kidnappers,

781
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:12,201
has earned them the sympathy of the people.

782
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:23,641
You missed me. Let go.

783
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:31,601
Listen

784
00:58:32,841 --> 00:58:35,641
As soon as Helsinki leaves,
we take action, got it?

785
00:58:35,801 --> 00:58:36,961
Is it the right time?

786
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:40,041
I've got a gun here, he's got a blank gun,

787
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:41,481
What do you think might happen?

788
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:56,081
Either you tell him or I will.

789
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:58,321
- I'll tell him.

790
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:03,761
The Profesor will try to free Tokio.

791
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:20,401
Where are you going?

792
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:24,801
¡Eh! For fuck's sake.

793
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,561
Where the fuck are you going?

794
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,121
What's this, are we at recess?

795
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,921
Come on, everybody sit down.
And I suggest the same to you,

796
00:59:35,081 --> 00:59:37,761
I'm not in the mood. You know what?
I feel like breaking

797
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:40,841
some skulls. And yours is the best one to start.

798
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:46,441
Try my gun. See if you can relax.

799
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,401
Arturo.

800
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:52,521
Arturito.

801
00:59:53,201 --> 00:59:55,441
You've got a toy gun and
I've got a bad bad fucking temper.

802
00:59:55,601 --> 00:59:57,841
What are you doing? A toy pistol?

803
00:59:59,521 --> 01:00:01,961
No.., it doesn't look like it.

804
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:04,521
Why don't we test it?

805
01:00:05,641 --> 01:00:08,561
I'm gonna give you three seconds,
or so help me God.

806
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:11,841
Make it one. Three, two...

807
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:15,601
One.

808
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,201
Surprise.

809
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,321
Cheer up, Río.

810
01:00:29,081 --> 01:00:32,001
Because we can be a family again.

811
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:40,201
Turn around.

812
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,841
I said turn around.

813
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:47,521
Son of a bitch.

814
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,921
Come on, let's go.
Quick, Get moving.

815
01:00:56,161 --> 01:00:57,121
They're gonna escape

816
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,521
They're gonna escape.

817
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,441
- Who?
- The hostages.

818
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:06,761
Come on, come on, we don't have all day.

819
01:01:06,921 --> 01:01:08,121
Mónica, open the door.

820
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:12,321
Just don't fucking listen to him,
this guy's taking advantage of you.

821
01:01:12,481 --> 01:01:14,561
Don't open the door!

822
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:17,961
Shut up or you'll get a shot, champ.

823
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,681
Don't listen to him,
open the door and we'll get out of here.

824
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:35,521
Let's go.

825
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:46,161
What's going on? It does not open.

826
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:49,841
Fuck, those motherfuckers must have blocked the door!

827
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:52,161
It was me.
Get back.

828
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:54,241
Arturo, put the gun down.

829
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,201
Drop the gun.

830
01:01:57,401 --> 01:02:00,441
- Arturito, I know you love movies

831
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:02,521
but this is getting out

832
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:04,601
of hand.
Another step and I'll shoot him.

833
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:06,481
I may not get out of here alive,

834
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:08,561
but I'll make sure he never smiles again.

835
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:10,241
Berlín, Berlín, calm down.

836
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:16,681
Open the door for me!

837
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,641
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

838
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:20,361
Take it easy.

839
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:23,881
Let's talk like civilized people.

840
01:02:24,561 --> 01:02:27,721
Let him go and if you want to get out,
I'll help you.

841
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:30,081
Open the door for me now.

842
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:35,041
No one's opening any doors here.

843
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:39,281
You really don't think so?
Look, I'll count to five

844
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:40,721
and then I'll shoot him.

845
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:44,121
I have nothing to lose and I don't give a shit.

846
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,001
So it's up too you.

847
01:02:46,561 --> 01:02:51,401
Five, four, three, two, one...

848
01:03:17,241 --> 01:03:20,321
But how could he have found out?
- He wore a GoPro camera.

849
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:22,441
controlled from a distance.
- Bastard

850
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:24,401
- We're trying to trace the signal.

851
01:03:24,561 --> 01:03:26,161
- It's no use, it's too late.

852
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:28,361
We've been deceived again.

853
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:30,481
- What is clear is that you were right,

854
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:33,241
That son of a bitch tried to kill Ángel.

855
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:35,481
- So Ángel must have come very close

856
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:36,961
to get that evidence.

857
01:03:37,121 --> 01:03:39,561
- It's possible they were even face-to-face.

858
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:45,681
- You'll forgive me, but I'm exhausted.

859
01:04:09,161 --> 01:04:11,561
"Leave your message after the signal."

860
01:04:12,321 --> 01:04:16,441
Salva, it's Raquel. I'm going to have a coffee.

861
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:20,641
at Hanoi, If you feel like it.
I could really use someone to talk to.

862
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:00,961
Antonio.

863
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:03,081
- Here, they left me an envelope for you.

864
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:05,961
- Who?
- I don't know,

865
01:05:06,121 --> 01:05:08,121
it was here when we opened.

866
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:09,801
What can I get you?
- A beer.

867
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:38,601
How was your day?

868
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,641
Well, I take it that it's going well.

869
01:05:53,961 --> 01:05:55,681
No, it's been awful.

870
01:05:57,281 --> 01:06:00,321
I set up an operation so
I could leave tomorrow with you.

871
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:05,241
to these beaches, but it's been a disaster.

872
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:08,041
- What can I get you? The same.

873
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:10,841
Raquel.

874
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:14,401
Sooner or later, all this will end.

875
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:19,481
And then, you and I'll meet on a beach.

876
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,241
But you have to choose a place.

877
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,361
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
It's just that I haven't had time yet.

878
01:06:29,081 --> 01:06:30,041
Let's see.

879
01:06:31,281 --> 01:06:33,521
How about we choose it together?

880
01:06:33,681 --> 01:06:34,881
That sounds great.

881
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:38,521
Pick one. Such a responsibility.

882
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:39,881
Let's see, ah...

883
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:48,521
Palawan. Palawan.

884
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:50,441
Let's see.

885
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:53,601
What a wonder.
And where's this?

886
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:57,161
Palawan, yes.
It is an island in the Philippines.

887
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:02,841
It's southwest of the archipelago,
a little to the north.

888
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:07,601
of Borneo. It has 849 000 inhabitants,

889
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:11,561
more or less, and the capital is Puerto Princesa.

890
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:17,121
Ángel must have come too close
to get the evidence.

891
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:19,441
- It's possible they were even face-to-face.

892
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:22,801
- Have you investigated him? Because I have.
Have you done your damn job?

893
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,761
The best fine sandy beaches in the tropics.

894
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,241
You don't like the Philippines.

895
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,081
Oh.

896
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:46,601
This is a wonderful moment.

897
01:07:49,521 --> 01:07:50,561
Stand up!

898
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,521
You're gonna sting till your hands bleed!

899
01:07:55,961 --> 01:07:58,641
I want you to armor roads,
ports and airports.

900
01:08:00,561 --> 01:08:01,601
Take off your clothes.

901
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:04,401
This is for not killing when we had to.

902
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:05,681
Turn around.

903
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:07,961
Don't lie to me, I'll know.

904
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:09,961
Who do you think stole your gun?

905
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:12,561
- You don't understand.

906
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:17,641
What am I going to have to do to get you to respect me?

907
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:19,881
What am I gonna have to do?

908
01:08:23,081 --> 01:08:25,681
What did you do,
what the fuck did you do?

909
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:27,321
- It was her or us.

910
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:42,521
Attention, we activate Operation Cage!

911
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:47,561
Get down, get down, everybody!

912
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,921
Shoot the target!
- What's going on?

913
01:08:50,081 --> 01:08:51,041
Let's go!
