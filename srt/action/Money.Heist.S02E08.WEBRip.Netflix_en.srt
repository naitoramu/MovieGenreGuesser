1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,320
Look, Paula's markers,

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
with chewed up caps,
like you used to do.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,720
Thanks, Mom. Give me one.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,800
So, on the day of our first date
I arrived 25 minutes early.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
I called him and he said

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,600
he was heading out right then.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,600
See you soon.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,040
We met

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,160
here, at Hanoi.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,680
He walked there
and it only took five to seven minutes.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,240
Pity, for once you land a good guy...
Why do you want to know how long it took?

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,880
To know how far away
from the cafeteria he was.

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,400
DISTANCE WALKING 5 TO 7 MINS

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
500 MTS APPROX.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,280
In that time frame he could have
traveled 500 meters at best.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,280
More or less.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,080
his hideout

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,280
is in this area.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,520
He took one of these streets
to get to the cafeteria.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm sure one of the surveillance cameras
taped it.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,240
I have to narrow it down.
Give me another one.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,360
I'll get the recordings
from that area

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,080
to figure out the route he took.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Are you sure of this?

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,960
Mom,

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
I'll find him no matter what it takes.

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,360
Be careful, dear.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,760
We have a badly injured man.

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Three gunshots in the abdomen
and it's been a few hours.

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,120
Where is he?

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,560
I don't know how long
before I get him out.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,520
And listen,

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
the police are tracking me down.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,080
Is it safe for them?

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,880
They already know
and they agreed to their part.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
Yours would be ten million.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,960
I need abdominal laparotomy gear,

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,240
a medical ventilator
and surgical equipment.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
Can you get it?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
I'll take care of it.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,920
WEDNESDAY
09:36 AM

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,560
14 HOURS
SINCE THE SHOOTOUT

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
Good morning. Inspector Murillo.

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,320
I need the footage from the cameras
from October 23rd.

45
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,600
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

46
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,000
Bye.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,680
Thank you.

48
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,720
Did you find out anything yet?

49
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm starting to draw

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
the route he took to the cafeteria.

51
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Look, that narrows the area down

52
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,760
to this triangle.

53
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
If he went to Hanoi this way,

54
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640
His hideout is very close, in this area.

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
I have to go out again, mom.

56
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,840
The bulk of the calls were made
from this area.

57
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,560
So the Professor must have
used these streets.

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,880
Check the surveillance tapes
from this area.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,920
Get the judge to issue a warrant.

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,920
This is headquarters...

61
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,200
I told the kid.

62
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,520
Told him what?

63
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,600
What I did to you.

64
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,320
That I abandoned you
at that roundabout in Martorell.

65
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
I went back to that roundabout,

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,600
because...

67
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,480
I dreamed that you were
cleaning windshields

68
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,960
at that stop light.

69
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
I took the car

70
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,640
and drove.

71
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,880
Hours and hours,

72
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,880
because I wanted to fix

73
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
my mistake.

74
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
Don't speak.

75
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,480
-Rest.
-I showed your picture

76
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
to everyone who passed by.

77
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,280
And now...

78
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,040
your son...

79
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
told me he hates me.

80
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,840
Your son

81
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,600
adores you.

82
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,600
No matter what he says
in the heat of the moment.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
I know he doesn't hate you.

84
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
Well, I deserve it.

85
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
I took his mother from him.

86
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,200
No.

87
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,600
No, you did great.

88
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,880
You have a wonderful son.

89
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,760
Strong.

90
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,120
Noble.

91
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,040
And that...

92
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
that's thanks to you.

93
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,360
I did what I could, honey...

94
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,840
He came out a little nuts, didn't he?

95
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,960
I have never

96
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
been as happy

97
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
as the day I met you.

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,960
If I have to go to some place now,

99
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,160
I'd like it to be that one.

100
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,480
The village festival.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,280
And dance with you,

102
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,040
together

103
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
with the lights.

104
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,440
With the colorful lights.

105
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
I love you.

106
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,880
Forgive me.

108
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Forgive me.

109
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm so sorry.

113
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,400
-What are you doing?
-Listen!

114
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
Do you hear that?

115
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,760
It's them!

116
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,520
-It's them.
-How much is left?

117
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
30 or 40 centimeters.

118
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,640
Come on. Let's go!

119
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,200
Hey!

120
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
Hey!

121
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,280
Professor!

122
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,160
We're here!

123
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
They're here.

124
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
They're here!

125
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
Hey!

126
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
They're here!

127
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
They're right there!

128
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,880
One more!

129
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,160
One more!

130
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,520
Professor!

131
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,520
You're going to get ink on the wall, dear.

132
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,520
Mom,

133
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,120
where are your car keys?

134
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,680
That car hasn't been used
for a long time, dear.

135
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
Well, it's about time

136
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,800
we take it for a spin.

137
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,000
Professor!

138
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,560
Denver!

139
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,960
Monica, tell my father to hang in there.

140
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,040
We're almost there!

141
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,440
-Denver.
-We're almost done!

142
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,480
-Go back up.
-What?

143
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,480
-Go back up.
-Not now!

144
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,840
-Listen, Denver!
-I'm not...

145
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,840
-Denver!
-What?

146
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,000
Go back up.

147
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,920
You need to go back up, now.

148
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,680
I'm not going back up now.

149
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,480
Denver, stop!

150
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm not going back up now!

151
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,560
No!

152
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,240
We're so close, Monica.

153
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,880
I know. Listen.

154
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,880
You have to go back up, now.

155
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,040
Do you understand? Look at me.

156
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,760
If you don't go up now,

157
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,440
you'll regret it for the rest
of your life.

158
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,480
Go up.

159
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,920
Go up.

160
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,080
Hey!

161
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,040
Let's go.

162
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,600
Let's go.

163
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Let's go.

164
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,440
Let's go.

165
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,400
Let's go.

166
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,480
Come on!

167
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm here, papa.

168
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,680
Just hold a little longer
because we're going to make it.

169
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,120
Right, Rio? We're digging like crazy.

170
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,560
We already hear
the Serbs on the other side.

171
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,400
Don't worry.

172
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,440
Dad...

173
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,240
-What?
-That...

174
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,360
That thing I said about

175
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,600
hating you...

176
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I could never feel that for you.

177
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
I can't hate you, okay?

178
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,120
It's okay. Don't worry.

179
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
You did what you had to do with mom.

180
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,160
But I can't hate you.

181
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,520
Monica.

182
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,120
Yes?

183
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll give you 300 million if you keep him.

184
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,160
This guy's a headache.

185
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,880
I brought him here,

186
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,440
But...

187
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,640
now I'm going on vacation.

188
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,960
Of course I will.

189
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,720
Take care of him.

190
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,360
Gentlemen.

191
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,400
I haven't introduced myself.

192
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Agustin Ramos.

193
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,120
And it's been a pleasure.

194
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,960
I love you.

195
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,720
I love you too, papa.

196
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,480
So much.

197
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,200
And I'm not letting you go.

198
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,640
Rio, bring all the explosives
we have left.

199
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm blowing up that tunnel.

200
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,400
Don’t.

201
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,960
If you blow the tunnel

202
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,360
you'll bury us all.

203
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,720
But papa...

204
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,720
You have to carry on.

205
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,560
And remember...

206
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,120
-Remember what?
-"No rear-view mirrors".

207
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,400
Alright.

208
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,880
Alright.

209
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,080
But I don't know if I can...

210
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,320
I love you.

211
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,080
I love you too.

212
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,800
I love you too.

213
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,360
<i>It was for the absence of your lips</i>

214
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,560
<i>That I cried for the first time</i>

215
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,840
<i>And I cursed having met you</i>

216
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,600
<i>For not being able to stop loving you</i>

217
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,840
<i>You, my wife I wished to make</i>

218
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,840
<i>And without love, I searched for luck</i>

219
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
<i>I pulled out a gun</i>

220
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,080
<i>And fate brought death</i>

221
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,760
<i>Maria, my life, my love</i>

222
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,840
<i>I promised</i>

223
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,320
<i>That I'd return</i>

224
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,560
<i>But I will not return</i>

225
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,760
<i>I was caught by the police</i>

226
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,760
<i>Maria, my life, my love</i>

227
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,680
<i>I will not stop</i>

228
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,240
<i>Loving you</i>

229
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,560
<i>The hugs that I lost</i>

230
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,200
<i>You will not see me again</i>

231
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,080
All the shops in the area
said the same.

232
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,800
Inspector Murillo has seized footage

233
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,760
crucial for the investigation.

234
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Indisputable evidence
that she's collaborating in the heist.

235
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,880
Activate the intervention protocol.

236
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,560
Immediately.

237
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,360
Gather your best men.

238
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,400
What about the hostages?

239
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,800
And Alison Parker,
or the international protocol?

240
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
What about public safety?

241
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Colonel, they have large caliber guns,

242
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,040
entrances loaded with explosives.

243
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,960
The hostages wear jumpsuits
and masks, like the thieves.

244
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,600
Impossible to tell them apart.

245
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,800
It will be a bloodbath and you know it.

246
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,960
And what do you suggest?

247
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,240
Let them get away,
holding hands with Inspector Murillo?

248
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,880
Yes. Let them get out
and catch them outside.

249
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,480
Do you know where
public safety has led us?

250
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,960
You want me to tell you?

251
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,760
To us being the laughing stock.

252
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,320
Not only of Spain,
of the whole fucking world.

253
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,640
The world's newscasts follow this story

254
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,120
as if it were the World Cup.

255
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,840
Do you want to be on TV
with the headline:

256
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,520
"The idiots in the police
let an escaped prisoner re-enter

257
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,520
the Royal Mint factory
riding a motorbike".

258
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,920
A motorbike!

259
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,600
Do you like being the goddamn foo?

260
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,600
Excuse me...

261
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
I didn't ask for your opinion.

262
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
The government has given
the order to intervene.

263
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,400
They have been in there for 125 hours,

264
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,560
and if by chance they were to escape

265
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,040
it would be a disgrace to this country.

266
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,320
-Excuse me...
-What?

267
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,160
The State Prosecutor's Office
issued an arrest warrant

268
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,640
for Inspector Raquel Murillo.

269
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,680
She is under search and arrest.

270
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,320
Shall we close it?

271
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,440
Just like that?

272
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,120
We should...

273
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,960
say a few words or something.

274
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Our Father who art in Heaven,

275
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
hallowed be Thy name.

276
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in Heaven.

277
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,520
Thy Kingdom come.

278
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,680
What?

279
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,400
You skipped a part.

280
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,400
After "hallowed be Thy name"
comes "Thy Kingdom come."

281
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
What the hell does that matter?

282
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,200
If you're going to pray,

283
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
do it right.

284
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,800
You think God is checking
if you're saying it right?

285
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,560
Give us this day our daily bread.

286
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,240
And forgive us our debts,

287
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,160
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

288
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,040
And lead us not into temptation,

289
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,320
but deliver us from evil.

290
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,360
Amen.

291
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,840
<i>There are moments in life</i>

292
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,920
<i>where you should be able</i>
<i>to have a remote control</i>

293
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,840
<i>so you could stop it.</i>

294
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,320
<i>Even if just for five minutes.</i>

295
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,000
<i>But some things happen</i>
<i>with irreverent obscenity.</i>

296
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,400
<i>And there's nothing you can do.</i>

297
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,800
<i>On the one hand</i>

298
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,240
<i>we had just buried Moscow.</i>

299
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,040
<i>On the other,</i>

300
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,240
<i>we were opening the path to our freedom.</i>

HOUR 125 OF THE HEIST

304
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,880
-Where is he?
-In the warehouse.

305
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,400
I'm so sorry.

306
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm so sorry.

307
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,200
Come here.

308
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,120
The one with the phone.

309
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,160
Hello.

310
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,400
You can call her Stockholm if you want.

311
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,360
It can't be all tears, can it?

312
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,560
Go on then.

313
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,720
Go.

314
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,720
Nine hundred and eighty four

315
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
million euros.

316
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

317
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,800
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

318
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,880
Nine hundred and eighty four
million euros.

319
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,800
Yes.

320
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,680
Colonel, we are ready to go in.

321
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,920
Good.

322
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,680
There's news from the tunnel.

323
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,040
The GPR shows that they are
close to the sewer system.

324
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,600
We have a special operations unit
in the sewers.

325
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,680
<i>Entering the main drainage channel.</i>

326
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
<i>Target distance 300 meters north.</i>

327
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,840
<i>Copy that. Standing by.</i>

328
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,200
Suarez.

329
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,720
We'll carry out
this operation together.

330
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,880
We'll use an enveloping tactic,
flanking them to force them into the hole.

331
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,600
In other words, a fucking sandwich.

332
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,560
We'll push them from the inside

333
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,240
so that they come out and
catch them at the sewer bend.

334
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,040
They can't go back for cover.

335
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,560
We've got them in a mousetrap.

336
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,000
Now we have to find Inspector Murillo

337
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,320
and her little boyfriend.

338
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,560
Lieutenant.

339
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,240
Come on, go, go!

340
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
-Squadron!
-Sir!

341
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
Ready?

342
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,560
Yes, sir!

343
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,360
Everyone moving the money.

344
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,400
-We need to get out!
<i>-Very well.</i>

345
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,440
Assault units are
getting ready to come in.

346
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,440
<i>We'll get on it.</i>

347
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,120
We're already in.

348
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,600
Son of a bitch!

349
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,960
Helsinki this won't be the last
you hear from me, I swear!

350
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,080
When I get out
I'll sue the shit out of you,

351
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,760
for cruelty, torture

352
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,320
and crimes against humanity, motherfucker!

353
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,080
Little Arturo,

354
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
we're going to the tunnel.

355
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,080
Your very important mission. Yes?

356
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,720
It was fake.

357
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,360
It was fake.

358
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,880
Stand up.

359
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,960
Slowly.

360
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,760
Turn around!

361
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,240
Now you're coming to the station.

362
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,000
And don't fucking move
or this time I will shoot you.

363
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,680
You know why?

364
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,160
Because I've gone for a little walk
in the countryside

365
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,080
and I've had time to think and I regret

366
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,560
not shooting the biggest son of a bitch
that I ever came across in my life.

367
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,520
Raquel, please.

368
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm not killing you

369
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,280
because I want you 30 years in prison.

370
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,480
And there,

371
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,880
you get to ask whoever the fuck you want
what he's wearing.

372
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,960
Don't move.

373
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,800
Don't move.

374
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,080
Don't move!

375
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,480
Don't move!

376
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,720
Stay where you are!

377
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,840
MOSCOW. AGUSTIN RAMOS
DOS HERMANAS. MAY 1, 1964

378
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,360
He was born on Labor Day.

379
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,240
On every birthday since he started
working at the mine he said

380
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,400
all the arrangements
were made for his party.

381
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,560
A good picket.

382
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,640
And the rubber bullets were his gifts.

383
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,520
This year it was real bullets.

384
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
I guess if you're born on the wrong side,

385
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
you die on the wrong side.

386
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,760
What's your name?

387
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,080
-No, Monica.
-I need to know your name.

388
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,760
Because I'm leaving here with you.

389
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,560
Through the back door,
the tunnel, or holding a machine gun.

390
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,800
But I don't want to be away from you.

391
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,680
And if I have to learn to shoot,

392
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,640
I will.

393
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,440
Besides...

394
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
this child...

395
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,880
this child is going to need a father.

396
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,360
Come on, tell me your name.

397
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,760
Ricardo.

398
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,600
<i>This is the Underground Unit,</i>
<i>making our way down the sewers.</i>

399
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,760
<i>-What's that noise?</i>
<i>-Stay still.</i>

400
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,080
<i>It’s the metro. Line 6.</i>
<i>It's right above us.</i>

401
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
<i>Proceeding.</i>

402
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,440
Come on, people! Keep it up!

403
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,800
Let's make sure the magic lasts
until the very end!

404
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,880
In there, we'll have satellite
radio and video signal

405
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,160
in order to avoid frequency jammers.

406
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,120
<i>The bomb squad</i>

407
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,720
will open a gap in the cargo door.
300 grams of thermite explosive.

408
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
<i>You know what that means.</i>

409
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,120
<i>So Lobo, Ruiz,</i>

410
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,360
you'll provide cover fire, if necessary.

411
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,160
The rest of us will enter in line,
no one stays behind.

412
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,160
Come on, come on, come on!

413
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,240
Gentlemen,

414
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
there's going to be a ruckus in there,

415
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,080
so we'll have to be united.

416
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,240
Together!

417
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,120
Understood?

418
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,320
Yes, sir!

419
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,720
The only instructions

420
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,960
are not to open fire if they wear a mask.

421
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Of course, we will open fire
in response to anyone shooting at us.

422
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,600
The only instructions

423
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,400
are that there's no order for any of them
to come out alive.

424
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,880
Is that clear?

425
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,240
Is that clear?

426
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,520
Yes, sir!

427
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,400
We're ready, so let's go get them!

428
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,520
Go, go, go!

429
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,480
Rio,

430
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,720
-Rio, are you there?
<i>-Yes, Professor.</i>

431
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,000
-I encrypted the frequency.
-How long can it take to decode it?

432
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,920
Two hours.

433
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,360
Perfect.

434
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,960
<i>Set the explosive charges.</i>

435
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,520
Pass the intercom to Berlin.

436
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,480
<i>Right away.</i>

437
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,560
Hey.

438
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,080
Come, please.

439
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,920
What's the matter?

440
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,160
I don't feel well.

441
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
What's wrong?

442
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,960
I feel pain in my chest.

443
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,640
May be an anxiety attack.
Do you want a tranquilizer?

444
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,040
It would have been easier for me too
if none of this had happened.

445
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,800
It was the only

446
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,160
actual crack
in an otherwise perfect plan.

447
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,720
A plan no longer perfect. You know why?

448
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,960
Because even if this all goes well...

449
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,720
Even if it all goes well, I'll be...

450
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,080
I'll be fucked.

451
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,160
Because I won't ever see you again.

452
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,720
You think it was in my plans
to fall in love

453
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,160
with the inspector?

454
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,480
I don't want to hear more.

455
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,880
You don't want to hear?

456
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,160
Why don’t you want to hear, Raquel?

457
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
Because I'm a bad guy?

458
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,080
You've been taught
to see good and bad guys.

459
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,720
But what we're doing
is okay to you when other people do it.

460
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,280
In the year 2011,
the European Central Bank made 171

461
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,480
billion euros out of nowhere.

462
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,160
Just like we're doing.

463
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,880
Only bigger.

464
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,600
185 billion in 2012.

465
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,720
145 billion euros in the 2013.

466
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,960
Do you know where all that money went?

467
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,320
To the banks.

468
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,520
Directly from the factory

469
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,400
to the pockets of the rich.

470
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,360
Did anyone call

471
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,800
the European Central Bank a thief?

472
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,400
No.

473
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,880
"Liquidity injections",

474
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,000
they called it.

475
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,960
And they pulled it out of nowhere, Raquel.

476
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,040
Out of nowhere.

477
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,200
What's this?

478
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,760
This is nothing, Raquel. Paper.

479
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,760
It's paper, you see?

480
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,640
It's paper.

481
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,120
I'm making a liquidity injection,

482
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,160
but not for the banks.

483
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,880
I'm doing it here,

484
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,840
in the real economy.

485
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,440
With this group of...

486
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,160
of losers, which is what we are, Raquel.

487
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,120
To get away from it all.

488
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,480
Don't you want to get away?

489
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,280
Angel is calling you.

490
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Does this mean he woke up?

491
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,800
If he's awake, they're going to...

492
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,240
He'll talk and they will be here
in five minutes.

493
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,400
Okay,

494
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,720
I'm going to answer it.

495
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,160
And you'll speak.
But no nonsense, please.

496
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,120
Please.

497
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,760
You'll answer it

498
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
and you're going to verify

499
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,880
if he's awake, okay?

500
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,360
Please.

501
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,480
Please.

502
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
No, no! Don't answer it.

503
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,680
Don't answer it.

504
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,920
My phone is tapped.

505
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,880
Do you have another one?

506
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,040
Who is it?

507
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
Raquel.

508
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,400
Raquel Murillo.

509
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,040
<i>Angel woke up.</i>

510
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,400
<i>He didn't want us to call anyone</i>
<i>before he talked to you.</i>

511
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
I'll put him on.

512
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,240
<i>Raquel,</i>

513
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,000
how are you?

514
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,880
Don't worry,

515
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,280
come on.

516
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,320
Take it easy.

517
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
<i>Come on, Raquel.</i>

518
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,520
-How are you?
<i>-Me?</i>

519
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,960
So high I can't even feel my ass.

520
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,440
<i>Listen,</i>

521
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,440
I saw on the TV that you've...

522
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,360
you've been replaced in the investigation.

523
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,360
Yes.

524
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,680
Don't tell anyone I woke up, okay?

525
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,720
I need you to come see me first.

526
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Okay.

527
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,200
Colonel, we've picked up a phone call
to Murillo's number.

528
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,280
But there was no communication.

529
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,360
Locate the call immediately.

530
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,160
Get the owner and the antenna.

531
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,120
Now.

532
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,080
You have to let me go talk to Angel.

533
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,800
If I don't go, in 15 minutes
he'll tell the police where you are.

534
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,720
And I can stop him.

535
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,080
-It's your only chance...
-Please.

536
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,120
It's about your perfect plan
not falling apart.

537
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,720
Please, let me think.

538
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,320
There's nothing to think about.

539
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,440
Sergio.

540
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,720
I'm with you.

541
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,200
A minute ago you were screaming
and biting me like an animal.

542
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,480
Can I trust you?

543
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,040
Come.

544
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,680
Come closer.

545
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,680
