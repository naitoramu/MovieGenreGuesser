1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,835
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:04,468
For 5 years, I was stranded

3
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:06,898
on an island
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:08,447
survive.

5
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,149
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:12,685
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

7
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:14,704
You can
survive this.

8
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,790
To use the list
of names he left me

9
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,526
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

10
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:26,865
To do this, I must
become someone else.

11
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,539
I must become
something else.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,623
Previously on "Arrow"...

13
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,291
How am I supposed
to stay away from you

14
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:35,260
if you won't
stay away from me?

15
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:37,495
John Diggle. He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

16
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,797
I think I'm just beginning
to understand

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,132
the kind of man you are.

00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,051
Hey.

20
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,186
Oliver?

21
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,270
You're that vigilante.

22
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:47,975
Easy, Dig.

23
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,326
You were poisoned.

24
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:50,477
Son of a bitch.

25
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,196
Come on.

26
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:53,948
Come on.

27
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,452
I could have
taken you anywhere,

28
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,320
could have
taken you home.

29
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,123
I brought you here.

30
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,960
You really did lose your mind
on that island.

31
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:07,511
Found a couple things
along the way.

32
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:08,545
Like what,
archery classes?

33
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:09,713
Clarity.

34
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:15,185
Starling City is dying.

35
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,724
It is being poisoned
by a criminal elite

36
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:24,177
who don't care
who they hurt,

37
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,064
as long as they maintain their
wealth and power.

38
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,649
What are you gonna do,

39
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,818
take 'em all down
by your lonesome?

40
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,036
No.

41
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,857
Now, I want you
to join me.

42
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,027
Special Forces out of Kandahar.
It's perfect.

43
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,497
You're a fellow soldier.

44
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:46,050
Oliver,
you're not a soldier.

45
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,218
You're a criminal.

46
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,388
And a murderer.

49
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,750
Where were you?

50
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:22,235
What?

51
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,422
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:26,573
I heard about
the shooting,

53
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,642
and I wanted to make sure
you were ok.

54
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:29,860
You did?

55
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:32,179
Yeah.

56
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:33,547
I knocked
on the door,

57
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,749
and I found a family
terrified for you.

58
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,584
They had no idea
where you were.

59
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:38,552
Oh.

60
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:40,587
Oliver, are you
so self-centered

61
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:43,140
that you don't think that people
who care about you

62
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:45,859
are gonna wonder where you
are after you all got shot at?

63
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,027
You're right.

64
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:51,565
I made peace with your
selfishness a long time ago,

65
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,234
but Moira, Thea,
and Walter,

66
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:55,903
they don't
deserve that.

67
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:57,988
They deserve better,

68
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,824
someone who doesn't care
only about himself.

69
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,114
Laurel...

70
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,303
thank you for coming.

71
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:16,440
I care about the lives
of other people, Oliver.

72
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,960
Maybe you should
try it sometime.

73
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,519
Oh, man.

74
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:31,488
That was harsh.

75
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,459
You ok?

76
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:36,910
Sure.

77
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,981
Second time tonight
that a friend of mine

78
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,550
has taken me
to the woodshed.

79
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:45,669
Kind of tires you out.

80
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,670
Yeah.

81
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:48,672
Good night.
Good night.

82
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:15,482
Shengcún.

83
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,286
What am I supposed
to do with that?

84
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,121
Shengcún.

85
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,957
Does that mean "bird"?

86
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,876
Shengcún!

87
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:27,795
I don't speak Chinese!

88
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:39,356
I'm sorry, Laurel.

89
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:40,757
I'm so sorry.

90
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,163
There were
no signs of forced entry

91
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,932
or any evidence
of a struggle,

92
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,653
but, hours later, the police found
that the bloodstained

93
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:54,430
kitchen knife in the trunk...

94
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,612
Couldn't sleep,
either?

95
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:57,497
No.
Forensic analysis verified...

96
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:58,782
What are you watching?

97
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,767
Peter Declan.
Blood on the blade...

98
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,902
Hmm?
Peter Declan's fingerprints...

99
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,820
A guy who killed
his wife.

100
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,488
Despite the growing
list of evidence...

101
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,490
Right. This guy
killed his wife

102
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,877
in their baby's room.
Psycho.

103
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,646
Camille was
everything to me.

104
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:16,116
I couldn't kill her any more than I
could kill myself.

105
00:06:16,118 --> 00:06:18,135
So why can't you sleep?

106
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,721
Bad dreams.

107
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,389
About?

108
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,474
Laurel.

109
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:27,027
So why don't you
make a play?

110
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,446
I mean, she did
come over here

111
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:31,348
just to make sure
you didn't get shot.

112
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,067
There are reasons.

113
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,619
Mm, what are they?

114
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:38,288
Besides you sleeping
with her sister

115
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,656
and her sister dying

116
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,658
and her father
hating your guts

117
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,460
and you basically
being a jerk

118
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:45,779
to everybody since
you've been back?

119
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,532
Those are the top ones.

120
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,340
I know that it might not seem
like it sometimes, but...

121
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,346
I'm not the same person
I used to be.

122
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,064
So show her.

123
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,116
Be yourself.

124
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,852
I mean
your new self.

125
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:21,415
How did you sleep?

126
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,667
Just fine.
Thank you.

127
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:26,069
We have
a visitor.

128
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,256
Hmm. Mr. Diggle's
replacement.

129
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,292
Replacement?

130
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:36,463
Yes. He tendered
his resignation this morning.

131
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:38,015
Did he say why?

132
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:41,101
He said he didn't approve of the way
you spend your evenings,

133
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:43,904
particularly given that they always begin
with you ditching him.

134
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:46,556
Hi.

135
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:48,108
Mr. Queen,
Rob Scott.

136
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,893
I'll be your
new body man.

137
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,428
That's a firm grip
you got there, rob.

138
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,947
That's 5 years SWAT
with Monument Point M.C.U.

139
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,099
I feel safer already.

140
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,628
Ah, thank God we
don't have to hear about

141
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:00,653
this awful man anymore.

142
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:06,576
Declan's execution is set for
midnight 2 days from now.

143
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:08,378
Camille Declan's
former employer,

144
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,682
Jason Brodeur, released
a statement saying, quote,

145
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:15,192
"I hope this gives Camille
the peace she deserves."

146
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,742
Jason Brodeur?

147
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:18,762
What?

148
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,749
The dead wife worked
for Jason Brodeur.

149
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,804
Apparently so. What--

150
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:24,976
why?

151
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:26,477
No reason.

152
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,012
Say, Rob, I want
to go into town.

153
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:29,564
Could you please
get the car for me?

154
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:30,598
No offense,
Mr. Queen,

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,850
but I have been filled in
on your tendency

156
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:34,135
to slip the leash.

157
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:35,636
If it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer

158
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:37,155
keeping you in my sights
at all times.

159
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,075
We're 20 miles
from the city.

160
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,144
If you don't drive me,

161
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,079
how else am I
gonna get there?

162
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:47,916
Right?

163
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:54,923
I like him.

164
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:05,133
Hey!

165
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:14,108
They say Peter Declan
murdered his wife in cold blood.

166
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,394
He had no alibi,

167
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:18,730
and all the evidence
pointed toward him.

168
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:22,450
He was tried, convicted,
and sentenced to death,

169
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,235
an open-and-shut case,

170
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,354
except for one thing.

171
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:29,540
Declan's wife Camille
worked for Jason Brodeur.

172
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:32,961
And Jason Brodeur
is on the list.

173
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,200
Mr. Brodeur.

174
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:40,501
Admiring your handiwork?

175
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:45,373
You should have just let me
kill both of 'em.

176
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,058
Peter Declan is
worth more alive.

177
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,894
"Husband kills wife" is
a much better headline

178
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:53,348
than "whistle-blower uncovers
toxic dumping," don't you think?

179
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,600
Either way, 48 hours,

180
00:09:55,602 --> 00:10:01,906
all this'll be over.

181
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:04,892
The odds are good that
Brodeur is involved in this woman's murder,

182
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:08,913
which means an innocent man
is facing execution.

183
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:11,499
He'll need a good attorney.

184
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,502
So I take it there's
absolutely no point

185
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,088
in asking if you'd
like to grab a drink?

186
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,591
I can't. I have to go over transcripts
for the Fernands case.

187
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:23,795
You know, if you go somewhere
that's not work or your home,

188
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:27,015
your odds of meeting someone
increase by, like, a gazillion percent.

189
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:27,965
Oh, that's not true.

190
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,251
I could still get mugged
on the way home.

191
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:33,271
In that case, I hope
he's cute and single.

192
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:35,606
Good night, Joanna.

193
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,917
Hello, Laurel.

194
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,585
Don't move!

195
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,804
I'm not gonna hurt you.

196
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,173
Stay back.
My father's a cop.

197
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,758
You are making
a huge mistake.

198
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,927
I'm not the person
you think I am,

199
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,395
and I need your help.

200
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:22,848
Peter Declan is gonna
be executed in 48 hours.

201
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,233
I think he's innocent.

202
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:27,519
Declan's wife was gonna blow
the whistle on Jason Brodeur.

203
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,803
Brodeur had her murdered.

204
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,974
There are a thousand lawyers
in Starling City.

205
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:33,575
Why me?

206
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,831
We're both trying to help.

207
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,418
What makes you sure
I'm gonna help you?

208
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,321
Because I know
you'd do anything

209
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:48,924
to save the life
of an innocent man.

210
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:05,524
A jury has charged you
as guilty, Mr. Declan.

211
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,392
The evidence was
stacked against me,

212
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,111
but I didn't
kill my wife.

213
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:12,514
I didn't take my daughter's
mother from her.

214
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,702
The murder weapon
was a knife

215
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:20,122
from your kitchen
with your prints on it.

216
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:22,357
It was found,
along with Camille's blood,

217
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,393
in the trunk
of your car.

218
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:27,129
Your neighbors said they heard
an argument that night.

219
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:30,799
We had a knockdown fight
over Jason Brodeur.

220
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,217
Camille worked for him,

221
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,971
and his company had been
dumping toxic waste into the Glades.

222
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:39,241
Now, Camille told me that she'd
gone and told a supervisor about it.

223
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,643
I was afraid for
my family's safety.

224
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,513
And we argued

225
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,382
very loudly, yes.

226
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:48,367
Izzy started crying,

227
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:51,903
so Camille went and
stayed in her room.

228
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,380
In the morning,
I went to apologize,

229
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:04,950
and that's
when I found her.

230
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:08,286
So I just
grabbed Izzy,

231
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,540
and I ran outside,
and I called 911.

232
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,630
I'm innocent,
Ms. Lance.

233
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,686
Well, it looks
like someone forgot

234
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:26,688
a lunch date
with his wife.

235
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,973
What do you mean?

236
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,524
Lunch isn't
for another--

237
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,978
45 minutes ago.
I'm so sorry.

238
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,947
It's all right. The restaurant
is holding our table.

239
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,816
Is there
something wrong?

240
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,235
Compliance department
has tagged something,

241
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,820
$2.6 million withdrawal

242
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,156
from one of our
Vancouver subsidiaries.

243
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,608
What--you mean--
are you saying that someone

244
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,744
embezzled $2.6 million
from the company?

245
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:50,579
Well, it's probably
a bookkeeping error,

246
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,047
but compliance
is understandably

247
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,882
worried about
an irs audit.

248
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,133
Hmm.

249
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,387
But don't worry.

250
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,422
I'm sure it's nothing.
Come on.

251
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,707
We're gonna be late.

252
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,125
On our way.

253
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,846
Well, I wasn't
the lead on this,

254
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,515
but from what I recall,
we had fingerprints.

255
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,819
We had blood.
We got motive, everything.

256
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,856
Brodeur seems
like the type of guy

257
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,974
with resources
needed to frame someone.

258
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:23,257
Laurel, in 24 hours,
Peter Declan is lying down

259
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,077
with a needle in his arm,
and he's not getting up.

260
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,998
If I thought for a second we didn't
have the right guy,

261
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,667
do you think there's anything
else I'd be doing right now

262
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,669
except trying to get at
what really happened?

263
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,338
Declan said his wife
went to her supervisor

264
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,308
with allegations that Brodeur was
dumping toxic waste.

265
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,660
Yeah, but that supervisor,

266
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,128
he said
that never happened.

267
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,047
Let me see.
What was his name?

268
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,715
Here you go.
Istook, Matt Istook.

269
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,134
He said he didn't even
see Camille that day.

270
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:48,603
Happy now?

271
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:49,805
Yes.

272
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,643
You know, I thought
it'd be a cold day in hell

273
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,861
before you started
defending criminals.

274
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,613
I'm not so sure
Declan's a criminal.

275
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:01,015
Like you said,
he's on a clock.

276
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,201
Can't leave
any stone unturned.

277
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,656
Oh, yeah.

278
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:14,830
So when are you
gonna tell me?

279
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:15,797
Hmm?

280
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,016
About what happened
to your arm.

281
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,835
Oh, it's my shoulder,

282
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,086
and it's--it's fine.

283
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,054
I knew that Queen guy
was trouble.

284
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,490
Hey, I never said this happened
protecting Queen.

285
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,209
Oh, yeah?

286
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,345
Then what's
he doing here?

287
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,717
Area is secure, sir.

288
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,552
Thank you very much, rob.

289
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,108
Hello, Diggle's
sister-in-law Carly.

290
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,076
I'm Oliver Queen.
I know who you are.

291
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,779
No, you really don't.

292
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,400
Hello.

293
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,705
I couldn't
help but notice

294
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:59,424
a distinct lack of police cars
when I got home.

295
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,810
I knew you wouldn't
drop a dime on me.

296
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,379
So have you
considered my offer?

297
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,580
Offer.

298
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,482
That's one hell
of a way to put it.

299
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:08,633
It is an offer.

300
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,369
It's a chance to do
the kind of good

301
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,555
that compelled you
to join the military.

302
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:14,923
Please.

303
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:17,943
You were born with a platinum spoon
in your mouth, Queen.

304
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:21,262
What, you spent 5 years on an island
with no room service,

305
00:16:21,264 --> 00:16:23,565
and suddenly you
found religion?

306
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,652
This was my father's.

307
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:35,327
I found it
when I buried him.

308
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,797
I thought you said your father
died when the boat went down.

309
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,298
We both made it
to a life raft,

310
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,633
but there wasn't enough
food and water

311
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,002
for both of us,
so he shot himself in the head.

312
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,922
And as much
as he was doing it

313
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,640
to give me
a chance to survive,

314
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:51,042
I believe that he
was also atoning for his sins.

315
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:55,564
I need to right
the wrongs done by my family,

316
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:58,400
and I'm offering you
the chance

317
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,735
to right the wrongs
done to yours.

318
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:02,470
Oliver, what are
you talking about?

319
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,022
The police never caught
your brother's shooter.

320
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,640
Hey, you leave Andy
out of this.

321
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:07,692
The bullets were laced
with curare.

322
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,010
That's
Floyd Lawton's M.O.

323
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:13,481
He is the sniper
that I stopped.

324
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,917
Are you trying
to tell me

325
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,285
that you took down
Andy's killer?

326
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:21,056
I'm--I'm giving you
the chance,

327
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:25,277
a chance to help
other people's families.

328
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,295
Do you remember
when the people

329
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,965
in this city
helped each other?

330
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,716
They can't
do that anymore,

331
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,603
because a group
of people,

332
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:37,122
people like my father,

333
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:40,341
they see nothing wrong
with raising themselves up

334
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:43,395
by stepping on
other people's throats.

335
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,146
It does need to stop,

336
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,699
and if it's not
gonna be the courts

337
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,918
and it's not gonna
be the cops...

338
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,738
Then it's
gonna be me.

339
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,861
And, I hope, you.

340
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,167
I'm gonna go
to the washroom, Rob.

341
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:20,649
Oh, that boy's
long gone, man.

342
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,317
Phew.

343
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,154
You still following
the money trail?

344
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:26,746
Mm-hmm.

345
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,574
Don't we have accountants
for that sort of thing?

346
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,225
They're being singularly ineffective
in this instance.

347
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,994
Well, then...

348
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:35,864
it's fortunate that
I've solved the mystery.

349
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:40,085
I think I'm the culprit.

350
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:43,171
2.6 million is
a rather specific figure.

351
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,623
That's the exact amount
the company invested

352
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,727
in a friend's start-up venture
3 years ago.

353
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,580
I will call accounting.
They'll clean it all up.

354
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:54,115
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

355
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:56,217
Ok.
Heh.

356
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,246
You really are putting a lot of hours
into this Declan thing.

357
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,764
You actually think
he's innocent.

358
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,765
Someone does.

359
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,100
So you said,

360
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:14,703
but you didn't
say who.

361
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,546
The guardian angel.

362
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,282
The guy in the hood?

363
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:29,634
Look, you're--
you're kidding.

364
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,253
He tracked me down and asked me
to look into the Declan case.

365
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,421
But you've met him?

366
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,006
But he goes
against everything

367
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:37,475
that I was ever taught
to believe in.

368
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,228
He breaks the law
and God knows what else.

369
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,052
How are you not afraid
that he is gonna do

370
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,265
God knows what to you?

371
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,899
He won't.

372
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,735
I don't know.
I can feel it.

373
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:48,903
You know, when I told you
to meet someone,

374
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,222
this is far, far away
from what I meant.

375
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,363
I got your message.

376
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,083
Is there a reason
we can't do this face to face?

377
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,785
You've met
with Peter Declan.

378
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,703
You were right.

379
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,340
He might be innocent.

380
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,659
Declan said his wife
blew the whistle on Brodeur

381
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,011
the day she was murdered.

382
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,668
Then we need to get whoever

383
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:16,841
she told about
Brodeur to testify.

384
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,668
He already has.

385
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:25,173
Matt Istook,
Camille's supervisor.

386
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:29,010
Only, he says that she didn't say
a word to him.

387
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,111
He could be lying.

388
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:33,347
Well, if he is,
then he's very convincing.

389
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:35,984
He had the jury
and police believing him.

390
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,570
He hasn't been
questioned by me.

391
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,123
I didn't
become a lawyer

392
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,742
to break the law
or hurt anybody.

393
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,461
I do what's necessary,

394
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,363
what people
like Peter Declan need.

395
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,751
If what you're doing
isn't wrong...

396
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,222
Then why are you
hiding your face with a hood?

397
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,925
To protect the ones
I care about.

398
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,179
That sounds lonely.

399
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,713
It can be.

400
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:09,984
But not today.

401
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,346
I've got one question.

402
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,048
Why am I being fired?

403
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,183
Ms. Smoak, isn't it?
Yes.

404
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,018
And I am without a doubt

405
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,938
the single most valuable member
of your technical division.

406
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,773
That's including
my so-called "supervisor."

407
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:41,677
Letting me go would be a major error
for this company.

408
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:45,731
I agree, which is why you're
not being fired.

409
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,784
Uh, I assumed when
you brought me up here,

410
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,002
it was because...

411
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,106
It's because I wanted
you to look into something for me.

412
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:58,243
A variance
of $2.6 million

413
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,145
on a failed investment
from 3 years ago.

414
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:01,597
It was authorized
by my wife.

415
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,365
I was hoping
you could find out

416
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:05,751
some of the details
of the transaction for me.

417
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:06,769
Find out...

418
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:09,371
Dig up discreetly.

419
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:11,974
I'm your girl.

420
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:16,845
I mean,
I'm not your girl.

421
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:19,231
I wasn't
making a pass at you.

422
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,769
Thank you
for not firing me.

423
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:33,895
Ahh.

424
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:37,833
What the...

425
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,260
Matt Istook.

426
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,765
You're him,
that hood guy.

427
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:55,217
You're the guy
that's been terrorizing the city.

428
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:56,185
Peter Declan,

429
00:22:56,187 --> 00:22:57,970
your lies helped
put him on death row.

430
00:22:57,972 --> 00:23:00,756
Now, either it's time
to tell me the truth,

431
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:03,559
or it's time
for the 10:15 to Blüdhaven.

432
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,027
O-ok.

433
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,429
Ok, I--
Brodeur paid me to--

434
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:09,698
to say that Camille
never spoke to me,

435
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,984
but I didn't have anything to do
with her death.

436
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,536
Oh, God, please.
I'll do anything.

437
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:15,587
Y-you could
have the file.

438
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:17,322
What file?
Camille gave me a file

439
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:19,291
of evidence
against Jason Brodeur.

440
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:20,743
Where is it?!
Let me go,

441
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:21,744
and I'll tell you.

442
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,715
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't go! It's in my desk!

443
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:28,467
The file, it's in my desk
at the office!

444
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:30,002
You can have it!
Get me out of here!

445
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:43,482
What is that?

446
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,967
I'm so hungry.

447
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:50,989
It smells really good.

448
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:53,826
Aah!

449
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,030
Hey, fine. Don't share.

450
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:06,705
Shengcún.

451
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,998
I'm not gonna kill
the bird.

452
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,386
Shengcún.

453
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:41,540
Compliments
of Matt Istook.

454
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:42,941
What's in here?

455
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,911
Leverage
on Jason Brodeur,

456
00:24:45,913 --> 00:24:48,196
enough to help save
Peter Declan's life.

457
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:52,050
As an attorney, I never would have
gotten a file like this.

458
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:55,721
I always thought the law was sacred,
I-it fixed everything.

459
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:57,756
And now, Laurel?

460
00:24:57,758 --> 00:24:59,591
Now what do you think?

461
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,544
I think there's
too many people in this city

462
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,479
who only care
about themselves...

463
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:08,567
people who
are selfish.

464
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:10,903
I think they need
someone who cares

465
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:13,105
about the lives
of other people...

466
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:16,742
someone like you.

467
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:22,047
♪ God, give me
your shelter ♪

468
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,131
Oh, my God.

469
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,682
What is wrong
with your face?

470
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:41,633
What do you mean?

471
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:44,169
There's something
really weird on it,

472
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,021
like this thing
with your mouth.

473
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:49,107
It--it looks like
it's in the shape of a smile.

474
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:50,893
That's cute.
So why are you grinning?

475
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,528
I took your advice
with Laurel

476
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,297
to be myself.

477
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:56,949
And...

478
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:57,983
It's helping.

479
00:25:57,985 --> 00:26:00,619
Got mad relationship
skills, bro.

480
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:03,322
Let me know if you
need trendy places to propose.

481
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,123
I think you're getting
a little bit ahead of yourself.

482
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,325
Mm.
Little bit.

483
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:10,545
Rob.

484
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,448
You gotta keep up.

485
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:26,979
Hey, you look busy.

486
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:29,064
Is that the Declan case?

487
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:32,034
You know, it was a funny development
on Matt Istook.

488
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,352
He, uh, filed
a police report.

489
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:35,187
He said the hood
harassed him last night.

490
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,655
And that's funny,

491
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:38,240
because I gave
my daughter Istook's name.

492
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:40,575
Dad--
He's a vigilante.

493
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:41,860
He's a damn criminal,

494
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:44,529
and you working with him,
that makes you an accessory.

495
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:46,531
I am trying to save
an innocent man's life.

496
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,534
No.

497
00:26:49,536 --> 00:26:51,370
You're breaking the law.

498
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:52,921
Well, I wouldn't
have to if the police

499
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:55,123
would have done
their job right in the first place.

500
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,628
I asked you
how you got this case.

501
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:02,514
You lied to me
straight to my face, eh?

502
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,518
I thought you and I
didn't do that.

503
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:09,771
Guess I was wrong.

504
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:15,527
The mere existence
of the file

505
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:17,846
proves that Mr. Istook
perjured himself

506
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:20,115
for Jason Brodeur's
benefit.

507
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:21,349
That's slander.

508
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:22,651
Jared Swanstrom,
Your Honor.

509
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:25,120
I represent Jason Brodeur and
Brodeur Chemical.

510
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:28,023
The interest of justice
requires you

511
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:30,025
to stay the defendant's
execution

512
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:32,577
pending exploration
of the newly discovered evidence.

513
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:35,380
Ours isn't a court of justice,
Ms. Lance.

514
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:36,531
It's a court of law,

515
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,583
and under the law,
I don't think your evidence

516
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:41,420
is sufficient to warrant
a stay of execution.

517
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:44,473
Your motion for habeas corpus
is denied.

518
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
This isn't over.

519
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:50,095
I've got
the loose end now,

520
00:27:50,097 --> 00:27:51,430
and no matter
what happens,

521
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:54,433
I am going to pull
on it until your whole world unravels.

522
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:58,854
Declan's lawyer's
pulling me into this.

523
00:27:58,856 --> 00:27:59,988
I'm gonna go to prison,

524
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,323
if not for murder,

525
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,824
then this--
this dumping thing.

526
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:03,792
That won't happen.

527
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:05,327
There are steps
we can take.

528
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,395
You saw her.
She's going after me.

529
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:09,664
She's gonna want
to meet with her client

530
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,166
after what happened
in court today.

531
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,568
We have friends
up in Iron Heights.

532
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,404
Prison can be
a dangerous place.

533
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,268
We're not done yet.

534
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,769
I'm an attorney.

535
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:27,272
Trust me.
We're done.

536
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,460
What do you need
to free Peter Declan?

537
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:33,462
At this point,

538
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:36,614
nothing short of a signed confession
from Brodeur.

539
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,717
Where are you going?

540
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,302
To get
a confession.

541
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,455
The company Mrs. Queen--

542
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,040
or Steele.

543
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,675
Mrs. Queen-Steele.

544
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:47,792
She hyphenate?

545
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,561
She seems like a woman
who would hyphenate.

546
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:52,764
Right.

547
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:55,367
The company she invested in
doesn't exist.

548
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,735
I don't understand.

549
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,904
There was no investment.
The money was used

550
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,989
to set up an offshore
LLC called Tempest.

551
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,492
I don't recall that name being under
the Queen Consolidated banner.

552
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,826
'Cause it's not.

553
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,828
There's nothing registered with
the Secretary of State,

554
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,080
no federal tax records,

555
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,648
no patent applications
filed.

556
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:14,670
But in 2009, Tempest purchased
a warehouse in Starling City.

557
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,127
Enough moping.

558
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:23,128
Mm.

559
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,180
You quit. It's done.

560
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,516
My advice would be
to move on.

561
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:30,218
Well, if it were
only that easy.

562
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,186
Except it is.

563
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,854
Personal security
is dangerous.

564
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,339
Your nephew already
lost his father.

565
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:36,725
He can't lose
his uncle, too.

566
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:39,828
Does it ever bother you

567
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,680
they never caught
the guy who killed Andy?

568
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,352
You know, when I was
in Afghanistan,

569
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:50,238
I had a job,
and I did it.

570
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:52,708
And when I could,

571
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,326
I would help out
the people there

572
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,361
so that, in some small way,
when I left,

573
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:58,914
I could believe I left it
a better place.

574
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:02,250
But ever since
I've been home,

575
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:04,252
all I do
is protect punks

576
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:05,637
and spoiled
one percenters.

577
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,406
Yeah.

578
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:10,392
I miss feeling like I'm making
a difference in the world.

579
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:11,560
Then get out
of personal security

580
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,044
and go do something
you believe in.

581
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,112
Yeah,
what if it's wrong?

582
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:16,832
John, if you
believe in something,

583
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,900
how can it be wrong?

584
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,053
What do you want?

585
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:23,655
You're gonna confess
that you arranged

586
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,357
to have Peter Declan's wife
murdered.

587
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,442
What, so I can
take his place in prison?

588
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:29,494
So you can avoid
the death penalty.

589
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,879
Except if I'm dead,

590
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,281
well, then, you've got no one
to pin Camille's murder on.

591
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:36,118
You need me to exonerate
Peter Declan.

592
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,869
Maybe you could
try to force me

593
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,737
to sign a confession
or something.

594
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:41,623
Yaah!
That might be difficult.

595
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,510
My hand!

596
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:51,583
Just answer it.

597
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:53,769
What?
It's Ankov.

598
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,771
It's going down,
one hour.

599
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:59,024
What's going down
in an hour?

600
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,526
What?!

601
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,595
Let's just say...

602
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,480
Peter Declan's
execution,

603
00:31:05,482 --> 00:31:08,150
it's getting
moved up.

604
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,606
We still
have a shot.

605
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,441
Do you remember
the friend that I mentioned,

606
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:17,659
the one
who believes in you?

607
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,661
He is working
on something.

608
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:27,269
I told you,

609
00:31:27,271 --> 00:31:30,172
Jason Brodeur
is powerful.

610
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:38,230
Time to unlock the cages.

611
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,481
I've been here before.

612
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:43,268
These lawyers holding out these
little nuggets of hope.

613
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,521
Secure all corners
in cell block "C".

614
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,556
The warden's
setting up

615
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:03,840
a secure perimeter
in "C" block.

616
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,025
Stay here,
Ms. Lance.

617
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:07,177
Wait!

618
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,497
There's Lance.

619
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:30,133
Let's go.

620
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,014
Stop.

621
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,592
Get down!

622
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:31,895
Get down!
Get out there!

623
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:37,284
Stay down!
Stay down!

624
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,869
Don't move!

625
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,877
Laurel.

626
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:50,497
Sweetie.

627
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:51,715
What are you--

628
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:53,667
I'm all right.

629
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:54,784
You sure?

630
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm sorry about
what I said to you.

631
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:57,954
Yeah, well,
you were right.

632
00:33:57,956 --> 00:33:59,789
Ankov just confessed
to Camille Declan's murder.

633
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,458
We got
the wrong guy.

634
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,226
Now, listen to me,
Laurel.

635
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:04,511
I'm right, too,
about him.

636
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:06,013
He's dangerous.

637
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:07,431
He's outside the law.

638
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,982
I know.

639
00:34:11,255 --> 00:34:13,256
He's a killer.

640
00:34:14,864 --> 00:34:16,714
He would have killed that man.

641
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:20,977
The look in his eyes, I--

642
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:22,996
it was awful.

643
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:32,089
Hey, please.

644
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,825
I'm starving.

645
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:39,829
I never killed
anything before.

646
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:01,535
I'm sorry.

647
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:18,868
Let's get you home,
sweetie.

648
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,922
How'd he get into
that prison, anyway, huh?

649
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:24,724
A grown man
in an outfit and a hood,

650
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:27,727
that kind of stands out a little,
doesn't it?

651
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:30,430
He actually wasn't
wearing the outfit this time.

652
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,432
He was
in a prison guard uniform

653
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:33,883
and a ski mask.

654
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,355
What?
Nothing.

655
00:35:38,357 --> 00:35:40,023
I just had an idea.

656
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:42,325
Get in the car.

657
00:36:56,817 --> 00:36:58,652
Ok, here's
the security footage

658
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:00,303
from the Exchange
building shooting,

659
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:01,938
but I've already
scrubbed through all of it.

660
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,573
Yeah? Well,
we're gonna do it again.

661
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:05,825
So, listen,
when you went through

662
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:07,227
the camera security tapes,
you were looking for

663
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:09,162
a guy in a green outfit
and a green hood, right?

664
00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:10,413
What do you want me
to look for,

665
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:11,831
a man in a wig
and a tutu?

666
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,500
I want you to look
for anything

667
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:15,585
that's out of the ordinary,
ok? Just look.

668
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,896
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait.

669
00:37:23,898 --> 00:37:26,098
Go back 10 seconds.
What is that?

670
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:31,053
I'll be damned.

671
00:37:33,895 --> 00:37:35,996
Play that again.

672
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,639
Thank you, Laurel.

673
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:42,007
Don't thank me.

674
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,593
Thank Brodeur's bodyguard
Ankov for flipping him.

675
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:49,564
I think there's someone
that wants to see you.

676
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:51,382
Izzy.

677
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:09,901
At least 5 federal, state,
and local agencies

678
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:11,586
are seeking
millions of dollars

679
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:14,155
in fines and
environmental cleanup costs

680
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:16,141
from Brodeur Chemical,

681
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:20,011
new facts have come to light that
Brodeur Chemical employee Camille Declan

682
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:23,298
had discovered Brodeur
was illegally disposing waste

683
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,600
and had collected
a file of evidence

684
00:38:25,602 --> 00:38:29,020
against her employer
before her murder in 2007.

685
00:38:29,022 --> 00:38:32,590
Peter Declan, who was
convicted of killing his wife,

686
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:35,777
has been released,
and the case has been reopened.

687
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:50,709
Shengcún.

688
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,545
Yeah.

689
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,246
Bird. I know.

690
00:38:55,248 --> 00:38:58,717
Shengcún
not mean "bird."

691
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,336
Shengcún
mean "survive."

692
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:03,972
You speak English.

693
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,425
You want survive
this place,

694
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:10,795
bird not
last thing you kill.

695
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:17,152
And forget her.

696
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,572
You look at that
all day,

697
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:22,857
you not survive
this place.

698
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:40,625
You wanted to see me?

699
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:43,661
You look nervous,
Moira.

700
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:46,497
Hmm. Do I have
a reason to be?

701
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,434
We all do.

702
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:58,793
A modern-day Robin hood.

703
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:02,530
What, are you worried that your
net worth makes you a target?

704
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:08,486
Jason Brodeur,
Adam Hunt,

705
00:40:08,488 --> 00:40:09,988
Warren Patel.

706
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,674
Tell me you see
a connection, Moira.

707
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,426
He's not targeting
the rich.

708
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:15,877
No, he's not.

709
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:18,463
He's targeting
the list.

710
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:27,906
You here
for the bodyguard position?

711
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:30,091
'Cause the new guy
just quit.

712
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,542
No, I'm not.

713
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,896
I'm here about
the other position.

714
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:39,550
Just to be clear,

715
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:42,520
I'm not signing on
to be a sidekick.

716
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:43,888
But you're right.

717
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,657
Fighting for this city
needs to be done,

718
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,609
and you're gonna do this
with or without me.

719
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,611
Yeah.
But with me,

720
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,913
there'll be fewer casualties,
including you.

721
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:54,833
Diggle, I'm not looking
for anybody to save me.

722
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:57,335
Maybe not,

723
00:40:57,337 --> 00:40:59,671
but you need someone
just the same.

724
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,572
You are fighting
a war, Queen,

725
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:04,742
except you have
no idea what war does to you,

726
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:08,096
how it scrapes off
little pieces of your soul.

727
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:11,966
And you need someone
to remind you

728
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,935
of who you are,

729
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,803
not this thing
you're becoming.

730
00:41:23,163 --> 00:41:24,762
Oliver Queen.
What is this?

731
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:26,064
You can't just
barge in here.

732
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,483
Yeah? Well, I got a badge
and a gun that say different.

733
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,984
Hey, what the hell's
going on?!

734
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:31,152
Detective Lance--

735
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:33,121
Oliver Queen,
you're under arrest on suspicion

736
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,706
of obstruction of justice,
aggravated assault...

737
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:35,957
What is going on?
Walter, stop them!

738
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,542
Trespassing,
acting as a vigilante...

739
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:39,460
Are you out
of your mind?!

740
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:40,628
And murder.

741
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,997
You have the right
to remain silent.

742
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:44,549
Give up
that right...
