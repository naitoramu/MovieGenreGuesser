1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,650
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,126
Twitch, I will open your throat.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,966
- Slade Wilson.
- Oliver Queen.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,209
Let me show you how not to die.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,805
- Unh!
- Ha, ha.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,401
There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,761
Sorry.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,564
- For what?
- Not telling you how I really feel.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,931
Time to choose, Oliver.
Who lives and who dies?

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,360
No! No!

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,881
No!

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,525
No.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,165
Whoever did this to her...

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,404
is going to suffer.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,161
You cannot die until you have known...

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,367
complete despair.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,403
And you will. I promise.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,523
There's a new player we've been tracking.

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,882
We've been calling him Deathstroke.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,928
Slade's goal is to create an army
of human weapons using the Mirakuru.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,325
I can't stop him from doing anything. Agh!

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,166
Five years ago, I made you a promise.
Well, I'm here to fulfill it.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,488
No!

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,845
There is still one person who has to die...

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,326
before this can end.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,449
Oliver?

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,362
Oliver, man, you okay?

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,963
The cure's not working.

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,045
We don't know that.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,931
He still has a lot of Tibetan
pit viper venom in his system.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,405
- What's that?
- Proximity alarm.

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,680
I rigged the tire with sensors just
in case Slade's goons came here to kill us.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,442
Slade's goons are here to kill us.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,578
Talk to me, Felicity.

35
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,549
They're inside. They're
right underneath us.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,850
Where am I?

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,441
Felicity!

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,201
Down the cable. Go!

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,806
Go, go, go, go!

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,845
Hurry, run!

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,004
Oh, my God.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,281
What the hell happened?

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,966
Slade's army. You were right
about this place being compromised.

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,814
Lyla, your boss is gonna
bomb the city at dawn.

45
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,959
Yeah well, Waller's never
seen a problem she didn't...

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,937
think couldn't be solved
with a drone strike.

47
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,267
Why do you think I'm here?

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,960
You knew Waller was looking to level
the city and you came here anyway?

49
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,764
You're here.

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,689
You need to go back to A.R.G.U.S.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,645
You need to stop Waller
or buy us enough time to stop Slade.

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,729
Yeah, not without me.

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,689
Till death do us part, right?

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,530
- This time it might.
- Guys?

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,767
I need you to scrounge as many weapons as
you can find, especially injection arrows.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,209
We're gonna fill them with the cure,
which clearly works.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,324
And this ends tonight, without killing.

58
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,609
There's been enough death already.

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,485
No!

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,243
Thea.

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,329
It's called Kevlar.

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,683
If you're gonna kill me,
just get it over with.

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,087
Kill you? Why? Because you shot me?

64
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,851
- I'm glad you did.
- You're sick.

65
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,203
Perhaps. How else to explain the fact
that not a year ago...

66
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,568
your brother held a gun
to my face as well?

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,131
Tommy?

68
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,089
He lacked the conviction...

69
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,846
the strength to pull the trigger,
but not you, Thea.

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,565
You are made of iron.

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,291
You are truly my daughter,
and I could not be more proud.

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,885
No.

73
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,440
Remember your training.

74
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,405
You be smart, you take clean shots,
and you don't miss the...

75
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,491
Pull back to Meltzer
Avenue. We need SWAT at Union Plaza.

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,767
City Hall's a war zone.

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,167
They're everywhere!

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,367
Fall back! Fall back! Aah!
I'm hit. I'm hit.

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,446
Okay, listen, I know you're scared.
You wouldn't be human if you weren't.

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,405
But tonight, this city, our city...

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,762
it's counting on each
and every one of you...

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,442
so you go out there
and be the heroes I know you all to be.

83
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,326
Go.

84
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,884
Where's your sister?

85
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,963
- I don't know.
- Detective?

86
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,164
I've got one PP on the line
with Lieutenant Pike in the field.

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,964
You're the ranking officer.

88
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,804
You should go. I'll find Sara.

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,645
Listen, I don't want you stepping foot
outside this place, do you hear me?

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,565
- I won't. I promise.
- Good night, sweetheart.

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,285
What have we got?

92
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,126
My sister can't be a part of this.
I don't want her getting hurt.

93
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,051
- Sara, what's going on?
- Laurel...

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,361
Well, it seems like I missed a lot.

95
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,160
Well, what do you remember?

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,523
Leaving town and heading to Blüdhaven.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,162
Was I out cold the whole time?

98
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,401
Felicity?

99
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,609
You were out. The whole time.

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,325
Slade has at least 50 or so of these
human weapons. We need a whole army...

101
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,713
if we plan on hitting
them with the cure.

102
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:03,738
I know.

103
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,769
Which is why an army is what I've brought.

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,447
Gee, you could've called
before you invited five, six...

105
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,080
seven assassins
down into our top-secret lair.

106
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,045
- What is she doing here?
- I asked her to come.

107
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,602
I am Nyssa, daughter of Ra's Al Ghul,
heir to the demon.

108
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,411
Felicity Smoak. MIT, class of '09.

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,604
That's where you went? Nanda Parbat?
The League of Assassins?

110
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,201
These people, they are mercenaries,
and whatever they promised you...

111
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,725
it comes at a price.

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,924
You don't have to worry about it,
because I've already paid it.

113
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,405
You agreed to go back?

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,363
Look, I'm not gonna let Slade Wilson
hurt Laurel or my father.

115
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,882
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes
to keep the ones that I love safe.

116
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,651
And I hope you're ready to do the same.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,201
Especially after what happened.

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,051
Look, Ollie, I'm sorry about your mother.

119
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,001
I am willing to do whatever it takes.

120
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,965
But that doesn't mean cold-blooded killing
is the answer, Sara.

121
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,369
- We have the cure now.
- To fight the unthinkable...

122
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,928
you have to be willing
to do the unthinkable.

123
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,411
You may not want my help, Mr. Queen...

124
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,246
but there is little question
you are in desperate need of it.

125
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,767
First we need to find
Slade's base of operations.

126
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,326
Slade Wilson and Isabel
Rochev are using your

127
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:33,024
former office building as
their base of operations.

128
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,289
- How are you feeling?
- Ready to serve up some payback.

129
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,843
Then remember your training.

130
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,091
Remember everything that you've learned.

131
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,164
- Are you for real?
- Someone...

132
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,205
a friend...

133
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,563
once told me that if you survive a
crucible, you grow the stronger for it.

134
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,888
This is to remind you of that.

135
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,365
What happened to Thea? Is she okay?

136
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,281
She's fine. She was headed
out of the city before this started.

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,445
- We do this my way.
- The League does not take prisoners.

138
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,324
It does tonight.

139
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,242
Thea, it's dangerous out there.

140
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,966
Better than here
with my psycho-villain dad...

141
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,891
who's happy I tried to kill him.

142
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,082
- Roy?
- Yeah, it's me.

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,203
I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.

144
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,966
Uh...

145
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,885
I'm fine. I'm at the train station.

146
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,048
Thea, listen to me. You're not safe there.

147
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,965
Can you please meet me at my place?

148
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,243
I'll be there. As soon as I can.

149
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,249
Okay. Be safe.

150
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,529
Who was that?

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,491
Roy?

152
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,048
You're my daughter.
There's not much I don't know about you.

153
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,449
Interesting how you'd run back to him...

154
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,123
after resolving to run away
to escape all the lies and half-truths.

155
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,446
He's no different, Thea.

156
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,167
No different from your mother or Oliver.

157
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,762
If you don't believe me...

158
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,242
then you should go to him.

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,250
I will.

160
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,007
And if you try to follow me,
I'll shoot you again.

161
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,685
Hmm.

162
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,922
When you need me, I'll be there.

163
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,571
Elevator bank's clear.

164
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,931
Conference room's clear.

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,851
You must have quite a bit
of faith in this cure if you've come alone.

166
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,042
We didn't come alone.

167
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,049
Sara, don't!

168
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,724
Kill me. Don't kill me.

169
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,201
Doesn't matter. I beat you.
I took away the one...

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,768
Your reticence to do what is necessary...

171
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,803
is why your city burns.

172
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,280
This isn't working. I can't get close
enough to Slade to hit him with the cure.

173
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,323
So, what do we do?

174
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,890
Another disappointment. Bring me another.

175
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,481
Come on, Slade. What are you doing?

176
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,331
Advancing the cause of science.

177
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,006
Hey! No, no! Wait!
I know you blame me for Shado's death!

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,841
I blame myself.

179
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,988
He should. It's his
fault we aren't together.

180
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,327
You said once that we were brothers.

181
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,285
And right now, I am begging you,
brother to brother...

182
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,926
just listen to me.

183
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,090
Don't listen to him. All
his words are lies.

184
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,363
I wouldn't be alive right now
if it wasn't for you.

185
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,483
I would be alive if it wasn't for him.

186
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,200
Think about Shado.

187
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,603
She cared for both of us.
She wouldn't want this.

188
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,202
She wants us off Lian Yu.
She'd want all of this to end!

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,529
He's right. This needs to end.

190
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,524
You need to kill him.

191
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,849
Two hours now.

192
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,086
I'm sorry, Oliver.

193
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,204
Do it.

194
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,849
Slade, no!

195
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,361
- Pull the trigger.
- Slade!

196
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,607
Laurel. Laurel.

197
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,962
Sweetheart, sweetheart.

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,764
- What happened?
- Sara.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,490
- She's gone sweetheart. What happened?
- Oh my God.

200
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,125
- You okay?
- She's with that woman.

201
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,327
That woman that took Mom.

202
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,045
Please, no!

203
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,924
You stay here.

204
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,723
Stop right there!
Don't take one more step. One more step!

205
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,601
No! No!

206
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,530
Drones locked on target. Starling City.

207
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,761
Why's this Wilson guy got such
a mad-on for the Queens?

208
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,520
I don't know.

209
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,345
It's a good thing Thea and
Oliver got out of town in time.

210
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,000
So now he has to go after my family?

211
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,810
The hell is she doing here?

212
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,287
She's here to help.

213
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,209
Just trust me, please.

214
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,042
I guess today I'll have to work with
anybody who can help get my daughter back.

215
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,162
What?

216
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:15,070
One of these masked
guys, they took Laurel.

217
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,286
I couldn't stop him. Believe me, I...

218
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,682
- I tried.
- Ooh, we have a new big problem...

219
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,207
which, considering our problems,
is really saying something.

220
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,688
I hacked a satellite and tasked it
for thermographic imaging.

221
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,842
All of Slade's men are
at the Giordano Tunnel.

222
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,247
I thought these guys were trying
to destroy the city, not escape it.

223
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,011
A.R.G.U.S. is gonna level the city
to stop them from getting out.

224
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,005
It's what Slade's planning on.
He knows Waller's tactics.

225
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,329
Fortunately with Slade's men attempting
to leave via the tunnel...

226
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,091
all our targets will be
grouped in a single place.

227
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,284
- We need to take it. Gather your men.
- What about Laurel?

228
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,689
- Must've took her for a reason.
- I know what it is.

229
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,242
But the city comes first.

230
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,762
This is my daughter. This is your sister.

231
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,804
You can't just leave her like this!

232
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,562
Look, I know you said you were trying
another way, and I respect that...

233
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,730
but Slade Wilson, his men,
they're monsters.

234
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,770
And monsters, they need to be destroyed.

235
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,442
You've killed before.

236
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,005
Tonight I suggest you
get back in the habit.

237
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,889
He's wrong.

238
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,244
He's right.

239
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,321
I've lost everything because
I'm fighting Slade Wilson

240
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,270
with one hand tied
behind my back.

241
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,567
The man murdered my mother.

242
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,765
I have to kill him.

243
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,127
You told me you had a choice.

244
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,926
That years ago you could've cured Slade,
but you chose to kill him instead.

245
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,964
This isn't happening
because you're not willing to be a killer.

246
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,886
- It's happening because you were one.
- You're right. That's how this started.

247
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,241
It's how it has to end.

248
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,607
The only move that he's
left me is to kill him.

249
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,444
I can't cure him, I can't capture him.

250
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,883
- I can't even outthink him.
- Then don't.

251
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,765
Just make him outthink you.

252
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,682
Residents are being urged to stay
in their homes amidst unconfirmed rumors...

253
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,127
that Mayor Blood is
among the casualties...

254
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,290
as masked men terrorize the city...

255
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,726
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,806
I'm sorry for everything.

257
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,165
I...

258
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,129
No, it's okay.

259
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,688
I know... I know that I haven't exactly
been myself for the past few months...

260
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,248
- but I was... I was injected...
- With some drug.

261
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,886
I know. Sin told me.

262
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,404
But are you okay now?

263
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,049
Yeah, I'm fine.

264
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,570
I woke up here. I'd lost
a lot of time, but...

265
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,602
And what about the Arrow? He...

266
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,525
He said he was gonna take care of you?

267
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,364
I don't know anything about the Arrow.

268
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,370
I'm done with all of that, but I...

269
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,127
You're the only person
that I've ever cared about.

270
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,208
Are you okay?

271
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,482
Did something happen to you?

272
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,247
It doesn't matter.

273
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,921
Look, let's just... Let's
just get out of here.

274
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,920
Let's start over.
We can be whoever we want to...

275
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,646
without anyone getting in our way.

276
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,962
I'm never losing you again.

277
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,761
Uh, there's just... There's just one thing
I need to take care of before we go, okay?

278
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
Stay here, get some stuff packed,
and I'll be right back.

279
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,045
- No, Roy. It's dangerous out there.
- I know.

280
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,442
But I have to do this.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,651
I wouldn't feel right if
I left without trying.

282
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,606
Do you trust me?

283
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,200
Yes.

284
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,004
Then when I get back,
we're getting out of here forever.

285
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,329
I love you.

286
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,166
Oliver, what are we doing here?
The whole city's falling apart.

287
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,450
I know.

288
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,201
- You need to stay here.
- What?

289
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,531
- Why? You can't just ask me...
- I'm not asking.

290
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,529
I will come get you when this is all over.

291
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,960
- No.
- Felicity.

292
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,965
- No, not unless you tell me why.
- Because I need you to be safe.

293
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,645
I don't want to be safe.

294
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,650
I want to be with you,
and the others, unsafe.

295
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,326
- I can't let that happen.
- Oliver...

296
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,010
You're not making any sense.

297
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,325
Slade took Laurel
because he wants to kill the woman I love.

298
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,330
- I know, so...
- So he took the wrong woman.

299
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,646
Oh.

300
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,886
I love you.

301
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,809
Do you understand?

302
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,485
Yes.

303
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,328
- Johnny.
- Yeah.

304
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,651
- Never mind.
- Hey, Lyla.

305
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,929
I love you. You know that, right?

306
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,082
I do, actually.

307
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,450
It's good to hear it.

308
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,404
- Time to impact.
- Drone is 52 minutes out from target.

309
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,011
Get me Sergeant Gomez.

310
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,442
Uh... Easy Company's not responding.

311
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,090
I need a visual.

312
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
They're in a tunnel ma'am.
I can't get a picture.

313
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,490
What the hell is going on in that tunnel?

314
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,040
Sergeant Gomez? Come in, Sergeant Gomez.

315
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,725
No kill shots. Let the cure do its work.

316
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,246
Ready!

317
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,764
Ready!

318
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,288
Ready! Fire!

319
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,449
Agent Michaels, this
area's restricted to un...

320
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,010
What the hell is this, early parole?

321
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,448
Waller's looking to bomb Starling City.
We need your help to stop her.

322
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,921
As much as I'd love to show the Wall
what we think of her.

323
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,407
There's just that little matter of
tick-tick-boom, ok?

324
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,763
- We all got miniature bombs in our spines.
- You'll have to trust me.

325
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,804
And Lawton, no dropping bodies.

326
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,369
Yeah, sure. Take the fun out of it.

327
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,485
Nyssa!

328
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,047
- Get off the ship!
- Not without you!

329
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,843
Give it to me. Give me the Mirakuru!

330
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,329
No!

331
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,124
Oliver!

332
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,410
Wait. No!

333
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,529
- Ollie!
- No!

334
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,371
- Prep the drone to fire.
- Weapons hot was set for 0600.

335
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,010
Prep the drone to fire.

336
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,128
- Down, now!
- Everybody get down! Down, down!

337
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,847
Waller, call that drone off.

338
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,123
This is treason, Agent Michaels.

339
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,642
Treason that risks
hundreds of thousands of lives.

340
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,410
Have you thought about that?

341
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,769
Have you thought about how you're going
to explain that to your son?

342
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,928
Or is it your daughter?

343
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,603
Did the doctor specify,
or did you want to keep it a surprise?

344
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,444
Congratulations, Mr. Diggle,
you're going to be a father.

345
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,370
- Go.
- You've been busy, kid.

346
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,325
It's over, Slade. Your army is broken.

347
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,482
And I pity them.
But once again, you missed the point.

348
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,848
I have the one you love.

349
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,246
You're going to meet me where I say.

350
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,204
Otherwise, I am going to kill her.

351
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,529
No, you do what you have to.
I'm done playing your games.

352
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,768
You're done when I say you're done!

353
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,168
I was surprised. I thought you
had a thing for stronger women.

354
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,646
But now that I've met her...

355
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,206
I can see the appeal.

356
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,326
She is quite lovely...

357
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,488
your Felicity.

358
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,926
Twitch and I will open your throat.

359
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,489
My first words to you. Do you remember?

360
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,480
I do. I remember the exact moment.

361
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,126
My blade against your neck...

362
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,206
just like my blade
is against the neck of your beloved.

363
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,448
If only I'd killed you then...

364
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,644
everything would be different.

365
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,485
Drop the bow, kid.

366
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,243
Do it.

367
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,131
Yes, countless nights dreaming...

368
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,609
of taking from you
all that you took from me.

369
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,842
- By killing the woman I love?
- Yes.

370
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,920
Like you loved Shado.

371
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,767
Yes.

372
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,806
You see her, don't you?

373
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,246
What does she look like in your madness,
Slade?

374
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,881
What does she say to you? I remember
her being beautiful, young, kind.

375
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,969
She would be horrified
by what you've done in her name.

376
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,607
What I have done?

377
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,002
What I have done...

378
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,171
is what you lack the courage to do...

379
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,569
to fight for her!

380
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,045
So...

381
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,965
when her body lies at your feet...

382
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,409
her blood wet against your skin...

383
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,730
then you will know how I feel!

384
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,524
I already know how you feel.

385
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,041
I know what it's like to hate.

386
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,368
To want revenge.

387
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,203
And now I know how it feels...

388
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,330
to see my enemy so distracted...

389
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,811
he doesn't see the real danger
is right in front of him.

390
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,166
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

391
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,001
Kill her!

392
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,051
Get them out of here!

393
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,601
Poor Sara.
How many times you gonna watch her die?

394
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,607
You can't kill me.

395
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,521
The Mirakuru isn't what made me hate you.

396
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,209
The end is near.

397
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,447
But maybe I'll be merciful enough
to let you live and see your city burn.

398
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,087
We both know there's only one way...

399
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,008
that this can end.

400
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,323
To beat me, kid,
you're gonna have to kill me.

401
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,490
But in the moment of my death...

402
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,525
you'll prove one thing.

403
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,602
That you are...

404
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,450
a murderer.

405
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,689
What are you gonna do, kid?

406
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,930
Stick me with the cure?

407
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,963
It doesn't matter.

408
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,885
I'll keep my promise.

409
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,449
I'll take away everything
and everyone you've loved.

410
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,487
Sara was only the first.

411
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,806
She was only the first.

412
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Your sister, Laurel, your mother...

413
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,726
You can kill me or not.

414
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,489
Either way, I win.

415
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,401
Amanda, it's over.

416
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,400
Slade's down. His army's been taken out.
Call back the drones.

417
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,006
Amanda, it's over!

418
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,240
So, what now, kid?

419
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,165
It's time.

420
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,643
Why are they making you do it?
Why are you making her do this?

421
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,282
- Why?
- Dad, she's not making me do anything.

422
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,606
- I chose this.
- What am I gonna tell your mother?

423
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,604
Tell her that for the first time in
my life, I'm deciding my own fate.

424
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,051
- She'll understand that.
- Yeah.

425
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,886
I love you, sweetheart.

426
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,367
I love you too, Dad.

427
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,328
I know the power of a father's love.

428
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,081
And I would die before I let
anything happen to your daughter.

429
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,645
Well, here's hoping.

430
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,127
So where you're going,
will you be able to e-mail or call?

431
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,369
- I'll see you again.
- I know.

432
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,000
If there's anything that I've learned this
year is that you always find your way home.

433
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,290
I will always be here waiting.

434
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,930
I love you.

435
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,961
I love you.

436
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,926
Oliver needs you.

437
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,647
And, hey...

438
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,330
I think that this
would look good on you.

439
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,721
It fits.

440
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,162
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetheart.

441
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,848
About that jacket...

442
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,048
don't get any ideas.

443
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,885
I could really use a meeting.

444
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,646
Yeah, probably a good idea
for the both of us.

445
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,571
Listen, I gotta pick up a little Pepto
on the way. I'm feeling kind of weird.

446
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,610
- Heh. Dad, she'll be okay.
- Yeah, I know she'll be okay.

447
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,042
But okay at what is what bothers me. Unh!

448
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,129
- Dad?
- Unh.

449
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,327
Dad?

450
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,566
Oh, my God. Dad! Dad!

451
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,165
I can't get my breath.

452
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,807
- No.
- I can't breathe.

453
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,004
Dad, stay with me!
Daddy, Daddy, stay with me!

454
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,611
Hello! I need an ambulance.

455
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,644
My father's S.C.P.D. Yes. Now!

456
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,406
Daddy, stay with me. Dad?

457
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,005
Thea?

458
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,444
Thea.

459
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,683
Roy, I'm sorry.

460
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,603
I made a mistake.

461
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,286
I thought I could still be with you.

462
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,046
I thought I could still be Thea Queen.

463
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,891
But Thea Queen was trusting.

464
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,929
And I don't trust you.

465
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,363
Or anyone. Not anymore.

466
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,202
Thea Queen was also weak, and no matter
what it takes, I will be strong.

467
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,969
Don't try to find me.

468
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,451
You won't.

469
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,484
Even I don't know where I'm going.

470
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,444
I only know one thing.

471
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,807
I am never coming back.

472
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,324
Where am I?

473
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,967
As far away from the world
as I could get you.

474
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,002
Where you can't hurt anyone ever again.

475
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,491
That's your weakness, kid.

476
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,802
You don't have the guts to kill me.

477
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,331
No.

478
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,401
I have the strength to let you live.

479
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,762
Oh, you're a killer.

480
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,324
I know. I created you.

481
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,120
You've killed plenty.

482
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,924
Yes, I have.

483
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,807
You helped turn me into a killer
when I needed to be one.

484
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,086
And I'm alive today because of you.

485
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,165
I made it home because of you.

486
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,049
And I got to see my family again.

487
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,730
But over the past year,
I've needed to be more...

488
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,124
and I faltered.

489
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,568
But then I stopped you...

490
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,046
without killing.

491
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,323
You helped me become a hero, Slade.

492
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,569
Thank you.

493
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,001
You think I won't get out of here?

494
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,285
You think I won't kill those you care for?

495
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,246
No, I don't, because you're in purgatory.

496
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,524
Well, I keep my promises, kid.

497
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,767
I keep my promises!

498
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,601
I keep my promises.

499
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,129
Last time I didn't notice
it's actually kind of beautiful here.

500
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,649
Don't get me wrong. I'm counting down the
seconds until we shove off Minefield Island.

501
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,041
You think that'll be enough to hold him?
A.R.G.U.S.' supermax?

502
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,846
Him and anyone else we send here.

503
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,805
This battle may be over,
but there will be others.

504
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,122
Starting with getting
my family's company back.

505
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,721
That's not gonna be easy,
since you're poor now.

506
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,649
You're gonna have to get a job.

507
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,041
If Slade doesn't scare you, that's got to.

508
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,330
Do you know anyone hiring ex-billionaires
with superior archery skills?

509
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,964
Hey, why don't I give you two a second?

510
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,681
Well, you did it.

511
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,763
- I had help.
- Yeah.

512
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,964
It was really smart,
the way you outfoxed him.

513
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,685
Talk about unthinkable.

514
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,729
You and me, I mean...

515
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,361
when you told me you loved me,
you had me fooled.

516
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,686
For a second I thought
maybe you might have meant it.

517
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,763
What you said.

518
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,363
You really sold it.

519
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,564
We both did.

520
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,606
Let's go home.

521
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,244
Dig, what was the news
about you and Lyla?

522
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,930
It can wait.

523
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,929
- I'm flying.
- Be my guest.

524
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,442
- I got one more question.
- Wouldn't be you if you didn't.

525
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,042
If you spent five years on this island,
when did you learn how to fly a plane?

526
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,402
My name is Amanda Waller, Mr. Queen.

527
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,561
We have a lot to discuss.

528
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,162
Welcome to Hong Kong.
