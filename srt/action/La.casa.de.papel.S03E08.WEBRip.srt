1
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:08,666
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,541
They think we're academics, not thieves.
Why are you so pessimistic?

3
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,000
How long have you known her?
Tatiana. How long?

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,166
Why does it matter? Love can't be timed!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,916
Love is to be lived.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,333
You can't risk the entire plan
for a woman.

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,750
That's the first rule.
Andrés, the first rule:

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,666
A job can't be poisoned
by an amorous relationship. Never.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,750
Never.

10
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,083
It's not that hard to understand.

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,333
You're so cute.

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,250
A loose end, just one,
will cost us our lives in there.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,083
Inside, our lives are at risk.
You need to understand that.

14
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,458
Dying is a possibility.

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,208
- No, only if you make mistakes!
- No.

16
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,500
No. That's the funny part.

17
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:54,458
You're heading into absolute chaos
and you insist on being in control.

18
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,625
Chaos doesn't exist in a perfect plan.

19
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,541
For God's sake, of course chaos exists.

20
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,916
Chaos always intrudes on life.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,916
You don't need to make mistakes
to get killed.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,541
How long do I have to live?

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,541
Three years. What mistake did I make?

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,583
What mistake did I make?

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,041
None.

26
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,083
It happens.

27
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,708
And you can't prevent it.
What mistake did Dad make?

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,666
- He must've made mistakes to end up dead.
- No, it's simpler than that.

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,125
A police patrol that was too close.

30
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,000
Or someone saw him enter,
or his weapon jammed.

31
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,666
Brother, you're clever.

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,750
Accident.

33
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,041
That's life's mystery.

34
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,791
That's why it doesn't make sense
to live like you do.

35
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,750
- How do I live, Andrés?
- Without Tatiana.

36
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,791
What I mean...

37
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,166
Without enjoyment.

38
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,541
In the end, that's the only thing
that matters.

39
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,875
We're here.

40
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,041
At every step.

41
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,500
Because some day,

42
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,916
something will go wrong.

43
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,375
It may cost your life...

44
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,416
or even something worse.

45
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,041
And on that day, you can't think

46
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:23,083
that you are guilty of something
you couldn't control. Do you understand?

47
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,958
That's life.

48
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,250
Enjoy it...

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,541
until the party is over.

50
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,375
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

51
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,166
Seville's detachment isn't enough?

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,833
No, I'm in a 170-hectare forest
with 183 houses to search.

53
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,541
Farms, huts, wells, and a search perimeter
I have to expand 20 kilometers every hour.

54
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,434
- <i>Madrid needs to come immediately.</i>
- I'll talk with Defense. They'll go.

55
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,458
Okay.

56
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,833
- Suárez, let's go to those farms.
- I'll take care of it.

57
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,541
Let's go!

58
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,541
Marseille is on his way here.

59
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,166
- Okay. Copy.
- <i>How are you?</i>

60
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,000
Very scared.

61
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,541
And very angry.

62
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,208
<i>And surrounded by chicken shit.</i>

63
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,875
I'm sorry, Raquel.

64
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,625
<i>I'm very sorry. I really am.</i>

65
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,041
<i>Look, I am...</i>

66
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,666
I'm quite old and you're my first love.

67
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,625
I don't know how to do this.
I don't know how to talk...

68
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,666
about this.
I only know I need you in my life.

69
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,208
<i>I've held on
to everything you've taught me.</i>

70
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,541
Like cooking together...

71
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,375
in our filthy boat.

72
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,166
Swimming fully clothed in the ocean.

73
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,458
And that Van Morrison guy is really good.
He is.

74
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,791
<i>I really like him.</i>

75
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,833
<i>Raquel, everything is better
because you're with me.</i>

76
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,875
Because I'm in love.

77
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,666
You could've told me before
that you were in love.

78
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,096
I'm telling you now because I don't know
how to say it to your face.

79
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,625
<i>Forgive me because...</i>

80
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,041
in our earlier argument,

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,541
who was really talking was...

82
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,500
the maladjusted one who doesn't know
how to enjoy life, the Professor.

83
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,750
<i>But Sergio, I...</i>

84
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,083
Raquel, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

85
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,916
I feel really rediculous here.

86
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,041
Crying.

87
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,625
While a hen stares at me.

88
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,000
Hens bring luck.

89
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,708
I don't know where.
Definitely not in the Chinese zodiac.

90
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,833
After what you've told me, I think
I'll be able to endure three hours.

91
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,750
We'll talk again in 15 minutes.
Frequency 144.

92
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,583
<i>Understood. Over and out.</i>

93
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,458
<i>I brought that champagne bottle
to drink with Rio.</i>

94
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,166
<i>While I was dancing,
I realized there are two kinds of people.</i>

95
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,083
<i>The ones who break up with you
and need to wish you the best.</i>

96
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,375
<i>Like, "Take care, be happy."</i>

97
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,791
<i>Rio is one of those.</i>

98
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,958
<i>Then there's the other kind.
We're a little bit more of a dick.</i>

99
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,916
I'm sorry. If you want,
I can wait outside.

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,416
No. At this point,
being shy doesn't make sense.

101
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,208
Rio, I wanted to say...

102
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,083
You did what we should have done
a long time ago.

103
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,458
Hey. Not a long time ago.

104
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,250
We had a lot of fun together.

105
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,166
And you're fucking crazy,
but you haven't headbutted me yet.

106
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,500
Yeah, we had our fun.

107
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,083
Good times.

108
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,875
But it wasn't enough.

109
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,208
The wave swept us away.

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,208
What wave, Tokyo?

111
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,333
What fucking wave are you talking about?

112
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,541
The robbery.

113
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,750
The pressure.

114
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,041
Being millionaires.

115
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,791
Hello, Denver.

116
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,375
I didn't hear anything.

117
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,500
- See you later.
- Where are you going, Denver?

118
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,500
- Don't go, don't go.
- What?

119
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,375
Rio, did you know
I almost hooked up with Denver?

120
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,375
Tokyo, what the fuck are you thinking?

121
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,625
- In Toledo. At that party.
- What are you talking about?

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You were drunk.

123
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,666
Yes, of course. He was drunk.

124
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,958
You were drunk. I was drunk.

125
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,125
No. Moscow came into the room
and ruined the moment.

126
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,666
What I'm saying

127
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,916
is that what we had was something casual.

128
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,791
Anything...

129
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,166
could have happened that day.

130
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
And now I wonder the same thing you do.

131
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,208
How could have we wasted
all this time together?

132
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,291
Thank you.

133
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:27,000
Rio, we didn't even kiss. Nothing.

134
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,875
<i>Love is like two people on a seesaw.</i>

135
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,666
<i>When one goes up, the other goes down.</i>

136
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,875
<i>The balance is always fucked.</i>

137
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,333
<i>Thanks to time, monotony,</i>

138
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,458
<i>or because of people like me.</i>

139
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,666
<i>The ones who only know one way
to get rid of pain:</i>

140
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,375
<i>by giving it back.</i>

141
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,041
Rio had a microphone and a GPS beacon.

142
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,125
<i>Everything was extracted. No problem.</i>

143
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,125
Did you isolate the chips?

144
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,041
Of course, dear.

145
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,708
<i>They're in the little box,
tuned in to the sweet sounds of sleep.</i>

146
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,500
<i>The police have been taking notes
on snoring for quite a while.</i>

147
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,291
<i>It's time to give them something else.</i>

148
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,125
<i>Palermo.</i>

149
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,208
Let's do the Alcatraz Plan now.

150
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,375
<i>Maximum urgency.</i>

151
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,750
The Alcatraz Plan?

152
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,166
<i>Sergio, what the fuck is happening
out there?</i>

153
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,416
We're in...

154
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,458
an extreme situation.

155
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,916
It's possible that, at some point,
Lisbon and I will be under such pressure

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,416
that it could overwhelm us.

157
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,541
We'll have the army on us.
The police as well.

158
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,791
Things may go wrong.

159
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,583
But, in that case,

160
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
we'll have the Alcatraz Plan.

161
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,541
If Lisbon and I see ourselves
in a critical situation,

162
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:06,791
we'll need the biggest
possible distraction tactic.

163
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,916
The objective is that the police will need

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
to look in two places at the same time.
And there's only one thing bigger

165
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,458
than capturing us two.

166
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,416
Capturing us all?

167
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,958
You escaping is the greatest bait
we can create.

168
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,041
They'll go mad.

169
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,958
Any news?

170
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,083
Colonel.

171
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,041
The seismic sensors indicate movement.

172
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,208
It's possible they're digging
with industrial machinery.

173
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,416
Bernardo!

174
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,416
You've studied that subsoil
to the point of exhaustion.

175
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,791
Tell me. Is there any possible way
they could escape through there?

176
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,416
I would say no, sir.

177
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,500
It's a very remote hypothesis.

178
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,041
Remote or impossible, Bernardo?

179
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,333
We'd be talking about an engineering job
with tunneling machines,

180
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,125
- more than 100 meters underground.
- So, Bernardo?

181
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,625
We can't underestimate them.

182
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,583
They could dig the Channel Tunnel
and we wouldn't notice.

183
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,083
- How many men are down there?
- Twenty-five men, sir.

184
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,086
Only 25 men?
Were there budget cuts or something?

185
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,208
Bring 50, 100 for every square meter.
I want an officer by every puddle.

186
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,708
They can't take a step without
being spotted. Get it together, Bernardo.

187
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,791
Yes, sir.

188
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,083
Let's go.

189
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,041
Bring me an expert who knows
every stone underground.

190
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,250
I want georadar, engineers, whatever!

191
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,125
Fuck everything! Come on!

192
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,625
What were you doing in there?

193
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,750
I was on a hike and I got lost, sir.

194
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,125
I came here to rest. I'm sorry.

195
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,708
And you hide in a chicken coop?

196
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:18,583
Well, I knocked on the door to the house,
but nobody answered. Please.

197
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,875
And those spikes?

198
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,625
Climbing.

199
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,208
There's no mountain here.

200
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,875
Or ice.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,750
Do you think I'm stupid?

202
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,000
I know who you are.

203
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,375
Raquel Murillo.

204
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,166
Okay.

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,541
I'll tell you the truth.

206
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
- Don't aim at me!
- Calm down.

207
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,041
- Don't! Put down your gun.
- Calm down.

208
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,041
What's your name?

209
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,416
- Put down the gun!
- Your name.

210
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,541
What's your name?

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,208
Tell me your name.

212
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,416
- Justino.
- Justino. Justino, calm down.

213
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,166
Look at me.

214
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,541
Now...

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,416
you have two guns aimed at you. And you...

216
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,750
You have a shotgun that kills birds.

217
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,916
You can hurt me.

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,083
But if you shoot me, you're dead.
So, put the weapon down.

219
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,708
Put it down, Justino.

220
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,250
Easy.

221
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,541
Easy. Yes.

222
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,458
You don't have a chance.

223
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,375
If I were you, I wouldn't risk my life.

224
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,500
They've asked for citizen cooperation.

225
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,458
And they're offering ten million euros
as a reward, ma'am.

226
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,708
Put down the guns.

227
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,583
Okay.

228
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,625
Okay.

229
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,541
Okay.

230
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,208
Don't move!

231
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,791
- Don't move!
- Step back!

232
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:32,791
Drop your weapons.

233
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,041
- Step back!
- Calm down.

234
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,500
Step back!

235
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,976
- Quiet, Justino.
- Step back, I say!

236
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Stop it, Justino.

237
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,500
Drop your weapons.

238
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,375
- I know this game, you don't.
- Do you think this is a game, ma'am?

239
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,041
You're police. I've seen you on TV.

240
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,583
You aren't going to shoot.

241
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,583
But we can. You've trespassed
onto our property.

242
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,541
And you have to have great aim
with both hands.

243
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,625
This rifle is for big-game hunting,
not for birds.

244
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,625
This makes holes.

245
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,083
Drop the fucking gun!

246
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,416
Okay.

247
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's do something. Okay?

248
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,583
Don't move.

249
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,375
What if we start negotiating?

250
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,250
Wow, so pretty.

251
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,416
So pretty.

252
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Very pretty.

253
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,416
Yes. And it's warm here. Look.

254
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,041
Here it is.

255
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,333
Hey! What are you doing?

256
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,083
Nairobi! Nairobi!

257
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,458
- What...
- We're both single now.

258
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,375
I see.

259
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,125
We can go buy kittens.

260
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,916
Yes. What happened?

261
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,458
Nothing. We...

262
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,250
We broke up.

263
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,541
- Things break. Love breaks.
- Come here.

264
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,875
Hey, guys!

265
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,458
- Come on.
- We came here with the cavalry...

266
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,708
Tokyo!

267
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,375
And then he shits all over me.

268
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,666
The oven!

269
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,291
- Listen to me.
- What?

270
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,583
Go upstairs and drink some coffee.
I'll come up later so we can talk.

271
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,916
- Not coffee, then I'll throw up.
- Yes. Then throw up.

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,708
- No.
- Yes. Throw up.

273
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,125
What?

274
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,708
I'm going to take a bath.

275
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,583
What bath? You're drunk as a skunk.

276
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,875
Yes, I'm going to take a bath.

277
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,583
I need the water
and being inside the darkness.

278
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,875
- Floating!
- Relax!

279
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,500
Let's go upstairs, the two of us,
so we can talk.

280
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,708
- A little bit.
- Sure.

281
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,958
Because you're in love
with the gang's fatty gay.

282
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,916
But I...

283
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,916
I had a good... love story.

284
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,291
I'm going to take a bath.

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

286
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Radio!

287
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,333
Denver. Come downstairs immediately
to pick up Tokyo.

288
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,083
- Hello, handsome!
- Let her be. She's funnier this way.

289
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,333
Shut your face hole, Matías.

290
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,333
If she wants to dive, I'll teach her.

291
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,708
Go back to work
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

292
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,791
Okay, okay.

293
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Okay.

294
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,500
Wow!

295
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,958
These ovens are at 1500 degrees Celsius.

296
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,583
- We can't babysit drunks right now.
- The alpha male.

297
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,416
What a buffalo you are, Bogotá.

298
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,625
- Stop messing around.
- Oh, I know.

299
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,166
You like Nairobi.

300
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,208
You like her ordering you around.

301
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,125
Stop messing around.

302
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,791
Okay. Then let's do something.

303
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:34,375
If I can't swim in water,
let me swim in gold like Uncle Scrooge.

304
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,250
Denver, you again?

305
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,875
Denver is here again.

306
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,166
Take her upstairs.

307
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,083
Tokyo, what the fuck are you doing?

308
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,958
What the fuck are you doing?
You're putting us at risk.

309
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,625
- I'm sorry.
- You're fucking sorry?

310
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,666
We're here because of you
and you're drunk.

311
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,791
If you aren't going to help,
at least don't get us killed.

312
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,708
So, fucking stop it now
because all of us have suffered.

313
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,208
I'm pathetic.

314
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,041
I'm not surprised he broke up with me.

315
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,750
Listen to me.

316
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,958
We came here to rescue Rio.

317
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,666
Didn't we? That's why we came.

318
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,250
Not to save your relationship.

319
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,166
And you got it done.

320
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,708
Because you're an amazing woman.

321
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,583
But you need to move on.

322
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,125
But I can't.

323
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,083
You think you can't.

324
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,125
But you can.

325
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,875
Repeat after me:

326
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,666
"I will move on

327
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,875
- because I'm the fucking best."
- I am...

328
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,458
No, no, no. Tokyo!

329
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,708
- What's up with you?
- I don't know.

330
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,125
Okay, but...

331
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,416
I'm sorry.

332
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,125
No harm done. Okay?

333
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,500
- Okay.
- No harm...

334
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,916
No. We aren't doing this. Okay?

335
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,791
- No. Okay.
- Stop that.

336
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,416
- I beg you.
- I won't do anything.

337
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,333
Please.

338
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,000
- I won't do anything.
- Okay.

339
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,125
- You stay put.
- I will.

340
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,458
That's not what I mean!
No. We're going up.

341
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,416
Stop. Hey, hey. Stop right now.

342
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,875
I'm not joking.

343
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,458
You wanted it before.

344
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,875
Get out.

345
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,166
Get out.

346
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,416
Oh, my God.

347
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,708
They will try to put at least a mic
and a GPS beacon in Rio.

348
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,125
And we'll use it to our favor.

349
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,958
In the Alcatraz Plan.

350
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,666
So, they'll think we're fleeing.

351
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,333
To make them feel that we're fleeing.

352
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,708
<i>It's much more powerful.</i>

353
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,291
Stop. Stop, Helsinki!

354
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,753
The seismic sensor isn't emitting
any signal now.

355
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,875
<i>There's the hole.</i>

356
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,666
Adding sound effects to their fear is
the biggest generator of paranoia ever.

357
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,208
<i>We can make them believe anything.</i>

358
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,458
The gallery.

359
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,875
- <i>Hurry, call Palermo.</i>
- Gallery?

360
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,833
Is there any gallery at that depth?

361
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,166
No.

362
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,875
There's none.

363
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,000
It can't be. There must be something.
Look for it!

364
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,875
- There isn't any gallery under that point.
- Find it!

365
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,666
<i>Listen.</i>

366
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,916
An escape is tension.

367
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,583
It's emotion, it's darkness.

368
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:11,541
It's the cavity's echo,
the subsurface humidity.

369
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,500
<i>They have to feel all of that.</i>

370
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:15,958
And they will.

371
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,875
They're in a flooded gallery.

372
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,500
Turn the volume up.

373
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,125
There's an echo.

374
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,916
Where's Nairobi?

375
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,666
She's not done melting.

376
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:43,625
Tell her to come down. We have enough.
We're leaving now!

377
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,083
Can they melt 90 tons of gold

378
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,041
- in two days?
- No. That's impossible.

379
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,750
Engineer, is it possible or not
to melt 90 tons in two days?

380
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:56,916
They would need 150 or 200 ovens.
I have to do some calculations.

381
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Technically, it's possible, but...

382
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,166
Improbable.

383
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,166
If they did probable things,
they'd be out robbing savings banks.

384
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,500
They'll question their ears so much

385
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:09,375
that they'll need confirmation
from another sense.

386
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:11,666
Sight.

387
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:16,041
And that's when the gang's new member
would come into play.

388
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,916
Be good, Sofía. It's your turn.

389
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,583
<i>Sofía.</i>

390
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,750
We'll put the geolocation chip in Sofía,

391
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,541
<i>and we'll get her ready while we keep
bombarding them with sound.</i>

392
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:50,750
What the fuck is that?

393
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,708
It sounds like a four-stroke engine.

394
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,791
An engine?

395
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,791
It could be an outboard motor.

396
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,416
With a recoil starter.

397
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,250
Who gives a fuck about the recoil starter?
They're leaving.

398
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,833
They're leaving!

399
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:08,041
And they could only think one thing
because there's a clear precedent.

400
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,791
And they won't like it.

401
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,208
It's Chapo Guzmán's modus operandi.

402
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,958
The Altiplano jail escape.

403
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,333
I'm here.

404
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,208
<i>We're all here now.</i>

405
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What is that?

406
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,208
Carts.

407
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:35,041
Carts!

408
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,333
And then it will be time...

409
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,041
to unleash the madness.

410
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,041
<i>We will release Sofía.</i>

411
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,333
Satellite confirmation. They're moving.

412
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,833
At what speed are they moving?

413
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,250
Eighteen kilometers per hour.

414
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,875
Fuck, at that pace,
they'll be in Alcorcón in 30 minutes.

415
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,208
What's up, Ángel?

416
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:03,416
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

417
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,125
- <i>It's urgent.</i>
- Urgent? Fuck, no.

418
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,968
They're taking the gold out
through a tunnel.

419
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The national reserve,
on carts propelled by outboard motors!

420
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,000
The Emergency Unit stays in Madrid.

421
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:18,833
We'll inhibit the mic's signal
so they'll only have the satellite.

422
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:19,916
<i>Then...</i>

423
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,666
they'll have to follow us blindly
to where the GPS indicates.

424
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,416
Wherever Sofía goes.

425
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,958
We've lost sound.

426
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,791
The signal is out of range.

427
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:32,958
They're going very deep.

428
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,500
Call the underground unit!

429
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,416
And I want a detachment outside the sewer.

430
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,875
Deploy units now!

431
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,666
Suárez.

432
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,666
We only have two farms left. We're close.

433
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,541
Okay.

434
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:54,333
Gentlemen!

435
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,416
We're leaving!

436
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,833
Forty meters.

437
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:12,083
Come on, come on, come on.

438
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,458
Come on.

439
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,625
Yes. Yes. We have them, Bernardo,
we have them.

440
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,708
Thirty meters.

441
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,250
You're next to them, Bernardo.

442
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:26,916
Next to them!

443
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:28,875
Come on!

444
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,541
Fifteen meters.

445
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,291
They're at the other end of the corner.

446
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,125
They stopped.

447
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,083
Let's go.

448
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,125
Seven meters.

449
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,875
Slowly.

450
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Five meters.

451
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:55,958
Bernardo!

452
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,458
Three meters.

453
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:00,458
<i>Two.</i>

454
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,208
- They're here. They're here.
- Bernardo, what's going on? What?

455
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,041
- Where are they?
- They're here.

456
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,458
A meter and a half away.

457
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,375
Fuck. What's that?

458
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
<i>Colonel.</i>

459
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,125
It's a ferret.

460
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,375
<i>It's dressed as Dalí.</i>

461
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,208
Those fuckers.

462
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,208
Those fuckers.

463
00:29:25,416 --> 00:29:27,708
<i>Cutting off visual communication.</i>

464
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,958
This news isn't that bad, Tamayo.
Read the situation.

465
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,625
Really? Enlighten me.

466
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,541
They're faking an escape.

467
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:43,250
It's an extreme distraction tactic.

468
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,125
He's fucked
and he wants us to look elsewhere.

469
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:51,083
You're stressed. Aren't you?

470
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,291
But I assure you,
he's on the verge of collapse.

471
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,750
It's all part of his fucking plan.

472
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,708
Yes, but he isn't the only one with plans.

473
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:06,666
It's the moment to hit them
where it hurts the most.

474
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:10,958
We have to attack.

475
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,250
Go straight for the heart.

476
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,500
Break them from the inside out.

477
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,333
I know how to do it.

478
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,166
How?

479
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,416
It's already in motion.

480
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,583
All of it.

481
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:36,541
<i>I have money.</i>

482
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,041
The police do, too.

483
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:39,583
Ten million.

484
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,166
Are you sure you've heard my name
on the news?

485
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,083
- Of course we're sure.
- Because...

486
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,541
they're offering ten million,
but that's for the Professor.

487
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,166
And that's not even true.

488
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,458
All the rewards have small print.

489
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,625
We're farmers, but we aren't stupid.

490
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,625
They've said it on the news, on TV.
Everywhere.

491
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,416
I've been a police agent
and I know rewards...

492
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,291
are never paid. Never.

493
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,375
Tom Lee, a businessman from Michigan.

494
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,083
He gave crucial information
about Bin Laden's whereabouts.

495
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,250
They were offering $25 million.

496
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,041
He's still trying to claim it.

497
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,541
I'm not lying. You can look it up online.

498
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,750
I can offer you money.

499
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,833
Today.

500
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,666
And a lot more than what
the police are offering.

501
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,250
How much?

502
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,083
What do you think about 15 million?

503
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,250
Fifteen?

504
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,458
Alert everyone of any movement.

505
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,500
<i>Everyone, be alert.</i>

506
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,125
<i>Perimeter covered.</i>

507
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,750
Windows. Watch the windows.

508
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,625
<i>Copy, sir. Watch the third floor.</i>

509
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,208
<i>West side.</i>

510
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,166
<i>Covered.</i>

511
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,291
What a bitch.

512
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:37,625
Come here.

513
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,250
You're the biggest piece of shit on earth.

514
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,875
We came here to rescue you

515
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,416
and the first thing you do is break up
with Tokyo?

516
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,458
Denver, that's a personal matter.

517
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,583
It's not fucking personal.
Tokyo is a time bomb. You knew that.

518
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,041
Ask her for forgiveness.

519
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,750
Ask her to be your girlfriend
or to marry you.

520
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,416
Whatever the fuck you want.

521
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:00,875
And once you get out of here,
break up with her. But not here.

522
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:02,916
Maybe you could grow up some.

523
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,833
A pregnant woman
with a teddy bear is coming.

524
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,291
Did anyone call the circus?
What the fuck is happening?

525
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,041
<i>Watching left side.</i>

526
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,375
<i>Entering high security perimeter.</i>

527
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,375
<i>Everything's in order.</i>

528
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,458
<i>Perimeter covered.</i>

529
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,416
<i>Roof and upper floor?</i>

530
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,750
<i>Affirmative.</i>

531
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,708
She's crazy.

532
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,500
We have to get that bear.

533
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,875
We're on it right now.

534
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,208
I'll do it.

535
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,041
Nairobi!

536
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,625
- Stop, Nairobi.
- What?

537
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,333
We have a protocol.

538
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,458
What's gotten into you?

539
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Nothing.

540
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,250
Denver.

541
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,416
The volunteer.

542
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,166
I have him.

543
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,166
What are you looking at?

544
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,250
Come here.

545
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,250
Come here. Look.

546
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,916
We're going out there to get a teddy bear.

547
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,208
But won't that be dangerous?

548
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,541
It's not dangerous. Go.

549
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Stop!

550
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,125
Don't do it, boy.
Don't try to be a hero. It's not worth it.

551
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,833
You know perfectly well that it's a trap.
You can't send him out.

552
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,625
This is practically suicide.

553
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,666
You're condemning that boy
to certain death.

554
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,208
Damn!
You're sending him to the slaughterhouse!

555
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,500
It could be explosives!

556
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,708
If it were explosives, I would send you!

557
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,166
Shut up!

558
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,750
Come. It's your moment.
We've talked about this. Remember?

559
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,166
Hey, listen to me.

560
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,291
I believe in you. I believe in you.
Be calm and composed.

561
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,666
Amanda is watching.

562
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,791
Come on, hurry. Come on!

563
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:03,875
Masks!

564
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,333
Rio!

565
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,166
They're opening the doors, sir.

566
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,750
Hostages with fake weapons, sir.

567
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,416
I can see them, Antoñanzas!
I can see them!

568
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,833
I'm a hostage, don't shoot!

569
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:33,916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla
from Totana, Murcia.

570
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,708
Intern at the Systems Department.

571
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,458
Be careful with the masked ones.
There could be thieves among them.

572
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,500
<i>Understood, sir. We're alert.</i>

573
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,000
<i>Waiting for orders.</i>

574
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,041
<i>He's grabbing the teddy bear.</i>

575
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,541
The bomb is inside.

576
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,750
Mission accomplished, Mr. Denver.

577
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,333
Very well, Miguel.

578
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,666
Now, give it to me.

579
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:17,125
Be careful with any sudden movements.

580
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,500
Take it to the X-ray.

581
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,291
I can go out for any exchange,
Mr. Palermo.

582
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,791
There's a phone here,

583
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,208
but there's no bomb.

584
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,333
- There's another thing.
- Open it, Helsinki.

585
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,041
The phone.

586
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,333
You bitch!

587
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,125
The fuck do you want?

588
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,041
To make you an offer.

589
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:29,833
Go to hell.

590
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,208
Okay.

591
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,250
Where do you think you're going?
Did it strike a chord...

592
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:37,333
Let me go.

593
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,375
What the fuck is happening here?

594
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,083
I don't know what the fuck is wrong
with her, but I want her here.

595
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,666
Now! Go!

596
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,083
- No. No.
- What?

597
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,166
- I'll go.
- No, you won't.

598
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,333
I said, I'll go.

599
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:08,250
Between the police and the thieves,
I trust the police.

600
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,000
These thieves have dumped
140 million euros on the center of Madrid.

601
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,708
Do you really think we don't have 15 or 20
to give you in exchange for your help?

602
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,000
Yes, but that's dirty money.

603
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,666
- The police's money is legal.
- It's legal.

604
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,833
If you hand me over,
you'll be outcasts.

605
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,833
As soon as they have me,
they'll disappear,

606
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:30,750
but you won't.

607
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,583
You'll be on every TV.

608
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,250
The couple that handed Lisbon over.
They'll hate you.

609
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:39,208
Everyone here loves us. Do you know why?

610
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:44,083
Because we came back to rescue a friend
who was being tortured.

611
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:48,000
And those torturers are the same
who are offering you the ten million.

612
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:50,750
So, think it over.

613
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,000
And take the money.

614
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,208
You'll have it in two hours.

615
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,458
And nobody will ever know about this.

616
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,708
I give you my word.

617
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:11,291
Okay.

618
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,166
Fuck.

619
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,791
It's the police.
The police are here, Justino.

620
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,333
That's your son's bear, isn't it?

621
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,958
It doesn't smell like him anymore.

622
00:39:58,833 --> 00:39:59,833
Nairobi.

623
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,708
They did it to hurt you.

624
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:05,291
Yeah. I know.

625
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,458
And now I'm really fucked because...

626
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,625
the only thing I want now...

627
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,125
is to smell my son.

628
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,375
I'm a bad mother.

629
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
No.

630
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,125
No, Nairobi.

631
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,000
You were the mother you could be.

632
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,500
And you paid for it.

633
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,375
You paid a lot. And you're still paying.

634
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,791
You don't know shit.

635
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,625
Do you know what I did with this bear?

636
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,708
I'm so ashamed
that not even Helsinki knows about it.

637
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,416
When they called me to buy drugs,

638
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,583
I took my son to the park.

639
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:54,708
I dressed him up.

640
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:57,750
He sat in his chair.

641
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,708
And I gave him his bear.

642
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,125
And inside the bear, his mom...

643
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:06,875
hid pills...

644
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,875
cocaine...

645
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
heroine...

646
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,875
and whatever else I needed.

647
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,208
That's how I took my kid to the park.

648
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:22,958
I used him...

649
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,666
as a mule.

650
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,916
So, they took him away from me.

651
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,750
And they were right to do it.

652
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,666
<i>I've brought your son here.</i>

653
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:10,416
- What?
- <i>Axel.</i>

654
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,333
<i>He's here with me.</i>

655
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,041
That's not true.

656
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,125
It is.

657
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:25,333
He's in front of me, one meter away.
He's as funny as ever.

658
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,833
<i>But he's nine. Axel.</i>

659
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:31,416
- What do you want to be when you grow up?
- A cook.

660
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,416
<i>- What?
- A cook.</i>

661
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,375
What?

662
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,625
A cook!

663
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,541
- <i>He wants to be a cook.</i>
- You're lying. I'm gonna hang up.

664
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:39,958
Don't hang up.

665
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,666
I have something to offer you.

666
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,041
<i>But first of all,</i>

667
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,625
I'll show you I don't lie.

668
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,125
I don't trust bitches like you.

669
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,375
Yes. I don't either.

670
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:54,875
Come, Axel.

671
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,875
Let's do something.

672
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,041
I'm going out there...

673
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,166
with him.

674
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:03,708
And you will see
that what I'm saying is true.

675
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:06,041
Then we'll talk.

676
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,333
I have something important to tell you.

677
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,166
- Permission to shoot?
- My son.

678
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,208
- Shoot.
- Nairobi, get out of there!

679
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:57,083
Nairobi. Nairobi. Don't touch it. Don't.

680
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,333
No!

681
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,333
Help!

682
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,291
Help! Come here!

683
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,916
Please, hide me somewhere.

684
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,958
Please. You have to hide me.

685
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:10,333
Hide me somewhere, please!

686
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,416
Twenty million.

687
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,333
Yes. Fine.

688
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,791
I have two million in my bag.

689
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,416
Once I'm out of here,
I'll give you the rest.

690
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,958
- I swear.
- Don't listen to her.

691
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,416
There's no time, Justino!

692
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,875
Stop! Stop that!

693
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,833
Calm down. It's a radio.
I want you to hear this.

694
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,375
<i>Professor. It's Lisbon. I'm surrounded.</i>

695
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,083
I need to give 18 million to some people
so they'll help me. Is it possible?

696
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,916
Of course. We'll give it to them
as soon as possible.

697
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,583
He never betrays his word. Neither do I.

698
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:38,833
Twenty million.

699
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,375
Do you accept?

700
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:44,541
They have dogs.

701
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,458
They will find her.
We will go to jail, Justino.

702
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:49,958
We have the trapdoor.

703
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,958
I can cover it with manure.

704
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,841
<i>- The dogs won't smell her.
- There's no time!</i>

705
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,041
- Please, Reni.
- Please!

706
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:58,791
No.

707
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,458
Help, please.

708
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,291
Nairobi! Nairobi, please. Hold on!

709
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,791
Nairobi. Let me do it. Nairobi.

710
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,458
You have to hold on, Nairobi!

711
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,500
I'm really fucked, Helsi.

712
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,791
The bullet's inside.

713
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,625
It's inside. That's good, that's good.

714
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:23,833
We'll get it out.

715
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,375
Gauze! Gauze!

716
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,041
Give me the gauze.

717
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,208
They must be busy playing doctor now.

718
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,916
- We'll go all in. Won't we?
- It's time.

719
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,833
Gentlemen, launch the attack!

720
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:45,833
Armored units, go.

721
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,125
We're going to knock down that damn gate.

722
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:08,625
Raquel.

723
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,750
Let's go.

724
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:14,916
They're going to hide me in a basement.

725
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,166
Stop there!

726
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,333
Raquel Murillo is inside here!

727
00:46:24,416 --> 00:46:26,000
She's talking to the Professor.

728
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,083
- Delta.
- Drop the gun!

729
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,833
Easy, easy.

730
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,041
- Is it inside?
- Yes. It's inside.

731
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:38,041
- Morphine!
- They got me good.

732
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,375
It ripped me apart.

733
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,458
No.

734
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,750
Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!

735
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,708
Against the tree!

736
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,750
- Against the tree!
- I didn't do anything.

737
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,583
- Please.
- Sierra, do you hear me?

738
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,666
- Yeah, talk to me.
<i>- We have Murillo.</i>

739
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,166
<i>She's talking to the Professor.</i>

740
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,541
What do you want me to do?

741
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,750
- Don't move!
- No, Justino, no.

742
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,416
<i>- Don't move!
- Hide me.</i>

743
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Don't move!

744
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:05,916
On your knees!

745
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,916
I'm going to give you morphine
to get the bullet out.

746
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,125
Hold on.

747
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:13,875
Hold on.

748
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:15,541
- Morphine!
- Morphine, here.

749
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:20,083
Justino, help me.

750
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,541
I can't.

751
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:25,041
Velasco, Solana, come with me.
The rest, surround the house.

752
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,000
Police!

753
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,166
There's nothing to do now.

754
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:32,833
Guys!

755
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,625
Guys, guys, guys!

756
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,958
They're coming with fucking tanks!

757
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,041
Fuck!

758
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:44,708
Police! Police!

759
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,416
- Put down your weapon!
- Hands where I can see them!

760
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,583
Hands on your head!

761
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,041
Sir, get out of here.

762
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:53,708
Raquel.

763
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,375
Why are you sending him outside, Suárez?

764
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,333
- Don't go, Justino, don't go!
- She's dangerous. I order you to leave.

765
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,208
- What are you going to do?
- Suárez.

766
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,333
I'm handing myself over. I'm unarmed.
What are you doing?

767
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,666
Velasco, take this citizen outside!

768
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,750
- What are you going to do?
- Justino, don't leave. Don't leave!

769
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:18,250
What are you going to do?

770
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,958
- Justino!
- Against the tree.

771
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,333
Against the tree! Don't move!

772
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:26,291
Suárez, I'm not a threat.

773
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,291
You're the biggest threat, bitch.

774
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,583
You sold us all out, traitor!

775
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,875
Suárez, put down the gun.

776
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,333
Where is the Professor?

777
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,583
Raquel, tell them you'll give me up.
Buy time until I can get there.

778
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,041
<i>Raquel, tell him.</i>

779
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:43,750
Where is the Professor?

780
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,250
I don't know where he is.

781
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,916
Raquel, I'm on my way. Raquel.

782
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,791
Where is the Professor?

783
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,875
I don't know!

784
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Are you sure?

785
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:56,166
Because I'm only going to ask you
once more.

786
00:48:57,708 --> 00:48:59,083
Get out of there!

787
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,333
<i>Get out of there!</i>

788
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,208
I don't know where the Professor is.

789
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,750
I don't.

790
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:08,750
Wrong answer.

791
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:18,958
I'm on my way.
Get out of there. Get out of there!

792
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,458
It was self-defense.

793
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,541
Do you understand, Solana?

794
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,666
<i>She shot first.</i>

795
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,708
<i>Take the weapon. Clean the fingerprints.
Put it in her hand.</i>

796
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,416
Professor, it's Palermo.

797
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:00,333
Get ready for immediate intervention.

798
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:04,708
As soon as we knock down that gate,
we're going in with all the troops.

799
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,708
<i>Professor, it's Palermo. Do you copy?</i>

800
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,583
Professor, it's Palermo. Do you copy?

801
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,291
<i>Sergio! Are you there?</i>

802
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Sergio!

803
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,375
They've executed Lisbon.

804
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,083
They've taken down Nairobi here.

805
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,000
A sniper. It's really serious.

806
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,250
- Hold on.
- Yes.

807
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,791
Almost.

808
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,125
I saw my son.

809
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,458
Just now.

810
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:52,250
He's fine.

811
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,833
He's fine.

812
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,125
He's fine.

813
00:50:56,416 --> 00:51:00,250
Palermo! Palermo!
They're coming with a tank.

814
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,875
They're going to knock down the door.

815
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,166
We're being attacked.

816
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,625
Palermo...

817
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,291
this isn't a robbery...

818
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,625
or a challenge to the system.

819
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,208
This is war.

820
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,083
Act accordingly.

821
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,416
Sir...

822
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,208
it was an honor to be under your command.

823
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,500
DEFCON 2!

824
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,541
Denver! Come!

825
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,958
Ready.

826
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,791
When he turns 18,

827
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:43,291
give him the money and tell him
who his mother was.

828
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:44,833
No.

829
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,583
- Swear it to me.
- Yes.

830
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,166
Look at me.

831
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:49,916
You will do it yourself.

832
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Okay?

833
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,875
You are going to get out of here
and you'll do whatever you want.

834
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,375
- Helsinki! DEFCON 2 now!
- Palermo!

835
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,708
Not now! I'm with Nairobi now, Palermo.

836
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I'll go!

837
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,291
Sir, we're ready for the assault.

838
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:23,416
Now!

839
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:38,375
Attention! Clear this area.
Two groups, two corners. Now!

840
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,291
On your knees with your hands
on your head!

841
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:49,541
Come on!

842
00:52:58,583 --> 00:52:59,916
Come on, Rio. Come on.

843
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,166
In position.

844
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:06,791
Wait for it.

845
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,208
Wait for it.

846
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,375
Gates!

847
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,208
Fire!

848
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:53,250
<i>The Professor had fallen for his own trap.</i>

849
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,125
<i>The ear's ability to elicit paranoia.</i>

850
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:09,416
<i>That's the card Sierra had played...</i>

851
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,583
Pretend to execute her.

852
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,541
<i>He'll be listening.</i>

853
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:16,583
<i>...to destroy us.</i>

854
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,000
<i>Then, it was war.</i>
