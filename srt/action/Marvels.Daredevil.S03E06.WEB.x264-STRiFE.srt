1
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,690
Karen, the gun. Where is it?

2
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,190
Bottom of the Hudson.

3
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,440
Did you touch the body?

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,900
He said he was gonna kill you.

5
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,870
You and Matt and my family.

6
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,870
He said I would die
knowing I got you all killed.

7
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,080
Karen, that's awful, but, please,
you have to focus.

8
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,000
Did you touch the body?

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,590
No. I don't think so.

10
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,350
What about your clothes?
Get blood on them?

11
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,420
I threw them away.

12
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,380
Foggy, can you not talk
to me like a lawyer and just...

13
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,930
just talk to me?

14
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,520
I want you to tell me
that I'm a bad person.

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,810
I can't say that.

16
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,730
Why... why not?

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,940
Because you're not.

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,110
Then why are you looking at me like that?

19
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,370
Because my friend...

20
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,920
my amazing, kind, brilliant friend...

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,380
went through something terrible.

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,840
And I didn't know.

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,390
When I got the gun,
I could've called the cops.

24
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,880
I could've run.

25
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,640
You were afraid for your life.
It was self-defense.

26
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,350
Seven times.

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,270
What?

28
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,980
I shot him...

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,820
seven times...

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,900
because I wanted him dead.

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,970
Hey, Karen.

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,150
You need to pay me back for your rent.

33
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,570
I've been staying where I grew up.

34
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,110
There's a reason I stayed away, Karen.

35
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,660
Yeah, if you say it was to protect me,
I'm seriously gonna throw up.

36
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,530
I can't protect you.

37
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,870
Not from Fisk.

38
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,080
Can't even protect myself.

39
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,130
Sure you don't want coffee?

40
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,500
If you wanna yell at me...

41
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,380
go right ahead.

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,890
Did I ever tell you about my old neighbor,
when I was growing up?

43
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,850
Mr. Larssen.

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,230
Well, he was this nice Norwegian guy.

45
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,060
He let his wife do his talking.

46
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,780
But on the days when it'd get really cold
you know, and stuff would freeze,

47
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,360
and you'd need help moving your car
or, uh... unstick a door,

48
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,990
Mr. Larssen was always there.

49
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,620
So, one winter,
his wife hit a patch of black ice.

50
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,370
The whole town turned out for her funeral.

51
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,340
And Mr. Larssen sat there
through the sermon...

52
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,300
and then he gathered up his casseroles

53
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,550
and went back to work on the farm,
like it was just another day.

54
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,830
He never said a word about it.

55
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,300
And I thought I'd go over there
and be a good neighbor...

56
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,010
see if he wanted to talk
about what happened.

57
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,560
And you know what he said?

58
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
"What for?"

59
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,290
You know what?

60
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,250
You came to Foggy
because you needed something from him.

61
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,630
What do you need from me, Matt?

62
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,510
Fisk staged the attack on himself
in prison.

63
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,190
That's how he, uh, tricked the FBI
into moving him to a hotel.

64
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,650
Got some lifer named Jasper Evans
to shank him

65
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,570
and then arranged for him
to walk out of prison.

66
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,830
On the books, Evans is in solitary.

67
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,370
In reality, he's been set free.

68
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,330
- Can you prove that?
- Yeah, if I can find him.

69
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,000
Get him to talk to you.

70
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,300
Bulletin publishes the details.
Fisk is exposed.

71
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,800
And the FBI will be forced
to send him back to prison.

72
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,600
So, yeah, you're right.
I came to you 'cause I needed something.

73
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,770
Your help.

74
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,360
What do you say? You wanna help me?

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
No.

76
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,950
And I'm serious about the rent.

77
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,840
You probably don't remember me.
I'm Julie.

78
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,010
Do you wanna hang out after?

79
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,140
How did you know I worked there
for three years?

80
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,680
You were only there for one.

81
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,470
Let go of me, Dex.

82
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,730
I said let go!

83
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,560
Let go of me, Dex. I said let go!

84
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,600
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

85
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,400
It just works better
with a North Star to guide you.

86
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,070
What if I can't find one?

87
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,030
Then you'll rely
on our structure.

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,360
A tidy physical space.
A disciplined vocation...

89
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,500
This paper
takes its sourcing seriously.

90
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,800
We don't publish unverified innuendo,
you know?

91
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,010
Gossip...

92
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,050
Ah, Ms. Page.
Yeah, I'm not boring you, am I?

93
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,970
Anyway, in other news,
our illustrious publisher,

94
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,390
in his infinite wisdom,

95
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,390
has decided to change
our health care coverage, yet again.

96
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,860
You should be getting your enrollment
packages sometime in the next week.

97
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,320
I've already had a look at it.
My advice to you is, try not to get sick.

98
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,360
Uh, any questions?

99
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,040
It's total bullshit.
I can't believe Matt would even ask.

100
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,840
- But I still think you should help him.
- Oh, come on.

101
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,050
Just hear me out.

102
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,510
You agree to write the article
on one condition.

103
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,630
Matt turns himself in to the FBI.

104
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,890
What? No.

105
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,720
They're only up in our chili
because they're looking for Matt.

106
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,060
Once they have him...

107
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,980
- But he can't.
- He'll never agree to it.

108
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,020
There's no reason to think the FBI
knows anything about Matt's other life.

109
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,360
But if he can give 'em that witness,
Matt's in the clear.

110
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,860
So we all are.

111
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,030
I could reach out as Matt's attorney
and negotiate his surrender.

112
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,870
Okay, but I'm not ready to forgive him.

113
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,460
I get it.

114
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,760
You know, you shouldn't be either.

115
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,090
I mean, he... he stole your identity,
he made you a target.

116
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,720
Has Matt been a shitty friend lately?
Without a doubt.

117
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,060
But, deep down, I think it's hurting him
as much as it's hurting us.

118
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,400
How do you figure?

119
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,150
Because he could've gone to any reporter,
Karen, but he came to you.

120
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,700
Maybe Matt's finally coming to his senses.

121
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,450
But even if he isn't, the way
he's been treating us lately is on him.

122
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,200
Us turning our backs would be on us.

123
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,500
People have bailed on Matt his whole life,
and I'm not gonna be one of 'em.

124
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,340
You do what you want, but...

125
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,010
that's not the kind of friend I wanna be.

126
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,600
It's like you argue for a living
or something.

127
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,890
Was it too much? It felt like too much.

128
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,190
Matt said he was staying
at the place where he grew up.

129
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,280
Do you know where that is?

130
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
Don't you look pretty today.

131
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,420
You know you're two hours early, right?

132
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,390
- Yeah, the, uh, the neighbors kept me up.
- Again?

133
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,510
Shit. You gotta move.
Or get them into couples therapy.

134
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
If those were my neighbors,

135
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,770
I'd go over there
and give them a piece of my mind.

136
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,310
Do you think a killer like that
deserves a second chance?

137
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,190
Your internal compass
isn't broken, Dex.

138
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,030
It just works better
with a North Star to guide you.

139
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,030
Let go of me, Dex. I said let go!

140
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,990
Then you'll rely on
our structure.

141
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,570
A tidy physical space. A disciplined...

142
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,280
Do you wanna hang out after?

143
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,580
- Yeah.
- Where'd you go?

144
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,920
It's feeding time.

145
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,000
You know, I, uh... I got it.

146
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,920
You sure?
You're not even on the clock yet.

147
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,510
Yeah, I could use a decent cup of coffee.

148
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,890
You mind going downstairs
and grabbing me one?

149
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,390
And I'll feed the animal.

150
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,010
He's all yours.

151
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,480
I don't know what strings you had
to pull to get that waitress a job,

152
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,190
but it was a waste of your time.

153
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,360
Yeah, they train us
in counterintel at Quantico.

154
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,980
You really think I'm gonna fall
for some bush-league honey trap?

155
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,660
You got it in your head
that she means something to me.

156
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,700
But she doesn't.

157
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,120
She doesn't mean shit to me.

158
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,630
So what? You...

159
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,630
You have me tailed for a few days,
you think you know me?

160
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,130
Think you got me dialed?

161
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,260
You don't, all right?

162
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,470
You don't know anything about me.

163
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,770
Say something!

164
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,360
When I was a boy...

165
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,530
I...

166
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,530
beat my father's skull in with a hammer.

167
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,410
I was 12 years old.

168
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,330
Young for my age, in fact.
Terribly inexperienced.

169
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,920
I'd never been to a dance
with a girl or...

170
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,550
stayed up past midnight.

171
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,090
Never been out of the city
or even taken the subway on my own.

172
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,050
Yet there I was...

173
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,890
twelve years old...

174
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,230
standing over my father's body...

175
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,560
watching him die by my hand.

176
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,780
That feeling.

177
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,910
That moment.

178
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,620
I sense it's something
you're familiar with.

179
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,710
You...

180
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,840
were taught to hide beneath many fictions.

181
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,930
You fashioned yourself

182
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,560
into something the world would tolerate.

183
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,600
A soldier doing his patriotic duty.
A sniper in the FBI.

184
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,070
The watchful companion
of a nice young woman.

185
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,030
You destroyed what we had.

186
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,320
If it were honest and true,
no one could've destroyed it.

187
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,540
I should've let you die.

188
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,080
Stay back.

189
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,830
Julie never would've understood you.

190
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,380
And society won't either.

191
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,260
It punishes people like you.

192
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,640
Like us.

193
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,910
Julie never would've
understood you. The real you.

194
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,040
She never would've understood
the real you.

195
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,250
And society won't either.

196
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,170
- It punishes people like you. Like us.
- It's all over the papers. Dex?

197
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,630
Dex? Dex!

198
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,340
What?

199
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,930
They're throwing you under the bus.

200
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,430
I'm sorry, Dex.

201
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,980
It isn't right.

202
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,250
Sister Maggie?

203
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,130
Can I help you?

204
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,630
Uh, yes. Uh, one of the nuns said
I should speak with you.

205
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,510
Um...

206
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,180
I'm looking for Matt Murdock.

207
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,640
I'm sure he swore you to secrecy, but...

208
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,230
he came to see me this morning.

209
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,770
Asked for my help.

210
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,650
Uh, is he here?

211
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,030
No, he's not.

212
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,160
Okay. I'm sorry. Sorry to bother you.

213
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,920
"And some bloody their fists
trying to keep the Kitchen safe."

214
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,920
I wrote that.

215
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
It was in your piece about Daredevil.

216
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,520
He's a complicated man.

217
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,980
Yes. Yes, he is.

218
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,320
I've read several of your articles
the past few days.

219
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,030
- I've been trying to find some insight.
- Mmm.

220
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Did you find any?

221
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,740
'Cause I sure as hell didn't.

222
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,370
Oh, I'm... sorry.

223
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,750
Wears you out, doesn't it?

224
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,380
Saving him from himself.

225
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,710
Yeah. I don't think I can do it anymore.

226
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,180
I think I'm done.

227
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,470
Matt was a tough one when he was a kid.

228
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,060
He held the record for the most
Hail Marys, five years running.

229
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
Hmm.

230
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,770
I wonder how many he'd have to say
these days.

231
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,740
He came to us
right after he lost his father.

232
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,200
His only family.

233
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,950
He was alone in the world.

234
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,660
In his private darkness.

235
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,000
Surrounded by strangers.

236
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,870
Yet he seemed fine during the day.

237
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,670
He'd eat with the others...

238
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,210
attend his classes, go to mass.

239
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,970
But he was plagued by awful nightmares.

240
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,310
He'd wake in a sweat, screaming.

241
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,030
He didn't say what they were about.
He'd just call out for help.

242
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,320
So I'd go, and I'd hold his hand
till he fell back asleep.

243
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,040
But I have so many children under my care.

244
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,630
Matthew wasn't the only one.

245
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,090
His nightmares went on for months.

246
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,800
One night, Matthew called for help
and I didn't answer.

247
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,850
I didn't go to him.

248
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,020
He never asked us for anything again.

249
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,520
He shut us out. Shut everyone out.

250
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,190
Everyone in Matthew's life abandoned him.

251
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,610
Including me.

252
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,380
When someone in need tries
to push you away...

253
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,590
you have to find the strength
to hold on tighter.

254
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,770
Seems unfair. It's an optics thing.

255
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,690
I can assure you,

256
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,200
there'll be an immediate investigation
into how this leaked.

257
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,160
Think of it as a paid vacation.

258
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,830
Take a minute, if you need,
to pack things up.

259
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,790
We prepared for this.

260
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,330
You are gonna get a job...

261
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,170
with a nice, rigid structure.

262
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,880
You're gonna stick to your meds.

263
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,340
Learn to stay calm.

264
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,780
You got a minute?

265
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,110
Yeah. Sure, Dex.

266
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,620
Hey, give us a sec?

267
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,450
They're...

268
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,620
They're puttin' me on leave, Ray.
They're... They're, uh...

269
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,670
Hey, first thing you have to do
is take a breath, all right?

270
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,880
Everything's gonna be okay.

271
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,970
Then look me in the eyes
when you say that.

272
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,720
Hey, I'm on your side here.

273
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,180
I can't get shut out, man.

274
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,350
I need this job.

275
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,310
Please.
There's gotta be something you can do.

276
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,520
I made a point to commend your conduct
in my shooting report.

277
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,150
You see how alone you are?

278
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,610
It wasn't your fault.

279
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,070
Dex, tell me...
What's making you scared?

280
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,530
It's just you surrounded
by all this emptiness.

281
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,580
- You see how alone you are?
- You got nothing to worry about.

282
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,910
You lost?

283
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,620
Not if you're holding.

284
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
You a cop?

285
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,500
Doesn't matter what I am.
I'm just looking for a couple of teeners.

286
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,340
That'll be $80.

287
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,510
And a crash.

288
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,130
So we take here the paprika.

289
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,300
And it's a smoked paprika.
We put it on the plate.

290
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:22,890
And I will be adding to it
tomatoes and a bit of...

291
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Hey.

292
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
Hey, uh...

293
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,920
you point me towards, uh, Jasper Evans,
this is yours.

294
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,010
What the hell's it to you?

295
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,850
Everybody out.

296
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,270
Get out!

297
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,240
Jasper Evans?

298
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,630
Sit down.

299
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,720
You okay?

300
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,730
Okay.

301
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,940
So you knew his last known address?

302
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,770
You knew he'd probably be here, so what...

303
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,820
what were you waiting for?

304
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,110
For me?

305
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,320
You knew I'd come?

306
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,580
I hoped.

307
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,000
Okay, look, I'm gonna help you.

308
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
But...

309
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,040
after that,
I need you to help Foggy and me.

310
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,710
Look, the FBI are all over us...

311
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,420
You want me to turn myself in.

312
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,010
- Did you talk to Foggy?
- No. But, uh...

313
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,220
it's the smart move.

314
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,520
Sure, I'll do it.

315
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,400
But what if they figured out
that you're... you?

316
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,860
Well, this mask doesn't do me any good
if I'm a wanted man, either way.

317
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,030
Besides, if the FBI figured out who I am,

318
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,500
who knows, maybe I'll get lucky
and they'll lock me up next to Fisk.

319
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,160
Jesus.

320
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,210
Foggy said you were... different.

321
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,670
Changed, I guess.
I told him it was bullshit.

322
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,750
All right, look,
we can't take his statement here.

323
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Fisk's lawyers will say it was coerced.

324
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,010
Yeah, no, we take him to the Bulletin.

325
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,050
We get him on record
in front of witnesses.

326
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,550
Besides, my editor's gonna wanna hear this
with his own ears.

327
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,890
Wake up, Evans.

328
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,900
It's your lucky day.
I'm gonna give you a choice.

329
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,850
Option one: I call the FBI...

330
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,980
and Wilson Fisk has you killed

331
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,020
before you can tell 'em
how you got out of prison.

332
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,360
Option two: you tell this nice reporter
the truth about what you did for Fisk

333
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,650
and I'll let you run someplace
Fisk will never find you.

334
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,660
- I can't.
- Cool. Option one.

335
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,410
No, if I talk, Fisk kills my son!

336
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,250
Look at this place.

337
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,620
I grew up here.

338
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,540
We had a good life before the neighborhood
went down and I got myself put away.

339
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,220
I left my son without a father.
And this is what he does with his life.

340
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,720
If I go back inside,

341
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,260
it won't be long until
he's sharin' a cell with me or worse.

342
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,310
If Fisk stays out of prison,

343
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,190
a lot of innocent people are gonna die.

344
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:06,030
So you can either tell my paper the truth
and we let you and your son run far away

345
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,950
or you can go back to prison

346
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,790
and I print the story
like you talked anyway.

347
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,080
You would lie and get us both killed?

348
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,620
Your choice.

349
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,170
Special Agent Nadeem.

350
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,720
Mr. Nelson.

351
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,260
I'm glad to see you've reconsidered.

352
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,390
The sandwich you ordered last night.

353
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,900
I'm here to represent Matt Murdock,
as his attorney.

354
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,490
So when I asked
if you knew where Murdock was...

355
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,030
I didn't lie. Matt contacted me today.

356
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,410
My client's ready
to submit to questioning.

357
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,490
That's fantastic.

358
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,410
So, uh...

359
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,620
where is he?

360
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,620
I'll provide him to you tonight.

361
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,500
After you hear the statement
of a second witness

362
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,670
who will convince you
of my client's innocence.

363
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,800
It sounds like I'm being jerked around,
counselor.

364
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,840
His name is Jasper Evans.

365
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,510
And you're really gonna wanna hear
what he has to say.

366
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,450
Hallelujah.

367
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,200
So you can dress
like a normal human being.

368
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,490
Clean socks.

369
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Thank you.

370
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,710
Well, it warms my heart

371
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,460
to see you going out to do something
other than beat someone up.

372
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,300
How do you know?

373
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,720
Could just be adding style to my beatings.

374
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Did you...

375
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,220
Did you just make a joke?

376
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,270
You look ready to smile,
which I'm sure in your case means...

377
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,400
Well, I don't know what that could mean,
as I've never actually seen one.

378
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,490
This have something to do with the blond
who came to visit me today?

379
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Karen.

380
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,620
Yeah. Yeah, I'm meeting her.

381
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,710
Wow.

382
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,080
She's lovely.

383
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,750
She is.

384
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,590
She knows you're Daredevil.

385
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,760
She does.

386
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,300
And she stuck around?

387
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,260
Sounds like a keeper.

388
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,560
We're just friends.

389
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,140
Well, it's nice to hear
you use the F-word.

390
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,190
And to see you reconnecting.

391
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,360
Wait, I'm...

392
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,530
She's just helping me one last time.

393
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:56,950
It's not a criticism, Matthew.

394
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,240
Calling you an idiot...

395
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,330
for believing that friends
make you weaker rather than stronger?

396
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,000
That would be a criticism.

397
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,580
Thank you for clarifying that.

398
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,090
Anyway, where are you off to?

399
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,380
Gotta turn myself in to the FBI.

400
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,800
You must be joking.

401
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,680
You need a suit for that?

402
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,930
I've been falsely accused.

403
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,020
Gotta clear my name.

404
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,810
You mean Matt Murdock's name.

405
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,310
If you're leaving him behind,
why does it matter?

406
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,480
My life is complicated enough
without being a wanted fugitive.

407
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,570
And there are... other people involved.

408
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,740
Other people?

409
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,490
You mean your friends?

410
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,010
So you've heard? Congratulations, Ray.

411
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,510
- What?
- You were right.

412
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,930
Your work with Fisk
trumped your credit issues.

413
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
The EAD approved your promotion.

414
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,230
Wow, I, uh...

415
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,360
- Wow.
- That's not why you're here?

416
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,660
Murdock's lawyer just promised
to surrender him tonight.

417
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,370
That's great.

418
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,000
But only after we hear from a witness
he claims can exonerate Murdock

419
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,250
and prove that Fisk has been playing us.

420
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
He's bullshitting.

421
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,970
Yeah, well,
he claims his witness is Jasper Evans.

422
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,380
Why do I know that name?

423
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,970
He's the guy that shanked Fisk.

424
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,560
That proves
Murdock's attorney is bullshitting.

425
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,100
Evans isn't giving any statements.
He's in the hole.

426
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,430
Actually, he's not.

427
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,600
I just got off the phone with the warden.

428
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,940
Evans is missing.

429
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,860
What do you mean he's missing?

430
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,940
I mean, they've searched the prison
top to bottom and he's not there.

431
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,950
Jesus.

432
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,370
If Murdock's attorney has him...

433
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,910
you don't think he's right
about what Evans can prove?

434
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,670
How can he be?

435
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,670
Fisk's intel checks out,
and we're watching him 24/7.

436
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,920
- We'd know if he was playing us.
- Right.

437
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,130
So it's a bluff.

438
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,510
It's a bluff.

439
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,500
Suicide Prevention,
this is Julie...

440
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,760
Tell me, Dex, are you thinking
about taking your own life right now?

441
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,300
How are you going to do it, Dex?

442
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,180
Do you have a gun?

443
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,470
Learn to stay calm.

444
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,040
- Is it in your hand?
- It wasn't your fault.

445
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,060
The world doesn't want you.

446
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,150
I don't want you.

447
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,520
It wasn't your fault.

448
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,150
Learn to stay calm.

449
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,990
Do you have a gun?
You know where to press it.

450
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,700
You see how alone you are?

451
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,410
You know where to press it.

452
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Hello?

453
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,980
When I was in prison,
my mother passed away.

454
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,690
Among her effects was a shoebox
with my name on it.

455
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,070
A keepsake box of sorts.

456
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,570
It was full of happy relics from my life.

457
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,280
The gifts that I made her
when I was young.

458
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,120
The odd news clipping.

459
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,040
And the hammer.

460
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,210
The instrument of my father's death.

461
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,670
I thought that she had thrown it away.

462
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,550
But she was proud of what I had done,
of who I was.

463
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,560
She accepted me, without shame.

464
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,810
And that's what I want for you.

465
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,190
Someone to accept you, without shame.

466
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,280
I do.

467
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,320
And I've sent you a gift,
an opportunity to become your true self.

468
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,660
And if you accept this...

469
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,500
unlike everyone in your life,
I will never abandon you.

470
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,330
The decision is yours.

471
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,750
A car is waiting, sir,
if you care to come with me.

472
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,740
I wanted to put some money in it,
but I'm a little bit behind on my rent.

473
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,500
Are you sure you wanna do this?

474
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,630
You confident this FBI agent
can be trusted?

475
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,710
Nadeem's a ball breaker, but he seems
genuinely interested in the truth.

476
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,470
Yeah. I trust him.

477
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,640
Then, yeah, I'm sure.

478
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,190
So, I got your message.

479
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,240
Why am I missing my wife's office party?

480
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,490
This is Jasper Evans.
He's here to go on record.

481
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,540
He's the inmate
who shanked Wilson Fisk in prison.

482
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,750
Fisk made me do it.

483
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,500
We just got the call.
Murdock's at the Bulletin.

484
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,620
What about Jasper Evans?

485
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,710
Nelson didn't say,

486
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,920
but doing this at the newspaper
means they want it as public as possible.

487
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,920
Get Murdock
and find out what the hell is going on.

488
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,470
The publisher and the lawyers
want it all on tape.

489
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,010
Just tell the truth,
you'll be outta here soon.

490
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,100
Just, uh, give me a minute.

491
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,270
- I know you told me lay off Fisk, but...
- All right, look...

492
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,280
- We owe this to Ben.
- Stop, stop, stop.

493
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,740
I owe you... an apology.

494
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,950
Someone has gotta shine a light on this.

495
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:39,950
And, well, I'm grateful that you were
brave enough to make me do it, so...

496
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,710
thank you.

497
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Lead on.

498
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,600
What is it?

499
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,470
Do you hear something?

500
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,140
Screaming.

501
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,930
Please state your name.

502
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,360
- My name is Jasper Evans.
- Good.

503
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,940
Now, can you tell us
how you know Wilson Fisk?

504
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,700
What the hell's going on?

505
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,930
Foggy, find Karen. Get her outta here.

506
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,790
Oh, shit. This is not happening.

507
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,420
Great, another power outage.

508
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,620
Genny's kicked in.
At least our work is saved.

509
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,840
Probably another fire drill
no one told us about.

510
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,050
That's weird.
The phones are out, too.

511
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,510
Hey, you can't be here!

512
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,780
Karen? What is it?

513
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
What's wrong?

514
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,410
- We prepared for this.
- Let go of me, Dex.

515
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,350
I said let go!

516
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,770
Fashioned yourself into something
the world will tolerate!

517
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,190
It's just you.

518
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,650
People like you. Like us.

519
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,780
The real you.

520
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,800
- Karen!
- Jesus.

521
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,640
Who are you?

522
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,730
I'm Daredevil.

523
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,230
Stop or I'll...

524
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,310
Ahh!

525
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,610
The hell are you do...

526
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,760
Hello, Karen. It's nice to see you again.

527
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,160
Did anyone see what happened?

528
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,210
Check 'em. You two, with me!

529
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,350
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Matt?

530
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,310
Jesus Christ.

531
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,070
Foggy?

532
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,780
No, no, no. He's okay. He's okay.

533
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,490
Jesus, are you?

534
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,740
Did he kill Jasper?

535
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,330
Yeah.

536
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:07,750
Yeah.

537
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,300
I don't, uh...

538
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,150
FBI, don't move!

539
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,840
Agents down! Agents down!

540
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,140
FBI!

541
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,970
FBI, nobody move!

542
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:56,590
What the hell happened?

543
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,840
Who did this?

544
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,770
It was Daredevil.
