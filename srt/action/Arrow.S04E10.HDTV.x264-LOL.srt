1
00:00:01,242 --> 00:00:02,550
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:04,104
I got an ID on our Mr. Creepy.

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,603
I'm not sure what
that symbol means.

4
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,905
It means anarchy.
Lonnie Machin.

5
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,741
Full time crazy pants.

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,146
Speedy, don't!

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,854
Sometimes, the best way to teach
someone a lesson isn't to punish them;

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,056
it's to punish the ones
he cares about the most.

9
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,058
Felicity Smoak...

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,993
Would you make me

11
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,230
the happiest man
on the face of the Earth?

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,866
Yes!

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,300
Now I know...

14
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,302
That it's not my fault.

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,039
It's my responsibility.

16
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,275
Responsibility?
To do what?

17
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,677
To end it.

18
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,879
I'm going to kill him.

19
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,721
Where is Damian Darhk?!

20
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,608
Where's Darhk?!

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,878
Where is Darhk?

22
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:11,182

24
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,602
Any luck?

25
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:21,706
Just more Ghosts
who would rather die than talk.

26
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,442
Nobody--nobody is going
to give up Darhk.

27
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,444
John, we got to talk
to Andy again.

28
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,213
I don't think Andy is in a very
cooperative place.

29
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,315
Darhk is gone to ground.
Right now, unless things change,

30
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,317
Andy is our best chance
of catching him.

31
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,353
Felicity's going in
for another surgery.

32
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,155
If we hurry, we might be able
to see her

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,890
before she goes
into prep.

34
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,025
No. No.
Darhk's in the wind.

35
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,960
The longer he's there,
the harder he's going to be to catch.

36
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,863
I'm going to stay here,
find something useful from the tip line.

37
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,200
It's what Felicity
would want me to do.

38
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,539
Can't lie your way
out of this one, pal.

39
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,674
Reiter might have
bought your B.S. before,

40
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,943
but now,
with these maps,

41
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:03,147
and ol' Miss Ukraine
over here still being alive,

42
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,516
it's game over.

43
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,523
He needs to rest--
for a moment.

44
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,225
Don't care.
Keep movin'.

45
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:17,261
And when he passes out,
do you plan on killing him?

46
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,931
Fine. Quick.

47
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,806
Hey, hey.

48
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,475
You need to make a run for it.

49
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,610
I'll distract Conklin.

50
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,645
By doing what?
Bleeding on him?

51
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,615
Well, isn't
this touching?

52
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,051
All right, come on,
let's go.

53
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,220
Don't get too attached
to him, sweetheart.

54
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,989
His prospects for a long life
don't look too good.

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,762
Hey.

56
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,397
Hey.

57
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,866
How are you
feeling?

58
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,701
I have never
been more ready

59
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,470
to have a bunch of guys
poking around inside me.

60
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,072
Doctors.

61
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,207
Doing doctor things.

62
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,244
Um, they think
the last surgery

63
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,812
will fix the nerve
damage, so.

64
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,913
Mm-hmm.

65
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,682
These are from Oliver.

66
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,519
Well, that's really nice
of him to stop by.

67
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,621
Yeah, it's ok.

68
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,122
I know he's doing
everything he can

69
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,225
to track down
the, uh...flowers.

70
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,261
Which is much
more important.

71
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,230
Plus, I got all the support
I need right here.

72
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:26,810
Felicity?

73
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,766
Mm-hmm?

74
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,468
I'm here to prep you
for surgery.

75
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,037
I'm going to be fine.

76
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,109
Aren't you tired
of this?

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,977
Same dead end
conversation.

78
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,712
I'm not talking,
I'm not helping.

79
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,616
So how about you stop wasting
both our time?

80
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:47,919
The Green Arrow
told me to have

81
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,322
a conversation with you
about Darhk.

82
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,259
Wow.

83
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,761
I'm surprised, John.

84
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,229
I didn't think
you had it in you.

85
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,339
I didn't.

86
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:00,532
So what changed?

87
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,701
Her name is Felicity.

88
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,844
Yeah, listen, I know,
I know, all right?

89
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,646
Just--just do--

90
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,951
listen, I got to call you back,
I'll call you back, bye.

91
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,085
How's she doing?

92
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,720
She's in surgery
again.

93
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,455
Then what
are you doing here?

94
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,590
Looking
for Damian Darhk.

95
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,091
There's a card

96
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,026
that we haven't
turned over yet,

97
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,329
and we haven't turned it over,
because when we do,

98
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,497
he will know that you are
working with us.

99
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,266
You want to know where I've been
meeting with Darhk.

100
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,368
Yeah.

101
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,803
You won't be able
to go home.

102
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,138
Luckily, we have
space in the bunker.

103
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,673
There are
living quarters.

104
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,841
What about Laurel?

105
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,543
She can take care
of herself.

106
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,811
Yeah, she can do that.

107
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,614
Ok--office building,
832 Sixth Street,

108
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,349
30th floor.

109
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,150
But with Felicity
in the hospital,

110
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,952
me and Laurel watching our backs,
your team gets mighty small.

111
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,222
None of it matters
once Darhk is off the board.

112
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,224
So you're back
to dropping bodies?

113
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,562
It's just this one.

114
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:53,382
Lonnie Machin.

115
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,850
The symbol that I found
in Darhk's lair

116
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,485
is consistent with the symbol
that Machin left

117
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,854
near the bodies  of two paramedics
a few months ago.

118
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:01,890
Ok, but why is Machin
still targeting Ghosts?

119
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,225
When he kidnapped
Danforth's daughter,

120
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:04,960
Darhk was the one
who gave up his location.

121
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:05,807
This is payback.

122
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,409
Darhk cleared out
before Machin got there;

123
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,431
Darhk is one step
ahead of Machin.

124
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:12,367
But Machin is one
step ahead of us.

125
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,102
Yeah. And I'll keep
chipping away

126
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,472
at my stone wall.

127
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:17,873
Wait.

128
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,708
How did you suddenly find

129
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,477
Darhk's base
of operations?

130
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,412
Finally had an interrogation
that went somewhere.

131
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:26,248
I'm going to bring up everything
I can on Machin.

132
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,685
I'll ask my dad if SCPD found
any leads at the crime scene.

133
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,062
Mr. Conklin.

134
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:42,631
I trust there was
a reason for this?

135
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,266
It's like I've been
telling you--

136
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,835
Queen's a liar.
Told me he killed this one.

137
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:49,271
Turns out he's just been keeping
her stowed away.

138
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,241
What you and your men do
to satisfy your needs outside of camp

139
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:54,243
is no interest of me.

140
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:55,811
I thought
you might say that.

141
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:58,080
That's why I made
sure to bring these with me.

142
00:07:58,082 --> 00:08:00,816
I found these two coming up from
a shipwrecked freighter.

143
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,718
Must have found
them inside.

144
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,819
Now, if he's
been on this island

145
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,822
the whole time
like he says...

146
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,156
How did he know
where they were?

147
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:09,691
I got those
for you.

148
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,628
For...whatever it is
you're doing here.

149
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,131
And yet you waited
all this time...

150
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,867
With someone
you claimed to kill.

151
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,969
I've defended you,
Mr. Queen.

152
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,705
At the cost of my credibility
with my men.

153
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,374
No more.

154
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,142
You can kill him now
if you'd like.

155
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,777
Nah.

156
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,712
I got something else in mind.

157
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,317
You can't do this!

158
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,153
You can't do this!

159
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:41,690
Aahh!

160
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,694
Aahh!

161
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,729
Aahh!

162
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:55,837
How's Felicity?

163
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,205
She's in surgery.

164
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,408
It's a long procedure.

165
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,376
I'm going to go
to the hospital in a bit,

166
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,978
but I needed to come here
and get something first.

167
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,546
What?

168
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,854
I'd hate to see
the other guy.

169
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:16,458
The other guy's Andy.

170
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,561
We had to get
information on Darhk.

171
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:21,930
I thought that was
Oliver's vendetta.

172
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:23,565
Oliver does have a vendetta.

173
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,267
I'm just trying
to keep my friends safe.

174
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,069
You feel betrayed.

175
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:30,372
I do feel betrayed, Lyla,
he was my brother. My family.

176
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:31,573
I think that's
your problem.

177
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:34,376
Ever since you heard
about what Andy did

178
00:09:34,378 --> 00:09:36,078
back in Afghanistan,

179
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,014
Andy stopped
being Andy to you.

180
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,716
He became a traitor.

181
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:41,917
The enemy.

182
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,385
Yeah, and then
he doubled down

183
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,520
and became one
of Darhk's Ghosts.

184
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,756
And you've been treating
him like a Ghost ever since.

185
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:48,442
How's that working out for you?

186
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,258
What's your point, Lyla?

187
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,059
If you're not getting through
to Andy as a Ghost,

188
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,362
maybe you should try
reaching him as your brother.

189
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,664
No. No.

190
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,366
I can't do that.

191
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,067
Sure you can.

192
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:01,003
I've seen the love you have
for your brother, Johnny.

193
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,138
The strength of it.
It's iron.

194
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,741
Before you give up on Andy,

195
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,909
just make sure he sees
what I do--

196
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,645
a man who'd go to
the ends of the Earth

197
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,713
for the ones he loves.

198
00:10:11,715 --> 00:10:14,082
And if it helps...

199
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:16,852
Consider it an order, soldier.

200
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,061
You doing ok?

201
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,729
You mean now
that Machin's back?

202
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:28,997
I'm sure he's
not after you.

203
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,732
Why would he be?

204
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:34,503
I only burned his face
off in a fiery fit of Lazarus rage.

205
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:36,772
Thea...

206
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:38,407
Look, you know those
crime scene photos

207
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:40,108
that Ollie showed us

208
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,311
with paramedics
and writing symbols in blood?

209
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:47,416
Whoever is out there now
is a complete monster.

210
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,618
A monster that
we're going to catch.

211
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,319
I don't know anymore!

212
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,588
And lately, I can't seem
to win for losing.

213
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,490
What do you mean?

214
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,926
When we got John's brotherr
out of HIVE,

215
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:01,263
I ran in to Damian Darhk.

216
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:06,068
And he--he tried to use
his creepy magic mojo on me,

217
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,036
but...

218
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:12,140
After that,
my blood lust was better.

219
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,743
It was almost
completely gone.

220
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:17,145
I don't know; I really
just thought I was starting

221
00:11:17,147 --> 00:11:19,381
to get
on the other side of this.

222
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:22,451
Hey. Sounds like
you already are.

223
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:24,152
Except now Machin's out there

224
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:27,189
and he has a blood lust
of his own.

225
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:29,958
And it's completely
my fault.

226
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,927
No, Thea, you can't
think that way.

227
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:34,296
It's far too late
for that.

228
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:40,769
It's all right, sweetheart,
it's all right.

229
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:42,137
Dad!

230
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,106
Ahem.

231
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:46,141
What...are you...

232
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:48,243
I had no idea
that Felicity's friend

233
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:50,645
was...Quentin's daughter.

234
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:55,617
It's such a small world.

235
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:59,654
Microscopic.

236
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:02,157
Um, Thea, I've been--
I've been trying to get Donna

237
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,525
to eat something
up at the cafeteria,

238
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,460
but maybe you'd have
better luck.

239
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,796
Uh...Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,030
Sure, sure. Come on.

241
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:10,832
Yeah, ok.

242
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:14,703
I was--I was going
to say something,

243
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,905
but then everything
with Felicity, and...

244
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:19,174
Dad, Dad...
It's fine.

245
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,208
Really?

246
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,878
I want you
to be happy.

247
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,947
Ok, so Oliver found Darhk's
base of operations,

248
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,250
and I'm guessing
that's thanks to you?

249
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,751
Well, there's no use
being on the inside

250
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:31,686
if I can't provide
inside Intel, right?

251
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,755
Darhk's going to realize
that you're helping the Green Arrow.

252
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:35,357
I think that ship's
probably already sailed.

253
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,892
Don't worry, I can
look after myself.

254
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,126
I'm more worried about you.

255
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,661
I though we already
worked past this.

256
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,063
There's no working past
a father caring

257
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,633
about his daughter.

258
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:47,402
Hmm, text from
the new girlfriend?

259
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:48,870
Easy, get out of here.

260
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:51,006
Crime lab.

261
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:54,042
I have half the CSIs I got working on
the HIVE crime scene.

262
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,577
I doubt they'll
find anything.

263
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,013
The Ghosts have
their DNA scrambled.

264
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,248
Which makes this
particularly strange.

265
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,585
The blood Machin used for his graffiti
didn't come from the Ghosts.

266
00:13:03,587 --> 00:13:04,753
How do you know?

267
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:06,488
The CSU got a match.

268
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,858
Two of them,
actually.

269
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,494
Michael and Crystal Olguin.

270
00:13:12,496 --> 00:13:14,362
Machin's foster parents.

271
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:16,097
Kidnapped
three days ago.

272
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,732
Machin's settling
old scores.

273
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,234
He planted their blood at HIVE,

274
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:21,570
so clearly Darhk
is next on his list.

275
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,372
But Machin's got to be
laying low somewhere, right?

276
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:25,674
You think
his former home?

277
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:27,409
Well, I mean,
it's vacant now.

278
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:29,411
Yeah, maybe they have
a security system we can hack into.

279
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,613
I've got it.

280
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,643
Or not.

281
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,667
Here, let me try it.

282
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,057
Ok, wait, who is that?

283
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,059
That's him.

284
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,158
Suit up.

285
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:04,512
Well, that's not
at all creepy.

286
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,514
Front's clear.

287
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:08,183
Same.

288
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,618
Except for trash, flies,

289
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,287
and some bad graffiti.

290
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:15,924
Wait, I think
we might have something.

291
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:36,478
I was expecting
Mr. Darhk's friends,

292
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,316
but...you guys
are a pleasant surprise.

293
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:43,785
Especially you, dear.

294
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,754
Hey!

295
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:47,289
Don't move.

296
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,924
Funny...

297
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,792
I was going to tell
you the same thing.

298
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:14,716
It's a motion sensor.

299
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:29,030
Oh, did you think
I was going to kill you?

300
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:31,833
Why would I do
such a thing?

301
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:39,040
You're the one
who saved me from myself.

302
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,380
Come on, then.

303
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:47,682
Hit me with
your best shot.

304
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:53,755
Oh, that's pretty.

305
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:55,690
Did you take
voice lessons?

306
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,492
Move, Thea.
Stay away from her!

307
00:15:57,494 --> 00:15:59,327
Oh, I would
never hurt her.

308
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,262
You, on
the other hand...

309
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,404
Speedy, you ok?

310
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,439
Now what?

311
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:13,274
Find out what he knows.

312
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,813
Aren't we risking
some crazy

313
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:28,314
Bond villain
stupidity here?

314
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:31,918
I mean, this guy needs
to be put away.

315
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,820
Far, far away.

316
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:36,523
Machin found Darhk's
base of operations without any help.

317
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:37,613
I need to know how;

318
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,293
I need to know where
Darhk is right now,

319
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:41,828
and the cops can have him
when I am done with him.

320
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,731
Machin is about ten different
kinds of deranged.

321
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,599
Why would you believe
anything he tells you?

322
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,234
I don't have
any other choice.

323
00:16:48,236 --> 00:16:50,937
Now I am done
talking about this.

324
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,705
Give me the room.

325
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,307
I thought we've
moved past this.

326
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,843
Sorry to disappoint.
Wake up.

327
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:59,179
Where's
Damian Darhk?

328
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:01,881
He went home.

329
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,683
Ahem.

330
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,286
I was planning
a party for him.

331
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:07,720
You interrupted my--

332
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,357
Tell me where he is!

333
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,126
Or what?

334
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:15,094
Look at me.

335
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:19,599
What could you possible do
that I haven't already enjoyed?

336
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:21,835
Hey!

337
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,269
Get out!
No.

338
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:25,205
Look, there's something
you need to hear.

339
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:33,112
What?!

340
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:35,481
Felicity's
out of surgery.

341
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:36,883
Donna just texted me.

342
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:38,251
They didn't say
what was wrong.

343
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,920
But I--I don't
think it's good.

344
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:44,023
You need to go there.

345
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:51,698
Back for more?

346
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,466
Does beating up
on your little brother

347
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:54,834
give you
a little thrill?

348
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,470
I'm not proud
of what I did, Andy.

349
00:17:57,472 --> 00:17:59,205
In fact, I'm ashamed of it.

350
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,908
You, John?
Mr. High and Mighty?

351
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:05,612
Do you remember
the last time

352
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:08,681
you beat on me until
your knuckles bled?

353
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:11,417
Yeah, I do.

354
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:14,287
Ten years ago.

355
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:15,755
When I found out
you were dealing.

356
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:18,791
Yeah. You convinced
me to enlist.

357
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:22,695
To go the straight
and narrow like my big bro.

358
00:18:22,697 --> 00:18:24,130
And I tried.

359
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:25,598
Honestly,
I tried, man.

360
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,700
Enough to fool you.

361
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:29,535
That's just not
who I was.

362
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:32,472
'Cause it's always been
about you, John.

363
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,007
'Cause I'm such
an embarrassment,

364
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,409
and my bad deeds
look bad on you.

365
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:38,444
No, Andy, no,
that's not true.

366
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:41,214
I did what I did
because I love you, man.

367
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,949
No, I do, Andy.

368
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:46,619
Then, now.

369
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,621
Andy, you're still
my little brother

370
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,590
who I stayed up late
playing cards with.

371
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:53,726
You're going through
this, that's on me.

372
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:56,796
But do you really think Damian Darhk
gives a damn about you?

373
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,132
He believes that the world
needs a reset.

374
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:02,368
And honestly, John, after what =
we witnessed in Afghanistan,

375
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,170
can you tell me otherwise?

376
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:06,806
Ok.

377
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,741
All right, so you and Darhk are
burning the village

378
00:19:08,743 --> 00:19:10,777
in order to save it.
I get that.

379
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:12,812
Malcolm Merlyn was
talking the same tune.

380
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:15,248
But Andy, Darhk hurt
a friend of mine.

381
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,083
A close friend.

382
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:20,019
A woman better
than you and me put together.

383
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:22,522
It doesn't matter if Darhk wants
to save the world--

384
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,524
he crossed a line.

385
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:27,360
So I'm asking you,
Andy--

386
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,896
begging you, man...

387
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:33,366
Brother to brother.

388
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,234
Where can I find Darhk?

389
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,974
He, um...

390
00:19:42,377 --> 00:19:46,045
Likes to talk about Stonehaven.

391
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:50,183
About how the leaves
look there...

392
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,085
in autumn.

393
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:56,222
Thanks, Andy.

394
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:57,924
Don't thank me.

395
00:19:57,926 --> 00:19:59,592
You're ashamed.

396
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:02,362
Now we're even.

397
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,701
Speedy.

398
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:11,904
That is what the blonde
with the black leather

399
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:15,541
and the big mouth
called you, right?

400
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:17,944
Hard to look at me, I know.

401
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:19,412
Your doing.

402
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:21,247
I owe you a thank you.

403
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:24,317
Baptism by fire,
it's transcendent.

404
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,886
You burnt away my weakness

405
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:30,757
like a Phoenix
rising from the ashes.

406
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:33,126
If you thought burning your face
off was fun,

407
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,328
keep talking.

408
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,730
I'll put an arrow
through your eye.

409
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,065
So why hold back?

410
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:42,268
I know you want to kill me.

411
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,938
Because I can
control myself.

412
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,473
No, you can't.

413
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:50,543
Look, you think you can,
you say you can,

414
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,011
but I can see it
in your eyes.

415
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:55,114
The hunger to deliver death.

416
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:57,950
Oh, delicious.

417
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:02,021
Told you.

418
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:12,065
Bye, dear.

419
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,635
...downtown
Star City where the SCPD

420
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:18,271
has apprehended a fugitive
wanted for murdering...

421
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,339
Hi, Donna.

422
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:22,275
Where have you been?

423
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,609
I...

424
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,278
I should
have been here.

425
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,082
Thea said that
Felicity is out of surgery?

426
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:31,217
Yeah, yeah, she's, uh,

427
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:33,619
well, she's got
a new diagnosis.

428
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:36,089
What?

429
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:38,257
They can't...

430
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,093
They can't fix her.

431
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,331
What do you mean,
they can't fix her?

432
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,901
The damage to her
spinal cord, it's...

433
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:52,171
Oliver, it's permanent.

434
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:54,474
She's never going
to walk again.

435
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:57,076
No. No.

436
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:58,544
We'll talk
to another doctor.

437
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:00,613
No, no, no, see, you don't--

438
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:03,015
this--this is
the other doctor, ok?

439
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:06,018
This is the doctor that came
all the way from Central City.

440
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:09,555
This is the doctor.

441
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:10,990
Where is she?
I need to see her.

442
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,491
She's in recovery.

443
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,177
We have
a special report.

444
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:16,330
Lonnie Machin has
just been apprehended

445
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:17,691
by the Star City
police department.

446
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:21,411
D.A. Laurel Lance was onsite
to oversee his detainment.

447
00:22:21,413 --> 00:22:24,814
We'll have updated  information you
upon his release.

448
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:27,150
Aahh!

449
00:22:28,954 --> 00:22:31,754
Aahh!

450
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:36,778
Stop!

451
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,179
What?

452
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:40,548
Stop.

453
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,953
You said he was mine
to do whatever I want with.

454
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:48,456
That was before I saw
the signs on his abdomen.

455
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,864
Hmm. Well, you can
look at it all you want

456
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,098
after he's dead.

457
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,601
I have a need of him.

458
00:23:01,738 --> 00:23:04,773
No, no, no,
everyone stay back.

459
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:07,809
Well, I count five guns.

460
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,778
And you got one.

461
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,846
What you going to do?

462
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,516
You can't run.

463
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,486
I'm not running.

464
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,970
Ah, long time,
no see.

465
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,939
We didn't finish
our conversation.

466
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:41,109
And what, I'm supposed
to be so grateful,

467
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:44,212
I'm just going to give up what
I know about where Darhk is?

468
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,415
Not likely.

469
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:01,029
You make sure he's dead.

470
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:15,393
Have you completely
lost your mind?

471
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:16,561
I don't have time
for a debate.

472
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,329
Good,

473
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,397
because there's nothing to debate.
What you did--

474
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,766
What I did?

475
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:25,002
I did what I had to do
after you made it necessary.

476
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:27,605
Machin was only arrested
by the SCPD

477
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:28,940
because you gave him up.

478
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,775
You were holding
a man prisoner

479
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,877
as some sort of
personal vendetta!

480
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,079
Do you have any idea
how many people

481
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,182
Damian Darhk and HIVE
have killed over the past six months?

482
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:41,686
This might be a vendetta,
but it's not personal.

483
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,155
I don't know
what's worse--

484
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:47,225
you actually believe that,
or you expect me to.

485
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:50,061
I put a tracker on Machin.
He will lead us to Darhk,

486
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,963
and then we will take
both of them down.

487
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:53,564
And when your master
plan doesn't work,

488
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:57,068
you just sent a murdering psychotic
back on the streets.

489
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,136
Like you did with Sara.

490
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,339
That's not fair.

491
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:02,974
What's going on?

492
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,276
Oliver broke Machin
out of custody.

493
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:06,878
What?

494
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,046
Using Machin to get
to Darhk, period.

495
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:12,377
If either of you
has a problem with it,

496
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,012
you know where the door is.

497
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:17,716
Laurel,
give us a second.

498
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:21,153
I don't have time
for a lecture, John.

499
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:22,755
There's no lecture
here, Oliver,

500
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:24,423
but you should know
that Andy gave me a lead on Darhk

501
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:25,110
and I've been working on it.

502
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:26,459
Good. What have you found?

503
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,893
Unfortunately,
it was a dead end, but--

504
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:29,595
But nothing. But nothing.

505
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:30,729
Oliver, I know
you're hurting, man,

506
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:32,131
but you should know
that whatever

507
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,867
your play is...
I got your back.

508
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,034
But?

509
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,436
But you've come
so far, Oliver.

510
00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:40,005
You've recovered
a humanity

511
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:41,340
that you lost

512
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,075
when I first met you.

513
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,343
I know you want payback
for what Darhk did

514
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:46,378
to Felicity, and you should.

515
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,748
But don't lose what made her fall
in love with you in the first place.

516
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,193
Oh, hey.

517
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,628
What are you doing here?

518
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,931
I came by to tell you, um...

519
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:08,433
I can't do this.

520
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,172
My anger management issues,

521
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:16,175
they are less manageable
than I thought.

522
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:18,610
Look, I called what's
going on with you anger management

523
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:22,447
because I don't know
what else to call it.

524
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,850
All I know is that there's something
that's really bothering you

525
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,652
and if I know
what it is,

526
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,754
maybe I can help.

527
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:31,890
You can't.

528
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:35,093
This...This can't
really be helped.

529
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:36,328
I don't
believe that.

530
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,063
I don't believe
that for a second.

531
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:39,798
Thea, you've lived
through more tragedies

532
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,667
than a person has
any right to.

533
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,335
Instead of crumbling,
here you are.

534
00:26:43,337 --> 00:26:46,238
Every single day, working to
rebuild your home.

535
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,208
You've got steel
inside of you, Thea.

536
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,311
That's what drew me to you
in the first place.

537
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:54,947
Thank you.

538
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,416
I'm...

539
00:26:57,418 --> 00:26:58,617
Just not ready.

540
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,053
Well, hey,
when you are,

541
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,021
I'll be here.

542
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:05,924
Ok.

543
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:19,471
Oh, boy.

544
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,740
What did I miss?

545
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,475
That's a long story.

546
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:25,611
Short version--
Machin's gotten loose;

547
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:26,979
he's after Darhk
and we're tracking him.

548
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,981
Wait, what?
What happens if he gets out

549
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,716
and starts
hurting people?

550
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:31,488
That's exactly my point.

551
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:32,151
It doesn't matter.

552
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,186
You sound like him.

553
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:36,088
No, I mean,
the tracker's gone dark.

554
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,690
I mean, we just lost his signal,
he must have found the tracker!

555
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,825
We lost him.

556
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:45,230
Ok, so, what
do we do now?

557
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:48,166
I don't know.

558
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,335
That was
the whole plan.

559
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,937
Oliver, go
see Felicity.

560
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,538
Not right now,
John, not with--

561
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,407
Then when?

562
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:58,277
She needs you.

563
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,879
And right now,
I think you need her, too.

564
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:03,148
We will find Machin.

565
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,917
Look...

566
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,852
They are right, ok?

567
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:09,054
We are going
to figure this out.

568
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,957
But right now,

569
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,726
you need to go
and be with her.

570
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,507
Hey, stranger.

571
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:37,616
Sorry I didn't...

572
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:39,484
come by sooner.

573
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:40,953
It's...

574
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:42,521
It's unforgivable.

575
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:45,958
Only if you were
in Bali or something.

576
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,793
Were you in Bali?

577
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:49,361
No, I was, uh...

578
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,762
Beating the streets.

579
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,432
Probably a lot of people
looking for Darhk.

580
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:54,866
I didn't want
to come and see you

581
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,034
until Darhk
was off the board.

582
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,570
Any luck?

583
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:00,372
Working
some leads.

584
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:02,708
Tell me you haven't
gone off the rails.

585
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,644
Well...

586
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,582
I just...

587
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:14,453
I can't help
but think that...

588
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,089
The reason that
Darhk is winning

589
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:20,092
is because I haven't
been willing to go far enough

590
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:22,260
and that if I was,

591
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:23,862
if I had,

592
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,298
maybe you wouldn't be
in here right now.

593
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,234
And I don't know

594
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:30,902
what the point...

595
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:34,272
of what I'm doing
as Green Arrow is

596
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:38,510
if I can't protect the people that
are closest to me.

597
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:41,747
Well, what's the point of doing it
if you lose yourself in the process?

598
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:43,315
Yeah.

599
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:45,017
There's something else
we need to talk about.

600
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,386
The doctors...

601
00:29:47,388 --> 00:29:50,422
They say that I'm, uh...

602
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,524
I know.

603
00:29:52,526 --> 00:29:54,993
My point being is we didn't
really exchange any vows,

604
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:57,596
so the whole for better, for worse thing
doesn't really apply here.

605
00:29:57,598 --> 00:29:59,664
What are you
talking about?

606
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,566
And maybe the real
reason you haven't been here

607
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:03,402
is because--
Felicity.

608
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:11,777
The nurse, she took this
off of you in the E.R.

609
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:14,513
How dare she.

610
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,623
For better,
for worse.

611
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,325
Ok.

612
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,437
He's bluffing.

613
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:40,405
Reiter, I can help you
find what you need...

614
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,340
On one condition.

615
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,509
What do you want?

616
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,145
I want
Taiana's safety.

617
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:49,247
So long
as she is alive,

618
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:50,649
I'll cooperate.

619
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,651
He's manipulating you.

620
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:55,220
What do you think
he's been doing this whole time?

621
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:57,289
You give him what he wants,
he's going to turn on you.

622
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,124
Do we have
a deal or not?

623
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,633
Take them both to prison.

624
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:13,371
You can't trust him.

625
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:17,342
Remember, Conklin...

626
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,844
There's no part
of my plan

627
00:31:18,846 --> 00:31:20,846
which requires you
to be alive.

628
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:37,562
You know, we go out
every night...

629
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,565
Suiting up,
risking our lives,

630
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,535
fighting assassins
and meta-humans

631
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,238
and all the worst
kinds of people.

632
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,440
She's stronger
than all of us.

633
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,843
You won't get
an argument from me.

634
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:54,513
Oliver, we might
have something.

635
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:57,516
John's brother said Darhk could be found
in a place called Stonehaven.

636
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:59,518
Dig said that lead
was a dead end.

637
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,621
That was before we cross referenced
the tracker's location

638
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:05,490
and came back
with a residential address.

639
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,626
Machin's going after Darhk
where he lives.

640
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:09,861
We're going to roll out.

641
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:12,497
I thought...you might
want to tag along.

642
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,432
Thank you.

643
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,434
Let's go.

644
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,809
All righty.

645
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:26,878
I just spoke
with Mr. Darhk.

646
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,181
He's on his way.

647
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:31,416
Traffic's a bitch.

648
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:34,586
Could take a while.

649
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:37,455
I really don't see why
we can't have some fun

650
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,224
in the meanwhile.

651
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,996
Just so you know,

652
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:47,098
this isn't your fault.

653
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,936
You see, daddy
done me wrong.

654
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:53,305
There needs to be
recompense for that.

655
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:56,174
He's not
responsible for what--

656
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,009
for what happened
to my face.

657
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:01,179
Not directly,
but incidentally.

658
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,648
And isn't that
what anarchy is?

659
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,686
The intersection of seemingly
unconnected events?

660
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:19,755
Who owns the house?

661
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:21,190
It's owned by
a dummy corporation.

662
00:33:21,192 --> 00:33:22,358
Couldn't work
through all the layers

663
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,126
without Felicity.

664
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,262
And we're sure
that Machin's inside?

665
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:31,066
Oh, yeah.

666
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,201
We're sure.

667
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:34,103
Hey.

668
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,251
Get on the ground!

669
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:51,287
First, you catch me.

670
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:53,022
Then, you break me out.

671
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:55,925
Now, you want
to catch me again.

672
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:57,693
Make up your mind.

673
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:59,528
Let's take him.

674
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,101
Get them
out of here!

675
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,505
Come on!

676
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:27,623
Split up.

677
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:05,294
There it is.

678
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:07,830
Shut up.

679
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:11,033
A little piece
of me inside of you

680
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:13,802
just begging
to come out and play.

681
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,080
Where's my family?!

682
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,687
I saved them.

683
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:38,694
I want to be clear
about something--

684
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,095
I have shown you repeatedly

685
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,865
that you cannot beat me.

686
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:44,900
You saved my family.

687
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:48,337
So I'll give you a few weeks
to spend with yours.

688
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:50,506
Enjoy your time.

689
00:35:50,508 --> 00:35:53,108
What's left of it.

690
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,447
You missed.

691
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,249
On purpose.

692
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:03,185
I'm disappointed in you.

693
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:26,319
Are Darhk's wife and daughter
in police custody?

694
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:29,689
They told police they weren't
his wife and daughter.

695
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:30,824
Had fake ID and everything.

696
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:33,126
Speedy...

697
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,228
You ok?

698
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,963
Yeah.

699
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:38,521
I'm just sorry I let
Machin get away.

700
00:36:38,522 --> 00:36:41,122
I'm just glad that
you're all right.

701
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,458
I'm going to go
see Felicity.

702
00:36:49,432 --> 00:36:53,167
The Chinese use
this island as a prison.

703
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,936
Bet you didn't know that.

704
00:36:54,938 --> 00:36:57,772
Said being sentenced here
was worse than any jail.

705
00:36:57,774 --> 00:37:00,108
Guess I'll just have
to see if I can give

706
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,443
those Chinese a run
for their money.

707
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,417
Reiter's going to get through
with you eventually,

708
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:12,120
and then you and me
will have a little uninterrupted time.

709
00:37:19,129 --> 00:37:21,763
You've lost
a lot of blood.

710
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,599
You shouldn't let these wounds
sit open like that.

711
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:26,067
Thank you.

712
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,236
You saved
my life again.

713
00:37:28,238 --> 00:37:30,705
Really, at the expense
of your own.

714
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:35,176
Well, you didn't
deserve to die.

715
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:36,945
You're a good man.

716
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:39,147
My brother would
have liked you.

717
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:49,557
I already told you
everything I know, John.

718
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:52,627
I'm not here to ask you
any questions, Andy.

719
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:14,048
Thank you for coming.

720
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,050
Yeah, I'm, uh...

721
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,852
Glad I did.

722
00:38:17,854 --> 00:38:19,654
And glad you called.

723
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:22,690
You know, this is
a little bit confusing.

724
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:25,259
Yeah.

725
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,228
First we're on,
then we're off,

726
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,396
now we're...

727
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:31,232
Drinking wine.

728
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,801
Look, um...

729
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:37,271
Something happened
earlier today,

730
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,040
and...

731
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,209
I guess I just wanted
to say that

732
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,678
you were right.

733
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,781
I am stronger
than I think I am.

734
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,050
Well...

735
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:51,285
Here's to being
stronger, huh?

736
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:01,295
Mmm.

737
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,497
How you feeling?

738
00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:04,399
How long you been
sitting there?

739
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:06,467
Not long enough.

740
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,503
Sorry I went away.

741
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:11,506
I think you
apologized already.

742
00:39:11,508 --> 00:39:14,542
Nowhere near
done apologizing.

743
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:19,147
You know...

744
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,716
I think I want to go to Bali.

745
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,217
Yeah.

746
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:24,652
Want to come with me?

747
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:27,055
Yeah.

748
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:29,557
I'd go anywhere
with you.

749
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,892
Yeah?

750
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:32,260
Just one question.

751
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:33,795
Mm-hmm?

752
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:36,197
What's Damian Darhk
doing in Bali?

753
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:39,534
I only ask, 'cause
if he's still here,

754
00:39:39,536 --> 00:39:42,770
we have
some work to do.

755
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:45,573
How'd you get to be so strong?

756
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:50,144
I took my lead
from you.

757
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:59,954
Shhh.

758
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:05,326
I've bought out
the Fairmount for the month.

759
00:40:05,328 --> 00:40:08,262
You'll be safe there
until we find a new home.

760
00:40:08,264 --> 00:40:11,032
And what about the man
that attacked us?

761
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,634
Lonnie Machin?

762
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:15,002
He'll never
hurt you again.

763
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:18,573
Those vigilantes saved us.

764
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:21,309
My dearest Ruvé,

765
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:23,845
do I detect a note
of criticism in your voice?

766
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,346
Yes.

767
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
But not the one you think.

768
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:31,759
You should have killed
the Green Arrow tonight.

769
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,860
As you said,
he saved your life.

770
00:40:33,862 --> 00:40:36,963
It would be bad form
to take him out now.

771
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:38,364
Genesis is almost ready.

772
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:40,466
We're much too close
to play games.

773
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:42,335
Do you remember
what I promised you?

774
00:40:42,337 --> 00:40:44,504
A new beginning.

775
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:47,573
And you will have it.

776
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:50,710
Once we've brought
this world to its end.

777
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:25,686
Are you ok?

778
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,754
Are you?

779
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:32,743
No.

780
00:41:32,744 --> 00:41:35,245
You know what
you have to do, right?

781
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:38,816
You have to kill
the son of a bitch.

782
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:48,397

783
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:05,814
Greg!
Move your head.
