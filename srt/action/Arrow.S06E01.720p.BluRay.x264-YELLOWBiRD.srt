1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,410
<i>Last season on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,917
Are you offering to
help me find my son?

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,044
I want us to find both of our sons.
I need your help.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,173
- Oliver's gonna come for us.
- Yeah, I'm counting on it, sis.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,765
Adrian, where is my son?

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,013
When we get to the airplane,
I'm not gonna get on it.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,935
- What?
- I'm not leaving William behind.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,847
Don't do that.

9
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,183
He's rigged the entire island
with explosives.

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,518
They're remotely linked
to some sort of dead man's switch,

11
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,569
<i>if he dies it detonates
all the devices.</i>

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,488
William, come here.

13
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,906
Are you okay? Are you all right?

14
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,780
He wants you to kill him
so it kills all of us.

15
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,361
No, Adrian!

16
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,235
I'm on site. No sign of Faust.

17
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,156
He's not at his last-known, either.

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,366
Well, his ordinance is.

19
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,791
If Faust is moving
from bombs to missiles,

20
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,459
it makes you wonder
what else he's changed up.

21
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,957
Exactly. Stay sharp.

22
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,338
Boss says stay sharp, hoss.

23
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,050
Faust, it's clear.

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,431
Apologies. Won't be but a minute.

25
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:52,068
If you have the opportunity,
please advise your mayor

26
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,362
that next time
someone threatens to launch

27
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,402
a ballistic missile at his city,

28
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,452
he really should pay up.

29
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,633
Disappointing.

30
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,717
That's an MGM140.
It's fire and forget.

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,097
You can't stop it.

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,224
You can't disarm it.

33
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,775
No.

34
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,857
But I have a very smart friend
who can.

35
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,905
My T-Sphere spoofed
the missile's guidance system.

36
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,365
I'm drawing it back to the water.

37
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,089
You look troubled.

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,852
As if detonation stirred
unpleasant memories.

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,400
Chase sabotaged the plane,
we can't get off the island.

40
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,856
There's an A.R.G.U.S. supply ship
on the eastern shore.

41
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,108
That's on the other side
of the island.

42
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,939
Slade knows where it is, go now!

43
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,150
Hey, Oliver says there's a boat
on the eastern shore.

44
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,947
You lot won't make it in time.

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,571
I'll take my own chances.

46
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,997
I always hated that guy.

47
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,449
- What are we gonna do now?
- What about the plane?

48
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,704
You said you couldn't get it fixed.

49
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,660
For shielding us from the blast,
it should work just fine.

50
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,416
It's not like there's a whole lot
of other options.

51
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,839
No, he's right. Okay,
it's better than nothing. Let's go.

52
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,542
<i>No!</i>

53
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,877
I have to find William.

54
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,087
<i>Samantha?</i>

55
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,261
Samantha?

56
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,594
Look, you go to the plane, okay?
I'll get her.

57
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,595
Careful. Let's go.

58
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,146
- You should be on the plane.
- I'm not taking refuge

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,268
from 100 bombs without you.

60
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,816
- It's more like 250.
- Go! Go! Go!

61
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:05,526
What's this?

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,203
Remarks for the police academy
graduation ceremony.

63
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,450
It seems my promotion came
with speech-writing duties.

64
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,000
- You can write?
- You can read?

65
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,248
I can kick both y'all asses
is what I can do.

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,214
This is really good, Rene.

67
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,963
It's like I keep telling you, hoss,

68
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,927
got the soul of a poet.

69
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,345
I don't think I've ever
heard you say that.

70
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,051
Who the hell asked you, blondie?

71
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,842
You totally missed me redirecting
a ballistic missile, B-T-dubs.

72
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,768
Aw, man, I've already seen you
do that once.

73
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,429
All right, just as you ordered,

74
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,932
a triple stack with a side
of heart disease.

75
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,851
- Don't judge me.
- Yeah, that's for you.

76
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,732
- Surprise is for you.
- Thank you.

77
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,903
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

78
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,071
You're welcome.

79
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,274
Sorry I was MIA.

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,700
I pretty much had to knock my mother
unconscious to get her on a flight

81
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,532
back to Vegas.
She did not want to go.

82
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,367
That's fine. We had it handled.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,122
Yeah, even without Dinah
in the field.

84
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,541
Come a long way in a year.

85
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,745
Yeah. Also makes me grateful for all
the times that Oliver kicked our ass.

86
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,288
Almost.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,836
I'm gonna go home.

88
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,375
We'll walk with you.

89
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,008
Wow. It's been over five months

90
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,963
and their subtlety hasn't gotten
better al all.

91
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,510
- Heard that.
- No, it hasn't.

92
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,134
Um, there's some in there
for William, too.

93
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,935
Got some fries and mini cheeseburger

94
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,011
and then a burger without cheese

95
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,471
'cause I wasn't sure
if he was, like, lactose...

96
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,147
Do you think
there's enough for three?

97
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,435
Oh, I already ate, and unless you're

98
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,942
asking 'cause you think now is
a good time... Do you need a buffer?

99
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,365
I don't need a buffer.
I could use some company.

100
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,234
I know we talked about it

101
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,411
and he's getting used to me,
and it might be a little weird...

102
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,615
I mean, confusing, right?
For him... For us... For me, for you.

103
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,245
Not tonight. Another night.

104
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,584
Promise?

105
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,874
Promise.

106
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,504
Okay.

107
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,299
Hey, come here.

108
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,595
- Where's my mom?
- I know.

109
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,393
I'm gonna go find your mom,

110
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,347
but the island, what happened
is very dangerous,

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,773
and you are safe by the shore,
do you understand?

112
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,150
What happened?

113
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,193
The man who took you when
we saw the explosions?

114
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,441
Okay, he did this.

115
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,568
He said you're my father.

116
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,159
I'm gonna go find your mother.

117
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,783
I'm gonna find her and make sure
that she's safe.

118
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,786
I promise you, but you have
to stay here, okay?

119
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,832
Good.

120
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,505
That food is junk.

121
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,258
That's why kids like it, Raisa.

122
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,552
How'd he do today?

123
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,633
New school. It's hard.

124
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,965
It's been a few months.

125
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,887
You had trouble fitting in
at his age.

126
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,768
What?

127
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,595
What are you talking about?
I had Tommy.

128
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,640
I wouldn't call having a friend
who helps you get into trouble

129
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,982
"fitting in."

130
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,435
It's a fair point.

131
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,158
Hey, kiddo.

132
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,195
Brought home some dinner.

133
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,864
Not hungry.

134
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,619
How's school?

135
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,583
- Fine.
- Yeah?

136
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,955
Making friends?

137
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,961
This weekend, let's go see
a Rockets game.

138
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,883
You know, as mayor,
I get pretty good seats...

139
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,210
I'm tired.

140
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,545
I'm gonna go to bed.

141
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,467
Okay.

142
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,886
Good night, William.

143
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,471
Good night, Oliver.

144
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,356
- Comfy?
- Could I get something to drink?

145
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,982
That'll be up to my lieutenant.

146
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,614
Thanks, Bob. I've got it from here.

147
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,452
Where'd you get the muscle?

148
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,496
Kettlebell swings.

149
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,452
Oh.

150
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,294
The gunmen, jerkwad.

151
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,794
You were rolling with some pretty
highly-trained mercenaries tonight.

152
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,376
According to your friend
in the green hoodie.

153
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,221
Highly-trained means
highly expensive.

154
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,842
You were probably paying
as much to hire them

155
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,848
as you were extorting the city for.

156
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,931
So you're saying there's a problem
with my business plan.

157
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,438
Well, could I get something to drink?

158
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:12,194
I'd be more disposed to linguistics
if I weren't so parched.

159
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,238
What do you want?

160
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,994
Anything carbonated will do.

161
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,073
Don't look so dour.

162
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,449
Mr. Smug'll crack.

163
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,910
It's not the whack job, Lieutenant.
It's Quentin Lance.

164
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,374
As Deputy Mayor, he was supposed
to be here to review plans

165
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,580
for the academy graduation.

166
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,882
- So?
- So his appointment was an hour ago.

167
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,514
All right. It's okay.
I know where he is.

168
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,013
So, get this guy a soda
or something, will you?

169
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,828
Hey.

170
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,121
Hey.

171
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,577
Thanks for coming.

172
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,589
You did the right thing texting me.

173
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,627
It's not like
I can call my sponsor, is it?

174
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,420
Why not?

175
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,388
If I tell him

176
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,222
why I wanna drink, what I did,
why I did it...

177
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,472
Yeah, he'd think you were on
something a lot stronger than booze.

178
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,600
It's like all I've got is this guilt

179
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,402
and all I can do is just run,
run away from it.

180
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,860
And go where?

181
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,525
To the bottom of these glasses.

182
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,365
Well, you're not gonna do that.

183
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,866
Because you know and I know that
is not what Laurel would've wanted.

184
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,667
Which Laurel?

185
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,873
Perfect.

186
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,253
Open it up for me?

187
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,009
Hey, do you think you can claim some
kinda police brutality?

188
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,688
Not at all. No, I just needed
to get this loose.

189
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,981
<i>C4 implant.</i>

190
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,646
Boom.

191
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,367
You're crazy.

192
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,496
I don't judge you.

193
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,250
<i>Well done, Alex.</i>

194
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,260
Right on schedule.

195
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,053
One does one's humble best.

196
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,177
Wire it up. Make it fast.
We're on a clock.

197
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,803
<i>SCPD! Drop your weapon now!
Drop it...</i>

198
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,363
We're all set here.

199
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,494
Care to do the honors?

200
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,425
Let's go.

201
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,900
What's the casualty count?

202
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,575
Nine dead, six in critical
condition, four injured.

203
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,281
Good thing the academy's turning
out a new batch of replacements.

204
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,329
- Come on.
- Sorry.

205
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,162
Look, we might want to consider
canceling graduation

206
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,416
or at least,
closing it to the public.

207
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,668
This city doesn't bend to terrorism.

208
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,090
Look, the media's going crazy

209
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,385
wanting us to figure out how
we're gonna handle this stuff.

210
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,758
We have A.R.G.U.S. connections.
I'll have them handle security.

211
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,135
The question is, who would do this,
and why?

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,762
I think I've got an answer on that.

213
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,722
We've got video footage.

214
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,016
Has anyone seen this?

215
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,066
I managed to get to it
before anyone else could.

216
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,021
<i>Thought you said she'd died.</i>

217
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,906
You said Black Siren died
on Lian Yu.

218
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,825
She did.

219
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,694
She was dead,

220
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,371
buried under a ton of rubble,
when Quentin and I found her.

221
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,617
Okay. Well, unless our Laurel is
mysteriously back from the dead,

222
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,043
something I wouldn't put past
either of the Lance sisters,

223
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,042
Black Siren is not only not dead,
she is not on Lian Yu.

224
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,170
Right. And running with
our "old friend" Alex Faust.

225
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,050
Okay, clearly he was at SCPD
when the explosion went off.

226
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,721
Which means he either
died or escaped.

227
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,969
He escaped.

228
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,843
The question is, why is he
working with Black Siren?

229
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,886
And where did they hire
these mercenaries?

230
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,388
I'll get this image over to Lyla.

231
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,563
She can tell us where
these guys are from

232
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,232
and when
they started working together.

233
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,605
I promised Raisa that
I'd take William to school.

234
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,403
So, I'll check in when
I'm done with that.

235
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,947
Hey, kiddo.

236
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,442
Sorry I'm late. Just I...

237
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,327
He did not sleep last night.

238
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,125
Was he having nightmares?

239
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,787
He seemed fine when I left.

240
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,297
I think he puts on
a good act for you.

241
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,459
But when you left with the emergency,

242
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,799
he cried about the "bad man."

243
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,552
He says the bad man is why
his mother is dead.

244
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,687
Slade?

245
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,358
You all right, kid?

246
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,943
Yeah, I'm fine. Where's everyone?

247
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,278
I came back here looking for people.

248
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,073
What do you mean, you "came back"?

249
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,035
Two of your friends went to
the monastery to look for survivors.

250
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,003
Ra's al Ghul's daughter went
to the cages for that girl.

251
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,331
But your sister...

252
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,208
What about her?

253
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,465
Slade...

254
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,176
Where's Thea?

255
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,554
She's this way.

256
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,688
- Hey.
- Hi.

257
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,099
What do you need?

258
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,526
What do I need?
Lots of things, I mean, you know?

259
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,853
More out of Rene, for one,
you know.

260
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,278
He's all right at the new job,
but...

261
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,401
He's not Thea.

262
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,777
No, he's not Thea.

263
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,740
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about her.

264
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,242
About Thea?

265
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,416
No. No, the other, uh... Laurel.

266
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,291
Dinah wasn't being straight with you

267
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,789
when she told you she was dead
when we found her.

268
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,132
Well, it's complicated, isn't it?

269
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,802
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

270
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,882
Well, listen, the point is that I was
supposed to be at SCPD last night,

271
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:57,094
and I think maybe she went there
looking for me.

272
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,310
Wait, why? Why would she
be targeting you?

273
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,646
A.R.G.U.S. has a lead on Black Siren.
I have to go.

274
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,235
Okay. But, listen,
I gotta come with you.

275
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,365
I know it's not my Laurel. But
I can't sit this out, either, so...

276
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,033
Okay.

277
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,596
Nice outfit.

278
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,772
Except for I would've
gone with fishnets.

279
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,827
<i>Priority is Black Siren.</i>

280
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,662
In custody and unharmed.

281
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,889
Quentin!

282
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,026
- How's Rene?
- Curtis and Lance

283
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,482
took Rene to Dr. Schwartz
for treatment.

284
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,029
Collapsed lung,
it doesn't look so good.

285
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,481
Black Siren and
the mercenaries escaped,

286
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,816
but we pulled this off the van.

287
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,242
- GPS?
- Backtrace it,

288
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,069
- figure out where they came from.
- On it.

289
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,201
Dinah, Quentin thinks the attack
on SCPD was targeting him.

290
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,242
Any idea why?

291
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,540
No.

292
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,666
If Laurel was after Lance,

293
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,748
why blow up the precinct after
discovering he wasn't there?

294
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,333
Maybe Quentin was wrong.
Maybe our first instincts were right.

295
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,384
That she's targeting the police
for some reason?

296
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,508
We need to figure out what that
reason is and we need to find her.

297
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,264
<i>Oh, funny you should say that.</i>

298
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,216
GPS' last location was a warehouse,

299
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,017
surprise, surprise,
outside of Pennytown.

300
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,640
If this Laurel is half as smart as
our Laurel,

301
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,266
she would not go back there.

302
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,098
Maybe she left something behind
for us to go on.

303
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,524
- John.
- We are on it.

304
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,776
The blast blew her over there...

305
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,827
Thea?

306
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,391
Clear.

307
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,688
Clear.

308
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,434
It's all packed up.

309
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,403
Doesn't look like they were planning
on coming back here.

310
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,234
Question is,
where were they headed?

311
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,525
Stay sharp. Look around.

312
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,407
In my experience, bad guys aren't
very good at covering their tracks.

313
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,242
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why?

314
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,415
Since the bridge,
you seem distracted.

315
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,625
Just worried about Rene, that's all.

316
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,876
I saw you take the shot at the merc.

317
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,637
Never seen you miss.

318
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,839
Nobody makes every shot.

319
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,520
What about you?

320
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,645
I don't know.

321
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,313
What about me?

322
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,737
I saw your reaction when Oliver asked
you why Evil Laurel targeted Lance.

323
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,155
And I said I didn't know.

324
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,107
And I didn't find your answer
that convincing.

325
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,613
Really?

326
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,954
What the hell is that?

327
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,420
It's a map of city hall.

328
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,344
With ingress and egress marks
and line of sight.

329
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:42,967
For an attack.

330
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,923
Why the hell would they want
to attack city hall?

331
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,517
After the SCPD got bombed,

332
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,141
they had to move the academy
graduation to a different venue.

333
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,347
Oliver chose city hall.

334
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,352
That decision was kept
under wraps for security reasons.

335
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,558
How the hell did these guys find out?

336
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,769
I don't know, but we're running out
of time to stop them.

337
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,229
The bombs really did their work here.

338
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,822
Yep.

339
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,819
Maybe I should
just do this alone, huh?

340
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,742
What, in case you find
my fake daughter dead?

341
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,036
Or alive.

342
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,699
It's all right, I'll be fine.

343
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,077
What's that, in case she's not dead?

344
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,287
In case Talia al Ghul isn't.

345
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,297
That's what John gave me this for.

346
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,420
Besides, swords aren't really
my thing. Come on.

347
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,761
You think they knew what
they were signing on for

348
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,089
when they threw in with Chase?

349
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,970
Seems to me they "threw in"
with Nyssa's sister.

350
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,802
Either way, I'm gonna go with "no."

351
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,973
Dinah!

352
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,605
Hi, Daddy.

353
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,273
Laurel.

354
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,735
This might be a late night, Raisa.

355
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,030
I remember when your "late nights"
were more like early mornings.

356
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,119
Thankfully,
I've exchanged club openings

357
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,867
for police academy graduations now.

358
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,118
<i>Raisa?</i>

359
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,786
Another nightmare.

360
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,246
I know how to get him
back to sleep.

361
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,497
No, I'll get him.

362
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,341
Hey, buddy.

363
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,586
Where's Raisa?

364
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,555
I'm here.

365
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,474
It was just a dream.

366
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,143
The bad man was in my dream.

367
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,350
He's why my mom is gone.

368
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,899
Well, he can't hurt you anymore,
William.

369
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,105
He's gone.

370
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,937
No, he's not.

371
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,197
The bad man's here.

372
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,527
Buddy, I'm confused. I'm...

373
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,701
Where do you think the bad man is?

374
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,136
Hey, everything okay?

375
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,809
Worried about William.

376
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,679
- You wanna talk about it?
- I would love to talk about it,

377
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,311
but we have more
pressing business, okay?

378
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,648
- Right.
- Okay.

379
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,476
- Okay, well, I cracked the code.
- Mmm-hmm.

380
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,820
I mean, so to speak.
You are welcome.

381
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,070
These are the targeted areas,
which means we can almost be

382
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,779
100% positive Evil Laurel and friends

383
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,202
will be attacking the police academy
graduation tonight.

384
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,613
The question is, why?

385
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,910
Nine dead officers wasn't enough
for them?

386
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,332
No, it wasn't.

387
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,828
Because she didn't get
who she was after.

388
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,496
- You mean you?
- Quentin.

389
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,920
Dinah, I appreciate
you having my back.

390
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,377
But I appreciate the truth
a little bit more.

391
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,345
Wait, what exactly
are we missing here?

392
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,012
You're missing why I told you guys
that Dinah and I found Laurel dead

393
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,760
back on Lian Yu.

394
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,512
Quentin, I don't think
you have to do this.

395
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,813
Yeah, I do.

396
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,480
I've been living with this guilt for
too long. I can't do it anymore.

397
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,195
Bad Laurel,

398
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,525
she wasn't dead when we found her
back on Lian Yu.

399
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,033
Bad news is that you won't be able
to scream anymore,

400
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,336
but the good news is that you'll be
too dead to care.

401
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,926
I told Quentin to say she was dead
when we found her.

402
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,975
Just spare him the pain of telling
you all the truth.

403
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,728
But the truth is, he saved my life.

404
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,025
The truth is I killed my daughter.

405
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,027
I killed my baby girl.
I just left her for dead.

406
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,607
That's the truth.

407
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,158
She was going to kill me.

408
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,036
As sure as I'm standing here
right now,

409
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,409
she was going to kill me
and you saved my life.

410
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,835
- You're staying here tonight.
- I can't.

411
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,587
Quentin, if Laurel's targeting you...

412
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,959
And she's not gonna stop.

413
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:51,754
And the only way we could stop her is
by dangling me right in front of her.

414
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,757
So, I 'm gonna be there tonight,
front and center, you understand?

415
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,678
All right.

416
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,810
You're at the graduation.

417
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,188
We need SCPD K-9 units
at every entry point.

418
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,725
Actually we can kill the K-9s.

419
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,192
What?

420
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,691
By kill, I do not mean
kill the actual dogs.

421
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,897
Curtis, what are those?

422
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,573
These are the latest in high-tech
sniffer devices...

423
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,242
Wait, those are bomb detectors?

424
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:16,695
They can spot as little as
an ounce of explosive material

425
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,825
within a 1,000-foot radius.

426
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,999
Yeah, the only catch is that
we have to be there to operate them.

427
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,371
Which means Curtis and I need
to be on the field,

428
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,794
which means no one will be down here
operating the comms.

429
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,087
I'll do it.

430
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,583
If someone has to take one
for the team, I can do it.

431
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,968
You sure?

432
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,050
Yeah. My gun'll get lost in all that

433
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,222
A.R.G.U.S. and SCPD
firepower anyways.

434
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,224
I'll stay.

435
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,809
Okay.

436
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,229
Okay, let's get out there.

437
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,102
We have to get her out of here.

438
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,105
Oliver?

439
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:53,694
Samantha?

440
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,484
William...

441
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,869
He's fine. Are you okay?

442
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,787
Hey, hey, hey.

443
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:02,866
Yeah, he's fine. We have to get you
medical attention.

444
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,577
No, I just needed to make sure
that he was okay.

445
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,162
He wants to see his mom.

446
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,794
William needs a parent, promise me

447
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,634
that you will be his father.

448
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,007
I promise.

449
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,731
Curtis, you got anything?

450
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,693
Negative. And shouldn't you be
calling me Mr. Terrific?

451
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,819
I am in the field.

452
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,275
Yeah, but you're not in your suit.

453
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,986
So, no suit, no code name.
Them's the rules.

454
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,914
How about we try to focus instead?

455
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,082
Spartan, what do you see?

456
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,621
So far, so good.

457
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,995
Yeah, maybe they decided to rethink
their plan.

458
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,125
That'd be a smart move.

459
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,207
Never seen this many cops
in one place in my life.

460
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,588
Me, either. I'm a cop.

461
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,341
Yeah. Well, doesn't mean they're not
gonna try something.

462
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:58,972
Everyone stay sharp.

463
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,635
Thank you all for being here.

464
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,518
In light of the recent attacks
on the SCPD,

465
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,811
tonight's ceremony is
incredibly important.

466
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,558
And while we need to
mourn the loss of life,

467
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,394
I feel the need to mention
that this city

468
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,279
is better off than it has been
in quite some time.

469
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,777
Crime is down,

470
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,737
our streets are peaceful,

471
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,990
people are not only moving here,
they are staying here.

472
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,367
Do you want to know why?

473
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,165
It's because you help them feel safe.

474
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,001
You have chosen a profession.

475
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,172
One of the most dangerous professions
in the world.

476
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,920
Where, as other people run from
danger, you run towards it,

477
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,468
time and time and time again.

478
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,264
And for that, we all owe you
a huge debt of gratitude.

479
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,971
So, thank you.

480
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,351
Thank you for protecting our
families. For protecting us.

481
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,190
And for our protecting
our beautiful city.

482
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,481
Thank you.

483
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,979
- Well done, Mr. Mayor.
- Of course.

484
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,198
You keep this up, they're gonna ask
you to run for governor.

485
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,992
Yeah? I'm just glad a bomb didn't
go off during the speech.

486
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,987
Anything from Black Siren
and her crew?

487
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,994
You mean the psychopaths I unleashed
on the city? No, not yet.

488
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,121
You can not take that on, Quentin.

489
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,750
And this speaking as one of the
world's leaders in feeling guilty.

490
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,835
Have you ever fired a gun
at your own daughter?

491
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,461
That is...

492
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,963
That's not what happened.

493
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,009
Black Siren is not Laurel.

494
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,473
She is Laurel.

495
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,224
You know it, and I know it,

496
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,178
and we both know that this
"parallel universe" crap is crap.

497
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,516
All right? Every time I see her,
I get that feeling, that instinct...

498
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,859
She's my child.

499
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,275
She's my baby girl, Oliver.

500
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,656
And I tried to kill her.

501
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,155
And from what I understand
you were protecting a friend.

502
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,620
You are not just a good man, Quentin,

503
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:46,992
you are a good father.

504
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,417
I know, because you are a better
father than I could ever hope to be.

505
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,702
You gotta give it some time.

506
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,332
You've only been on at it
what, five months?

507
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,506
- It's not getting any easier.
- Well...

508
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,424
William blames me
for Samantha's death.

509
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,043
Why?

510
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,469
Because he's a smart kid.

511
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,972
And he knows what happened,
happened because...

512
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,675
I was involved.

513
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,520
He shouldn't be with me,
he should be with Samantha's parents.

514
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,518
That's not what Samantha thought.

515
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,349
I don't know how to reach him.

516
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,775
Just be his father.

517
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,067
Hey, anything?

518
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,442
Nothing.

519
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,242
Curtis and I scanned every inch
of this place,

520
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,490
something seems really off.

521
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,788
Let's get in touch with Spartan.
See if he saw anything on the cams.

522
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,789
Spartan, you copy?

523
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,367
Yeah. Still here, still nothing.

524
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,911
Maybe A.R.G.U.S. scared 'em off.

525
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,205
Maybe they're targeting Lance
another way.

526
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,006
Maybe he isn't their target...

527
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,144
<i>John?</i>

528
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,476
<i>John, do you copy?</i>

529
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,270
<i>John, are you okay?</i>

530
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,898
Don't worry, Felicity. John's fine.

531
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,193
He's just gonna be catching up
with an old friend.

532
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,498
Shouldn't you be protecting
the graduation ceremony?

533
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,417
Oh, but what's wrong?

534
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,919
Did you loose your nerve
along with your aim?

535
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,416
I don't know...

536
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,248
You tell me.

537
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:25,629
You want me to kill him?

538
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,714
I'm not paying you to keep him alive.

539
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,223
Hey, psst.

540
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,347
Let's get to work.

541
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,830
You're not gonna feel a thing.

542
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,044
I promise.

543
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,493
You okay?

544
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,655
I'm pissed.

545
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,157
Just about finished.

546
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,833
Make sure you put one here too.

547
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,582
Incoming.

548
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,971
God, you are such a bitch.

549
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,682
Yeah, takes one to know one,
sweetheart.

550
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,911
God news, the bomb sniffer works.

551
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,122
Bad news, it's working in the bunker.

552
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,752
<i>Yeah, the whole place is wired.</i>

553
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,380
If you can take the devices, I can
jam the detonation signal remotely.

554
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,631
Is John okay?

555
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,633
I don't know. But I might not be...

556
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,766
Spartan's fine.
I've got eyes on Black Siren.

557
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,445
To be continued...

558
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,782
<i>Don't move.</i>

559
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,826
I said, don't move.

560
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,128
Oh, this feels familiar.

561
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,169
Maybe this time
you'll aim for the heart.

562
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,375
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,966
For shooting me
or for leaving me for dead?

564
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,130
You were trying to hurt my friend.

565
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,182
Oh, so, you choose your friend...

566
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,348
over your own daughter?

567
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,559
Don't make me do this, Laurel.
Please don't make me do this.

568
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,728
So, now, I'm Laurel?

569
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,357
Don't torture yourself.

570
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,400
Because if we were back on Lian Yu,
and the roles were reversed...

571
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,818
I would've pulled the trigger.

572
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,506
Hell of a mess.

573
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,214
Yeah. What's happening
with the graduation?

574
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,590
Went off without a problem.

575
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,263
Unless you count some food poisoning
from the city caterer.

576
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,965
Graduation was a distraction.

577
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,225
Laurel left that map for me
and Dinah to find.

578
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,804
So when did she pivot from targeting
them to targeting us?

579
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,105
Maybe she didn't.

580
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,564
I mean...

581
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,317
Maybe the SCPD and the bunker
were her targets all along.

582
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,484
Yeah. Seems pretty random.

583
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,233
Particularly considering how much
trouble Laurel went through

584
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,359
to make sure we wouldn't be here.

585
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,066
Well, what if planting the explosives
wasn't her objective.

586
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,651
Planting the explosives was
to cover her objective.

587
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,735
Yeah.

588
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,195
What if she was
trying to steal something?

589
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,246
Like what?
She doesn't need weapons.

590
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,041
Mercenaries she's working with do.
We should inventory the armory.

591
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,540
We should inventory everything
that we have.

592
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,043
If she stole something,
we need to know what it is,

593
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:30,582
and we need to know fast.

594
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,544
Hey, you all right?

595
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,139
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just glad
that nobody was hurt, you know.

596
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,632
Yeah.

597
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,764
Listen, I'm sorry about lying to you
about what happened on Lian Yu.

598
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,931
Quentin... You don't have
to apologize to me.

599
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,357
I'm sorry that you had to go
through that.

600
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,901
When're you gonna stop taking on
everybody else's sins, huh?

601
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,937
No time soon.

602
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,787
How you feeling?

603
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,740
Oh, like a million bucks.

604
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,950
Yeah?

605
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,416
All right, maybe more like
a couple of hundred, but...

606
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,331
I'm alive, right?

607
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,251
Dr. Schwartz would like you in here
for a few more days.

608
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,551
I feel good.

609
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,838
Besides, when have I ever
listened to anybody?

610
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,174
Not to get too personal,
but what would happen to Zoe

611
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,635
if something happened to you?

612
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,223
Not much.

613
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,890
She's got her new family now, hoss.
I mean...

614
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,317
She probably doesn't even
think about me.

615
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,777
She's your daughter, Rene.
Of course she thinks about you.

616
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,188
That ship's sailed.

617
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,860
I blew that chance months ago.

618
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,737
Chase blew that chance for you.

619
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,738
One of many reasons why I think
you deserve another one.

620
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,829
I tried getting another hearing...

621
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,459
Yeah, you're not the mayor.

622
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,092
- You got me another hearing?
- Not just me,

623
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,843
the new DA had
something to do with it.

624
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,517
Okay. All right.

625
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,512
Thank you, Oliver.
I owe you one.

626
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,306
Pay me back by getting better.

627
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,686
Copy that.

628
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,061
Hey, kid.

629
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,940
Hello, Slade.

630
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,659
How is she doing?

631
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,952
She's the same.

632
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,956
What are you doing here?

633
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,290
I popped by to say that the intel
that you gave me on my son, Joe,

634
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,875
it panned out.

635
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,584
So, I'm heading to Calgary.

636
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,672
Well, that's great. I'm very, uh...

637
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,722
I'm happy for you and I hope that...

638
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,600
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

639
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,223
You don't think I will?

640
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,728
I think that finding your son
doesn't always go as planned.

641
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,489
Have things been that hard
with you and your son?

642
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,651
Be patient.

643
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,908
But be prepared.

644
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,490
For what?

645
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,533
Choosing between being the man

646
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,411
that people need you to be

647
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,414
or the father

648
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,799
that your son needs you to be.

649
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,754
What do you mean by that?

650
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,634
You and I

651
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,051
walk between two worlds.

652
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,268
But we can only do that
for so long.

653
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,230
Good luck,

654
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,656
Mr. Queen.

655
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,366
Good luck, Slade.

656
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,270
You okay?

657
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,606
Yeah, I'm good.

658
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,400
Anything missing?

659
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,648
No. All's accounted for.

660
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,531
Including your gun?

661
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,075
Not that you seem to be using it
that much these days.

662
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,240
I checked it
after the fight down here.

663
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,874
You checked my gun?

664
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,326
You didn't even fire it.

665
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,582
And none of the guys down here
got hit, either.

666
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:21,914
Yeah.

667
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,541
Dinah...

668
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,800
I found it.

669
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:37,514
And by found it, I mean I found
what Laurel... Black Siren took,

670
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,850
which is more like not finding
anything at all. You get my point.

671
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,649
What? No, I'm not sure we do.

672
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,356
She took one of my T-Spheres.
A prototype version.

673
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,533
A prototype?
Meaning it's not weaponized?

674
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,119
Well, then they can't
use it against us.

675
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,912
Question is, what can they do?

676
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,445
Hey, buddy.

677
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,490
William, I know that the last few
months have been difficult for you.

678
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:41,954
And I know that you blame me
for a part of that.

679
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,508
I used to blame my dad for things...

680
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,677
Well, he wasn't perfect.

681
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,597
Neither am I.

682
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,888
But he loved me.

683
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,181
I know how much your mom loved you.

684
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,312
She really did.

685
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,568
But you need to know
the last thing that

686
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,897
she asked of me
was to take care of you.

687
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,410
Now, you don't have to like me
for me to take care of you,

688
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,404
because I'm your dad.

689
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,167
The way that works is,
I'm going to be there for you,

690
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,960
whether you want me to be or not.

691
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:28,382
I'm never, ever
walking away from you.

692
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:40,266
There's a game on tomorrow if
you want to stay up late, watch it?

693
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,475
Football or baseball?

694
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,149
Baseball.

695
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,155
Okay.

696
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,874
Okay.

697
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,841
Hi, I was just gonna give you a call.

698
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,513
Turn on Channel 52 right now.

699
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,341
Okay.

700
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,186
<i>...with the discovery of
a shocking photograph</i>

701
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,309
<i>that seems to finally
solve the mystery</i>

702
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,562
<i>haunting Star City for
the past two years.</i>

703
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,852
<i>Who is the Green Arrow?</i>

704
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,939
<i>This photo, which was obtained
exclusively by Channel 52,</i>

705
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:37,944
<i>provides unequivocal proof of
the identity of the vigilante</i>

706
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,619
<i>known as the Green Arrow.</i>

707
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,618
- Oliver.
<i>- This is the latest controversy</i>

708
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,870
<i>- to hit the Queen administration.</i>
- What are we going to do?

709
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,035
<i>What else has the mayor lied about?</i>

710
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,292
I don't know.
