I don’t know if it’s relevant, but...

I’ve been thinking about it a lot
and wanted to ask you, Alicia.

201

Ask away.

you get home from work

205
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
after...

206
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,580
torturing a kid like RÍO

207
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,410
who you’ve made stand for days

208
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,120
in a cell that's smaller than a closet,

209
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,080
shitting and pissing himself.

210
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,330
Then you go home... to Germán.

211
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,410
That’s what I wanted to ask.

212
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,950
You don’t mind they call you
a torturer in the press.

213
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,370
But Germán...

214
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,370
Because Germán is a really good person,

215
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,250
what does he say when you come home?

216
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,250
Does he ask you,
"How was your day, honey?"

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,250
Do you kiss him and...

218
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,160
you hug him?

219
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,830
What then?

220
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,290
Does he hug you? Kiss you?

221
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Do you fuck?

222
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,500

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,450
See, the truth... Well, It's been about
two months since Germán hugged me.

225
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,450
Since he hugged me, since he kissed me,
or made love to me.

226
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,750
To be precise, not since I cremated him.

227
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,870
They pulled a white sheet over his face,

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
they rolled him down to the morgue
in the hospital,

229
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,910

you have two months,

237
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
He was thin.

239

240

It consumed him.

241
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,500
Life grew inside me,

242
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,120
and death grew in him.

243
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,200
But I guess that's cancer.

245

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,950
"Turn on the news."

247
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,250
I thought he was gonna give me
one of those speeches of his

248

because you know he was really eloquent,
and he was really creative too.

- Better.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
- I feel a little more calm now.
- That's great.

If it's okay, I think I'm ready

Don't worry about that now.
What's important is your recovery.

308
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,160
- Okay.
- Okay, let's check your pulse.

309
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,450
Oh. Oh, man, this is way too fast, Amanda.
It's signs of a seRÍOus anxiety attack.

310
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,000
Do you have agitation?
Agitation in your chest?

311
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,120
Well, a little, yes.

312
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,540
No, that's normal.
It’s one of the symptoms.

Why don't you take three?

317
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,200
But isn’t that too much?

318
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,410
It's just a little stronger than Valium.

- Are you sure?
- I swear.

320

322

Okay, everyone, listen up.

339
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,200

341
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,830

and all our photos.

343
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,290
That's why I'm such a fucking robot

344
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,660
calculating 200 million plays per minute
against the Professor.

345
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,950
And that's what this heist needs
right now.

And that's what I need right now too.

347

No?

- Shoot him in the leg!

- I can’t!
- Then knock him to the ground,

or throw him against a wall,
or whatever you need to do...

360

Listen to me.
I couldn't do it. I couldn't move!

<i>He told me he had a family.</i>

362

I couldn’t do it!

363
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,410
Why couldn't you do it?

364
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,620
Tell everyone why.

365
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,330
You couldn’t do it
because you’re fucking traumatized!

366
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,660
And I told you,
but you didn’t fucking listen.

367
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,700
It's because of you. Yeah, you.
You almost killed Helsinki and Nairobi.

Denver, stop!

369
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,040
RÍO warned us,

370
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,330
That’s what's important.

373
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,120
- You took Gandía to the bathroom.

- Of course.

375
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,540
Of course, he did.

But... they're not published
until next month, no?

413
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,250
Yes, we’re still working on them,
but these are close to the final versions.

414
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,290
They're not very encouraging.

415
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,000
They’re going to affect
the rate of your public debt.

416
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,790
- Any recommendations?
- Officially, liquid assets in the bank,

417
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,330
anti-inflationist measures.
You know, standard procedures.

418
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,620
If you'll allow my personal opinion

419
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,790
that will never appear in this report...

on the rise, so bring it here...

2008 was nothing.

Now the debt crisis is on its way.

and those are just the official ones.

457
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,000
Because in the six years that he was
a member of the special ops corps,

458
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,790
there isn't a single record
of his movements, and that means...

459
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,870
black ops, secret missions.

460
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,790
The guy’s an assassin, Sergio.

461
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,910
He’s an assassin.

462
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,160

but without hesitation...

475
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,660
because he won't hesitate.

476
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,910

477

I’m going to tie everyones hands outside

That...

482

and I'll make them think
we’re stronger than ever.

483

Okay.

484

The most important thing you've gotta do
is take a long, deep breath.

608
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,790
Why don't you have any scars
from the torture?

609
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,250
And you don't look like
you lost any weight.

610
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,950
How did he get away, Gandía?

611
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,580
Why are you asking me this?

612
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,250
Because you lied.

613
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,620
Because you didn’t tell us
everything about the torture,

614
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,790
and the Professor told you to be precise.

615
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,330
Why did you only tell me?

616
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,870
I need to know why.

617
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,750
Wanna know why?

618
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Why me?

619
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,160
Because there's so much horrible shit
in my head that I can't sleep.

620
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,000
Because I didn’t want to remember it
or have any of you pity me.

621
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,750
Because I didn’t want to describe

622
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,120
how I was crying so desperately
in that coffin

623
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,830
that the only thing I wanted...

624
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,290
was to be in my bedroom

625
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,620
and hug my mom,

626
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,290
who I thought wouldn’t see a single piece
of me again in her life

627
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,410
because she wouldn’t even have
a body to bury.

628
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,870
- RÍO...
- I cried so muchthat I was having spasms

629
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,080
and I hit my head against the the coffin.

630
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,250
Sand fell in my eyes,
but I kept crying.

631
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:49,200
Enough! Enough!

632
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,290

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,660

I guess I won't surprise you,

766
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,830
but we got to Mindanao,

767
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,120
and your mother and daughter
weren't there anymore. Ta-da!

I’m not going to.

Because the thing is, little RÍO,
before he went into the bank,

772
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,370
gave me the names
of all your transporters.

773
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,620
And he hasn't told the Professor.

774
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,120
I was listening, you know?

775
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,660
How long do you think it'll take until
he gives me your mother and your daughter?

Listen to me.
Gandía is armed. He has a panic room.
