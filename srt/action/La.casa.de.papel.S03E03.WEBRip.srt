1
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:09,041
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,000
STOP FRAUD

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,708
TRAITORS

4
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,583
They're attacking the bank.

5
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,708
They're attacking the bank.

6
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,583
Seal off the building!

7
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,750
I repeat, seal off the building!

8
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,166
Red protocol, sealing the doors.
I repeat,

9
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,875
<i>we're sealing the bank doors.</i>

10
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,791
<i>Everyone, put on your vests.
All of you!</i>

11
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,833
And then the Bank of Spain will be sealed.

12
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,541
Even when sealed off,

13
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,916
the building is very big, Professor.

14
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,125
Too many windows, not enough men.

15
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,208
We can't defend the whole thing.

16
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,250
Good point, Helsinki.

17
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,416
A really good point, but...

18
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,375
this building...

19
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,333
has its own secrets.

20
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,208
This is the part of the Bank of Spain
that interests us.

21
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,083
The structure is covered
with concrete walls

22
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,333
and steel sheets 180 centimeters thick.

23
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,416
From the outside,

24
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,000
it is a true safe.

25
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,458
From the inside,
it's an impenetrable fort.

26
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,083
Once red protocol is activated,
nobody, and I mean nobody,

27
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,625
will be allowed to go in or out
for one hour.

28
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,000
That's the time we need
to obtain a key piece

29
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,583
for stage two of our plan.

30
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,291
What piece?

31
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,750
The Governor of the Bank of Spain.

32
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,708
He'll be in his office,

33
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,625
escorted by five personal bodyguards

34
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,250
with a poor sense of humor.

35
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,458
I call that the ghost train.

36
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,583
<i>Everyone knows
something weird is going on</i>

37
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,125
and things will jump out,

38
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,500
but no one really knows from where.

39
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,291
Governor, sir, I'm Lieutenant Lorenzo.

40
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,625
You must come with us.

41
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,916
We need to evacuate you immediately.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,041
Thank you, Amanda.

43
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,375
For now, I'm not leaving my office.

44
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,666
Sir.

45
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,583
It's a direct order
from General Salas Núñez.

46
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,958
- It comes from above.
- I received it,

47
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,666
but I'm not following it.

48
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,041
I'm not leaving the Bank until
the last employee has left.

49
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,875
So, if you want to protect me,

50
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,041
you'll have to sit down and wait.

51
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,916
Coffee, anyone?

52
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,166
Amanda, if you please.

53
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,375
Come in, come in.

54
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,500
<i>At that moment,
I wondered what Nairobi might be thinking.</i>

55
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,416
<i>I only had one thought my mind:</i>

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,750
<i>to draw my gun
and rain hell down on them.</i>

57
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,416
Get some rest.

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,375
Take a seat.

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,583
May I ask what regiment you belong to?

60
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,208
We're airborne sappers

61
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,416
from BRIPAC,

62
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,333
sixth brigade.

63
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,250
With demining missions in Mali, Lebanon,

64
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,166
Afghanistan.

65
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,541
<i>There were five bodyguards.</i>

66
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,666
<i>We had two guns each,</i>

67
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,541
<i>so we could each take out two men.</i>

68
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,750
<i>It was still one too many.</i>

69
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,708
Very risky business.

70
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,625
By the way,

71
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,333
how do you deactivate
an anti-personnel mine?

72
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,833
It depends.

73
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,708
There are many types of mines

74
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,000
and each one has a different mechanism.

75
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,916
There are the Green Parrots,
the Butterfly, the PMF1...

76
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,208
Some are activated by methods

77
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
that would defuse others.

78
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,375
Some explode due to movement.

79
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,291
Some...

80
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,500
explode when being opened.
Some even explode

81
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,958
when you get too close to them.

82
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,333
May I go to the toilet?

83
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,916
By all means. You can use mine.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Excuse me.

85
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,041
Amanda, if you please.

86
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,916
This way.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,916
The worst are the Russian.

88
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,583
<i>The Professor had prepared us
for any event.</i>

89
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,958
<i>But let's be honest.</i>

90
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,916
<i>Theory is one thing.</i>

91
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,083
<i>The actual action, another.</i>

92
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,666
Go!

93
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,250
Move!

94
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,208
You'll be safe here.

95
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,291
Nothing to worry about
among writers and poets.

96
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:52,916
Stay calm.

97
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,833
Hands in the air.

98
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,041
Like this. Like in a robbery.

99
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,125
Come on.

100
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,916
Very good.

101
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

102
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,416
my name is Palermo.

103
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,458
And I have two pieces of news for you.

104
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,666
Good and bad.

105
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,458
The bad one is that the Bank of Spain
is under attack.

106
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
The good one...

107
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,833
We are the attackers!

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,416
Keep calm! Keep calm!

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,625
Keep calm!

110
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,333
Everyone, keep calm!

111
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,166
VP13.

112
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,250
VP13?

113
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,291
They have an electronic fuse

114
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,541
controlled by a seismic sensor.

115
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,125
Touch them...

116
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,125
and you're fucked.

117
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,416
Afghanistan was full of them.

118
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,541
I see you're well trained.

119
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,875
Sir, do not move.

120
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,875
Are you OK, Lieutenant?

121
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
Lieutenant!

122
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,625
Governor, sir...

123
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,125
Now you must come with us.

124
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,375
Get up.

125
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,041
Come with me.

126
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,208
What are you doing?

127
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Don't move.

128
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,541
Guns down!

129
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,875
Don't move!

130
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,625
Don't move!

131
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,958
Well...

132
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,875
This doesn't look good for either of us.

133
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,750
Let's call it quits.

134
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,333
Quits? You think
we've reached a draw?

135
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,208
You won't shoot the governor,

136
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,291
but I'll do this bitch in.

137
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,625
I'll do it.

138
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,041
Gandía!

139
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,416
Release the girl.

140
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,583
Calm down, Amanda.

141
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,666
It's okay.

142
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,500
- Gandía, release the girl.
- No.

143
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,333
I don't want anyone harmed.
That is an order.

144
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,458
Gandía, release the girl!

145
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,750
I'm going with them.

146
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,958
And I don't want you to do anything.

147
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,041
That's right.

148
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,958
I don't know what you want,
but there's no way out.

149
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,375
Then we stay.

150
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,708
Fire!

151
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,666
Shit!

152
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,583
What the fuck!

153
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,500
Shit!

154
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,791
What just happened?

155
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,250
What just happened?

156
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,250
- Shit! Okay...
- What are you doing?

157
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,541
They're going down. We need to go up.

158
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,708
- We're going down.
- Going down?

159
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,583
If we stay here, they shoot us.
Better to get out.

160
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,291
Let's gate-crash it, Tokyo style.

161
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,458
Shit's about to hit the fan.

162
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,916
Now you belong
to our wonderful hostage family.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,666
We'll enjoy some days
of complete disconnection.

164
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,750
Take the masks and put them on, please.

165
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,875
Put the fucking masks on!

166
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,041
So that nobody feels inclined
to be a hero,

167
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,166
hand in your mobile phones
to my mate, Denver.

168
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,708
Let's do it this way.

169
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,708
Raise your hands if you're parents.

170
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,541
Okay.

171
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,875
We'll tag your mobile phones in red,

172
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,125
so you can make one phone call a day.

173
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,333
Where's that coming from, moron?

174
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,541
Because I say so
and I'm the hostage coordinator.

175
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,750
Did you take a course?

176
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,625
Are you daddy of the year?

177
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,875
Hand in your mobile phones now!

178
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,541
What about this white strawberry?

179
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,041
Oh, my God! You're such a snob, Tokyo!

180
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,750
He's such a cutie.

181
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,875
What's his name?

182
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,125
Ask his father.

183
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,875
Cincinnati.

184
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:14,958
No, come on!

185
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,916
The love of my life seated here

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,750
wanted Cynthia when we thought
he was a girl.

187
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,833
However...

188
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,333
They misread the ultrasound.

189
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,541
- Why?
- I only had the first one done.

190
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you remember where that was?

191
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,625
- Yes.
- In Sulawao.

192
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,583
- In Sulawesi.
- Sulawesi.

193
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,958
- Sulawesi.
- That one.

194
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,833
It looked like a filthy bike garage.

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,083
Unbelievable!

196
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,541
And we never went back.

197
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,166
They took a bullet out of me
during the war in a tractor garage.

198
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,625
- You never told me that, cub.
- For real.

199
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,625
- Where?
- In the ass. Wanna see?

200
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,500
- No...
- No!

201
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,708
Show them your pet, come one, Helsi.

202
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,625
- No.
- Come on! Show them your pet, come on.

203
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,125
- Huh?
- They're family.

204
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,291
OK. Check this out.
I have a new...

205
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,750
No way!

206
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,875
Don't look!

207
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,208
What are you doing?

208
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,250
- It can talk.
- Hey, big man,

209
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,125
want me to train your bear?

210
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,125
I'm good at training animals.

211
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,625
- Did you prefer a girl or a boy, Mónica?
- We didn't care.

212
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:27,291
We didn't care. You love him or her,
not matter what comes out, right?

213
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,291
It's a boy.

214
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,583
What?

215
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,208
A boy?

216
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,250
It's a boy.

217
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,916
It's a boy!

218
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,125
It's a boy!

219
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,166
It's a boy! A boy!

220
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,083
Boy!

221
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,500
Boy!

222
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,750
It's a boy!

223
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,166
Boy!

224
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,250
What can I say? I was happy.

225
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,166
It's a boy!

226
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,958
You could hear him screaming:
"It's a boy!"

227
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,375
So that's it! From Cynthia...

228
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,916
Cinthy...

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,458
Cincy-nati. Cincinnati.

230
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,416
You're insane.

231
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,541
It's pure logic.

232
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,375
He's got a city name.

233
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,500
Like the whole family.

234
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,750
This family.

235
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,666
Cincinnati.

236
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,125
Right?

237
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,625
It's okay, my love. My little boy.

238
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,708
- To him.
- To Cincinnati!

239
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,666
- Well wishes!
- Here, here.

240
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,958
Cheers! To everyone!

241
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:06,875
Come on.

242
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,958
Guys.

243
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,333
I want to thank you for what you're doing.

244
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,833
In Rio's name and in mine.

245
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,791
- Thank you.
- To Rio!

246
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,041
To Rio! Cheers.

247
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,791
Cheers.

248
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,291
We're doing this for Rio, Tokyo, but...

249
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,333
also for all of us.

250
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,916
Right now, they think they can only win.

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,333
Chasing us like animals
and prying us from our holes...

252
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,333
Torturing us. Violating
every human right. Anything goes.

253
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:55,000
If we hide like rats,

254
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,458
they'll strike again.

255
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,000
One by one.

256
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,166
There's only one way to avoid it.

257
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,916
To face them.

258
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
Listen.

259
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,583
In this world...

260
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,083
everything is weighed
on a simple pair of scales:

261
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,458
what you can win

262
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,500
and what you can lose. And right now...

263
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,916
they think they have nothing to lose.

264
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,166
And when you think
you have nothing to lose,

265
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,833
you get stronger.

266
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,250
Well...

267
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,458
we will...

268
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,083
show them...

269
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,625
how much they have...

270
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,541
to lose.

271
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,125
Where's the governor?

272
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,750
Where is he?

273
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,666
Palermo!

274
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,458
We have a problem.

275
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,708
Tokyo.

276
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,333
Take it easy.

277
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,166
- Tokyo.
- Take it easy.

278
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,375
On the count of three, shoot and duck.

279
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,625
One...

280
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,125
Two...

281
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,750
Guns down, you rats!

282
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce myself.

283
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,291
I'm Palermo
and I'm the one in charge of this robbery.

284
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,875
So, please, aim at my chest.
I'm your most valuable target.

285
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,958
Aim at her!

286
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,041
At her.

287
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,125
Okay...

288
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,833
We have a few seconds
before all the shooting starts,

289
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,000
so let's talk about anatomy.

290
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,208
Human beings have two eyes.

291
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,875
And unlike chameleons,

292
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,625
their eyes are located
in the front of the head and are fixed.

293
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,833
This is clearly a handicap for you
in a shoot-out.

294
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,041
Shoot and your girls will be dead.

295
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,541
I'm talking to you, Gandía.

296
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,791
I know that you go to the firing range
every Sunday,

297
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,041
that you like reading about armaments.

298
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,125
You've been waiting your whole
fucking life for this,

299
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,583
to be a hero.

300
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,375
Let me give you some advice:

301
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,416
think of Marisa,

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,333
imagine your son Juanito's angelic face...

303
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,083
and put your fucking gun down very slowly.

304
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,708
Okay.

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay.

306
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,916
<i>At that moment, the Professor realized</i>

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,833
<i>that this job would be very different
from the one at the Royal Mint.</i>

308
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,541
<i>This one didn't come from his head</i>

309
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,041
<i>and he hadn't had the time
to make it his own.</i>

310
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,375
<i>Had he had a rewind button,
he would have pushed it right then.</i>

311
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,458
<i>But he didn't have one.</i>

312
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,000
Are you okay, Tokyo?

313
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,083
Say something!

314
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,541
Are you okay?

315
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,833
Go check on Palermo!

316
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,375
<i>We fired all our bullets at their vests,
following the Professor's instructions.</i>

317
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,500
- Help Palermo!
- <i>But we were too late.</i>

318
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,416
Wake up! Where's the governor?

319
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,875
We have to get him out of here.
Find a stretcher!

320
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,458
Everything's gone to hell!

321
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,333
His eyes are full of glass!

322
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,416
Shit!

323
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,708
Help me!

324
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,333
Move!

325
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,666
Up against the wall! Against the wall!

326
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,333
Come on! Move!

327
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,416
Come on! Hurry up!

328
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,833
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Move!

329
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,458
- Almost there.
- Careful.

330
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:20,708
It's okay.

331
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,000
Painkillers!

332
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,791
Calm down.
I'm taking this off very slowly.

333
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,083
Slowly... Easy...

334
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,166
Very good.

335
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,708
Okay. Open your eyes now. Slowly.

336
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,375
Come on.

337
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,041
Very good.

338
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,416
I can't keep them open for too long.
I can't.

339
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,583
Can you see?

340
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,750
I can't see shit. What's happening?

341
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,083
Shit.

342
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,750
Okay. Okay.

343
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,583
How about the light?

344
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,541
As if I were in Maracanã Stadium.

345
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,500
Does that mean anything to you?
You think you're an eye doctor now?

346
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,375
He needs an ophthalmologist!

347
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,875
Call the Professor.

348
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,000
I see the glass.

349
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,375
Okay. Stockholm, first aid kit number 4.

350
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,708
- The surgical one.
- OK.

351
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,833
Hurry up.

352
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,875
- What are you going to do, Tokyo?
- I'm going to remove them.

353
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,833
- Really? How?
- With tweezers.

354
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,500
I wouldn't do that, Tokyo.

355
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,500
Call the Professor
and release three hostages

356
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,416
- for an eye doctor.
- Denver!

357
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,416
- Shut up and leave!
- Okay.

358
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,875
Listen to me, Palermo.

359
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,750
My hand is steadier than
a Swiss watchmaker's.

360
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,750
I'm getting that glass out.

361
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,500
Do you know
why they use lasers for eye surgery?

362
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,166
- Yes.
- For just a tiny detail.

363
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,250
Precision. Eye operations need
to be precise to the micrometer.

364
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,125
Check this out, Denver.

365
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,166
Tokyo wants to use
the same tweezers she uses

366
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,500
to trim her jungle down there.

367
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,000
Come on!

368
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,083
Nonsense!

369
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,916
Say it again.

370
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,750
Say it again.

371
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,500
How was it?

372
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,583
I'm sure
your peach down there is all silky.

373
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,708
Now say, "I will never mention

374
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,375
my colleagues' pussies ever again."

375
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,333
I will never mention
my colleagues' pussies again.

376
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,583
I didn't get that.

377
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,875
- I'll never mention your pussy, bitch.
- Fucking great, Palermo.

378
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,583
At your service.

379
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,791
Okay. We'll deal with my eyes later.

380
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,250
- Denver, on my right.
- What's up?

381
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,375
Give me your arm.
You're my second in command now.

382
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,041
- I'm your damn guide dog now?
- Silence!

383
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,875
- Tokyo!
- What?

384
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,875
We have 14 tons of steel below.
Tell me Nairobi is with Bogotá.

385
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:36,958
That's right.

386
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,583
Let's go.

387
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,541
Listen. What are you doing?

388
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,333
Are you going to tie us up like dogs?

389
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,416
I'm not.

390
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:49,625
We're all family here,
in case you need to take a piss.

391
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,875
I'm going to kill you.

392
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,500
Governor, I beg your pardon.

393
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,125
I'll hold onto this for you.

394
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,750
Your attention, please.

395
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:08,750
We have placed 460 kilos of explosives

396
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,625
on doors, windows,

397
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:14,500
at every entrance and exit, so in case
anyone tries to escape...

398
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,625
Boom!

399
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,625
They would do so in pieces.

400
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,250
It's not worth it.

401
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,750
We must all stay here together
for a few days, that's right,

402
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,333
but during all this time,

403
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,625
we will

404
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,250
protect you all.

405
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,250
And you will protect us all.

406
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,375
How wonderful!

407
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,375
And now, whenever you want,
you can take the masks off.

408
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,458
Now!

409
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,125
How's that?

410
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:53,958
How are you?

411
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,375
Now that we can see each other,

412
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,208
let me introduce you to Mr. Bogotá.

413
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,250
He's going to pick four volunteers.

414
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,666
My name is Bogotá
and I came to do the hard part of the job.

415
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,375
We're going to work in
over 65 degrees Celsius.

416
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,041
It's going to feel like
a fucking crematorium.

417
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,125
We'll be doing shifts
of 12, 14, 16 or 24 hours.

418
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,708
As many as you can handle.

419
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,375
Who's in?

420
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,625
Name!

421
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,375
Agustín.

422
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,791
- Agustín Montero.
- Why are you here?

423
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:39,875
I was...

424
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,583
exchanging currency.

425
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,291
Step forward.

426
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,791
Congratulations,
you're our first volunteer.

427
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:47,875
Next.

428
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,875
Miguel Talanilla. From Murcia.

429
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,208
- Okay.
- What do you do, Miguel?

430
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,458
I intern at the Operations
and Systems Department.

431
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,500
IT.

432
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,166
- Unsuitable.
- Unsuitable. Next!

433
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,916
Name. Why are you here?

434
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:04,791
Alfonso.

435
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,291
I have... I had an appointment
at the Public Debt Department.

436
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,666
Step forward. Congratulations,
you're our second volunteer. Next!

437
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,166
Name. Why are you here?

438
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,000
Amanda. I'm the Governor's secretary.

439
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,333
Unsuitable. Come on, next!

440
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,416
Name!

441
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:22,916
Matías Caño.

442
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,875
Suitable! Step forward.

443
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,958
- No, ma'am.
- Don't "ma'am" me.

444
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,875
You're our next volunteer.

445
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,875
I'm no volunteer.

446
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,250
Okay. Can you see this finger?

447
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,500
This finger points at the volunteers

448
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,750
and it is pointing
at you over and over again.

449
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,916
So, please, step forward
because you're now a volunteer.

450
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,791
Ma'am, I'm no volunteer.

451
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,166
What was your name?

452
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,125
Matías Caño.

453
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,041
What?

454
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,291
Matías Caño.

455
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,875
Okay, Matías Caño.

456
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,500
You're coming with me right fucking now.

457
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,875
Let's go. Move!

458
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,291
Come on!

459
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,416
Go to the elevator!

460
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,375
Don't move!

461
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,083
Go in!

462
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,208
What was that about?

463
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,541
Are you stupid?

464
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,125
What the fuck was that about?

465
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,500
To seem more credible.

466
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,375
More credible? Do you think
you're fucking Anthony Hopkins now?

467
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,416
I had to act like a hostage, right?

468
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,625
You're joking. From the producers
of "Coming with me right fucking now,"

469
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,666
coming soon to a blacksmith workshop
near you.

470
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,166
I think I did a good job. It went smooth.

471
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,958
I'll slap your face smooth.

472
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,958
Six years!

473
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,958
Six fucking years working with this guy

474
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,291
and six times I've wanted to slam
his head against a wagon.

475
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:29,833
My dears.

476
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,250
In the next few minutes,

477
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,916
even your balls are at stake.

478
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,583
Sergio!

479
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,083
The CNI has arrived.

480
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:18,958
Get them bugged.

481
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,916
Colonel Tamayo.

482
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Inspector.

483
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,416
- Time of explosion.
- 12:04.

484
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,458
We heard shooting
and they put explosives everywhere.

485
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,000
- How were they detonated?
- We're not sure.

486
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,208
Plastic explosive, RDX. Flawlessly made.

487
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,291
They're bluffing.

488
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,166
It doesn't seem like it.

489
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,541
They're at the front, the roof, inside...

490
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:42,416
I studied them. They wouldn't blow it up.

491
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,916
Respectfully,
they're capable of anything.

492
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,791
I take a piss and nothing happens.
They're scum.

493
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,375
- Listen to me.
- Please!

494
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,708
Alfonso.

495
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,291
<i>How are you doing?</i>

496
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,916
<i>I'm fucked big time, Luis.</i>

497
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:03,916
I can't.

498
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,208
I'm sorry. You're in charge.

499
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,250
Don't worry.

500
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,083
Get some rest.

501
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,125
Luis.

502
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Call her.

503
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,958
I sent her to interrogate Aníbal Cortés.

504
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:25,916
Call her.

505
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,958
Gentlemen,

506
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,500
we know everyone here.

507
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,708
I'm Colonel Tamayo, Intelligence.
I'm in charge here.

508
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,583
First, I want the queen bitch here.

509
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,125
Get me Alicia Sierra.

510
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,375
<i>Get her on the phone now.</i>

511
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,916
Back to work.

512
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,041
Get me Inspector Sierra right now.

513
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,833
It's her.

514
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,250
Inspector Sierra, you've got
a phone call from Colonel Tamayo.

515
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,416
Talk to me.

516
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,166
<i>Alicia, Tamayo here.</i>

517
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,875
<i>Get something out of him?</i>

518
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,708
Nothing that can help us, Luis.

519
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,291
Send him to his mommy,
to fix him some soup.

520
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,541
<i>He's gone limp
from all the drugs and chats.</i>

521
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,125
Put him on a plane
and come with him to Madrid.

522
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,500
You've got work here.

523
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,125
Let me be part of this, Luis.

524
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,708
Tell me you want me
to get the fucking shepherd

525
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,791
and his sheep out of the bank.

526
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:40,041
Exactly.

527
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,791
Fuck, yeah...

528
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,458
I'm so happy, my water could break!

529
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,833
I feel uneasy...

530
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,083
in front of all this beauty,

531
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,208
but I've got some pretty unpleasant news.

532
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,875
I've been diagnosed with mom's illness.

533
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,250
How long?

534
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:31,916
Three years.

535
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,958
At the least.
You know how alarmist doctors are.

536
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,500
In the end, it'll be six.

537
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,083
Or seven.

538
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,625
Like a stray cat's life.

539
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,416
Andrés.

540
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:04,041
We'll call it all off
and find a treatment abroad.

541
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,458
First, there's no cure.

542
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,250
And, secondly, I enjoy stealing much more.

543
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:13,208
Do you want to risk spending
the time you have left behind bars?

544
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,250
If a painter told you
he had three years left to live,

545
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,083
would you ask him to stop painting?

546
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,208
Andrés, please...

547
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,750
Look.

548
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,500
Would you have told Michelangelo
to stop sculpting his <i>David?</i>

549
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,000
No. Of course not.

550
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,541
You'd have said:<i> "Forza, </i>Michelangelo!

551
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,583
Continue doing your passion."

552
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,166
A painter? A poet? It's the same thing.

553
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
"Gentlemen,

554
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,166
continue creating beauty."

555
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,083
And this job, Sergio,

556
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,208
is an apologia for beauty.

557
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,791
It's our masterpiece.

558
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,708
Sixteen minutes...

559
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,875
and 15 seconds.

560
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,000
Sixteen minutes...

561
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,000
and 15 seconds.

562
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,875
That's what it is.

563
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,625
The moment you touch that door,

564
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,708
the vault will be flooded.

565
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,791
Sixteen minutes and 15 seconds.

566
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,041
The time it takes the water
to reach here.

567
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,166
Either we make a hole

568
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,916
and weld the interconnection tube
in that time,

569
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,291
or that's it,

570
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,541
we all end up in prison

571
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,708
for nothing.

572
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:47,708
For breaking a door.

573
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,625
But that...

574
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,166
that's not...

575
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,333
going to happen to us.

576
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,625
And that's not going to happen
to us because... Bogotá.

577
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What are we?

578
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,041
The fucking best.

579
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,333
What are we?

580
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,875
The fucking best.

581
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,416
No... Not like that.

582
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,166
You can't melt a 14-ton door like that.

583
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
What are we?

584
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,000
The fucking best!

585
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,166
What are we?

586
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,750
The fucking best!

587
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,291
What are we?

588
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,458
The fucking best!

589
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,000
That's much better! Grab your lances!

590
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,833
This is not a door.

591
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,750
This is butter.

592
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,000
And you...

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,208
You're going to melt it down.

594
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,666
Burnt butter! Take your positions!

595
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,500
Come on, Sergio.

596
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,750
Don't be mean. Imagine it.

597
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,750
Imagine it. You can do it.

598
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,500
Imagine it with me now.

599
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,375
A 14-ton steel door.

600
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,041
And right there,

601
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,458
the best blacksmiths in the world.

602
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,708
Ready?

603
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:11,791
Tick-tock!

604
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,875
Now!

605
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:25,250
The moment we touch that door,
water will pour in; 7,500 liters/minute.

606
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,416
Tick-tock!

607
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Come on! Hurry up!

608
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,458
Don't stop!

609
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,875
<i>Once it's full,</i>

610
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,333
you'd be crushed

611
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,500
if you opened that door.

612
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,708
But we're not going to open it.

613
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,833
Exactly.

614
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,000
We're going to penetrate it.

615
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,833
Bring the ram!

616
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,666
Go!

617
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,666
Now!

618
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,833
Tube!

619
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,666
Go! Lead the way!

620
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,875
In the 16 minutes it takes
the vault to fill up, we'll play

621
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:28,000
Jacques-Yves...

622
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,750
Cousteau.

623
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,250
One, two, three.

624
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,458
Push!

625
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Ready!

626
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,166
Without opening that door,
a welder will go in.

627
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,250
Here.

628
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,291
Okay, we're ready.

629
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,250
Our fate is in your hands.

630
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,416
The oxygen comes first.

631
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,291
- Let me be.
- What are you doing?

632
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,208
- I've got time!
- What the fuck?

633
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,291
Put your oxygen on, Bogotá!

634
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,958
Shit! Why? Why the hell does someone
always have to be the hero?

635
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:31,750
There's always someone
who has to play the hero!

636
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:36,083
And right there,
with water rising by the second,

637
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,208
begins the real fantasy
of the new millennium.

638
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,625
Welding a small interconnecting chamber

639
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,208
to both sides.

640
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:57,375
With water rising by the minute,
it's better than a Bond movie.

641
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:01,625
Not even James Bond could weld
the antechamber in such a short time.

642
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,541
Exactly!

643
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,958
That's why we'll hire
the best welder in the world.

644
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:14,791
If the water level is over the welding,
or this welding isn't perfect...

645
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,375
the water will push with such pressure

646
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,125
that we'd need four or five days
to get him out.

647
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,500
So, he'd die!

648
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:29,833
He'd die!

649
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,708
But what robbery is without risk?

650
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,041
Go!

651
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,291
Don't waste time!

652
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,916
Anyway, brother,
let's not think about that just now.

653
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,750
Come on! Just one more minute!

654
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,166
Just give me one more minute!

655
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,125
Who would imagine that?

656
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:09,916
Who?

657
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:21,541
I'm going in.

658
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,791
An interconnecting antechamber.

659
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,208
Just like a bathyscaphe!

660
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
So then,

661
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:45,250
my dearest brother,
there come the bubbles.

662
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,875
You used to love ocean documentaries.

663
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,458
Well, now comes
your most wonderful moment.

664
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,416
As the flotation levels out...

665
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Bogotá!

666
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,583
You're alive!

667
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,333
...you turn around...

668
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,666
<i>see the bubbles...</i>

669
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:25,833
sparkling bubbles,

670
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:30,000
because of the gold ingots,

671
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,666
and bursting against the roof.

672
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,875
You'll think you're in the Space Station.

673
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:55,416
But you aren't.

674
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,583
You're in the vault of the Bank of Spain.

675
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,166
There... floating...

676
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,416
It'd be like entering a sunken galleon
in the middle of the ocean.

677
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,125
Ninety tons of 24K pure gold.

678
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:31,750
What do you think?

679
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,000
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

680
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:48,916
I told you!

681
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Compay!

682
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,250
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

683
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,125
<i>Guantanamera</i>

684
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,875
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

685
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,750
<i>Do not leave me in the dark</i>

686
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,291
<i>To die like a traitor</i>

687
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,875
<i>Do not leave me in the dark</i>

688
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:33,000
<i>To die like a traitor</i>

689
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:36,625
<i>I am good and good as I am</i>

690
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:40,166
<i>I will die facing the sun</i>

691
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,875
Facing the sun, brother.

692
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,083
I want to die on a beach.

693
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,833
When the judge comes to pick up my body,
I want him to say: "That bastard!"

694
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,291
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

695
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,375
Let's dance.

<i>Guantanamera</i>

697
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,875
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

698
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,541
Dance with me.

699
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,375
My babies...

700
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,708
Look what I brought.

701
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,541
Look at these little earrings I've found.
Would you look at that?

702
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,208
Golden! Sweet gold!

703
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:37,458
That's right!
