1
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,461
Potential juror number
17, please state your name.

2
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,295
Richard Day.

3
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:19,424
Can you state for the court
any preexisting opinion, any at all,

4
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:21,760
that you may hold for the
defendant, Frank Castle?

5
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:24,972
You mean the Punisher? I
think he's an animal...

6
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,641
a sick, twisted, venal...

7
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,227
Hero. That's what we
should be calling him.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,563
Doing the things the cops won't
do, Frank Castle is a...

9
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:34,940
A grotesque insult to
the Second Amendment,

10
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:38,068
a fascist without the authority.
If you ask me,

11
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:39,737
people like Frank Castle ought to be...

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,197
Applauded for putting all the thieves

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,908
and muggers and rapists in the
morgue, where they belong.

14
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:50,205
Let those bastards feel scared walking
down the street for a change.

15
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,642
It's Son of Sam all over again.

16
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:10,851
It's Bernie Goetz...

17
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,814
It's like the only thing
protecting us is Frank.

18
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,606
I just moved my family to New
York, and now we're moving out.

19
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,693
If anyone can kill anyone in this town...
where does the insanity end?

20
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:41,089
Counselors, over 400 potential jurors
have come through this courtroom.

21
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,382
So I should tell you,

22
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:46,595
if you can't agree to move forward
with the 12 men and women selected,

23
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,765
I will make this trial a
living hell for all of you.

24
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:53,101
Your Honor, New York hasn't seen a trial
this divisive and this public in years.

25
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:55,646
Finding an impartial jury is not easy.

26
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,940
Everybody has an opinion
about Frank Castle.

27
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:02,653
It's New York, Mr. Nelson. Everybody
has an opinion about everything.

28
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:06,824
Ms. Reyes, is the prosecution
satisfied with its jury panel?

29
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:09,785
- Yes, Your Honor.
- And the defense, Mr. Nelson?

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,499
- Uh, yes, Your Honor, we are.
- Thank Christ.

31
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:21,589
The trial of The People
of New York v. Frank Castle

32
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:23,465
is now in session.

33
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:03,023
If I get my hands on the worthless
intern who organized these files...

34
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,818
Oh, I'm sure that intern's just
following the DA's orders.

35
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,360
It's not officially sabotage,

36
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:10,280
- just sets it back.
- It's a cheap trick.

37
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,201
We got bigger problems.
Like, locking a defense.

38
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:17,037
- M'Naghten Rule's still our best bet.
- What's that?

39
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,498
- Uh, the, uh, insanity plea.
- Whoa, whoa, guys...

40
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:22,625
We need to buy a "not guilty" verdict.

41
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,670
My high school debate team could
prove that Castle did it.

42
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,088
We need an affirmative defense.

43
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,882
Yeah, yeah, I get that, but I'm
not so sure Frank is insane.

44
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:33,011
I'm no doctor, but I'd say he's
at least driven past Crazy Town.

45
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:34,680
- Foggy, I'm serious.
- She has a point.

46
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:38,266
I mean, insanity only has a 0.12%
acquittal rate in New York.

47
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,477
Reyes is just gonna call in

48
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,021
some expert shrink witness
to blow our case apart.

49
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:45,523
- What case?
- Look, what if we...

50
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:48,485
push for a mistrial?
We get more time.

51
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:50,696
We talk about the DNR and the
suits and Reyes' involvement.

52
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,865
We get her kicked off the case.

53
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:54,616
She wouldn't see it coming.

54
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,746
If we go down that road now,
we gotta prove, in a court of law,

55
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,249
that the government willfully hid
evidence of the Punisher ambush,

56
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,834
and that Reyes was involved.

57
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,170
- Well, I was there and you were there.
- We're not exactly impartial, okay?

58
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,757
And either way, we need an
opening statement tomorrow.

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,300
I can open with PTSD as
a mitigating factor,

60
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,676
focus on Castle's time at war.

61
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:15,846
So you think the war is
what made Frank what he is?

62
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,556
Our only goal is to reduce the
charges and set precedent.

63
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,308
Castle made a lot of enemies, all right?

64
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:22,352
If he goes into general
population, he's as good as dead.

65
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:25,272
We need to get him somewhere safe,
where he can get help, and...

66
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:26,395
citing PTSD could do that.

67
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,484
I mean, none of us know
what Castle saw over there...

68
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:34,948
but research suggests that... PTSD
can be triggered by new stressors.

69
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,366
Like losing your family.

70
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:37,910
I need to get to work on
the opening statement,

71
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:40,037
but we need to be sure Castle
will get on board with this.

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,704
Uh, I'll try.

73
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,457
I mean, Frank made it pretty clear
he's willing to talk to me, at least,

74
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,126
just as long as I'm alone.

75
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,922
- Are you sure you wanna do that?
- Well, I wanna help.

76
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:52,424
We have a better shot at
getting him to talk if I go.

77
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,803
I'll grab the list of questions
I was working on.

78
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:57,805
Okay.

79
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:01,850
Karen...

80
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:06,479
You know you don't have
to do this by yourself.

81
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:09,066
It's okay. Castle doesn't scare me.

82
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:13,695
- Maybe he should.
- I can take care of myself.

83
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:18,241
I know... but
I'd be saying it to Foggy.

84
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,577
Or a Navy SEAL.

85
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,706
Just watch your back.

86
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,419
Promise.

87
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:33,506
Here you go. Just do me
a favor, stick to the script.

88
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,591
Okay.

89
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:38,929
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

90
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:44,309
Grow up so fast, don't they?

91
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:54,212
- Hi, Frank.
- Ma'am.

92
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,267
Um, we've been, uh, looking
over similar cases...

93
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,601
legal precedents, and, uh...

94
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:12,272
we... we think it would help to bring
forth someone from your past...

95
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:15,817
maybe from your... your military
unit, someone who could, uh...

96
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:17,610
speak to the nature of your service.

97
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:22,032
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Um... it's a character witness.

98
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:26,286
Uh, we put someone on the stand who...
who knows you well.

99
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,330
Uh, can... can speak to
what you've been through.

100
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,498
PTSD, huh?

101
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,586
We think it would
greatly help with your defense.

102
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:36,588
Don't do that. It's an insult.

103
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,132
Lots of veterans experience it.

104
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,800
I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about them.

105
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:43,720
It's an insult to them, people who
are actually going through it.

106
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:47,182
I know what you wanna do, you
wanna sit here and label me

107
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:51,061
just another case of some crazy-ass
combat vet who lost his mind, huh?

108
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:54,940
Maybe that'll appeal to some shitbag
jury in some shitbag court.

109
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,194
It wasn't on a battlefield.

110
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:03,240
That's not when my life went to shit.

111
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,577
Now, ma'am, I believe that you told me
that you were gonna find me answers.

112
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,621
That's what you said to me. Do
you have anything for me or not?

113
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:10,872
- Not that easy.
- That what you want?

114
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:13,000
- You want things to be easy?
- You are on trial

115
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,086
for multiple homicides and you don't
have a defense strategy in place.

116
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,964
You don't cooperate with us,

117
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,466
it doesn't matter if I help you
figure out who killed your family,

118
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:22,842
you will never see justice.

119
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,640
All you will do, the rest of your
life, is rot in a goddamn jail cell!

120
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,735
Colonel Ray Schoonover. My old CO.

121
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:46,033
Let's forget the PTSD defense, but
if you want a character witness,

122
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,617
the colonel, he will do.

123
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:49,995
Thank you.

124
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:52,914
Now, ma'am, do you have
anything for me or not?

125
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:58,503
Maybe I just ought to go back and
rot in my goddamn jail cell?

126
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:02,674
Yeah. Yeah, I did some digging.

127
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:06,303
All right, there are huge moving parts
and they do not want to be seen.

128
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:09,139
I've already looked at all of those.
I've done it a hundred times.

129
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,932
Sure...

130
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,434
but you haven't done it with me.

131
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,362
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

132
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:27,574
Imagine, if you will...

133
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:32,204
Yeah, this is Matt.

134
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:35,332
- I found a lead.
- Hold on.

135
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,132
Elektra, I can't do this right now.

136
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:46,468
The guy who encoded that ledger of ours?

137
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,595
Some pervy NYU professor,

138
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,348
master cryptographer who
teaches Asian studies.

139
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:53,766
I'm gonna go beat the cipher out of him.

140
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,143
- Yeah.
- You wanna come?

141
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:56,436
- Hey.
- Hey.

142
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,188
You check out these Dogs of Hell depos?

143
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,314
Might as well have been
written in crayon.

144
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:00,690
I think we could poke
some holes in these.

145
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,613
That's great. Yeah. Just,
uh, give me a minute.

146
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,536
The most important case we've ever
handled starts in the morning.

147
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,954
I can't go with you.

148
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,748
- Can't or won't?
- Can't.

149
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,251
My life doesn't stop
every time you call.

150
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,044
This may be our one chance
to translate this ledger

151
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,133
before the Yakuza adjust their plans and
we lose all the progress we've made.

152
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:27,384
You're infuriating.

153
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,094
Tell me in person. Two hours.
Barclay and Church.

154
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:33,223
I know I'm into some sick
shit, but next time, I swear,

155
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:37,185
all I wanna do is eat moo goo
gai pan off your bodies.

156
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,563
All day.

157
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:44,442
- We're not Chinese.
- Whatever, it's all hot to me.

158
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:47,195
What?

159
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,489
He's a repulsive asshole.

160
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:53,535
A repulsive
asshole who pays well.

161
00:11:54,702 --> 00:11:59,166
I can't tell any of you
apart, but I guarantee...

162
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:03,170
I know all your tongues
better than you do.

163
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:06,130
So... be nice.

164
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,050
Get out.

165
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,110
Hey, honey, I'm home.

166
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:31,281
And you've been awfully naughty.

167
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,454
You're gonna wanna stay real still.

168
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,593
What the hell do you want from me?

169
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:54,679
- You were hired by the Yakuza.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

170
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,764
You encrypted files for them.

171
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:58,808
Money must be good.

172
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,728
Not many professors can afford
garish, high-rise flats

173
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,231
and a revolving door of prostitutes.

174
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:05,607
What do you want me to do?

175
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,611
What you do best, Philip. Translate.

176
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:10,737
But this time for us.

177
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,031
They will kill me
if I tell you anything.

178
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,158
And if you don't,
we'll make you beg for killing.

179
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,794
Thirty stories up, Philip.

180
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:28,880
You'd make a mighty good mess.

181
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:31,299
More liquid than solid, I'd imagine.

182
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,636
- What do you say, Professor?
- Come on, please...

183
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:37,138
Please... please.

184
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,021
- I'll pay you, I'll do anything.
- Once more.

185
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:43,353
I can't. I can't, they'll kill me.

186
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,480
It's gonna break.

187
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:46,898
Okay! Okay, shit!

188
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:48,816
Stop! I'll do it! I'll do it!

189
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,942
I'll help you.

190
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,580
All right, be a pet and
tell us how to read this last page.

191
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,918
They wanted a code
that couldn't be hacked.

192
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:14,175
I put the Japanese alphabet...

193
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,968
through a cipher.

194
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:18,805
Now...

195
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:22,809
put the characters through the
matrix, you can decode it all.

196
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:24,352
You do it.

197
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:36,823
There's weekly shipments.

198
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:39,284
Next one is tonight at 11:00.

199
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,495
Bay Ridge Rail Yard.

200
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:44,910
You find a boxcar with that number...

201
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,662
and you can find the train
you're looking for.

202
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:49,918
What are they shipping?

203
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,048
It doesn't say, I swear.

204
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,595
I swear! I
can't help you anymore.

205
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,975
Well, thank you
for your help, Professor.

206
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,891
Do yourself a favor. Find
better business partners.

207
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:08,986
And kill your decorator.

208
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,087
Hey. Hungry?

209
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,466
No. I don't think
I'm ever gonna eat again.

210
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,344
Cost of looking at these all day.

211
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:42,221
Yeah. How about some fresh coffee?

212
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:44,056
Yes.

213
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,479
Uh, where's Matt?

214
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,106
I thought he'd be burning
the midnight oil with you.

215
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,817
I... He's, um...

216
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,153
He's working on his opening statements.

217
00:15:57,737 --> 00:15:58,905
Oh.

218
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,241
Did you... you talk to Castle?

219
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,370
Yeah, um...

220
00:16:07,163 --> 00:16:10,750
He, uh, won't endorse PTSD, so...

221
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,544
Oh, shit!

222
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:15,004
He's... he's not having
war flashbacks, Foggy.

223
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,381
It... it's just not the truth.

224
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:19,341
Did Castle say anything that we can use?

225
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:21,343
'Cause when the judge calls
his first witness tomorrow,

226
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,847
my only plan so far is
to run away, and...

227
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:26,766
open a butcher shop.

228
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:30,812
Well... I, uh, went over some
of our files with Frank.

229
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:33,398
The medical examiner's report
from his family's murder,

230
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,649
it's filled out by a, um...

231
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:37,777
- Dr. Gregory Tepper.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,696
He's the chief medical examiner.

233
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,053
He's scheduled to testify for Reyes.

234
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:47,328
Well... his report says that
Lisa, Frank, Jr. and Maria Castle

235
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:51,541
each were killed by a single gunshot, but
Frank says there were multiple wounds.

236
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:54,669
He describes them in awful detail, um...

237
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,464
different angles, uh...

238
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:00,341
bullet calibers, exit wounds
that are too big for a handgun.

239
00:17:00,425 --> 00:17:03,428
I mean, his family was
practically shredded.

240
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:07,557
There's a discrepancy,
which is good, but...

241
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,769
it's still their word against Frank's,
who was also shot in the head.

242
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:12,854
Okay.

243
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:15,773
Just for a minute...

244
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,861
try... try to be Frank Castle.

245
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:22,572
To be solely fueled by...

246
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:25,950
by a single cluster of seconds.

247
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:30,538
One moment in... in your entire life...

248
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,003
And every time you close your
eyes, you relive that moment.

249
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,048
And every time you open
them, you find only the...

250
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:46,053
the briefest peace before you realize
that that nightmare is real.

251
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:49,431
That nothing has changed.

252
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,352
Your family isn't coming back.

253
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,773
And so you watch them die...

254
00:17:57,774 --> 00:18:00,067
all over again right in front of you.

255
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:04,280
We're not talking about something
that happened to Frank Castle,

256
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:07,324
we're talking about something
that is happening to him.

257
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:11,996
I hear you.

258
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,666
But...

259
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:17,960
short of having his
family's bodies exhumed...

260
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:22,757
we still have no proof that what
Frank is saying is the truth.

261
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,845
Okay, so...

262
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:32,725
Let's say the ME's report...
was doctored.

263
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,145
It's still tangential and,
so far, inadmissible.

264
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,608
What?

265
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,529
Unless we can get this ME to corroborate
Frank's story on the stand.

266
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:47,156
Can you do that?

267
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,952
It's a long shot. He's still
probably in her pocket, but...

268
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:52,954
if it works...

269
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:55,540
maybe we expose Reyes

270
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:57,584
and we get the mistrial
you've been praying for.

271
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:01,629
So, trial starts in a few hours,

272
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:03,548
and in lieu of a bullet-damaged brain,

273
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:07,802
our case hinges on getting
a dirty medical examiner

274
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,220
to crack on the stand.

275
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:13,558
Guess I'll call Matt. Give him the news.

276
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:14,767
Oh, I'll do it.

277
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:18,104
As long as he has the opening
statement of the year, I'd...

278
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,482
I think maybe we have a chance.

279
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:30,532
We should make bets on
what the Yakuza are exporting.

280
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:33,202
Hundred bucks says exotic animals...

281
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,788
or counterfeit purses.

282
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,207
Last time these guys
brought something into town,

283
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,127
it was a cargo ship transporting a kid.

284
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,588
- Human trafficking?
- Yeah, something like that.

285
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,680
- Oh...
- Elektra.

286
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:56,142
All these cars are empty.
This one's full.

287
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,853
So are the others beyond it.

288
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,606
- Full of what?
- I don't know.

289
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:03,524
There's no negative space.

290
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:06,068
Cargo is uniform. There's no real shape.

291
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:08,445
There's a lot of it, though.

292
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:10,364
Enough to buckle the tracks.

293
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:14,076
You're right. This is ours.

294
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,245
Come on, let's go. Let's have a look.

295
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,475
- Dirt.
- Do they know we're here?

296
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,645
Is this a decoy?

297
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:44,691
Wait.

298
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:48,986
- They're coming.
- Let's go.

299
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,002
You okay?

300
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:31,505
The best things in life leave
you breathless, right?

301
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:36,218
I'm glad you feel that way,
'cause I got something for ya.

302
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:25,726
It's your lucky day.

303
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:29,396
Ahh!

304
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:02,263
What the hell took you so long?

305
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,270
You hurt?

306
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,276
Let me see.

307
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:17,904
Ow.

308
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,118
Do you think this one will scar?

309
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,120
Don't they all?

310
00:24:27,788 --> 00:24:29,957
I suppose I'll never
have short hair again.

311
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,127
Well, you could always tell people
you got it fighting the Yakuza.

312
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,422
No one would believe you anyway.

313
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,721
- All right.
- Thank you.

314
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:50,769
We make a good team, Matthew.

315
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:54,231
Keep some pressure on it.

316
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:01,280
What do you tell people?

317
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:03,490
About?

318
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,702
Where you got your scars?

319
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:13,000
Um...

320
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:15,086
Lucky me, I wear suits to work, so...

321
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:17,296
rarely comes up.

322
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:21,092
What do you tell the
women you bring home?

323
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:23,219
Well, they're enjoying
themselves too much.

324
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:25,304
They don't ask.

325
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:26,513
Sure.

326
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:31,310
Oh, hey.

327
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:35,064
- You're bleeding.
- Oh.

328
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:45,282
- That okay?
- It takes a lot more to hurt me.

329
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,871
You, on the other hand...

330
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:04,968
Oh... I haven't seen this one.

331
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:08,972
Yeah, the Russians like their knives.

332
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:11,892
At least, I think it was the Russians.

333
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:14,895
And these?

334
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:17,689
The Yakuza.

335
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:21,943
Actually, a ninja named Nobu.

336
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:25,031
Nobu Yoshioka?

337
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:26,740
What, you know him?

338
00:26:26,823 --> 00:26:28,700
By reputation.

339
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:33,914
Yeah, this was him, too. That hurt.

340
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:37,793
And the, uh, two on my back.

341
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:45,884
Wasn't there in college.

342
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,179
Most of them weren't.

343
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:51,390
You've been busy, huh?

344
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,642
Seems we both have.

345
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:06,613
Where did you go, Elektra?

346
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,243
The last time we were together...

347
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:18,667
As far from you as I could.

348
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:24,881
And... did you find whatever...

349
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:28,009
you were looking for?

350
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:32,806
Mostly I found that I was alone.

351
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,602
Then why didn't you come back?

352
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,897
Because you
don't know what I know.

353
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:47,654
Because you deserve better.

354
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,133
Lie down. Get some rest.

355
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:30,216
I'm, uh... I'm really late.

356
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:35,346
I... I will look into the exports,
see where they're coming from.

357
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:37,348
Yeah.

358
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:41,685
Have a good day in court, Matthew.

359
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,696
Today, of all days...

360
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,699
I mean, he said he'd be late,
but this is ridiculous.

361
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:57,909
Foggy, what
is going on with him?

362
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,997
All rise. Court is now in session,

363
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,166
the Honorable Judge
Cynthia Batzer presiding.

364
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:12,132
Indictment number 1986-4447,
The People v. Frank Castle.

365
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,675
Be seated.

366
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:19,306
Looks like you're a man down.

367
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,975
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

368
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,895
the defendant has been indicted
for several serious crimes.

369
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:27,689
But I'm instructing you,
as a point of law...

370
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:29,733
You know those college stress dreams,

371
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:31,860
when you show up to your
class in your underwear?

372
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:33,654
- Yeah?
- That's me right now.

373
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:37,783
God damn, Matt was supposed
to deliver opening, not me.

374
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:40,702
Ms. Reyes, are the People ready
to begin opening statements?

375
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,162
More than ready, Your Honor.

376
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:44,415
Should we be worried?

377
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:47,876
I mean, there's no way
Matt misses this, right?

378
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,378
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury...

379
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:54,925
Frank Castle brutally tortured
and murdered 30 people.

380
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:58,178
Thirty that we know of.

381
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:02,182
He took the law into his own hands.

382
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:07,938
Acted as judge, jury, and...
most violent executioner.

383
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:13,234
And you will hear that the defendant's
victims were criminals...

384
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,237
but the victims are not
on trial here today,

385
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:19,866
and justice does not belong in the
hands of a man like Frank Castle.

386
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,160
This isn't the Wild West.

387
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:26,457
Justice is served here...
in a court of law.

388
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,750
And it is up to each of you

389
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:32,504
to take back the city from
lawless vigilantes...

390
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:34,631
like Frank Castle.

391
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:43,349
This man is no hero.

392
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:46,810
He's a serial killer.

393
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:50,772
And he is guilty.

394
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:55,319
Thank you.

395
00:31:57,988 --> 00:32:01,658
Mr. Nelson, are you prepared
to make your opening statement?

396
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:04,203
- She's good.
- So are you.

397
00:32:05,203 --> 00:32:06,585
Mr. Nelson?

398
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:12,713
Mr. Nelson, are you reserving the right
to make your statement at a later time?

399
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:22,012
Screw it.

400
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:24,976
Um...

401
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:28,607
No, Your Honor, um... the
defense is ready to proceed.

402
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,315
Uh, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

403
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,656
the defendant, Frank Castle, is not...

404
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:44,325
Sorry.

405
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,539
Um...

406
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,584
Mr. Castle is as much a victim...

407
00:32:55,504 --> 00:32:57,088
No, he's not.

408
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,098
Okay, so...

409
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:10,561
you're 19... standing in hot sand...

410
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:12,979
sun burning down...

411
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:15,899
noise...

412
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,819
yelling, gunfire...

413
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,363
The only thing that you know for sure

414
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:25,116
is that you're surrounded by
an enemy that wants you dead.

415
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:29,538
But you do it. You endure it.

416
00:33:29,621 --> 00:33:31,247
Why?

417
00:33:31,331 --> 00:33:34,501
Because you have orders.
And you have a duty.

418
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:38,964
And also because your
life doesn't end here.

419
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,926
You have people you
love waiting at home.

420
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:47,973
Because... aside from being
a decorated marine...

421
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:53,311
the man before you is a good
husband and an excellent father.

422
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:58,734
Frank Castle returned
from the hell of war

423
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:01,361
wanting nothing more than
to pick up his life.

424
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:07,200
But his wife... young son and daughter

425
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:09,745
were brutally murdered by criminals,

426
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:13,540
and no one, not the police and...

427
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:17,544
certainly not the District Attorney
stepped up to make it right.

428
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:19,630
See, Frank Castle never came home.

429
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:22,758
He just traded in one
war zone for another.

430
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,348
This trial isn't about vigilantes.

431
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:33,393
It's about the failure
of the justice system.

432
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:36,688
And how one man, Frank Castle,
is being used as a pawn

433
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:38,982
to cover up that system's mistakes.

434
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:41,735
The prosecution wants blood.

435
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,987
But as the judge just said...

436
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,033
to get it, they have to prove their
case beyond a reasonable doubt.

437
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,077
So all I'm asking of you today...

438
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:53,580
keep an open mind.

439
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,168
That's all, Your Honor.

440
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,216
That was a pretty thick slice
of bullshit there, counselor.

441
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,968
Prosecution,
call your first witness.

442
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:08,053
Yes, Your Honor.

443
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:10,055
- Sorry, guys.
- Where the hell have you been?

444
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,057
Look, I made a mistake, Karen,
I feel terrible about it,

445
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,600
but, Foggy, I caught some
of your opening statement.

446
00:35:13,684 --> 00:35:14,893
- You did great.
- He was amazing.

447
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,228
Hey, hey, thanks for
keeping us afloat, buddy.

448
00:35:18,271 --> 00:35:20,440
Yeah, well...

449
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:23,944
hopefully Reyes didn't notice
my buckets of flop sweat.

450
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:26,613
And if the DA's office didn't
suspect we had nothing before,

451
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:27,698
they gotta be sure now.

452
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:28,949
Well, then we'll just
have to change that.

453
00:35:29,032 --> 00:35:30,951
Yeah, who's on the prosecution's
witness list for tomorrow?

454
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:33,494
Uh... I've got it, here.

455
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:38,917
Tepper, wonderful.

456
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,587
Reyes is calling the
chief medical examiner.

457
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,171
From rocky start to Hail Mary.

458
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:44,255
Why, what do we know about him?

459
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,633
I showed Frank a copy of his
family's autopsy report.

460
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:48,509
He claims they're faked, and
Tepper's name is all over them.

461
00:35:48,594 --> 00:35:49,595
Well, that's great. All right.

462
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:51,512
- So we should get him on the record.
- That's what we said.

463
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:53,599
Which you would've known had you
shown up to the office at all.

464
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:55,934
- Let me take lead on it, buddy.
- Like you took the lead this morning?

465
00:35:56,017 --> 00:35:57,769
You've made your point, all right?
Let me try at least.

466
00:35:57,853 --> 00:35:58,854
Let me get a crack at this guy.

467
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:01,481
Even if we get the false
reports entered into evidence,

468
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:04,442
and it's a big "if," since they
concern an unrelated crime,

469
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:07,195
odds are slim that this clown's
gonna incriminate himself.

470
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:10,073
Unless two brilliant attorneys can
figure out a way to trip him up.

471
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:13,702
- Exactly.
- You want it? Knock yourself out.

472
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:17,789
But Tepper ain't talking without a fight.
The DA's pulling his strings.

473
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:20,709
And he's had plenty of time
to bulletproof his story.

474
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:24,504
We only have 12 hours to tear it down. I
don't know how we do that by tomorrow.

475
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:28,008
Because Karen's gonna catch me up,
and we're gonna figure out a way.

476
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:31,678
Fine, but I'm going back to the office,

477
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:34,180
'cause I have the rest of
the trial to prep for.

478
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,437
- You let him down, Matt.
- I know. Hey, I know.

479
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:43,189
But I'm gonna make it up to him.

480
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:44,553
And I'm gonna make it up to you.

481
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:46,693
Come on.

482
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:48,577
You get Tepper thinking
about the real report.

483
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:50,071
- Mmm-hmm.
- The real truth.

484
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:52,991
And then when he's disoriented, I
follow up with something like...

485
00:36:53,074 --> 00:36:54,910
"Who had you change the report?"

486
00:36:54,993 --> 00:36:56,494
And even if he says "no
one," it proves...

487
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:57,996
It proves that the report was changed.

488
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,497
- And that's...
- That's brilliant.

489
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,958
- See? You're a natural.
- Huh.

490
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,919
Well, I keep good company.

491
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:05,796
Ah, you know what?

492
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:08,048
Why don't I help you go through
Tepper's bread-crumb questions?

493
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:09,883
We could, you know, set
'em up, knock 'em down?

494
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,592
All right, but it'll be boring.

495
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:13,303
And tedious.

496
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:16,222
- Could take all night.
- Hmm.

497
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:18,642
Well, I don't mind.

498
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:20,811
- What?
- You ever consider law school?

499
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:23,689
Oh, I don't know.

500
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:26,149
Well, Foggy and I know a lot
of good people at Columbia.

501
00:37:27,442 --> 00:37:29,986
I mean, if it's even something you want.

502
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:35,075
Just thinking Nelson and Murdock
might be more fun as...

503
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:36,993
Nelson, Murdock and Page.

504
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:41,748
You're... you're sweet. Uh...

505
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:46,336
I don't know. I don't know if law
school's really the right fit for me.

506
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:47,796
Um...

507
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:51,299
I guess there's just something
about the rules and the loopholes.

508
00:37:51,382 --> 00:37:54,803
It just feels like the truth
gets lost a little too often.

509
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:57,086
Well, not every case will be
The People v. Frank Castle.

510
00:37:57,138 --> 00:37:58,223
Right, right.

511
00:37:58,306 --> 00:38:01,517
But, you know, it's not
just this case. It's...

512
00:38:02,728 --> 00:38:05,646
Uh...

513
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:08,942
What is it?

514
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,238
You know, we...

515
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:17,283
You ever...

516
00:38:18,326 --> 00:38:20,453
think back to the night we first met?

517
00:38:21,872 --> 00:38:24,249
Yeah, all the time.

518
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:30,255
While I sat in that police station...

519
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:31,506
alone.

520
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:35,135
I was afraid of the whole world.

521
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:39,139
Well, at least, until...

522
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:41,141
you and Foggy came into my life and...

523
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:46,104
You trusted me. You gave me hope.

524
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:52,736
And then we came back to your place.

525
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:55,238
I offered you Thai food.

526
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,490
God...

527
00:38:58,574 --> 00:39:01,161
I remember everything about
that night, 'cause it's...

528
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:04,289
not every day your life is threatened...

529
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:07,793
then saved by a man in black.

530
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:12,672
Hey, you...

531
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,842
You believe in what he does?

532
00:39:15,926 --> 00:39:19,179
- You know, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Um...

533
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:24,810
I, uh...

534
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:30,273
- What?
- I... believe in the law.

535
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:34,903
- If that's what you're asking.
- Right. No, but... but...

536
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:36,822
But what about when the law fails?

537
00:39:36,905 --> 00:39:38,656
Like it did with me,
like it did with Frank.

538
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,826
You know, what are we supposed
to turn to? What should we...

539
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:43,411
What should we believe
will protect us then?

540
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:49,835
See, you're asking a Catholic lawyer.

541
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,627
- I, uh... Yes.
- What do you...

542
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:54,380
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

543
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,342
Uh, I guess it's just...

544
00:39:57,425 --> 00:40:00,178
ever since we took on
Frank's case, like...

545
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:01,262
I keep...

546
00:40:02,263 --> 00:40:05,809
I keep asking myself if there's
really a difference between...

547
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,604
between someone who saves lives and...

548
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:13,108
someone who prevents lives from
needing to be saved at all.

549
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:14,234
Right?

550
00:40:16,277 --> 00:40:17,362
Wait... Wait a second.

551
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:21,032
Frank Castle should be behind bars.

552
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:23,576
I mean, he deserves a fair
trial, but he's murdered people.

553
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,120
Yeah, right. Bad people.

554
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:26,621
I mean, like the ones
who killed his family

555
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:27,705
or the ones who came after me.

556
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:30,083
But it's not Frank's
decision who lives or dies.

557
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,252
That's up to God...

558
00:40:32,335 --> 00:40:35,046
or sometimes a jury.

559
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,965
What happened to Frank's
family is a tragedy, Karen,

560
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:38,466
but it doesn't give him
the right to kill...

561
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:40,551
No. No, no, no. God... God, no!
Not the right, that's...

562
00:40:40,635 --> 00:40:42,303
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying that...

563
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:43,930
I can understand why Frank... why...

564
00:40:44,014 --> 00:40:45,723
why anyone would seek vengeance
for something after...

565
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:47,366
- after losing it...
- Whoa, no, no, no.

566
00:40:47,392 --> 00:40:49,519
That's not the same.
Vengeance is not justice.

567
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,187
What he's doing is completely wrong.

568
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,231
But, right or wrong, you
can't deny that it works.

569
00:40:56,902 --> 00:40:58,111
You really believe that?

570
00:40:58,194 --> 00:40:59,863
I don't know. No.

571
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:06,827
Maybe.

572
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:17,172
- Um...
- No, um...

573
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,757
You know, maybe this is a
good time to call it a night.

574
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:23,344
I just think we're both exhausted, and...

575
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,305
You know, a case this
big, let's just...

576
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:25,955
Um...

577
00:41:26,014 --> 00:41:27,390
Yes, you're probably right.

578
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,896
I don't know, maybe, uh, after...
after the trial's over.

579
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:35,315
- Yeah, a real date next time.
- Good.

580
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:39,444
Thanks.

581
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:52,873
- Uh, good night.
- Good night, Karen.

582
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:56,544
Get some rest.

583
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,228
- How long were you listening?
- I wasn't listening.

584
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:14,938
I didn't hear anything about your work

585
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:18,399
that would make me want to tie a
noose and test it on my neck.

586
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:20,986
I won't even mention what I didn't
hear about your girlfriend.

587
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:24,239
- I warned you not to interrupt my life.
- This is not your life, Matthew.

588
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:26,532
You may not give a damn about
what I've made for myself,

589
00:42:26,616 --> 00:42:28,409
but that is what's most important to me.

590
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,704
All right? She... is important to me.

591
00:42:32,622 --> 00:42:33,664
Right.

592
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,875
Sorry.

593
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:41,131
I didn't know your time pairing wine
with Thai food was so important.

594
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:43,008
What do you want?

595
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:46,886
I looked more carefully at
Roxxon's construction investment.

596
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,597
Seems there's only a small
number of projects in New York

597
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,849
capable of moving that much dirt.

598
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:55,145
We pay the sites a visit, I bet
we find out what they're hiding.

599
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:58,439
- What are these sites?
- Um...

600
00:42:58,523 --> 00:43:02,110
The Conservatory Hotel, the
Midtown Tunnel project,

601
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:04,612
and some big build
site at 44th and 11th.

602
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:06,697
44th and 11th.

603
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:08,324
- You know it?
- Yeah, Midland Circle.

604
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:10,451
There was a tenement on that block

605
00:43:10,535 --> 00:43:14,039
before Wilson Fisk swallowed it up
in his Better Tomorrow initiative.

606
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:16,707
- How did the Japanese get hold of it?
- I don't know.

607
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:20,170
But before I fought Nobu, I found
blueprints at Midland Circle.

608
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:24,965
Now, I always thought Nobu was just
a weapon Fisk sent to take me out,

609
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,302
that Fisk had interests
tied up in the building,

610
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:28,803
but maybe he didn't want it at all.

611
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:32,015
I mean, what if he only acquired
Midland Circle for the Japanese?

612
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:33,933
That's a curious riddle,

613
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:35,768
one I think we should
go and solve together.

614
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,062
Elektra, I got court in the morning.

615
00:43:37,145 --> 00:43:39,772
- I got a case to prepare, I got...
- Tomorrow night, then.

616
00:43:43,943 --> 00:43:45,570
Cheap wine.

617
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:48,156
Finish your homework.
I'll do some recon.

618
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:54,120
And so, Dr. Tepper,
the medical examiner's office

619
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:57,665
can confirm that the 15 victims
found at the Irish Social Club

620
00:43:57,748 --> 00:43:59,334
all died of multiple gunshot wounds.

621
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,461
Yes, that's correct.

622
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:06,966
Um, all 15 victims died of wounds
inflicted by the same caliber bullet...

623
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,469
each shot multiple times.

624
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:11,262
Thank you.

625
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:13,306
Your witness.

626
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:21,814
- Cross your fingers.
- I'm crossing everything.

627
00:44:33,076 --> 00:44:34,785
Dr. Gregory Tepper,

628
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:37,455
how long have you been medical
examiner for the city of New York?

629
00:44:37,538 --> 00:44:39,915
Uh, 14 years, uh, give or take.

630
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:42,877
And how many death certificates would you
estimate you've signed in that time?

631
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,961
Huh?

632
00:44:45,087 --> 00:44:47,548
Um, I don't, uh...

633
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:48,758
It's probably in the tens of thousands.

634
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:50,968
Objection, Your Honor,
leading the witness...

635
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:53,429
- I'm not sure where.
- Mr. Murdock...

636
00:44:53,513 --> 00:44:55,223
I have something I need to say.

637
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,351
- Doctor?
- Your Honor, I'm sorry, but...

638
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:00,186
I have to, on the record...

639
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:03,439
I need to say something
about what I did.

640
00:45:05,816 --> 00:45:08,236
- Clear the gallery.
- Yes, Your Honor.

641
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,114
All jury members, please exit
back to the deliberation room.

642
00:45:12,948 --> 00:45:14,242
Everyone in the gallery,

643
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,495
please make your way out of
the courtroom at this time.

644
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,918
What's all this about?

645
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:26,337
I...

646
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:30,508
I know what the defense was gonna
ask me about, and it's true.

647
00:45:30,591 --> 00:45:32,468
I altered the autopsy reports.

648
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:34,345
Uh, you're referring to
the official findings

649
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:36,029
on the murders of Frank Castle's family?

650
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:37,973
Not just them.

651
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:40,142
You don't understand. I had to do it.

652
00:45:40,226 --> 00:45:44,272
- Those animals came to my office.
- Who came to your office?

653
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:46,816
After the defendant's
family was murdered,

654
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:48,818
two men I'd never seen before...

655
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:51,987
they warned me, if I didn't
fix the case reports,

656
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:54,490
they'd come after my family next.

657
00:45:54,574 --> 00:45:58,160
You falsified the autopsy
findings on the Castle family?

658
00:45:58,828 --> 00:46:00,705
Them and one more.

659
00:46:00,788 --> 00:46:02,623
- Who?
- I don't know.

660
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:04,709
Some John Doe killed the same day.

661
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:07,086
Male, adult, multiple gunshot wounds.

662
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:10,423
Look, you can fire me, arrest me...
I don't care.

663
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:14,009
I thought this was behind
me, but after last night...

664
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:16,512
Doctor, did something happen last
night to impact your testimony?

665
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:18,931
She was in my house.

666
00:46:19,014 --> 00:46:20,266
She tied me up.

667
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:24,854
She said she didn't give a
damn who got to me before.

668
00:46:24,937 --> 00:46:27,565
If I didn't tell the defense
what really happened,

669
00:46:27,648 --> 00:46:29,234
she'd hunt me down and kill me.

670
00:46:29,317 --> 00:46:31,319
- Who told you this?
- I don't know.

671
00:46:32,278 --> 00:46:33,279
A woman.

672
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:36,324
Her face was covered. Had
some foreign accent.

673
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:39,285
Your Honor, I believe the defense
intends to distract the jury

674
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:42,872
and make this case about some
impossible-to-prove conspiracy theories...

675
00:46:42,955 --> 00:46:43,956
Impossible to prove?

676
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,251
Your ME just confirmed that he
doctored the autopsy records.

677
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:48,085
He also said that he'd been threatened.

678
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:51,171
If my office finds out that your
firm had anything to do with this...

679
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:54,259
Our firm? For all we know, it
was you who sent those goons.

680
00:46:54,342 --> 00:46:55,468
I've heard enough.

681
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:59,305
It's clear to me that whatever Dr. Tepper
may know about these autopsy reports

682
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:00,806
has been tainted

683
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,018
by threats made by person
or persons unknown.

684
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:05,728
Then the defense asks for a mistrial.

685
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:08,939
Not on your life, Mr. Nelson. I'm
still not convinced these documents,

686
00:47:09,023 --> 00:47:11,609
whatever they may be, are
even relevant to this trial.

687
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:14,737
I'm striking the doctor's
entire testimony

688
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,657
and instructing the jurors to disregard
anything they may have heard.

689
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,368
- Your Honor, I strongly urge you to...
- We're done here, counselor.

690
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:23,538
Trial will reconvene tomorrow with
the prosecution's next witness.

691
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:27,166
Once again, Reyes finds
a new way to screw us.

692
00:47:27,249 --> 00:47:29,569
You'd think it'd get easier,
but somehow it's more painful.

693
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:32,338
Foggy. Foggy... it wasn't Reyes.

694
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:35,800
- What?
- The woman who threatened Tepper.

695
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,678
It was Elektra.

696
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,972
From college.

697
00:47:42,056 --> 00:47:44,224
- Elektra?
- Yeah, she's back in town.

698
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,186
- Your ex-girlfriend?
- Yes.

699
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:50,022
No. This is insane.

700
00:47:50,105 --> 00:47:53,359
She's a diplomat's daughter, a...
a debutante.

701
00:47:53,443 --> 00:47:55,861
Not anymore. She's, uh...

702
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:59,490
She's... she's different. She's...
she's dangerous.

703
00:47:59,574 --> 00:48:02,034
Yeah, no shit. She
nearly got you expelled.

704
00:48:02,117 --> 00:48:05,371
I mean, she screwed your semester
of torts, civil procedure...

705
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:08,165
You almost missed the final
because she hurt you so bad.

706
00:48:08,248 --> 00:48:09,291
And now, what?

707
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:11,794
- She's... breaking into an ME's house?
- Okay.

708
00:48:11,877 --> 00:48:13,671
So, the Yakuza
didn't go away, all right?

709
00:48:13,754 --> 00:48:14,797
They're still here in Hell's Kitchen.

710
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,257
Elektra is trying to help me
stop them, infiltrating...

711
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:18,718
What are you even talking about?

712
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:20,553
She was going up against
them by herself, and she...

713
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:23,116
- Your ex-girlfriend?
- Yeah, I'm trying to protect the city...

714
00:48:23,138 --> 00:48:27,184
I knew she was crazy, I didn't
know that she was homicidal.

715
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:29,144
She's, um...

716
00:48:30,438 --> 00:48:31,897
my new client.

717
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:35,776
Foggy, the, uh... rich one.

718
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,111
The private one.

719
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:41,949
- You lied again.
- I did, I lied,

720
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:43,784
but, look, the Yakuza are
funneling money into something

721
00:48:43,868 --> 00:48:45,411
even bigger and darker
than before, all right?

722
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:47,037
Elektra came to me, I'm
trying to help her...

723
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:49,707
You wanted to take this trial!

724
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,126
You missed strategy sessions...

725
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:55,671
witness prep, opening statements,
and you criminally decimate...

726
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:56,756
No, I didn't. She...

727
00:48:56,839 --> 00:48:58,674
I never told her anything
about the trial, all right?

728
00:48:58,758 --> 00:49:01,511
The one witness that could've
helped us do what I wanted to do,

729
00:49:01,594 --> 00:49:02,595
which is take down Reyes!

730
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:05,222
She must've overheard me talking to
Karen, and then she moved on her own.

731
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:06,849
I would... I didn't
sanction, I would never...

732
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:09,644
- I don't care! I don't care, Matt!
- I'm furious with her!

733
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:11,937
Stop acting like these
things just happen to you!

734
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:14,732
No one's making you go out all hours
of the night fighting bad guys

735
00:49:14,815 --> 00:49:18,819
and nobody makes you lie to your
friends, over and over again!

736
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:22,740
Elektra is not the problem, Matt.

737
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:26,577
You are.

738
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:30,498
It's almost dark.

739
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,792
- I'm sure there's someplace you gotta be...
- You're not walking away.

740
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,585
- No, 'cause you know what?
- Don't walk away from me, Foggy.

741
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:38,338
If the last few days are any indication,
you sure as hell haven't been here!

742
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,512
Going forward, I will count
on you for nothing at all.

743
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:51,060
Tell your girlfriend to
stay away from my trial.

744
00:49:51,143 --> 00:49:52,983
Yeah, she's not... Elektra's
not my girlfriend.

745
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,314
Then you should be the one
to tell Karen about her.

746
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:00,402
Hey.

747
00:50:00,486 --> 00:50:03,448
- Hey, I heard yelling.
- Yeah, you should talk to Matt about it.

748
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:04,532
Foggy!

749
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:08,786
- Hey, what the hell happened in there?
- We're fine.

750
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:10,955
No, no, no, you don't treat me
like I'm just your secretary.

751
00:50:11,038 --> 00:50:12,289
I've done more work on
this case than you have!

752
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:15,209
- I can't get into this right now, Karen.
- No, enough of the dodgy bullshit.

753
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:16,836
I deserve to know what is
going on with you two.

754
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:17,920
With you.

755
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:21,381
You asking as my co-worker?

756
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:24,301
Or my girlfriend?

757
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:26,971
- Both.
- Yeah.

758
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:28,430
I am sorry you're caught
in the middle of this,

759
00:50:28,514 --> 00:50:30,349
but right now, I have to go.

760
00:50:30,432 --> 00:50:33,060
- Where?
- I'll see you tomorrow, Karen.

761
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:37,940
Yeah, maybe.

762
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:58,043
What the hell did you do?
I told you to stay out of my life.

763
00:50:58,127 --> 00:51:00,170
I never asked you to coerce a witness!

764
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:02,422
- You had a problem, so I stepped in.
- No! It doesn't help.

765
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:05,134
We can't even use his testimony because
of you. It was all thrown out.

766
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:07,094
I was only following your rules.

767
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:10,765
- What rules?
- You don't get what you want by day.

768
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:13,768
You take it by force at night.

769
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:15,895
This is who you are, Matthew.

770
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:19,982
And don't fool yourself into
thinking it's anything else.

771
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:22,109
What I do...

772
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:23,819
is none of your business.

773
00:51:24,695 --> 00:51:27,990
- Both halves of my life are mine.
- Fine.

774
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:31,994
I'll stay out of your boring legal shit.

775
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,790
Now, you wanna fight me?

776
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:38,793
Or you wanna fight the guys who
are tearing your city apart?

777
00:52:48,528 --> 00:52:51,573
- You didn't wanna help?
- You didn't want me to.

778
00:52:54,076 --> 00:52:55,077
Ready?

779
00:53:05,755 --> 00:53:06,922
You hear something?

780
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:11,468
We're alone.

781
00:53:35,284 --> 00:53:38,537
It's empty. There's nothing in here.

782
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,249
- The Yakuza were guarding something.
- Yeah, but...

783
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:50,507
Shh!

784
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:53,678
- Elektra.
- What?

785
00:53:56,764 --> 00:53:58,307
You're not gonna believe this.

786
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:13,948
Holy shit.

787
00:54:18,202 --> 00:54:20,996
Why are the
Yakuza digging a hole?

788
00:54:23,498 --> 00:54:24,959
Give me the flashlight.

789
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:39,765
- Did it hit the bottom?
- No.

790
00:54:40,933 --> 00:54:43,102
Tell me when it does.
