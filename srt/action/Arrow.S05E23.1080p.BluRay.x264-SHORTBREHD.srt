1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,424
This season on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,806
<i>Either I'm willing to do
whatever is necessary,</i>

3
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,261
or I shouldn't be out there at all.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,598
One day, your actions might have
some unintended consequences.

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,148
Prometheus, you want revenge.

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,852
I'm going to show them
how everything you touch dies.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,279
He calls himself Adrian Chase.

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,984
<i>He means to destroy you utterly.</i>

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,362
Your crusade was based on a lie.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,996
Make it home, make it better,
right my wrongs. Survive.

11
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,244
NO!

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,793
<i>You used your father's memory
to justify a killing spree.</i>

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,621
<i>I'm not going to kill you.</i>

14
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:41,710
I am never going to give you
the satisfaction of being the man

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,718
- that you think I am.
- You're wrong.

16
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,345
<i>Please help me.</i>

17
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,718
Where is my son?

18
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,968
No! No! I said you let me go,
and I keep your loved ones safe.

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,514
I'll see you on the boat.

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,719
I know where he's taking them.

21
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,106
<i>The name of the island
they found me on is Lian Yu.</i>

22
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:06,325
<i>It's Mandarin for purgatory.</i>

23
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,919
What brought you back to the island?

24
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,085
Like I said...

25
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,005
I need your help.

26
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,335
What the hell's going on here?

27
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,305
We have a problem,
and I need you to get off the island.

28
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,382
I'm not going anywhere, neither is he.

29
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,302
I'm taking him.
And I'm taking Digger Harkness.

30
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,937
There's an A.R.G.U.S. supply boat
that is docked on the eastern shore,

31
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,560
you take it and you go.

32
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,021
I'm not abandoning my post.

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,609
Suit yourself.

34
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,696
Would you like to explain what's going on?

35
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,491
I'd like to talk about you for a minute.

36
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,246
- You seem...
- What, in possession of all my marbles?

37
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,792
The Mirakuru wore off
a long time ago, kid.

38
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,800
I mean, I remember
everything that happened,

39
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,597
I'm not trying to escape that,

40
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,892
but it feels like some bad dream.

41
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,727
Now, regardless of my sanity,

42
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,901
why do you want to help me
after everything I've done?

43
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,990
There is a man here on the island
named Adrian Chase.

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,820
He's holding my friends
and my family hostage,

45
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,497
including Thea

46
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,996
and my son.

47
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,919
Since when you do you have a son?

48
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,292
Slade, are you gonna help me or not?

49
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,010
I think I'm stating the obvious
when I say I killed your mother.

50
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,630
And for that alone
you should've killed me.

51
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,009
Maybe what's happening now
is the reason I didn't.

52
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,769
This is all the intel that I've been
able to gather on your son, Joe,

53
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,518
including his present whereabouts.

54
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,901
Are you offering to help me find my son?

55
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,316
I want us to find both of our sons.

56
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,428
You and me, kid, like old times.

57
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:54,201
You know,
if we're going to fight side by side,

58
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,278
you're going to have to
at least speak with me.

59
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,783
I know, it's awful.

60
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,160
Pity.

61
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,791
By now, I thought you'd realized

62
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,495
that by disbanding
the League of Assassins, I freed us both.

63
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,662
Are you looking for applause?

64
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,923
Clapping is a little more difficult
for me these days.

65
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,675
Have you offloaded the supplies?

66
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,882
Most. Guns and ammo
are still on the plane.

67
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,339
By the way, what do you need an RPG for?

68
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,341
Well, like I said,

69
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,521
Chase has Talia, an army of her students,
Evelyn Sharp, and a meta-human.

70
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,772
I have no interest
in this being a fair fight.

71
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,188
Is that why you released
the animals from their cages?

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,355
Oh, come on, love.
That is no way to start a new friendship.

73
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,278
Look at me again like that,
and I'll feed you your eyes.

74
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,700
You're not her type anyway.

75
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,706
All right, that's enough.
Let's offload the rest of the gear...

76
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,455
Ooh.

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,206
So much for our gear.

78
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,962
There goes our ride home, kid.

79
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,807
Are you sure you heard the gunshot?

80
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,009
Very sure. You sound surprised.

81
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,224
Yeah, well, I know he would crack

82
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,935
but I expected him to last
a little longer,

83
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,141
it was almost disappointing.

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,859
Find him.

85
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,989
And, Gennady,

86
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,576
no one kills him but me.

87
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,727
- In 48 hours.
- <i>Da</i>. In two days.

88
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,125
The RPG that took out the plane
came from over there,

89
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,965
and the call from my son
originated just west of here.

90
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,671
Hostages could be at either place.

91
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,886
Or neither. This is a large island.

92
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,510
- I'll check the RPG site.
- I'll accompany you.

93
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,467
Oh, it's almost like
you don't trust me, Nyssa.

94
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,727
No, it's exactly like I don't trust you.

95
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,638
Check it out. Stay on comms.

96
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,317
Why does he get a weapon and I don't?

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,023
I trust him more than you.

98
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,907
Didn't he kill your mother?

99
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,618
You listen to me very carefully,

100
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,492
you help me take down Chase, you walk.

101
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,161
You screw with me even a little bit,

102
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,744
and I will put you
right back into that hole.

103
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,414
Just a gun is all I'm saying.

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,127
Kid.

105
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,091
I see movement.

106
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,678
Stay sharp.

107
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,390
Oliver!

108
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,858
Keep your voice down.

109
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,686
What the hell is he doing here?

110
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,815
- Where is William?
- I don't know, we were separated.

111
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,483
Oliver, what is going on?

112
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,034
Why are they unguarded?

113
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,036
Seems pretty obvious to me, mate.

114
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,669
- It's a trap.
- Don't even think it, Oliver.

115
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,418
Or your son loses his mother.

116
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,749
Oh, and...

117
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,085
And don't worry about that gun, mate.

118
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,969
Mr. Chase gave me this nice new one.

119
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,141
Along with a better offer.

120
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,720
Adrian said it would be pointless
to reach out to you.

121
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,565
Although, given this turn of events,
perhaps you've changed your mind?

122
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,400
What's it gonna be, Slade?

123
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,028
Care to side with the winners?

124
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,073
What's it gonna be, mate?

125
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,575
Put a gun to his head.

126
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,961
<i>Sorry, kid,
but there's no giving up to these guys.</i>

127
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,425
I assumed you'd wanna be
on the winning side.

128
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,305
Assumption is the mother of all failures.

129
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,235
Sister!

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,765
Six men are dead. It's impossible!

131
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,098
Nothing is impossible with him.

132
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,935
Where you going?

133
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,229
<i>Vertolet.</i> I'm gonna end this.

134
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,617
- You okay?
- Go to hell.

135
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,321
I'll take that as a yes.

136
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,700
You've been left behind.

137
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,328
You should choose your friends
more wisely.

138
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,213
Where is everyone else?

139
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,174
Not sure, Chase split us up into groups
when we got here.

140
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,009
We are gonna talk about that, right?

141
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,340
Yes, we're gonna talk about that.

142
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,881
Right now, we need to focus
on finding the others.

143
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,217
- Where are they?
- I wish I knew.

144
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,928
So I could tell you
to go screw yourselves.

145
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,517
Why did Chase split up all the hostages?

146
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,056
Why does Chase do anything?

147
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,975
So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop

148
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,860
you could keep yourself
from jumping through.

149
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,738
Maybe leaving me here
was part of the plan.

150
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,943
- How did Chase get you here?
- A plane.

151
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,362
Do you think
you can find your way back to it?

152
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,702
- Yeah, probably, but...
- Malcolm, can you fly a plane?

153
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,367
If it's anything like
the three Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.

154
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,083
Get them to the mainland
and then come right back for us.

155
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,622
We are not leaving you here.

156
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,042
I need to focus, and that means
getting you out of harm's way.

157
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,470
And despite my better instincts,

158
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,630
when this is all over
I will come back for you.

159
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,595
When this is all over, you'll be dead.

160
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,601
Can I talk to you for a sec?

161
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,852
Yeah.

162
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,229
- Okay, what the hell are you doing?
- What do you mean?

163
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,565
I mean Slade Wilson and Malcolm Merlyn!

164
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,526
- Thea, there...
- No, we are orphans because of those two.

165
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,032
You know what I'm up against here.

166
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,784
Yes, so why are you
sending Curtis and I away?

167
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,914
Because I need the two of you
to keep Felicity and Samantha safe.

168
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,916
- We need to get them off of the island.
- Okay, Curtis can handle that.

169
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,952
I understand
if you don't wanna go with Malcolm.

170
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,374
Damn right, I don't.

171
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,461
And I do not want to rely on Slade Wilson.

172
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,092
There's nothing about this situation
that's ideal, Thea.

173
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,263
I need your help, Speedy,
and this is how you help me.

174
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,104
- Okay.
- Okay.

175
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,190
My sister and Harkness fled
into the forest, but I can track them.

176
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,437
They might lead us
back to the rest of the hostages.

177
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,530
They're our friends,
and we don't need your help.

178
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,033
I see you haven't lost your feistiness,
Ms. Smoak.

179
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,536
Get them to the plane,
make sure that everyone stays safe.

180
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,991
Comms, just in case something goes wrong.

181
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,325
You mean "when," right?

182
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,712
Detailed satellite imagery of the island.
Again, just in case.

183
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,632
- What was that for?
- "Just in case."

184
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,216
We're gonna make it through this.

185
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,931
You can't know that for sure.

186
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,397
I didn't wanna regret not kissing you.

187
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,810
When it comes to the two of us,
I regret enough as it is.

188
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,941
Let's talk more about this
when we're off the island.

189
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,577
You all keep each other safe.

190
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,170
Nice place.
This island got a Big Belly Burger, too?

191
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,387
Before the Chinese turned Lian Yu
into a prison, it was a holy retreat.

192
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,805
But now you're using it for payback
for a guy you barely know,

193
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,219
on a guy you barely know.

194
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,432
Chase freed me.
I don't owe Oliver Queen a thing.

195
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,565
- John!
- Hey.

196
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,568
Hoss. You okay?

197
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,774
- Rene.
- Okay, everyone, calm down.

198
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,328
The four of you are gonna have
plenty of time to catch up.

199
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,617
See you later.

200
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,826
I'm assuming
that you tried your sonic scream.

201
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,796
Sonic dampener. I can't even whistle.

202
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,044
Don't worry.
Oliver will get us out of this.

203
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,302
Yeah? What makes you think
he even knows where we are?

204
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,267
- The trail's gone cold.
- Are you sure?

205
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,194
No doubt my sister knew we would follow.

206
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,448
Let me go on ahead,
see if I can recover the trail.

207
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,737
Okay.

208
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,952
So instead of marrying the blonde,
you marry Ra's al Ghul's daughter?

209
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,992
Nyssa talks too much.

210
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,162
She hasn't explained your beef with Chase.

211
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,675
My past is coming back to haunt me.

212
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,799
Seems to be
a recurring theme with you, kid.

213
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,175
Don't know why.

214
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,512
Well, it's not really that complicated.

215
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,517
You suffer from survivor's guilt.

216
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,012
You can't get over
the death of your father.

217
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,645
Adrian Chase
has nothing to do with my father.

218
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,316
Kid, when it comes to you,
everything has to do with your father.

219
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,110
You and I are not dissimilar.

220
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,613
We're both haunted by our pasts.

221
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,247
And the only way you to bury that ghost
is by forgiving yourself.

222
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,204
Forgiving myself? For what?

223
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,461
You blame yourself
for your father's suicide,

224
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,250
and everything else
that has gone wrong since.

225
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,878
You need to forgive yourself
for your sins.

226
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,467
You say that like it's easy.

227
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,261
It is the hardest thing in this world.

228
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,307
If the two of you are done relaxing,
I've picked up the trail.

229
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,240
There's something I need to tell you.

230
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,909
Can we save
the horribly awkward conversation

231
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,115
for when we're off this island?

232
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,870
No, that's what I need to say.

233
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,031
When we get to the airplane,
I'm not gonna get on it.

234
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,496
- What?
- I'm not leaving William behind.

235
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,162
- No, Oliver will bring him back.
- I know,

236
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,456
but I can't abandon my son.

237
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,011
You know, for what it's worth,
I wasn't in favor of sending William away.

238
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,134
Not that I was consulted, or...

239
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,716
ls that why you two broke up?

240
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,801
I'm sorry, I saw you're not wearing
your engagement ring.

241
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,309
Yeah, no, it's just...
It was complicated, you know.

242
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,182
I saw that kiss you gave him.

243
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,018
Doesn't seem that complicated to me.

244
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,695
You know, I traveled
halfway across the world to rescue you,

245
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,704
I thought it would at least entitle me
to a conversation.

246
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,115
Yeah? Well, it doesn't.

247
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,500
Did it ever occur to you
that I'm here because I'm your father?

248
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,999
No, you are not.
We are nothing to each other.

249
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,789
Don't you ever understand that?

250
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,299
Thea? You okay?

251
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,720
No, she's not.

252
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,883
She just activated a land mine.

253
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,103
Don't move.

254
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,487
The trigger's rusted over.

255
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,399
Okay. That's good, right?
That's a good sign?

256
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,661
No, that's really bad news.
It means we can't disarm it.

257
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,496
Well, somebody needs to do something.

258
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,123
Thea, on the count of three,
take your foot off the mine.

259
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,329
No, that'll blow us all up!

260
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,543
- I'm gonna take her place.
- That's crazy!

261
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,919
Yeah, you're not the first one
to call him that.

262
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,421
Look, I'll just find a boulder
around here or some...

263
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,841
No, we don't have that kind of time!

264
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,128
- Thea.
- No, okay? No one is doing this, okay?

265
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,638
Okay, okay, it's all right.
All right.

266
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,598
I forgot how stubborn you could be.

267
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,934
Oh, my God!

268
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,103
- Thank you for reminding me.
- What the hell are you doing?

269
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,146
I'm gonna take care of them,

270
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,944
disarm the mine,
and I'll catch up with you.

271
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,946
- Yeah, and how are you gonna do that...
- He's not going to.

272
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,319
No, okay? If you think that you needed
to prove something to me, you don't, okay?

273
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,989
- You've proved it.
- I'm not trying to prove anything.

274
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,376
From the moment you were born,
all I ever wanted was to protect you.

275
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,879
You don't have to,
I didn't ask for you to!

276
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,622
A child doesn't have to ask.

277
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,883
Don't do this, okay?

278
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,508
You may not think of me
as your father, Thea,

279
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,971
but you'll always be my daughter.

280
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,815
All right, go, quick!
Get her out of here. All of you, go!

281
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,356
- No, seriously, this is insane!
- Go!

282
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,825
- Go after the rest.
- I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

283
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,402
Oh...

284
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,706
Well, you don't seem too bright,

285
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,039
just standing out here
in the open like this.

286
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,713
What kind of ass backwards strategy
is that?

287
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,667
Let me show you.

288
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,650
The trail continues this way.

289
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,027
This place brings back memories?

290
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,865
Feels like a lifetime ago.

291
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,452
For Shado, it was.

292
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,038
No time for nostalgia.

293
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,532
I know where they're going.

294
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,632
Do either of you
know anything about this place

295
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,464
that could give us a tactical advantage?

296
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,505
I've only seen it one time,
and that was from a distance.

297
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,924
Well, maybe we should split up.

298
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,101
Should we?

299
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,432
Yeah, go on, Nyssa, we'll be fine.

300
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,646
She doesn't trust me.

301
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,646
Can you blame her?

302
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,238
No.

303
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,168
Tell Mr. Chase I have a gift for him.

304
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,892
Oliver.

305
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:23,978
Don't blame me, Mr. Wilson is the one
who gets credit for this trophy.

306
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,980
Slade. You son of a bitch.

307
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,441
I never should've trusted you.

308
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,161
- Are you all right?
- Where's my son?

309
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,821
William? Chase took him, too?

310
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,161
We didn't know anyone else was here.

311
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,575
Okay, what makes you think he's here?

312
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,294
He took Samantha.

313
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,705
He showed me a video of William.

314
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,293
He is on this island somewhere
and we need to find him.

315
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,003
I'd ask if you're okay,
but I don't see how you possibly could be.

316
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:32,633
Honestly, I...
I don't even know how I feel right now.

317
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,215
Twenty-four hours ago,

318
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,722
I couldn't even think of Malcolm
without wanting to scream,

319
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,634
and now, now I miss him?

320
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,721
- Is that insane? I...
- It's not insane.

321
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
He's your father.

322
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,645
He manipulated me, he lied to me, he...

323
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,779
He got me to kill my friend's sister, I...

324
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:02,242
How can you miss somebody
that you have hated so much?

325
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,958
Yeah. You know I have some experience
with evil dads, too.

326
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:12,419
My father abandoned me, lied to me,
and then took a bullet for me,

327
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,128
saving my life.

328
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:19,464
Malcolm was not a good person,
and he was an even worse father,

329
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,883
but in his own way,

330
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,050
he loved you.

331
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,428
Today, he proved that.

332
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:32,519
God, I don't know,
it's like today I got to see

333
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,562
the father that he could have been,

334
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,574
but he'll never get to be

335
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,454
because he's gone.

336
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,203
"The plane, boss, the plane!"

337
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,589
Reference too dated?

338
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,387
Who's gonna fly the plane now?

339
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,637
Oh, don't worry, between Curtis and I,
we have over 500 points of IQ,

340
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,722
so we'll probably
be able to figure it out...

341
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,853
- No.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.

342
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,559
No, it's not that.

343
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,106
- Are those antennas?
- Yep.

344
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,150
And that's C-4.

345
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,649
This is way too many antennas
for a remote trigger.

346
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,827
- They must be networked.
- Great, so there's more than one.

347
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,158
Yeah, you could say that.

348
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,998
Wait, there's hundreds.

349
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,454
Way too many to defuse.

350
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,173
All right, let's get out of here.

351
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,585
I think Wilson did something to your head
when he knocked you out.

352
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,715
Curtis worked this up for Dinah.

353
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,004
It's gonna control your canary cry,

354
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,969
but it's also gonna bypass
the sonic dampener.

355
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,180
Oh, I love that Curtis!
This may hurt a bit.

356
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,598
Just sing, Canary.

357
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,305
Actually, it's Black Canary.

358
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,985
The prisoners.

359
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,865
Don't concern yourself with them.

360
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,326
We have unfinished business, sister.

361
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,372
I heard you gave up
the ring of the Demon's Head.

362
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,416
What a foolish woman you've grown into.

363
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,253
It was your selfishness
that forced me to grow up alone.

364
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,599
Our father never would have
passed his mantle on to a woman.

365
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,098
I had to forge my own path.

366
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,890
And you left me,
knowing I would suffer at father's hand.

367
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,559
And you wish to settle the score now?

368
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,485
I stand with my friends.

369
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,443
You ally yourself
with our father's murderer.

370
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,237
He'd be ashamed of you.

371
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,281
Father was always ashamed of me.

372
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,249
No.

373
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,253
Do not interfere.

374
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,631
Do it.

375
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,043
Father would have wanted you to.

376
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,970
- You're late.
- But they are not.

377
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,804
He was only pretending to screw with you?

378
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,315
I needed a way
to get Curtis' device to Dinah.

379
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,558
Have you seen my son?

380
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,524
I've searched. Your son is not here.

381
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,359
We gotta get my gear, and we gotta move.

382
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,994
We find Chase, we find my son.

383
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,947
Not so sure about that, hoss.

384
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,000
Hello, Oliver. Welcome back to purgatory.

385
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,888
Where's my son?

386
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,303
I love this.

387
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,606
Even now, at the end,
you're still ten steps behind.

388
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,229
Where is my son?

389
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,276
William, good name.

390
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,647
Sort of a sweet kid, actually.
You sure he's yours?

391
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,441
Adrian! Where is my son?

392
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,653
If you wanna get your son back,
you know what you have to do.

393
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,821
I know what you want me to do,

394
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,748
and I won't do it.

395
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,207
I'm not gonna kill you,
no matter what you do.

396
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,171
That is never going to happen.

397
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,458
Never say never.

398
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,612
You said nothing ever really dies.

399
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,491
You're going to.

400
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,041
<i>Do svidanya, Konstantin.</i>

401
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:52,131
My men overheard your conversation
with that traitor, Knyazev.

402
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,769
The boat he's arranging will be here soon.

403
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,644
I don't have to kill you, Oliver Queen.

404
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,439
I only need to make sure
you never get on that boat.

405
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,160
You thought you could replace me?

406
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,292
That's cute.

407
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:15,421
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, I did, for so many reasons.

408
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,890
Oliver, do you copy?

409
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,513
Are you sure you can't defuse these bombs?

410
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,303
Well, I can with my equipment back
in Star City,

411
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,561
but with this teeny-tiny, little tablet

412
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,972
all I can do is try
and locate the trigger.

413
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,140
- Okay, but you can try, right?
- Yeah, I can try.

414
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,353
Okay, good, you do that. And, Curtis,
you just, you work on the comms, okay?

415
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,275
- How?
- I don't know,

416
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,569
you're the genius, all right?
You both are,

417
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,199
so, we need you to do this.

418
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,239
So you guys just gotta,
both, do this right now.

419
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,505
There's the killer
that I know and love.

420
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,144
Maybe you stronger
with that hood of yours.

421
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,480
Tell me where my son is!

422
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,100
"Pain is fascinating, isn't it?"

423
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,264
I told you I was gonna make sure
that you were dead this time.

424
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,897
Do it, Oliver.

425
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,281
You know you want to.

426
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,531
Adrian, tell me, tell me where my son is!

427
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,236
Never.

428
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,706
You're not gonna make that boat.

429
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:16,375
This island
will remain your prison forever.

430
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,810
It's all over, but only if you do it.

431
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:39,152
Do it, Oliver, and show everyone,
show yourself who you really are.

432
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,995
No!

433
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,337
It's who I was.

434
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,798
That's who I was, before!

435
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,177
It's not who I am now.

436
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:15,313
You can blame me for your father's death
for the rest of your life.

437
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,776
Lam done blaming myself for mine.

438
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,822
I knew it would come to this.

439
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,704
Your son is dead, Oliver.

440
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,649
I don't believe you

441
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,731
because you're a liar.

442
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,243
You're lying to me, to manipulate me
into doing what you want.

443
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:12,157
But, Adrian, here's the thing,
if you are telling the truth,

444
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,499
if you killed my son,

445
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,714
I am never going to be
the person you want me to be.

446
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,839
Not ever.

447
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,228
<i>Oliver? Oliver, do you copy?</i>

448
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,102
- Felicity.
- You can't kill Chase, did you hear me?

449
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,557
What are you talking about?

450
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,102
He's rigged the entire island
with explosives.

451
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,145
They're remotely linked
to some sort of dead man's switch.

452
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,732
If he dies, it detonates all the devices.

453
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,277
He wants you to kill him
so it kills all of us.

454
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,956
Oliver! Oliver, are you okay?

455
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,749
It's okay, I'm fine.

456
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,502
John, you need to get to the plane,
and make sure that everyone's safe.

457
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,884
- Felicity can talk you in.
- Oliver, what the hell is going on?

458
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,173
Chase has put explosive charges
all over the island.

459
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,177
You need to get to the plane,
and you leave when you get there.

460
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,718
- What are you gonna be doing?
- I'm going after my son.

461
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,803
What if Chase is telling the truth?

462
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,015
I don't believe him. I can't believe him.

463
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,894
But either way, Adrian Chase
is not getting off this island.

464
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,716
Where is William?

465
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,005
Hmm.

466
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,300
Where is William?

467
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,469
You really love that kid, don't you?

468
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:16,849
Adrian!

469
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:33,279
For an absentee father,
your devotion is impressive.

470
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,319
Here you are, worried about your kid

471
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:36,782
when everyone else that you care about

472
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,455
is on an island
about to get blown up sky high.

473
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,710
My friends and my team
can take care of themselves.

474
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,246
By using my plane to escape, right?

475
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,915
I can't start the engine.

476
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,001
John's right.
There is definitely something wrong.

477
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,135
With the plane or with the pilot?
No offense.

478
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,921
None taken. I'm no ace,

479
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,841
but I know how to start a plane.
Whatever this was, it's not pilot error.

480
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,807
Either way, we're not going anywhere
without Oliver, or his son.

481
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,475
Actually, we're not going anywhere at all.
I found this ten feet from the wing.

482
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,185
Please don't tell me
that's what I think it is.

483
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,729
That depends on if you think
that's an on-wing hydraulic system.

484
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,818
- Can we repair it?
- With what tools?

485
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,733
So we're stuck here,
is that what you're saying?

486
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,697
We have to tell Oliver. Now.

487
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,871
Oliver, do you copy?

488
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,541
- I'm here.
- Chase sabotaged the plane.

489
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,701
We can't get off the island.

490
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,121
There's an A.R.G.U.S. supply ship
on the eastern shore.

491
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,334
That's on the other side of the island.

492
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,165
Slade knows where it is. Go now!

493
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,801
They'll never make it in time.
Besides, we're not finished here.

494
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,420
Oh...

495
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,432
Don't do that. Even if you had a shot,

496
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,184
you've already told me
that you wouldn't kill me.

497
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,889
Or have circumstances finally changed?

498
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,191
If I die, everyone you care about dies.

499
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,153
Except your son.

500
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,032
But if you don't kill me, I kill him.

501
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,080
You son of a bitch.

502
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,869
William, or everyone else.

503
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,708
You choose, right now.

504
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,761
Either way, it proves me right, yeah?

505
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,218
Either way, it's exactly like I told you,

506
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,973
everyone around you,
everything you touch, dies.

507
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,740
William! Come here! Hey, are you okay?

508
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,246
Are you all right?
Did he hurt you? You all right?

509
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,499
- He's gonna be fine.
- Don't you talk to him.

510
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,789
Don't even look at him!

511
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:00,713
<i>Hello?</i>

512
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,510
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

513
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,806
Mom, it's...

514
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:09,973
It's Oliver.

515
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:17,155
My son has been dead for five years.
Please don't call here again.

516
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,367
<i>Mom, Mom, please!
Just listen to my voice.</i>

517
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,912
It's Oliver.

518
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,292
<i>I did not die on the Gambit,
I'm alive, I'm okay.</i>

519
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,040
Oliver?

520
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,253
Oliver, is that you?

521
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,717
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
Just please don't hang up, okay?

522
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,637
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, I won't.

523
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,969
<i>- Oh, my beautiful boy.</i>

524
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,224
Is... ls your father alive?

525
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,313
No.

526
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,410
No, he and, uh...

527
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,072
And Sara didn't make it.

528
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:16,123
Oliver, sweetheart, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

529
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,376
<i>Where are you?</i>

530
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,085
I...

531
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:27,889
I'm not entirely sure, but I'm...
I'm on a boat.

532
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:34,183
I love you and I'm coming home, okay?

533
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,977
I love you!

534
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,234
<i>Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.</i>

535
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,193
You won.

536
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,991
Your son has his father back,

537
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,704
and he learned exactly who his father was.

538
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,873
Just like you learned who your father was,
right here.

539
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,884
On these very same waters.

540
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,591
- What?
- William's younger than you were,

541
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,431
so he's gonna be fine, you know.

542
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,770
And you have each other.

543
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,514
What did you say?

544
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,811
Which is good. Oliver, that's good.

545
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,606
Because it's gonna be lonely

546
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,738
without Mom, and Felicity.

547
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,247
No, Adrian!

548
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:27,962
