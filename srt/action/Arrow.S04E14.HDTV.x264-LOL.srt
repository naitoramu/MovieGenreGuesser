1
00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:03,678
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,232
After 5 years in hell,
I returned home

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:09,033
with only one goal--
to save my city,

4
00:00:09,035 --> 00:00:10,734
but my old approach
wasn't enough.

5
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,603
I had to become
someone else.

6
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:15,840
I had to become something else.

7
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:18,542
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:20,077
Previously on "Arrow."

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,512
Someone else is throwing their hat
in the ring.

10
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:22,335
ho?

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,359
Ruvé Adams.

12
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:26,117
I'm Oliver.

13
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:27,251
He can't know that
you're his father,

14
00:00:27,253 --> 00:00:28,853
and nobody else can.

15
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:30,588
I know who Oliver Queen
cares about more than anyone.

16
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,253
Who?

17
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:32,691
His son...

18
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,992
William.

19
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,995
Merritt Davis will be
moderating the debate.

20
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,764
There will be a podium there,
another one there,

21
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,033
and according
to tradition,

22
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:46,036
the selection's made
by some coin toss thingy.

23
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,139
Mr. Queen.

24
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:50,574
At last, we meet.

25
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:53,077
Ms. Adams,
I'm just curious.

26
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,778
Is Adams your
maiden name?

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,614
Oh, I'm not married
actually.

28
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:57,292
Really?

29
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,750
Mm-hmm.

30
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,351
Well, I'm sure you just haven't met
the right person yet.

31
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:03,754
Well, it is lovely
to finally meet you,

32
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:06,023
an unconventional candidate
to say the least.

33
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,225
Bit of a dark horse
yourself.

34
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:10,060
Just meaning that
your candidacy seems

35
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,462
to have come
out of nowhere.

36
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:13,030
Well, generally,
I prefer to keep

37
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,032
my philanthropic
works quiet,

38
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:16,767
but the city is
in simply too much trouble

39
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:18,435
for me to remain
in the shadows.

40
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,703
Yes, it is.

41
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,005
The people
destroying our homes

42
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,574
need to be fought
in the light of day.

43
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:27,444
Well, I hope that we
have a productive debate, Mr. Queen.

44
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,246
I look forward
to it...

45
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,716
Ms. Adams.

46
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,585
More like
Mrs. Deceitful-Darhk.

47
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,720
I feel like Adams
probably polls better.

48
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,122
It's not like we
can prove that Adams

49
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,290
isn't her
real last name.

50
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:40,824
How is our opposition
research coming?

51
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:42,326
Uh, nothing yet.

52
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,628
She's apparently clean,
but the more we do

53
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,363
digging into her
and her background,

54
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,799
the more likely she's
gonna dig into ours.

55
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,334
I think that's
our cue.

56
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,602
Wait, wait.

57
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:52,937
I really need you
to take a look

58
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,238
at these engagement party
invites.

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,306
My mom's been hounding me.

60
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,007
The envelope is
very pink.

61
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,343
Wait! Don't...

62
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,911
Open it.

63
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,346
Should have
totally seen that one coming.

64
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:03,981
I'm so sorry.
What do you think?

65
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,182
Maybe less glitter.

66
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,383
You look good
in glitter.

67
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:07,785
Yeah. Let's move out.

68
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,989
The valet's bringing
up her car.

69
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,157
All right. Laurel's
got the eyeball.

70
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,491
You should move.

71
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,099
Are you gonna be
all right in here?

72
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,201
Oh, yeah.
Great Wi-Fi.

73
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,038
Overwatch on.

74
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,742
I've got her
approaching 7th.

75
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,444
Think she's headed
to her house again?

76
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,312
Like she did the last
6 times we trailed her, you mean?

77
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,947
She has to be coordinating
with Darhk somehow.

78
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,282
We keep this up,
we learn how,

79
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,717
we find out
where he is.

80
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,252
I've run
out of roof.

81
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm on it.

82
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,622
If she turns
left on Wilson,

83
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,823
she'll be headed home.

84
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,391
Then she's not.
Right turn.

85
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,692
Could be our lucky night.

86
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:50,127
Speedy, you're it.

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,333
Got her!

88
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,506
Green Arrow, you
ready for the handoff?

89
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:03,874
Already there.

90
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,379
I've got eyes on.

91
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,996
I lost her.

92
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,998
What do you mean?
That pursuit was textbook.

93
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,236
You had an appointment
with my husband

94
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:33,570
the other week.

95
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:36,173
He does not take
kindly to being stood up,

96
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,875
and he has a little
something to say

97
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,711
about you stalking
his wife, as well.

98
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,242
Are you all right?

99
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,812
She got away again.

100
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:19,816

102
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:28,826
Ok. So clearly,
we're not gonna find

103
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:30,527
Darhk by tailing
his wife.

104
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:31,729
Yeah. Well, it's not
like we have a lot

105
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:32,963
of moves left
to make.

106
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,665
Darhk has gone,
well, dark

107
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,433
ever since Machin
attacked his family.

108
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:38,402
But Darhk is not afraid
of Machin.

109
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:41,271
He's just--his plan's gone
to a new phase.

110
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:42,940
And how do you
know that?

111
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,174
Because HIVE spent
months trying to cripple

112
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:45,642
this city's
leadership.

113
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:47,111
They discouraged
people from running for mayor.

114
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:48,846
They even tried to
co-opt my candidacy.

115
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:51,248
Yeah. Then Mrs. Evil
threw her hat in the ring.

116
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,649
There has to be
a reason.

117
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,752
Darhk did not
try and destroy Star City

118
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,554
so that his wife
could be mayor.

119
00:04:57,556 --> 00:04:59,523
There's something
that we're not seeing.

120
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,925
Oh, I can see it
clear as day.

121
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,961
You on the podium
Thursday night vexing

122
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:07,331
Oliver Queen with your
political legerdemain.

123
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,802
Until we take him out of the game
completely, you mean.

124
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:14,338
Oh, you're not
reconsidering the plan?

125
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,507
Malcolm Merlyn
reached out,

126
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:19,042
gave me an early
birthday present.

127
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,811
It would be a shame
not to make use of it.

128
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:25,048
Ah! My buddies!

129
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,352
Let's get the rest
of the organization on the line.

130
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:35,726
Ladies
and gentlemen,

131
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,628
I am giddy to
report that

132
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,031
phase 4 is
proceeding on schedule.

133
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:44,601
There's still some concern about
the Star City operation.

134
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,003
Enlighten me.

135
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:49,173
Phase 5 requires control
over city hall,

136
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:52,509
yet somehow we've found
ourselves mired

137
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,912
in a petty political race
to see that happen.

138
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:56,180
We didn't exactly
plan on

139
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:57,948
Oliver Queen,
did we?

140
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,349
No one ever does.

141
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:01,418
I think what Mr. Armitage

142
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,687
is too polite to say

143
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:07,858
is that phase 5 now rests
on your wife's

144
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,028
questionable
political acumen.

145
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,233
Tomas, how is Madrid
this time of year?

146
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:19,036
I remember taking
a siesta in your office once.

147
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,638
I can practically picture
the room right now

148
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,576
as if I'm actually in it.

149
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:32,182
Ok, then. Anything
else to cover.

150
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,585
Well, there is the matter
of Quentin Lance.

151
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:37,254
He's clearly been aiding
the vigilantes.

152
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:38,789
I can confirm as much.

153
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,591
Oh, don't worry.

154
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:43,694
That loose end is
about to be well-tied.

155
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:46,363
Hi.

156
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,665
Hey. Time for my
8:00 feed already?

157
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,568
Funny. I thought you
could use a little pick-me-up.

158
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,103
I think you used
that excuse last week

159
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,372
to check up
on me.

160
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,474
DA's office never worked with my
department so much.

161
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:59,510
I'm just--I'm
worried about you.

162
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,811
No kidding.

163
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,246
No, Dad, seriously,

164
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:03,947
Darhk has to know
that you're the one

165
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,482
that gave up the
Ghost base of operations.

166
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,050
And I go to work
every day surrounded

167
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,418
by men and women
with guns.

168
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,686
It is all right,
sweetheart.

169
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:12,055
It's all right.
Hello. Lance.

170
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,291
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,193
All right. I'll be
there in 10.

172
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:18,295
Got a possible 602.

173
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:19,796
Isn't that a little
below your pay grade?

174
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:21,999
Uh, yeah. That's how
short-handed we are.

175
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,301
Good. I'll come
with you.

176
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,236
I'll wait in the car,
and then we can go for dinner.

177
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,539
I got--I got plans
with Donna.

178
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,040
That's even better.

179
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,075
I've been wanting to
spend some time

180
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,511
with the woman that won
over my father's heart.

181
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,583
Oh, wow.

182
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,851
Oh, I knew we
should have had Slade Wilson

183
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,319
do the party
planning.

184
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,620
Hey, guys.

185
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,589
I, um--you know,
I--I don't know

186
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,990
how I'm gonna get
everything done in time.

187
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:47,581
Maybe we should cancel.

188
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:48,426
What?

189
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,561
I think what Felicity
is trying to say

190
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:51,895
is that we--we
just don't--

191
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,730
we don't want you
working too hard.

192
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:55,032
I don't consider
this work.

193
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,400
I--I think of it
as a dry run

194
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:57,668
for your wedding.

195
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,370
So listen. We are
gonna have party favors

196
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:02,406
over in that corner.

197
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:05,375
We're gonna have
a champagne tower right here.

198
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:06,543
Hoo hoo!

199
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:07,844
And we're gonna
play games

200
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:09,313
over by the fireplace.

201
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,114
Oh, oh, oh.
I brought my favorite--

202
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,651
Pin the Junk
on the Hunk.

203
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:16,219
Sorry. Is this
bad timing?

204
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,754
For who?

205
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:18,889
Is everything ok?

206
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,390
Yeah. We got to,
uh...

207
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:21,692
Yeah.

208
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:22,893
Uh, ha ha!
Where you going?

209
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:25,262
Duty calls.
Sorry. Sorry.

210
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,164
Ahem. Is
everything ok?

211
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,465
So Alex got
a phone call

212
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,733
from one
of the lawyers

213
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,301
doing research
on the opposition,

214
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,270
and it looks like they might have
found something.

215
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,538
On Ruvé?

216
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,573
On you actually.

217
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,875
In 2013,
Homeland Security

218
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,511
did a tax audit
after the Undertaking,

219
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:45,582
and looks like mom wrote
a million-dollar check

220
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:49,019
to some woman named
Samantha Clayton.

221
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,854
I mean, Alex flagged it
as something

222
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:52,389
potentially weird
for us.

223
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:53,724
By weird he means?

224
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:55,859
Well, the check was
never cashed,

225
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,694
so why would mom
write a check

226
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,197
for a million dollars to a woman
young enough to be her daughter,

227
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,766
and why would that woman not
cash the check?

228
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:04,101
I don't know.

229
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:06,637
Should I look into this
Samantha person?

230
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,372
I don't really
see the point.

231
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:11,074
I mean, whatever was
going on with this Samantha person,

232
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,610
clearly she wanted
nothing to do with mom,

233
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,679
and either way,
I don't--just--

234
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:19,216
I don't see how something like this
would blow back on me.

235
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:20,550
Thank you.

236
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,120
Ok.

237
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,495
Everything has unfolded
according to Providence.

238
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:33,463
What do you think
is under there anyway?

239
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:36,700
Power, Mr. Queen.

240
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,703
I'm glad you have
recuperated.

241
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,972
We have much to
accomplish together.

242
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:53,850
Reiter's pet.

243
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,485
You don't know what
you're talking about.

244
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,287
I know you
killed Vlad.

245
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,723
I watched.
We all did.

246
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,291
What are you
going to do,

247
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,493
kill him right in front
of Reiter's men?

248
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,529
They don't care
what we do to him.

249
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,764
They remember
what he did to Conklin.

250
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,069
Maybe you men need to go
for a drink or something.

251
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:26,683
A 602's breaking
and entering.

252
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:30,020
Why would they need backup
in the form of a police captain?

253
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,856
I told you.
We're short-handed.

254
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,524
Don't worry.

255
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:36,326
It's not a job
for Black Canary.

256
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:48,872
SCPD. Anyone here?

257
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,993
Yeah, this is Lance.
Get me dispatch.

258
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:15,565
Dad!

259
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:16,967
Agh!

260
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,502
Come on!

261
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:20,370
Thought I told you
to stay in the car.

262
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,972
Yeah.
You're welcome.

263
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,445
Get out!
Go, go, go, go!

264
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:36,453
Go! Run! Go! Go!
Get out!

265
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,123
Get out! Go, go,
go, honey!

266
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,658
Come on!

267
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,432
Go, go, go!

268
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,234
Ohh!

269
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,369
Get up! Go!

270
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,977
Are you ok?

271
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,213
What the hell
was that?

272
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:05,849
I don't know. It's like the building
attacked me or something,

273
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:09,886
but that's not
possible, is it?

274
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:16,364
Captain, you move
again,

275
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,966
and it's gonna leave
an even bigger scar.

276
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,316
What happened?

277
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:21,272
Ugh. Your guess is
as good as mine.

278
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,405
It's like
the big bad wolf

279
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,606
huffed and puffed
or something.

280
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,208
This wolf
being Darhk.

281
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,409
Why do you think they
went through so much trouble

282
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,411
to make it look
like an accident?

283
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,413
They didn't want to take
the heat of killing a police captain.

284
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:32,548
Thanks for
the needlepoint.

285
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,950
Where
are you going?

286
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,885
Yeah. If Damien Darhk
has you in is gunsights,

287
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:37,120
it might not be
a good idea

288
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,588
to show yourself
in the open.

289
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,490
Uh, I'm meeting
with Donna.

290
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,858
Oh, she's fine.
She's probably just playing

291
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,924
Pin the Junk
on the Hunk or something.

292
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:44,493
What?

293
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:45,396
Do not ask. Do not ask.

294
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,730
Stay here for a minute
and let us do what we do.

295
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,432
Look. I'm gonna check
with Andy,

296
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,483
see if he's ever seen HIVE
use these tactics before.

297
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,916
Besides, I'm
on daddy duty

298
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,684
now that Lila's
the head of Argus.

299
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:55,852
I'm gonna try
and backtrace the call

300
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:57,387
that supposedly came
from dispatch.

301
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:58,821
I am--

302
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,557
Going to go work
on your debate prep?

303
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,926
Yeah.

304
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:07,563
Debate prep. Just took the words
right out of my mouth.

305
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,865
Yep.

306
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,202
This man deserves to die.
He tortured us!

307
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:15,738
And he saved me.

308
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,142
At great risk to himself,
he kept me alive.

309
00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:22,445
I have more reason
than anyone to hate this man,

310
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,113
but he's our best chance
of going home.

311
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,381
He killed your brother.

312
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:28,418
Yes, he did.

313
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,819
Tell them why.

314
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:34,891
The guard Conklin,
he put Vlad up to it.

315
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:36,626
I was defending
myself.

316
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,829
He attacked me.

317
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:46,302
Now I--I know that
you have no reason to trust me,

318
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:49,472
but I am not
your enemy.

319
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:53,276
All I want to do
is stop Reiter

320
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,579
and get all of you
out of this place.

321
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:58,281
So prove it.

322
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,316
How?

323
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:04,354
Kill Conklin.

324
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:14,664
Aside from
my brother,

325
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,034
have you
killed before?

326
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:19,836
Yeah.

327
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:23,906
There was a man
in Hong Kong,

328
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:27,143
and I did terrible
things to him,

329
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:29,178
and that made me
a monster.

330
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,913
And you're afraid
killing Conklin

331
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,716
will make you into
this monster again?

332
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,084
Yeah.

333
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:40,823
Good. It takes a monster to
fight monsters.

334
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:47,897
I like this midday summons.

335
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,834
It's very mysterious.

336
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,872
Very sexy.

337
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:57,974
Boobear, what
happened to you?

338
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:58,976
It's nothing. Listen to me--

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,010
No, no, baby,

340
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:01,010
it doesn't look
like nothing.

341
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,813
Oh, my gosh.
Come sit down.

342
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:08,551
Oh, oh, my big, tough
police captain, baby.

343
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,386
Can I make it
all better?

344
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,655
No, no. Listen to me.
We can't see each other for a while.

345
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:14,090
- What?
- Yeah.

346
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,391
It's--it's a thing
I got into.

347
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:17,860
I--I owe some guys
some money.

348
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:18,895
You gamble?

349
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,530
Mr. Straight
and Narrow?

350
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:22,165
Yeah. It helped me,
uh, cope

351
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,400
after I quit drinking,
and I've pissed off

352
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:26,969
some pretty tough
customers, and--

353
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:29,338
Wait a minute,
wait, honey.

354
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,376
Please, please,
I'm a Vegas girl, ok?

355
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:35,878
Whomever you owe
money to is gonna have to get up

356
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,416
pretty early in the morning
to take me on,

357
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,018
so don't worry.

358
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,387
Donna, it's a little
more complicated than that.

359
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,424
Just for a few weeks.
That--that's all.

360
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:49,392
That's it.

361
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:51,694
You know...

362
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:53,062
How about we
make it longer?

363
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:54,430
What?

364
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:55,865
My ex-husband was
a lying son of a bitch.

365
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,700
Only two good things
came out of that marriage--

366
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,035
my daughter
and my B.S. detector,

367
00:15:59,037 --> 00:16:00,269
which is flawless,

368
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,671
and right now,

369
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:03,306
yeah, it's--it's
red-lining.

370
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:03,883
Donna, please don't be--

371
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:05,542
Don't Donna--oh, my God.

372
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,244
Don't Donna me.
You know what?

373
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:11,380
This is actually
very simple.

374
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,182
You either respect
me enough to tell me the truth,

375
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:16,853
or you don't.

376
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:19,489
Clearly you don't.

377
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:20,957
Donna, please.

378
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:24,320
Hey, mom.

379
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:25,529
Oh, hey, hon.

380
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,630
I'm--I'm--I'm fine.

381
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,667
What did you do?

382
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,136
Why--why--why--why
you think it was me that did something?

383
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:34,504
Because you're a man.

384
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:37,306
I'm trying to put some
distance between us

385
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:38,975
in case Darhk
is after me

386
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:40,710
because I can't stand
the idea of anything

387
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:42,111
happening to her,
Felicity.

388
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:43,746
Yeah? Well, she looked
pretty upset.

389
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,148
Yeah.

390
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:49,452
Oliver's not here.

391
00:16:49,454 --> 00:16:51,154
I was looking for you.

392
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,555
I found something.

393
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:58,161
The 602 didn't come
from SCPD dispatch at all.

394
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:00,129
Someone just made it
look like it did.

395
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:02,598
That someone being HIVE
you're thinking.

396
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,066
There's an encryption on it
that uses the same cipher

397
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:06,202
of a HIVE Sat phone
that Merlyn gave us.

398
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:07,303
One more time.

399
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:08,504
They lured you
to the hotel.

400
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,772
Do we know where
the call came from?

401
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,407
Price and 14th.

402
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,209
A bunch of other calls
came from there, as well.

403
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,710
I'm guessing it's their
base of operations.

404
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:16,812
Ok. Contact the team
and have them meet me there.

405
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:25,888
Split up.

406
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:31,160
Job seems easy enough.

407
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:34,330
Don't get cocky. Darhk won't tolerate
another screw-up.

408
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,670
Where's Jack?

409
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,406
Patrolling. Why?

410
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,649
Rahh!

411
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,151
Ohh!

412
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:01,324
Blow it! Go, go, go!

413
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,323
They're demoing
the factory

414
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,391
just like they did
the hotel.

415
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:36,692
You guys go get
Spartan, ok?

416
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:37,590
I'm gonna get
the laptop.

417
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:38,225
Be--

418
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,249
Go!

419
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,865
Hey! Can you walk?

420
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:43,866
Yeah.

421
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:45,067
Hup!

422
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,435
Don't have much
of a choice.

423
00:18:46,437 --> 00:18:47,637
Where's Speedy?

424
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:49,005
She's right
behind us.

425
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,459
Please tell me that
the nails are the clue

426
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,161
and not what's
on the laptop's hard drive

427
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,834
because there are 3 nails
running straight through this thing.

428
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,055
Yeah. The bad guys
went a little crazy

429
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,320
with that nail gun.

430
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:29,755
Yeah. According to Andy,

431
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:30,890
they're called
the Demolition Team,

432
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:34,260
former GRU, IRA,
and Mossad.

433
00:19:34,262 --> 00:19:36,395
They're experts
at precision demolition.

434
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,097
Now they work
for HIVE.

435
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:40,199
I got a look at the laptop before
it got shot up,

436
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,134
and there were
blueprints on the screen.

437
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:44,436
So they are gonna
take down another building.

438
00:19:44,438 --> 00:19:45,538
Felicity?

439
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,139
I know.

440
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,641
The first time we met,
the first thing you asked me

441
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,143
to do was pull data
off a damaged laptop.

442
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:52,545
It's kind of romantic.

443
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:54,113
In case the laptop
is a dead end,

444
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:57,516
I am going to work up a list
of potential targets.

445
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,585
Yeah, and Andy's
supposed to get some more Intel.

446
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:00,753
I'll see if he's made
any progress.

447
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,390
Huh. Mom.

448
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,725
Wonder what
took her so long.

449
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:11,397
What was that about?

450
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,099
Donna called it quits.

451
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:16,101
Oh. I'm sorry
to hear that.

452
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:17,837
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

453
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,680
You're lucky you're
with someone you don't need

454
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:22,049
to keep secrets from.

455
00:20:24,186 --> 00:20:26,219
Are these
really necessary?

456
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:28,522
Can't risk you jeopardizing
your life again.

457
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:30,057
You're much
too important.

458
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,259
You know, you keep
saying that to me,

459
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:34,194
but I have no idea
what you mean.

460
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:35,896
Do you believe
in destiny, Mr. Queen?

461
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:37,864
I prefer the idea
of freewill.

462
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,600
This map conceals
deeper truths,

463
00:20:40,602 --> 00:20:43,870
secrets I couldn't uncover
without more information

464
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:46,440
until you brought
these to me.

465
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:49,376
Except I didn't
bring them to you.

466
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,244
Conklin took them.

467
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:52,879
Destiny, Mr. Queen.

468
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,348
With the survey map's
details,

469
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,418
I was able to decipher
the inscriptions on this,

470
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,455
which you also
provided me.

471
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:04,558
Are you beginning
to see it now, the pattern,

472
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,127
the trend of Providence?

473
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:09,596
Legend tells
of a hidden place

474
00:21:09,598 --> 00:21:13,500
within which lies
a device of untold power.

475
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:16,737
The quest to find it
requires one who has been granted

476
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:19,039
passage by the Gods.

477
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,874
I believe
that person is you.

478
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:23,210
Hey. You're needed
upstairs.

479
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:26,313
Keep Mr. Queen company
till I return.

480
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:28,482
We still have much
to discuss.

481
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,824
All this magic
mumbo jumbo.

482
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:40,260
Way it saved your neck
with Reiter,

483
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:44,464
maybe I ought to start
believing in it myself.

484
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:46,933
Ain't easy when it
looks like toilet paper.

485
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,241
Huh!

486
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,877
Boy, you got
some balls.

487
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,845
I'm gonna enjoy
watching you die.

488
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:02,682
I--ech--I didn't
want to bother you

489
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:05,452
when you walked in on us
at Oliver's campaign office,

490
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:06,620
but I--

491
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:07,788
It's o--it's ok.

492
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,990
No, honey, no, no,
it's not.

493
00:22:09,992 --> 00:22:11,057
It's actually
not ok.

494
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,460
It's ok.

495
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:15,762
After your father,
after all these years,

496
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:18,999
I thought I finally
found the one man--

497
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:23,336
Who wouldn't lie
to me, ok?

498
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:24,404
Well, maybe he's got
a good reason.

499
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:28,275
Yeah. Right.

500
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:32,045
Honey, I want you
to know that I'm really sorry

501
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,847
that I've been going
all momzilla

502
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,015
for this
engagement party.

503
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:37,317
Momzilla.

504
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,718
Do you want to
know why I push

505
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,156
the tiaras
and the 10-tiered cake?

506
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,658
Well, that's because
you've loved princesses

507
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,526
since before you
could walk.

508
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,695
Yes. That and, um...

509
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:55,802
I've been living
vicariously through you.

510
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:59,406
You and Oliver are
one of those couples

511
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:02,008
that everyone
believes in.

512
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,746
You don't lie
to each other ever,

513
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:09,115
and he's gonna be the best daddy
in the whole world

514
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,350
when that time comes.

515
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:11,451
Ahh. Heh heh.

516
00:23:11,453 --> 00:23:14,020
You know that,
don't you?

517
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:15,856
In my bones.

518
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:20,260
And when I see something
that beautiful

519
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:23,396
and that rare
and that romantic,

520
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:27,734
it also reminds me
that, you know,

521
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,103
I'm never gonna find
a love like that.

522
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:31,872
Yes, you will.

523
00:23:31,874 --> 00:23:34,274
You have it now
with Captain Lance.

524
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:37,077
No, honey, no, not if
he's hiding something from me.

525
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,980
Maybe he's doing it
to protect you

526
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:42,215
because he loves you,

527
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,751
and you need to
return that love

528
00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:48,455
with a little bit
of trust.

529
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:49,789
I love you.

530
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,691
I love you, too.

531
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:54,227
Crime,
healthcare, taxes,

532
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:56,062
business incentives.

533
00:23:56,064 --> 00:23:58,698
You've actually
pretty much nailed them all.

534
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,102
Stop sounding so
surprised, please.

535
00:24:02,104 --> 00:24:03,470
I mean, you did spend
your education nailing chicks,

536
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:05,772
not doing
social studies.

537
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:09,242
Ahh. Ok. I'm sort
of wiped.

538
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:11,311
Can we wrap this
up maybe?

539
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:15,749
Um, yeah, I did just have
one more question for you?

540
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:17,317
Ok.

541
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,685
Why didn't you tell me
you went to college

542
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:20,053
with Samantha Clayton?

543
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:27,227
I was with
Samantha Clayton

544
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:29,629
while I was
dating Laurel,

545
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,165
and I'm not proud
of that, so--

546
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,435
So why did mom pay
her a million dollars?

547
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:38,171
Thea, I told you.
Mom is--

548
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,907
Ollie, I, um--
I looked her up.

549
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,409
Right after you guys
broke up,

550
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:45,312
she moved
to Central City.

551
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:51,051
She's got a son
named William

552
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:52,686
who's about as old
as that check is.

553
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:54,287
Ok, Thea.

554
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:56,256
When we were
in Central City,

555
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,626
I--I knew something
was bothering you.

556
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,495
I knew it just wasn't
Vandal Savage.

557
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:04,864
I mean, now it
makes sense.

558
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:07,701
William's your son,
isn't he?

559
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:09,202
Yes, he is.

560
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:10,904
Why haven't you
told anyone?

561
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:15,775
Because Samantha said
that the only way that I could see him

562
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:17,744
is if I promised to
not tell him

563
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:20,347
or anyone else
that I'm his father.

564
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:23,950
God, that's--
that is brutal.

565
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:25,196
Are you ok?

566
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,787
I thought I was doing ok.

567
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:28,688
I spent a lot of time
convincing myself

568
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,491
that I was--that
I was trying to do the right thing,

569
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:35,161
but then, you know,
you brought this--

570
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:36,963
the--the thing
with the check in.

571
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,832
I'm not--it's not
your fault,

572
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,067
but it's--you bring it
up right when we're

573
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,335
trying to plan
an engagement party,

574
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:43,737
and so I'm left
to think,

575
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:46,573
"how can I marry
Felicity if there's

576
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,141
this lie between us?"

577
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:50,644
It's not a lie, ok?

578
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,412
It's a--it's a promise
that you are keeping

579
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,581
to the mother
of your child.

580
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,249
That doesn't
make it right, Thea.

581
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,218
Look at it
from Samantha's perspective.

582
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,322
As far as she knows,
you are a rich playboy

583
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:03,556
who slept
with a bunch of women

584
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:06,026
and got her pregnant.

585
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm not that person
anymore.

586
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:08,762
Now you're
the Green Arrow.

587
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:10,697
Anyone who comes
into your life is

588
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,732
automatically a target.

589
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:16,536
What Samantha is asking
for you to do,

590
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:18,104
as hard as it may be,

591
00:26:18,106 --> 00:26:20,674
it is the right thing
to do.

592
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,842
I know you want to
tell Felicity,

593
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:28,615
and trust me,
I would love to be an aunt,

594
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,450
but you have got to do
the right thing

595
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:34,287
for your son here.

596
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,724
As hard as this
may be for you, Ollie,

597
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:42,896
keeping William a secret
is keeping him safe.

598
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:52,772
Yes, John.

599
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54,074
Andy did a little digging
on the Dark Web,

600
00:26:54,076 --> 00:26:55,575
found out
the demolition team

601
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:57,277
uses a specialized
acid that can

602
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,012
weaken
building structures.

603
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,914
Only one warehouse
in the city stocks it.

604
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,549
Text me the address.
I'll be right there.

605
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:04,317
I'm coming with you.

606
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,187
No. Just it's--
it's a long shot at the best.

607
00:27:07,189 --> 00:27:09,656
Ok.

608
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:10,656
Thea.

609
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,393
Hmm.

610
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:13,637
Thank you.

611
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:14,428
For what?

612
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:16,730
Just saying what
I needed to hear.

613
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:23,937
I'll clear the area.

614
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:32,145
We're too late.
They cleaned this place out.

615
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:33,646
Yeah, took 100 gallons
of that acid with them.

616
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:35,682
Whatever they're
planning on  taking down...

617
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:37,150
It's massive.

618
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,028
Hey! Uh, hope I'm
not bothering you.

619
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,598
I, um--uh, Curtis,
why is my face your screensaver?

620
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,567
At the risk
of early termination,

621
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:58,040
um, none
of your business.

622
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:58,554
Curtis!

623
00:27:58,578 --> 00:27:59,361
Please don't ask.

624
00:27:59,362 --> 00:28:01,329
I'm, like, superbad
with secrets.

625
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,498
Ok. It's an early
wedding gift,

626
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,632
but it's really bad luck
if you see it,

627
00:28:04,634 --> 00:28:06,434
so please stop
trying to see it.

628
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,668
Ok. I think you're getting
your wedding traditions confused,

629
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,437
but fine,
I will let it go.

630
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,106
Lucky for you, I have
more important concerns.

631
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,575
I maxed out the computer power
in the lair again,

632
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:17,211
and I was hoping maybe
your mainframe might have better luck.

633
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:18,346
I'll do my best.

634
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,047
Thank you.

635
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:21,983
Really? Me
on a screensaver. Hmm.

636
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:23,918
Whatever this surprise,
it better be good.

637
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,553
Oh, it will be.

638
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:30,758
Well, that's not your
typical nighttime suit.

639
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,727
Well, you're the reason
I'm wearing it.

640
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:36,464
Inspiring me to save
the city in the light of day.

641
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:37,465
Fine inspiration
I turned out to be,

642
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,933
hiding down here
in the dark.

643
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:41,369
For your protection.

644
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:44,505
You haven't told
Donna, have you?

645
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:45,873
No.

646
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,710
How you kept this up
for 4 years, huh,

647
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:52,413
this double life, these secrets,
lying? I mean--

648
00:28:52,415 --> 00:28:54,682
I'm trying not to live
that way anymore.

649
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,219
Trying.

650
00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:59,887
You know, in AA,
we say you're only

651
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:02,757
as sick as
the secrets you keep.

652
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,992
You're looking pretty
healthy these days.

653
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,929
Let's just hope I can
get back to that place with Donna.

654
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:09,197
For what it's worth,
you're in a tough spot,

655
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,033
and you're trying
to keep her safe.

656
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:13,568
You know, sometimes
a lie isn't wrong

657
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,370
if it's for the good
of someone that you love.

658
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:21,108
Just so you know,
after I'm done with you,

659
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,945
I'm gonna gut that slave girl
just for kicks.

660
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:25,446
All the rest
of them, too.

661
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:28,115
You're never hurting
them ever again.

662
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:31,252
There he is.
There's the killer.

663
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:51,806
You stupid
son of a bitch.

664
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:54,175
Reiter's gonna
kill everyone

665
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:56,444
no matter what you do.

666
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,450
So Ruvé's probably
gonna question you

667
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:03,951
on your party boy past,
but if she does, we just got to--

668
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:05,953
oh, if she does,
just steer the conversation

669
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:07,221
back towards the issues.

670
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,656
I've got it.

671
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:10,024
Alex's mom kind of
picked the wrong week

672
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,525
to go in for surgery,
don't you think?

673
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,527
I couldn't agree more.

674
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:16,330
We got about 20 minutes
until we're live,

675
00:30:16,332 --> 00:30:18,332
so how are you feeling?

676
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,201
Are--are you
nervous at all or--

677
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:22,270
You know,
I don't think that nervous

678
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:23,971
is in Oliver's vocabulary.

679
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:25,940
Yes, but translucent
matte powder should be.

680
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:28,976
You don't want to shine
under those big, bright lights.

681
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:30,544
Ha ha ha!

682
00:30:30,546 --> 00:30:32,480
Hey. Why do--no.
Why do we even need makeup?

683
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,481
We're not even gonna
be onstage.

684
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,615
Reaction shots,
sweetie.

685
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,117
Plus I just--
I love makeup.

686
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,585
Ok, mom, mom,
mom, mom, mom.

687
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:38,127
What?

688
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:39,288
I got to take this.

689
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:40,688
Oh, ok. You know what?
I'm gonna be right back.

690
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,156
I hate this.
It's a horrible powder puff.

691
00:30:42,158 --> 00:30:43,291
It's just--it's awful.

692
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,680
That was fast.

693
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:46,028
You sound surprised.

694
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:48,195
I don't know whether
to be flattered or insulted.

695
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,463
Ok, Curtis.
What did you get?

696
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:50,831
Not much. Just
a set of blueprints.

697
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,066
Pretty underwhelming
considering.

698
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:53,634
I'm uploading it
to you now.

699
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:58,072
Curtis, I got to
call you back.

700
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:00,174
Oliver, I need you.

701
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,809
What's wrong?

702
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:04,578
I know what building
HIVE is planning on taking down.

703
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,813
It's this one.

704
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:10,834
Ok. I have a million questions,
but first,

705
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:12,533
why would HIVE try to
attack the debate?

706
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,302
To take me out, discourage anyone
else from running.

707
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,750
Ok, but Darhk's wife
is here at ground zero,

708
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,417
so it doesn't
really make sense--

709
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,819
unless Darhk's Demolition Team
is gonna wipe

710
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:21,620
everyone out
except Ruvé.

711
00:31:21,622 --> 00:31:23,155
Leaving Mrs. Darhk
a sympathetic survivor

712
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:25,725
instead of the pot
of evil stew that she is.

713
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:28,260
Can you identify the likely areas
the bombs would be?

714
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,962
Yeah. According to the schematics,
it's these 3 points,

715
00:31:29,964 --> 00:31:31,664
but this building,
it's huge.

716
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,199
Which means split up and cover
more ground.

717
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,400
Ok. Good thing we brought
a change of clothes.

718
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:35,568
Call Laurel
and Diggle.

719
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,769
Can you hack
the fire alarm?

720
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,437
We need to evacuate
the building.

721
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,672
It's an old system.
It might take me a minute.

722
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:44,009
Yeah. I--I learned that
in high school.

723
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,377
So we can...

724
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:54,346
Listen to me
very carefully.

725
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:56,148
Change of plans.

726
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,552
Do not let Oliver Queen
leave this building alive.

727
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,887
Copy that.

728
00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:13,065
Oh. I finally
found it.

729
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,300
Where's Oliver and Thea?

730
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:15,434
Oh, they're probably
just inside,

731
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:16,702
making sure everyone
gets out ok.

732
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:18,037
You left them inside?

733
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,505
Honey, come on.
We need to go help them.

734
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:21,240
Let's go. Excuse us.

735
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,008
Captain Lance, you're
supposed to be not here.

736
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,476
What kind of cop
sits on the sidelines

737
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:27,046
when people's lives
are at risk, huh?

738
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:28,714
You stay here.

739
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,499
I count
3 charges but no demo team.

740
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:48,867
What do you see?

741
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,070
Same here.
No hostiles.

742
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:53,939
Lots of ticky-tocky
bombs.

743
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,381
More charges down here.

744
00:33:02,383 --> 00:33:05,451
See the countdown?
13:25 until detonation.

745
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,785
That's two minutes
after the debate starts.

746
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:08,587
We need to disarm
these things.

747
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:09,722
Disarming one now.

748
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:11,957
Hope this
neutralizing agent works.

749
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:16,762
You ok?

750
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:18,097
Yeah. This place
is booby-trapped.

751
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,531
Be careful up there.

752
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:20,766
Or don't.
It's not polite

753
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,501
to touch things
that ain't yours.

754
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,972
You're not the only
one with tricks.

755
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:31,477
Watch out!

756
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,190
Speedy!

757
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:04,103
We're clear.

758
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,873
It's clear
down here, too.

759
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,081
Top is clear.

760
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:18,851
Thanks. Sure you should be
out in the open?

761
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:20,693
Don't you have somewhere
to be right about now?

762
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,996
I checked the cafeteria,
the green room, everywhere.

763
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:33,532
Everywhere except
for the bathroom apparently.

764
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:36,969
Sorry. A--ahem--
nervous bladder, I think.

765
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:39,438
Oh, that was something I
never needed to hear ever.

766
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,240
Um, are you ready to go?

767
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,608
More than ever.

768
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:51,617
Captain Lance never lets
his man get away.

769
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,719
You shouldn't either.

770
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,464
That's nice
applause.

771
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:08,267
It's enough to bring
the house down.

772
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,602
Almost.

773
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:11,837
Good luck!

774
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,764
Despite a bomb threat,

775
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,031
tonight's mayoral debate

776
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:26,464
then went on as scheduled

777
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:29,244
with Mr. Queen being
declared by most pundits

778
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:30,264
the clear winner.

779
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:32,212
Ha! Of course
he's the clear winner.

780
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:34,213
He's marrying
my daughter.

781
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:35,982
I think you're
a little biased.

782
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:37,850
Did Alex call
with the new poll numbers?

783
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:39,519
Well, Bethany Snow's right.
He doesn't have to.

784
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,688
Experts are saying
that you already won.

785
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,056
Experts aren't
the voters.

786
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:46,993
Ok. Well, you at least
have one voter in your camp.

787
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:48,394
Meeee!

788
00:36:48,396 --> 00:36:49,395
Only one that matters.

789
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:51,631
Hee hee hee.

790
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:54,067
Conklin may have had
his difficulties,

791
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:55,301
but he was a good man.

792
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,037
Yeah. He was
a good man

793
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,206
who attacked me.

794
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,574
Self-defense.

795
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,243
As it was
with her brother?

796
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:07,046
I'm not saying
it lacks irony.

797
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:10,216
I need you a live,
Mr. Queen,

798
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:13,720
but there are different
forms of alive.

799
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,288
Don't test me again.

800
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,694
Agh.

801
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,732
You did it.

802
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:30,570
What was that for?

803
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:32,639
Thank you.

804
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,707
I don't need thanks,
Taiana.

805
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,043
Before he died,
Conklin told me that Reiter

806
00:37:37,045 --> 00:37:39,912
was gonna kill
everybody here.

807
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,417
We don't have much time.

808
00:37:49,324 --> 00:37:52,725
John, could
I introduce you to Laura Hoffman?

809
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:54,394
- Laura.
- Ooh. Don't mind if I do.

810
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,629
John, hi.

811
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:58,097
Laura was our neighbor
in Ivy Town.

812
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,899
She drove all day
to get here.

813
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:02,135
Please. The drive
was nothing.

814
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:04,137
I've been waiting
5 months for this moment

815
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:05,638
to finally arrive.

816
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,975
Oh, hey. Have you started
your wedding register yet?

817
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:10,443
Because I may very well
have the perfect

818
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:11,644
gift idea for you.

819
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,613
Oh, let me guess.
Slow cooker.

820
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:15,715
How did you--how
did you know that?

821
00:38:15,717 --> 00:38:17,216
I'm telepathic.

822
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:18,518
Excuse me. Sorry
to interrupt,

823
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,652
but I need you both.

824
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:21,587
Photographer
is here.

825
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:25,825
Did you invite him?

826
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:28,261
Who, me? Uh...Ppfff.

827
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:30,763
Sorry. Could I--
could I talk to you for--for a minute?

828
00:38:30,765 --> 00:38:32,098
- Yes. Absolutely.
- It's not really a good--

829
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,533
- Felicity.
- What?

830
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:34,901
The photographer's
right over there.

831
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:37,403
We will make it there
just fine by ourselves.

832
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:38,080
Captain Lance.

833
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:39,773
Nice to see you.

834
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:42,875
Ahem. Please.
Please, please.

835
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:44,610
It's quite the party
you got going on here.

836
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:49,449
What? What? What do you want to
talk about, Quentin?

837
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:52,852
I came here to apologize
because you were right.

838
00:38:52,854 --> 00:38:56,622
I...lied to you

839
00:38:56,624 --> 00:39:01,761
because I was afraid
how you would react to the truth.

840
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:03,529
The thing that I was
worried about...

841
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:07,500
It wasn't
a gambling problem.

842
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:10,403
It was--it was--
it was HIVE,

843
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:11,971
the same people that--

844
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:13,372
The same people that
hurt my baby.

845
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:14,607
Mm-hmm.

846
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,542
Why wouldn't you
tell me that?

847
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,311
Because I'm not in their gunsights
because I'm police.

848
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:19,846
I'm in their gunsights
because I stopped working for them.

849
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:23,082
You were working
with Damien Darhk?

850
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,451
He threatened Laurel,

851
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:29,756
and the truth is I'm glad Darhk
came after me and not her

852
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:30,890
because if he'd done it,
I'd--

853
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:33,659
you were
protecting her

854
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:37,597
just like you were
protecting me.

855
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,965
Oh, baby.

856
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,534
I'm so sorry.

857
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,970
Ahh. Aah!

858
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:46,005
Is it possible to go blind from
too many flashes?

859
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:48,107
Take a little bit
of a break just for a moment.

860
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:49,308
I literally can't see
a thing right now.

861
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,011
I think the cure
for that is champagne.

862
00:39:52,013 --> 00:39:56,315
Ahh. Dr. Queen, I do
believe you are right.

863
00:39:56,317 --> 00:40:00,686
Curtis, Paul, so glad
you guys could make it.

864
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:02,622
Quick! Grab a glass
filled with champagne.

865
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:04,824
Careful.
He might drink the entire bottle.

866
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:07,393
I like my bubbly.
What can I say?

867
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:09,295
Ah-ah-ah.
Mixing a downer

868
00:40:09,297 --> 00:40:10,363
with all the coffee
you've had

869
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:11,564
in the last
72 hours,

870
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:13,166
your head
might explode.

871
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,401
Yeah. I have been
pulling a lot of crazy hours.

872
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:17,003
After my surprise
was blown on my gift,

873
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:20,072
I wanted to finish it
as soon as possible.

874
00:40:26,614 --> 00:40:28,014
Thanks!

875
00:40:28,016 --> 00:40:31,517
We forgot to register
for, uh, microchips.

876
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,821
Actually, it's neither
a micro nor a chip.

877
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,956
It's an implantable
biostimulant.

878
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,392
And why would I need
an implantable...

879
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:41,994
Biostimulant?

880
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:45,731
For walking.

881
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:48,034
Excuse me?
Curtis...

882
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,203
In a perfect world,
it will work in time

883
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:52,038
for you to walk
down the aisle,

884
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,540
I mean, but it's
pretty cutting edge,

885
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,475
so I can't
promise anything.

886
00:40:56,477 --> 00:40:57,810
You're telling me that this little piece
of technology's

887
00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:59,312
gonna help me
walk again?

888
00:40:59,314 --> 00:41:01,447
After it's implanted
in your spine, yes.

889
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:03,382
He's been trying
to crack it for a while,

890
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:04,951
but he needed
a power source,

891
00:41:04,953 --> 00:41:06,853
something that would
last a lifetime.

892
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,087
Palmer Technologies'
power cell.

893
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:10,122
Exactly.
Once I solved that,

894
00:41:10,124 --> 00:41:12,358
I knew this
might actually work.

895
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,826
Oh, my God.

896
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:18,164
I don't know what to say.

897
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,966
I do.

898
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:22,635
Curtis, you're terrific.

899
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:24,270
Thank you.

900
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:26,038
Well, don't thank
me yet.

901
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,273
Still has to work.

902
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,108
It will work.
I know it will.

903
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,476
You come with me.

904
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:32,845
We're about to make
my mother very happy.

905
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,442
Hi, daddy.

906
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:41,088
Hi, sweetie.

907
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:43,489
Nora, honey, there's
someone I'd like you to meet.

908
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:46,292
Nora, this is William.

909
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,261
William's mother asked us
to look after him.

910
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:50,263
He'll be staying
with us for a while.

911
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:51,430
Nice to meet you,
William.

912
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:52,186
Want to play?

913
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,389
Sure.

914
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:04,375
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

915
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:23,629
Greg!
Move your head.
