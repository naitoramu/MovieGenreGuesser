Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

from the authorities

of run-ins with the police,

Roy Harper with the same crime.

Nice try. Five hours ago,
Queen turned himself in.

He confessed!

Your so-called

fabricated right about now.

I had nothing to do
with Roy turning himself in...

131
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,766
But I will
get him out.

132
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:41,961
And then what?

But of course, no one
close to you has died.

Have you considered that
leading the League of Assassins

might be a preferable outcome
as to what alternatives

Run a facial recognition.

321
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:20,675
Way ahead of you.
Jake Simmons.

322
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:22,244
He's already in the system.

323
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,479
Serial bank robber,
which explains Starling National.

324
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,047
Last known address,

325
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:26,927
Central City.

326
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,251
Where is he now?

327
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:31,019
He was last seen
on a traffic camera

328
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,121
at the corner
of Gantner and Yount.

329
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:34,923
There's a processing
plant there;

330
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,247
he went in, never came out.

331
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,227
On it.

332
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,693
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second.

333
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,061
I thought the whole point
of this team-up

334
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:42,631
was you not being spotted
out as a vigilante.

335
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,266
Stop calling it
a team-up, Ray.

336
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:46,101
This Jake Simmons
is not just a meta-human,

337
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:48,970
he is a killer.
And you're not ready for that.

338
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:51,239
Look, I'm--I'm not going to try to
equate our experiences,

339
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,775
but superpowers
are based in science,

340
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,077
and I am a man
of science.

341
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,113
So if there's any way
to defeat this guy,

342
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,415
I'm the one who's best able
to figure it out.

343
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,751
Fine.

344
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,452
The second that you get in
over your head...

345
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,288
I'll run.

346
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,623
Fly, probably.

347
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,596
[Mechanism whirring]

348
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,838
Ray: How many abandoned
warehouses do you think are in this city?

349
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,540
No, no, I'm--I'm
genuinely curious.

350
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,841
Oliver: Stay
focused, Ray.

351
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:28,510
Maybe Simmons
isn't in there.

352
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,612
Do you get this anxious
when I'm out in the field?

353
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,814
I honestly can't think of an answer
to that question

354
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,449
that doesn't
get me in trouble.

355
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,186
Still nothing.

356
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:41,122
Not a visual sighting or any
other reading at all from the Atom.

357
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,724
And when I say atom,
I mean the suit,

358
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,292
not myself
in the third person.

359
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,560
There's a decent chance

360
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:48,430
that you and Palmer
are related.

361
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:55,538
Well, that's
equally fascinating

362
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,639
and terrifying.

363
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:01,109
Be my eyes, Ray,
what's going on?

364
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:05,247
Oh, tin man?
You shouldn't be here.

365
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:07,582
Actually, I should.
See, you're the bad guy,

366
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,517
and I am--

367
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,254
Ray?!

368
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:14,389
[Groans]

369
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,228
Thanks for the top off.

370
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,134
Ray!

371
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:32,707
[Ray groaning]

372
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,586
Felicity: Ray,
where are you?

373
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:47,451
Ray, Ray!

374
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,976
[Groans]

375
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:57,245
Oh, my God, Ray,
are you hurt?

376
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,913
Heh, "hurt" would be
a step or two up

377
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,715
from how I feel right now.

378
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:03,017
But...just a second.

379
00:18:04,987 --> 00:18:07,388
You're lucky to have gotten
out of there alive.

380
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,190
It wasn't that
bad, was it?

381
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,524
It was way worse, Ray.

382
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:11,378
Right.

383
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,661
I need shields!

384
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:15,396
That's not the answer.
You need to anticipate

385
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,764
your opponent.

386
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:17,899
You need to trust
your instincts

387
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,667
and not just
your tech.

388
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,402
My instinct
is to trust my tech.

389
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,437
Ray, when I'm out in the field,
my bow, my arrows,

390
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,373
those are just tools.

391
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,624
I'm the weapon.

392
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,010
That's poetic.

393
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,444
My point is that
if you rely on that suit

394
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:33,481
more than you rely
on yourself...

395
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,683
It's going
to get you killed.

396
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,260
So when is Shrieve going
to distribute the virus?

397
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:48,863
I don't know. If he's going to pin it
on the Triad, though,

398
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,364
he'll have
to do it soon.

399
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:52,199
We need to get out
of Hong Kong.

400
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,269
My contact says Shrieve
has men everywhere,

401
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,972
with even more resources
at his disposal than Waller ever had.

402
00:18:57,974 --> 00:19:01,976
Shrieve has assured
we won't get off this island alive.

403
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:04,312
[Chuckles]

404
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,950
Well, if we can't run,
Waller said Shrieve

405
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:10,584
had a vaccine
for the virus.

406
00:19:10,586 --> 00:19:12,620
You want to steal
some of the vaccine?

407
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,889
He has to have it
somewhere in Hong Kong.

408
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,351
Get down!

409
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:46,020
[All yelling]

410
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:48,823
Let's see how good you are
without your arrows.

411
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,658
Good enough.

412
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,626
[Alarm sounding]

[All grunting]

00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,585
Just remember--
that was without arrows.

[Doors opening]

416
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:20,788

[Gasping]

All right, turn this
place inside out.

420
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:35,236
We know how this guy loves
his secret hiding places.

421
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,837
Hey, Frank.

422
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,873
What brings you out
of your downtown office?

423
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,708
The Chief of D's asked me
to have a word with you.

424
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,778
Yeah?
What about?

425
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,613
He wants to know
why you're still going Ahab

426
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:48,716
on Oliver Queen when we got
a different suspect already in custody.

427
00:20:48,718 --> 00:20:51,052
We got a patsy in custody. Trust me,
Queen is our guy.

428
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,521
Well, there's no evidence
against Queen.

429
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:55,222
Why do you think
I'm searching his condo?

430
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:56,624
Friend to friend--

431
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:59,193
you've come so far.
You're a captain.

432
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:03,497
Don't throw all your hard work
away on something personal.

433
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:11,105
[Thea sighs]

434
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:13,641
Look, I don't know what
it is you think that you're going to find,

435
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:16,310
but it's not here.
There's nothing here!

436
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:18,746
Kind of like how there was
nothing in the basement of your club?

437
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:21,282
You're either complicit or just about
the most naive girl I ever met.

438
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,784
You know that your brother
is letting your boyfriend

439
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:26,053
rot in prison
for his crimes, right?

440
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:28,789
Get out of my home.

I know you went
to visit Harper yesterday.

Does he even know why
he's throwing his life away?

[Cell phone vibrates]

All right,
I'll be right there.

447
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:51,412
Your boyfriend
was just attacked.

448
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:55,015
He's all right, but I can't imagine
it'll be the last time.

449
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:57,485
Your brother dropped
a lot of bodies.

450
00:21:57,487 --> 00:22:00,955
And when, and it's not if, it is
when Roy gets a shiv in the back,

451
00:22:00,957 --> 00:22:03,023
that body will be on him, too.

452
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:10,131
The suit recorded
over ten terabytes of data,

453
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,233
which were uploaded
in real time

454
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:13,734
to a geosynchronous
satellite.

455
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:15,069
That is a huge
energy suck.

456
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,403
This is all fascinating.

- How do we find Simmons?
- Light bulb, literally.

458
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,807
I--no, actually,
figuratively.

459
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,611
[Chuckles] Uh, just
before Simmons beat me,

460
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:26,080
I blasted him with my
compressed light beams,

461
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:28,182
and he thanked me
for topping him off.

462
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:30,417
He absorbs energy and turns it into
weaponized plasma.

463
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,253
And if we can manually get into
the city's power grid,

464
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:35,089
we might be able to track where he's
getting his extra juice.

What's going on?

It's Roy!

468
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,866
He was attacked
by a bunch of inmates.

469
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:49,970
He's fine, but there's
hundreds of them in there!

470
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:54,808
I'm going
to break him out.

471
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,078
Oliver. You can end up
in a cell right next to him.

472

John, if you know
what's good for you,

473
00:22:59,448 --> 00:23:00,981
you'll get out
of my way.

474
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,483
Oliver, if you know
what's good for you--

475
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,952
and for Roy--you're going
to need to stay put.

476
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:05,508
I can't do that.

477

Oliver, listen--

478
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,055
Get your hands
off of me!

479
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,523
Listen, I know what
you're going through, man!

480
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,325
You have to rely on Palmer
to take care of this meta

481
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,160
while Roy sits in a prison.

482
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:15,563
But listen to me, man--
you have to throttle this back,

483
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:18,399
Oliver. You have to.

484
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,834
Before you lose everything.

485
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:26,507
I've already lost
everything.

486
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:30,611
I'm not going
to lose Roy.

Oliver!

488
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,768
I can't believe
that you and Diggle are ok

489
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,635
just sitting
on your hands while Roy

490
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:55,302
fights off all of Iron Heights!

491
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,206
It is not that simple!

492
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,474
No, Felicity,
if anything was ever simple,

493
00:23:58,476 --> 00:23:59,808
it's this.

494
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,111
Then what? You're
going to jail, too?

495
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,713
I can't just do nothing.

496
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,215
I think John's right.

497
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:07,950
I think you're struggling
with doing nothing;

498
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:10,352
with Roy, with Ray,
but right now,

499
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:15,324
you need people to help you.
You need to let them.

500
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:17,359
Maybe...there is
something more

501
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:20,028
going on with you than just what's
happening with Roy

502
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,097
and this meta-human.

503
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:25,934
You have sacrificed
everything to be the Arrow.

504
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:29,505
Even you and me.

505
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:31,306
But...

506
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:35,010
Whether or not you break Roy
out of Iron Heights,

507
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,881
there is no more Arrow.

508
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:42,184
Ra's took that
from you.

509
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:45,888
I was told once that a man

510
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,758
cannot live by two names.

511
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Well, right now,

512
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:55,898
I can't live by either.

513
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,901
So I don't know who I am.

514

I know who you are.

Whether you're
in a--in a suit

516
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:05,007
or under a hood,
you're the man that I...

517
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,281
You're the man
that I believe in.

Uh, Ray finished
the transponder.

519
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,921
I have to upload it
to a power source

520

and, uh, hopefully it'll bring us
right to Simmons.

I'll go with you.

It is adorable

523
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,561
how you keep forgetting
that Lance is after you,

524
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:27,396
but, uh, it's a quick errand

525
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,533
and you need practice
in letting people help you.
