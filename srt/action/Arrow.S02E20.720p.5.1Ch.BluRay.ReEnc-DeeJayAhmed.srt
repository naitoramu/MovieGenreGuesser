1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,446
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,611
But there are some things
that must never be spoken of.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,282
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,084
Sara, you're not a killer.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,731
I am what I need to be.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,046
Roy, you're dangerous.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,207
Some people are broken.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,767
I'm not letting what happened to Slade
happen to Roy.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,240
Is that what I think it is?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,001
Mirakuru. We're gonna
use it to make a cure.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,250
No change?

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,047
Nope. So much blood mixed in
with so much Mirakuru.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,607
I don't know if it's good or bad.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,521
- We could really use that cure.
- I talked to Caitlin this morning.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,881
We're working on it.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,606
- No mention on Isabel Rochev's death?
- Not a thing.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,043
I wasn't expecting a glowing obituary,
but she's a Fortune 500 CEO...

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,609
that's been missing for a week now.
You'd think she'd have some column inches.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,880
Does the fact that him lying there, freak
me out a little, make me a bad person?

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,408
Felicity, I don't think there's a force on
Earth that could make you a bad person.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,046
But I am starving. Dinner?

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,810
Yeah.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,489
Uh, no Big Belly Burger though.
It's giving me a big belly.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,883
- Sushi then.
- Sushi then.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,286
How can you be unconscious
and freak me out at the same...

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,524
time?

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,764
Roy?

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,683
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,688
You scared me.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,609
- Roy?
- I forgot my phone.

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,611
Roy, listen.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,046
- Dig.
- You okay?

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,730
Roy.

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,604
Roy.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,006
What's going on?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,243
Move, move, move.

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,400
You think Roy's okay?

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,441
Please tell me that you're not thinking
about Roy right now.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,887
We were finally alone...

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,491
in bed...

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,728
in a very nice hotel room.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,730
A hotel room that you couldn't afford.

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,329
I have something of a history
with the manager.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,524
Mm. I can only imagine.

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,208
I think I trashed this specific room once.

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,721
But favors run out.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,449
We should think about getting
a more permanent place.

48
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,609
We?

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,966
Well, you're probably getting tired
of staying with Laurel...

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,960
and we can't sleep in the foundry
now that Roy's there, so...

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,686
But I mean, "we"?

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,167
Are you asking me to move in with you?

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,287
- Hey, your phone's ringing.
- I know.

54
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,561
Okay, both our phones are ringing.
That's never good.

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,071
What happened?

56
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:02,109
I don't know. One
minute, he's comatose...

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,567
the next, he's flipping over
computer equipment.

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,928
He's a lot more out of control
than Slade was at your house.

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,930
He looked like Roy but he wasn't Roy.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,488
- Where do you think he's headed?
- I don't know, but we have to find him.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,401
Despite everyones predictions,

62
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:20,507
you've managed to pull ahead of
Sebastian Blood in recent polls.

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,082
Yes. I think our message
is resonating with the voters.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,608
The people of Starling know
that I have a vision...

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,963
and the experienced apparatus
to make that vision a reality.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,488
What would you say is the main reason they
should vote for you over Alderman Blood?

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,648
Well, um...

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,890
Alderman Blood isn't a parent.

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,084
And the soul of being a
parent is making sure

70
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:45,505
that your children have
a bright future...

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,564
and I've been very lucky
to be able to do that for my own.

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,848
Yeah, mother of the year.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,647
Uh, we're in the middle of an interview.

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,810
I'll keep it short.
You can't have your rally at Verdant.

75
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,130
It's the only place I have
that hasn't been poisoned by you.

76
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,328
Can you give me one moment, please?

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,567
Turn it off.

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,525
Thea, I know you're upset,
and you have every right to be...

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,530
- but we need to talk somewhere else.
- I'm done talking.

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,520
I just came by to tell you it'll be a cold
day in hell before you can use my club.

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,749
We can't just change the
venue the day before.

82
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,715
I'm sure you could
figure something out.

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,048
I mean, you have such
an experienced apparatus.

84
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,765
You signed a contract.

85
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,170
Huh.

86
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,130
Just when I thought
you couldn't go any lower...

87
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,210
you threaten your own daughter.

88
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,844
Moira.

89
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,924
What's going on?

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,571
Sorry you had to witness that.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,889
After her abduction, I'd think the
two of you'd be closer than ever.

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,367
It's a very complicated situation.

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,369
Well, my advice?

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,449
Simplify it.

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,650
You have to be either a mother
or a candidate.

96
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,127
You can't be both. Not right now.

97
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,483
You cannot split your focus.

98
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,361
You're absolutely right.

99
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,002
You're really cute when you're mopey.

100
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,407
I'm not mopey.

101
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,167
Mopey's your default, Ollie.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,404
It's part of your smoldering charm.

103
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,764
- I do have smoldering charm.
- Ha, ha.

104
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,764
But you're more-than-usual mopey.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,647
Is everything all right?

106
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,043
It's fine.

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,930
Ollie?

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,251
Tommy had me out a little bit later
than maybe I should have been and...

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,291
Heh. What, I'm wiped?

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Well, you want me to go?

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,561
I promised Sara I'd help her
with her trigonometry.

112
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,285
I don't know what that is.

113
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,570
You are very cute.

114
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,242
- Get some sleep.
- Mm-hm.

115
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,730
Bye.

116
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,570
Bye.

117
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,010
- Good night, Mrs. Queen.
- Good night.

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,410
- You didn't go out with Tommy last night.
- Ha, ha.

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,886
Okay. Thank you for eavesdropping on
my entire conversation, Mom. That's nice.

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,801
Sweetheart, something's bothering you.
Tell me what it is.

121
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,167
Dad's gonna kill me.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,845
Your father loves you.

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,008
- I love you.
- I screwed up.

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,010
It's bad.

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,520
What happened?

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,640
I got a girl pregnant.

127
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,081
Laurel's pregnant?

128
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,289
No.

129
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,091
Not Laurel.

130
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,250
This is ridiculous. We can't just ride
around all night, hoping to lay eyes on him.

131
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,767
Diggle.

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,440
His place is clean.
I don't think he's been back here.

133
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,450
A call just went out for an ambulance
at 14th and Hobart.

134
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,087
There's four men seriously assaulted
by someone wearing a red hoodie.

135
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,724
What happened?

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,201
Guy jumped us. It came out of nowhere.

137
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,287
Dude is roided out or something.

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,688
Crazy-like.

139
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,327
- See you, Sin.
- Adios.

140
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,722
Yo, Abercrombie.

141
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,967
Hold up.

142
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,844
Where you been, man?

143
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,203
I went over your place, like, 20 times.
Thea said you skipped town.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,242
Holy crap. Have you been in a fight?

145
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,367
Hey!

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,648
Hey, Sin. This guy bothering you?

147
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,411
No, no, no. It's chill.
Seriously, just step off.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,047
We gonna have a problem, guy?

149
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:30,515
Seriously? Just leave him alone.
He's fine.

150
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,444
What, you got nothing smart to say?

151
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,931
Felicity's running facial recognition
on traffic cameras throughout the city.

152
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,144
Which could take forever.

153
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,830
We need to take Roy down now
before he attacks any more people.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,402
What part of "I want nothing to do
with you" are you just not understanding?

155
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,807
I came by to see Sara.

156
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,601
And what about him? He's been stalking me.

157
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,484
- He's protecting you.
- From what?

158
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,444
Slade Wilson is still at large.

159
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,281
- He already tried hurting you once.
- He didn't hurt me. He told me the truth.

160
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,768
Which I know you think is a bad thing,
but it's actually not.

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,166
It is if it cost me you.

162
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,365
Your lies did that.

163
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,081
Now, I'm gonna go up to the stockroom, and
if I get attacked by some shot glasses...

164
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,520
I'll call 911.

165
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,005
Thanks for taking care of her.

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,044
Lucky for me, she's not as good
at disappearing as you are.

167
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,088
I'll be right back.

168
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,047
- Have you seen Thea?
- What happened to your eye?

169
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,528
It's okay. I could cover it with makeup,
if I wore makeup.

170
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,041
- It's fine.
- Who did this to you?

171
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,004
- It's a long story.
- I asked you who.

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,890
Roy.

173
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,809
But he's not right in the head.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,527
He got injected with something, a drug,
I don't know, but it made him strong.

175
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,444
Like comic-book strong.

176
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,048
- Look, I know it sounds nuts...
- No, it really doesn't.

177
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,881
Sara, Roy's a friend.
He needs help, not a beatdown.

178
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,047
I'll have to call you right back.

179
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,409
You want me to stay, Mr. Blood?

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,605
Uh, no, Clinton, thank you. We'll be fine.

181
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,331
My new body man,
he's a little overprotective.

182
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,126
- Please.
- No, thank you.

183
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,769
I'd say this visit is unexpected
but I despise understatement.

184
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,931
I'm dropping out of the race. I'm making
a concession speech at my rally tonight.

185
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,327
You're ahead in the latest polls.

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,609
Even the most skeptical pundits are saying
you could actually pull this out.

187
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,451
I felt I owed you the courtesy
of informing you in person.

188
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,884
I don't, however,
owe you an explanation as well.

189
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,889
No, you don't.

190
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,887
But I'd appreciate one.

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,771
What you're doing, Moira,
as much as it benefits me...

192
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,327
doesn't really make much sense.

193
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,242
It's my daughter.

194
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,285
At the moment, she needs me
more than Starling does.

195
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,841
Well, you're doing the right thing.

196
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,762
I am going to change this city, Moira.

197
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,446
A new day is coming.

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,250
A better day...

199
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,528
for all of us.

200
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,644
I know things seem bleak, sweetheart,
but we're gonna figure this out, I promise.

201
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,081
Mom, it doesn't seem fair...

202
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,084
to me.

203
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
One mistake and it...

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,091
It feels like my entire life is over.

205
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,364
Your life is far from over.

206
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,361
Are you sure it's yours?

207
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,326
Where there is money, Oliver,
there are people looking to take advantage.

208
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,603
She's not that type of person.
She's a good person, Mom. She's...

209
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,689
All right.

210
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,201
I don't know what to do. What do I do?

211
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,046
Heh.

212
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,170
We all make mistakes, Oliver.

213
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,201
And I'd hope that one day you'd forgive me
for any that I might make, so...

214
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,848
All right. Um, I'll be right back.

215
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,210
Verdant, 14th and Hobart,
and the bar Sin spotted him at.

216
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,687
- He looks to be moving east.
- What's east?

217
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,524
Queen mansion.

218
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,808
If he still remembers where Thea lives...

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,241
Well, you used to live,
but Roy doesn't know that.

220
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,727
There might be something of Roy
still locked in there.

221
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,763
Or it's just a coincidence
he's moving east.

222
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,723
I know that Sin's involved,
but don't let that cloud your judgment.

223
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,844
Well, don't let the fact
that this used to be Roy, cloud yours.

224
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,728
- Sin.
- I found Roy.

225
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,524
I thought I told you to go home.

226
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,200
Yeah, that's where I am right now.

227
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,562
And so is he.

228
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,565
Roy.

229
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,200
He's not here.

230
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,083
It's Oliver.

231
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,163
It's me.

232
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,363
What you're doing right now...

233
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,528
it's because of the Mirakuru.

234
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,242
You're a good person, Roy.
You have a conscience and a soul.

235
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,889
I need you to use those and fight this.
You can do it.

236
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,250
Drop the arrow. Drop it.

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,161
No!

238
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,483
A full moon tonight,
that really brings out the whack jobs.

239
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,048
Good news is, it can't get any stranger.

240
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,203
My friend needs your help.

241
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,563
I was wrong. Gotta call you back.

242
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,409
Some of this damage is chronic.

243
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,921
The cost of jumping off rooftops, I guess.

244
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,202
I need to get back on my feet.

245
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,166
I can give you a brace, but you'll still be
in horrendous amounts of pain.

246
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,567
Six months ago,
this cabinet would've been empty.

247
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,849
The Chinese Triad was stopping
all of our med shipments...

248
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,520
until someone stopped them.

249
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,442
Ever since, I've been looking for a way
to thank you.

250
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,529
If you're gonna have to follow me
everywhere, at least don't lurk, all right?

251
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,250
I can't let you out of my sight...

252
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,205
and you're sick of seeing me everywhere you
go. Lurking seemed like a good compromise.

253
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,165
Yeah, well, it's not.

254
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,204
Family's hard.
Sometimes they're the hardest in the world.

255
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,880
Loving someone so much
and letting them love you back.

256
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,731
You know, you're right.
You should go back to lurking.

257
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,729
I spend a lot of time with your family.

258
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,207
If you think that gives you the right
to weigh in, you're wrong.

259
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,364
Plus, Oliver will be out of money soon
and you'll be unemployed.

260
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,565
Right. Then I guess I should get this in
under the wire.

261
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,762
You know, your mother isn't perfect.

262
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,803
Her judgment definitely isn't.

263
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,489
There's one thing she's consistent about,
that she loves you and Oliver.

264
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,728
And that should buy her what, in your mind?

265
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,641
Hell, I don't know, Thea.

266
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,283
But she is your mother...

267
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,562
that should buy her something.

268
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,288
A second chance maybe?

269
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,881
Perpetrator of an attack
that left one police

270
00:18:04,906 --> 00:18:07,385
officer seriously injured
and the other dead.

271
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,331
We have video shot by a bystander...

272
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,201
but please be warned that the footage
maybe too graphic for some viewers.

273
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,410
Oh, my God.

274
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,682
- Thea?
- I have to go see a friend.

275
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,247
If you have to follow, follow.

276
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,650
These aren't gonna fix your knee.

277
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,525
- They'll help it heal faster.
- And until then?

278
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,405
- Where are we with facial recognition?
- Traffic cams can't get a clear shot.

279
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
- Now I see why you wear that hood.
- Felicity.

280
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,208
We need to find Roy before the police do.

281
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,368
Because they'll kill him and we won't?

282
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,882
- S.T.A.R. Labs is working on a cure.
- Which they may never come up with.

283
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,527
Even if they do, how many people
are we gonna let Roy kill in the meantime?

284
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,200
You wanted to kill Helena too.
You found another way.

285
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,445
That was different and you know it. Roy
has the Mirakuru in him, just like Slade.

286
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,291
If you had a clear shot at Slade right now,
you'd take it.

287
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,811
Roy isn't Slade.

288
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,240
Roy isn't Roy.

289
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,649
He's not himself anymore.
He's too far gone.

290
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,321
I don't believe that.

291
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
Do you even hear yourself right now, Ollie?

292
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,009
This is the exact conversation
that we had five years ago...

293
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,441
except we were freezing on Lian Yu.

294
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,161
- What are you doing?
- What needs to be done.

295
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,727
Mirakuru won't do anything
against a head shot.

296
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,492
Sara.

297
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,231
Your mother's rally
starts in half an hour.

298
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,602
I'd start getting dressed, if I were you.

299
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,762
She reminds me so much of me
after I came home.

300
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,807
When it just seemed...

301
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,569
It seemed impossible to believe in
anything even resembling hope.

302
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,847
But you did.

303
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,364
You did.

304
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,923
Eventually.

305
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,320
Sara will too.

306
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,722
- Thanks for coming.
- It's chill. Who's that?

307
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,800
Uh, my shadow.

308
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,008
Uh, listen, something is going on with Roy.

309
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,168
I know. I saw him. He's totally crazed.

310
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,089
What's happening to him?

311
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,846
Do you remember around Christmas
when he bailed on us?

312
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,430
Yeah?

313
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:46,304
He got shot up with
something, this drug...

314
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,448
and it's been messing with his head.

315
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,364
Did you tell my brother any of this?

316
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,771
No. Why?

317
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,281
He's had this bodyguard all over me.

318
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,808
He must know about Roy,
think he's coming after me or something.

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,206
What are you gonna do?

320
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,323
Roy?

321
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,804
Roy, it's me.

322
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,251
It's Thea.

323
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,051
I'm so glad I found you.

324
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,846
I've been looking everywhere.

325
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,761
This is all my fault.

326
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,247
I did this to you.

327
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,284
When you broke up with me,
it was a cry for help...

328
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,642
and I didn't listen.

329
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,531
I should be punished.

330
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,646
I deserve to be punished.

331
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,289
Someone hurts you, you hurt them worse.

332
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,166
You hurt them permanently.

333
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,328
You should just kill me.

334
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,681
Kill me.

335
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,682
Kill me.

336
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,650
Oliver, where have you been?

337
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,884
- Haven't you gotten any of my calls?
- I've been busy. What's wrong?

338
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,208
- It's your mother.
- She'll do fine.

339
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,084
No, she won't.

340
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,410
She's not using this event to rally
the troops. She's using it...

341
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,961
to tell people she's dropping out
of the race.

342
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,763
Oliver.

343
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,250
What happened?

344
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,081
It's a motorcycle accident. It was stupid.

345
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,001
Yes, this would be the second accident
in as many weeks...

346
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,219
if my math is correct.

347
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:40,467
Mark says you're
dropping out of the race.

348
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,850
The truth is I should have done it
weeks ago...

349
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,280
after Thea was abducted.

350
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,087
My complete focus needs to be
on repairing our relationship.

351
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,521
What's happening with Thea
right now isn't because

352
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:54,434
you weren't spending
enough time with her.

353
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,202
Well, maybe not. But I have to do something,
and I'm not sure what else to do.

354
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,168
Thea hates you right now
because of the things that you've done.

355
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
Terrible things.

356
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,001
So let her see you do something good...

357
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,561
as mayor.

358
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,163
Mom, I know a little something about...

359
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,604
sacrificing the people closest to me...

360
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,320
for the good of this city.

361
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,051
It's what you need to do now.

362
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,689
I know.

363
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,083
Good.

364
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,324
Oliver, I know.

365
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,528
I know.

366
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,407
I've known since last year, I suppose.

367
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,180
The night of the Undertaking,
everything became so clear.

368
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,600
It's pretty much the night I stopped sleeping.

369
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,684
- Before you say anything else...
- There's nothing else to say.

370
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,530
Nothing I need to say.

371
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,291
Except I could not be more proud.

372
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,010
Can I have Raisa get you anything to drink?

373
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,568
Or something to eat perhaps? Please.

374
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,524
Where's Oliver?

375
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,530
He's running an errand for me.

376
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,929
I thought it would give
us a chance to talk.

377
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,088
With all due respect, um, Mrs. Queen...

378
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,726
what's happening,
it's between me and your son.

379
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,410
Yes.

380
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,687
What is that?

381
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,089
Oh, I had one of our investigators
write up at dossier on you.

382
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,729
I'm sorry, but it's a necessary precaution
against a fraudulent claim of paternity.

383
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,410
Well, the baby is Oliver's.

384
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,366
Oh. Of that, I have no doubt.
Our investigators were quite thorough.

385
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,403
But you can imagine...

386
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,289
how many people my family attracts
who are looking for handouts.

387
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,204
Well, I'm not looking for money.

388
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,647
Of course not.

389
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,082
I told you I don't want money.

390
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,410
And I'm telling you
that this is my first grandchild.

391
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,089
And I wanna make certain
that he or she has a bright future.

392
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,647
Please.

393
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,887
This is a million dollars.

394
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,084
I wanna make certain
that my son has a bright future as well.

395
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,884
That money is yours...

396
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,971
once you tell Oliver
that you've lost the baby.

397
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,367
What?

398
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,884
And another million when you return to
Central City never to speak to him again.

399
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,686
Can I offer you some advice,
one mother to another?

400
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,606
When it comes to your children,
there is no action that is inconceivable...

401
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,127
there's no decision that is impossible.

402
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,285
You do what you must
to provide the life that they need.

403
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,451
And I think that $2
million is sufficient...

404
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,365
to provide the life
that both our children need.

405
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,528
Don't you?

406
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,962
When I was first approached
about entering this race...

407
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,650
the prospect of winning seemed a
distant, nearly impossible feat.

408
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,201
How could a city
that had suffered so much...

409
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,166
place its faith in someone
so responsible for its suffering?

410
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
But as the weeks progressed...

411
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,002
good people such as you
raised your voices in support...

412
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,249
and I began to think
that I could make a difference.

413
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,370
I could help save this city.

414
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,769
But...

415
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,441
recent events have
changed things, and...

416
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,691
And now I know I can make a difference.

417
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,122
Should the honor become mine,
I promise with every breath I take...

418
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,049
to do what is necessary.

419
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,290
To sacrifice what is necessary
for the good of this city.

420
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,046
Starling City is my home,
you are my family...

421
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,529
and there is nothing more
important to me than family.

422
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,442
Thank you. Thank you, all.

423
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,807
Great speech, Moira.

424
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,089
- A little too off-book for my liking...
- Thank you.

425
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,806
- But we'll work on that.
- I thought it was perfect.

426
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,610
Uh, um...

427
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,644
Hi.

428
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,129
I just wanted to come up here
and say a few words.

429
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,122
I am so proud to have my mom here tonight.

430
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,085
At my club, Verdant, in the Glades.

431
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,327
What is she doing?

432
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,325
She knows this is being televised.

433
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,480
She's sending a message to Roy.
Trying to draw him out.

434
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,045
Vote Queen. Tell your friends. Thanks.

435
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,043
- Thea...
- That was not for you.

436
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,802
Oh, my God, you're heavy.
Is this really all muscle?

437
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,875
How many of those
vitaminerals do we have?

438
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,510
About 20.

439
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,684
- I need all of them.
- Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?

440
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,160
Can you even get into those
leather pants with that knee?

441
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,129
Lidocaine, now.

442
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,924
Okay.

443
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,527
- Let's see, the bottle says the proper dose...
- Is all of it.

444
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,200
- I don't think that's a good...
- Mm.

445
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,401
Oh.

446
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,643
Terrific speech, Moira. How did we
not think of running you years ago?

447
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,126
Well, thank you.

448
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,408
- Uh, can you give me a moment?
- Of course.

449
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,440
Oh, hello.

450
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,676
We need to go now.

451
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,504
No, no, I can't leave
without my daughter.

452
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,849
I'll see to the safety of your daughter.
Go. Thea, we have to go now.

453
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,611
No, it's Roy. I'm not leaving him.
He came here for me.

454
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,691
Roy.

455
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,884
Roy, listen to me. Listen to my voice.

456
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,684
I don't know what's going on...

457
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,363
but I have to believe the man I fell in
love with is still inside there, somewhere.

458
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,848
You have to fight.
You're strong, you can fight this.

459
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,445
Fight this.

460
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,884
Roy.

461
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,409
Put her down.

462
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,847
No. Please, don't.

463
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,611
- He can't control it.
- That's why I don't have a choice.

464
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,131
Roy.

465
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,010
- Get out of the way.
- Don't do this.

466
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,441
Kill me.

467
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,560
Please, kill me.

468
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,850
Please, don't do it.

469
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,801
No one dies tonight.

470
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,009
You've got the police.

471
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,440
Go outside.

472
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,809
We'll get Roy the help he needs.
I promise. Go.

473
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,051
Tibetan pit-viper venom.

474
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,561
Constant dose of that
can't be good for you, right?

475
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,651
- It'll keep him sedated like it did Slade.
- Until when? What happens when we run out?

476
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,720
Not like you can buy this stuff
over the counter, unless you're in Tibet.

477
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
Then maybe.

478
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,289
We'll take care of him.

479
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,811
I'm not ready to give up on Roy.

480
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,404
Anyone else crave dim sum after fisticuffs?

481
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,483
No? Okay, dumplings for one then.

482
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,242
I would've killed him.

483
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,921
I was ready to.

484
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,126
He'd be dead right now
if you hadn't have stopped me.

485
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,805
But he's not.

486
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,888
That's all that matters.

487
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,128
That's not true.

488
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,610
I wanted to kill Roy...

489
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,726
because that's what I do.

490
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,122
That's who I am.

491
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,364
I spent six years in the darkness...

492
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,485
and I looked into the
eyes of the devil...

493
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,291
and I gave him my soul.

494
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,530
Let me help you get it back.

495
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,287
No, you deserve someone better.

496
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,926
Someone who can harness that light
that's still inside of you.

497
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,326
But I'm not that person.

498
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,730
- And I never will be.
- Sara.

499
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,285
Don't.

500
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,168
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,087
I just care about you too much
to be with you.

502
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,444
Hey.

503
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,802
Everything okay?

504
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,369
Yeah. Just had a long day.

505
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,763
- How's Roy?
- Well, he's alive. No thanks to me.

506
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,247
You know, that was brave,
getting between us.

507
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,403
- It took guts.
- Not really.

508
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,121
I knew you wouldn't really hurt him.
You're not a killer.

509
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,161
What's this for?

510
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,287
Say goodbye.

511
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,801
What? Wait, where are you going?

512
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,606
To see an old friend.

513
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,210
We've got every cop in this city
canvassing. We'll find this guy.

514
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,402
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

515
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,167
- You okay?
- Fine. Where were you?

516
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,961
He was with me.

517
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,488
Odd to see the two of you
are getting along again.

518
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,566
Thea.

519
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,764
You knew about Roy.

520
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,247
What?

521
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,848
That's why you had your bodyguard
stalking me.

522
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,931
Somehow, you knew
what was going on with him.

523
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,209
I'm just trying to protect you.

524
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,680
By not telling me the truth.

525
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,564
Just like with Malcolm Merlyn.

526
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,929
You know, the two of you...

527
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,570
you think you're protecting me
by lying and by keeping secrets.

528
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,202
But that's what's actually hurting me.

529
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,250
You're absolutely right.

530
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,248
- We need to turn a new page.
- It's not gonna be that simple.

531
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,403
- Or easy.
- I know.

532
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,202
If the truth were easy for me,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

533
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,444
But to start...

534
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,170
there's something about Malcolm
that both you and Oliver need to know.

535
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,047
Malcolm...

536
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,243
Oliver.

537
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,962
Oliver.

538
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,410
I'm dead.

539
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,281
Oliver?

540
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,965
Oliver.

541
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,081
I was dead the last time
you were offered this choice.

542
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,049
Slade.

543
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,120
Oliver, what's happening?

544
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,647
I often wonder how you looked...

545
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,405
when he pointed the gun at Shado...

546
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,171
and took her from me.

547
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,044
You psychopath.

548
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,925
Shado. Shado wasn't yours.

549
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,645
No, she was yours.

550
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,802
Until you chose another woman over her.

551
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,049
- That's not what happened!
- It is what happened.

552
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,242
It is.

553
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,891
She told me.

554
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,041
What do you mean, she?
There's nobody there.

555
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,169
Slade...

556
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,927
you were on the island with Oliver.

557
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,488
I thought I had known true despair...

558
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,968
until I met your son.

559
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,046
I trusted him to make the right choice.

560
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,961
Let me make the right choice now. Kill me.

561
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,241
- No.
- No.

562
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,771
Choose me, please.

563
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,689
I am killing you, Oliver.

564
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,128
- Only more slowly than you would like.
- Don't.

565
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,409
- Choose.
- No, no. No.

566
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,840
- Don't.
- Choose.

567
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,486
- Please.
- Choose.

568
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,523
I swear to God, I am gonna kill you.

569
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,484
- Choose.
- No. No.

570
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,204
- No.
- No.

571
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,050
Mom?

572
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,601
- Mom, what are you doing?
- There's only one way this night can end.

573
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,444
No.

574
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,087
We both know that.

575
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,451
Don't we, Mr. Wilson?

576
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,524
Mom, please don't.

577
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,644
Both my children will live.

578
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,969
Mom, what are you doing?

579
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,530
Mom.

580
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,081
Thea, I love you.

581
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,927
- Close your eyes, baby.
- No!

582
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,081
No.

583
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,091
You possess true courage.

584
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,648
I'm truly sorry.

585
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,245
You did not pass that on to your son.

586
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,961
No!

587
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,846
No.

588
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,327
There is still one person...

589
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,442
who has to die...

590
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,482
before this can end.

591
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,011
No.

592
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,485
Mom?

593
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,930
Mom.

594
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,928
Mom.

595
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,605
Well, yeah, I'm sorry too.

596
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,601
Well, listen, if there's ever anything
that I can do...

597
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,404
Hello?

598
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,248
Who was that?

599
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,010
That was, um...

600
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,928
She lost the baby.

601
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,487
She said she's sad about it.

602
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,923
And she's gonna go back to school
in Central City.

603
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,970
Apparently, she has family there.

604
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,889
I'm sure this has been
very traumatic for her.

605
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,811
But it sounds for the best.

606
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,127
- Sure.
- You okay?

607
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,208
Yeah. Yes.

608
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,241
I continue to be
the luckiest guy on the planet.

609
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,284
What would I have done if she...?

610
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,928
I'm just... I'm not ready to be a dad.

611
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,167
No.

612
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,442
But someday.

613
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,123
It's my fondest hope for you.

614
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,167
I'm glad I told you.

615
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,440
I don't think I could've gotten
through something like this without you.

616
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,610
You're never without me.

617
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,890
My beautiful boy.

618
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,002
So...

619
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,410
I love you.

620
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,844
I love you.
