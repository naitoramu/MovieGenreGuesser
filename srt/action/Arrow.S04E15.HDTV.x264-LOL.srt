1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,687
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:04,369
He can't know that
you're his father,

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:05,633
and nobody else can.

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:07,336
Samantha, there is
someone in my life now.

5
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:09,588
Please don't make me
keep this from her.

6
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:12,122
You will if you want
a relationship with my son.

7
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:15,058
I know who Oliver Queen
cares about more than anyone.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,027
Nora, honey, there's
someone I'd like you to meet.

9
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,461
This is William.

10
00:00:18,463 --> 00:00:19,963
It's an implantable
biostimulant.

11
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,331
This little piece
of technology's gonna help

12
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,732
me walk again?

13
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,294
After it's implanted
in your spine, yes.

14
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,139
I can do this.

15
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,609
I can do this.
I can so totally do this.

16
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,345
Yes, you can,
but either way,

17
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:37,480
we've got you.

18
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,716
It's no pressure
here, Miss Smoak.

19
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:42,819
Curtis' implant is the longest
of long shots.

20
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:43,987
I was expecting
a little more encouragement

21
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,355
from the husband
of the genius

22
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:46,723
who invented the thing.

23
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,425
My man works
miracles with technology,

24
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,327
but the human body
doesn't play by the same rules.

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,663
Well, here we go.

26
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:54,931
Here we go.

27
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,334
Here we go,
here we go.

28
00:00:58,336 --> 00:01:00,036
Yeah. We're going.

29
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,340
- Ooh! Ow!
- Ohh!

30
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,844
Ok. It's ok. Got you,
got you, got you.

31
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:12,382
Well, that went nowhere.

32
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:14,250
Curtis ever tell
you how we met?

33
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:15,552
Uh-uh.

34
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:18,321
He came in with
Achilles tendonitis.

35
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:19,956
He was training
to qualify for the Olympics,

36
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,792
so all he cared
about was results.

37
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,127
Took me weeks just
to get him focused

38
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,795
on what really
mattered.

39
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:28,965
How handsome
his therapist was?

40
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,033
Healing.

41
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,703
Got to be patient with yourself.

42
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,304
These things
take time.

43
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,115
Are you sure what Conklin
told you was the truth?

44
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:47,183
Conklin was dying.

45
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:49,052
He had no reason
to lie.

46
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,587
Whatever Reiter
has planned,

47
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:52,756
he's gonna kill
everyone here.

48
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,023
Mr. Queen...

49
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,459
It appears we are
within striking distance

50
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,927
of my prize.

51
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:00,563
I want you both at my side
when I claim it.

52
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:01,831
I don't give a damn
about your

53
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,867
superstitious
crusade!

54
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,035
Nevertheless, you'll
both bear witness to its fruition.

55
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,241
You ok?

56
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:20,718
Me?

57
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,051
I knew you were gonna
ask me,

58
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,219
so I thought I'd beat
you to the punch.

59
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,089
Heh heh.
Are you ok?

60
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:30,160
A guy, a brilliant guy
says he can put

61
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:31,661
a microchip in my spine

62
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,530
and I will walk again.

63
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,366
I'm enough of a geek
to know science fiction when I see it.

64
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,768
You're still
disappointed?

65
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,638
Yeah. You know...

66
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,642
It's stupid.

67
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,410
Talk to me.

68
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:51,414
I wanted to be able to walk down
the aisle on our wedding day.

69
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,116
Heh.

70
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,725
Aw, you two just
melt my stone-cold heart.

71
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:04,394
You almost make me
believe in love again.

72
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:05,695
Nice to see you,
Mr. Queen.

73
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:07,463
How was your Christmas?

74
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,065
Son of a bi--

75
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:12,335
Ooh! Oh. You're so brave
for a political candidate

76
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:13,837
and reformed party boy.

77
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,805
Oh. Sorry about the limo,
love the wheelchair.

78
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,308
Might I suggest motorized.

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,610
Unh!

80
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:22,278
We have extremely
powerful friends.

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,313
You do not know who
you're messing with.

82
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:24,848
If it makes
you happy,

83
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,116
the messing ends today.

84
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:30,019
I tried to bring you
into the fold, Mr. Queen,

85
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:31,821
I tried to kidnap
your nearest and dearest,

86
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:34,557
I tried to kill you,
but none of that took.

87
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:38,328
Well, like she said, you don't know
who you're messing with.

88
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,297
I suspect that is true,

89
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,734
but as they say--
well, or should--

90
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,803
the fourth time
is the charm.

91
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,607
Go ahead.
Take a look.

92
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,141
I'll wait.

93
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:59,749
William thinks that I'm
friends with his mother.

94
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,684
Funny. Heh heh heh.

95
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,921
Anyhoo, 6:00 on Friday,
you're gonna hold a press conference

96
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:07,423
and drop out
of the mayoral race.

97
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,359
Oh, that's 6 pm,
by the way.

98
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,261
I will be at home
watching you

99
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,429
from my brand-new
television.

100
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,804
What did he show you
on your phone?

101
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:24,440
Who's William?

102
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,056
He's my son.

103
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,057

Please say something.

106
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:40,423
Felicity, I can explain.

107
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:42,058
Stop.

108
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:46,529
I cannot hear
another lie.

109
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:48,731
You know, it's--it's
more complicated than that.

110
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,400
God, Oliver.
Are you the only person

111
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:53,970
on this planet that considers
the truth complicated?

112
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:56,172
Just to be clear,
I don't care

113
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,441
that you have a child.

114
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,877
I can't believe that
you have a child

115
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,246
that you didn't
tell me about.

116
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:05,048
What does it say
about our relationship

117
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,951
if your first instinct is
to always hide the truth?

118
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:09,719
William's mother made
a condition

119
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:11,387
that the only way
I would be allowed

120
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,426
to meet my son is
if I agreed to keep him secret,

121
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,261
even from you.

122
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:19,829
Who even makes
that kind of ultimatum?

123
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,831
Just a--a mother
who's trying to protect her son,

124
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,433
and she thought that
the best thing for him

125
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,601
was to keep his world
separate from mine.

126
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,437
After everything
that has happened,

127
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,238
can you really say that
she was wrong?

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,841
Well, it didn't
work, did it?

129
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,810
Somehow, Darhk
still found out.

130
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:37,080
Hey.
We got your 911.

131
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:39,082
Darhk paid
us a visit.

132
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:40,616
He's holding
a 10-year-old boy hostage,

133
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:42,251
says that he will
release him

134
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:43,920
if Oliver drops out
of the mayoral race.

135
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,288
Let's get
in touch with Alex,

136
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,856
have him schedule
a press conference

137
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:48,424
for Friday at 6 pm.

138
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,093
You're not actually
going for this, are you?

139
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,929
The boy Darhk has--
William--

140
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:55,431
he's my son.

141
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,100
Yeah.
I just found out, too.

142
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,468
Apparently, the only
two people that knew

143
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,471
about William were
Oliver and Darhk.

144
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:05,174
Actually,
I found out, too. Um--

145
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:06,576
um, what's our
next plan?

146
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,511
William lives in
Central City, right?

147
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:09,846
Yep.

148
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:12,115
I will call Barry,
see what CCPD can do.

149
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,150
Is it ok if I tell
Barry that William's your--

150
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,787
Barry knows, too.

151
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,555
Let's also get in touch
with Malcolm.

152
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,657
He has an ax to grind after
what happened with the League,

153
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,262
and, um, Malcolm
knows, as well.

154
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:27,930
Maybe it would be easier
to list the people

155
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:31,868
who don't know
about your son.

156
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,973
Ahem. Samantha's here.

157
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,474
Who's Samantha?

158
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,009
It's William's mother.

159
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:48,551
Alex.

160
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,453
She said her name
was Samantha Clayton.

161
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,221
The name struck a bell from the
million-dollar check you told Thea

162
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:53,322
wasn't gonna be
a problem.

163
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,891
It's not gonna be
a problem.

164
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:58,694
Ok. Then why did I
just get a 911 text

165
00:06:58,696 --> 00:07:00,936
from Thea telling me
that you're pulling out of the race?

166
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:04,901
Have you heard
from William?

167
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,469
Do you know
where he is?

168
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,737
I don't, but I'm doing
everything I can.

169
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,639
Oh! I knew it.

170
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,374
I knew the second
I realized he was gone,

171
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:15,578
I knew that you had to have
some sort of involvement in this.

172
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,913
Oh, my God.
What was I thinking

173
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:18,414
letting you get
into his life?

174
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,116
Two months later,
and he's missing.

175
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,984
Samantha, I need you
to tell me exactly what happened.

176
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:23,252
No, Oliver.
You need to tell me

177
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,720
what the hell
is going on,

178
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,355
and you need to give me
my son back right now!

179
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:28,024
I am trying,
but you need to tell me

180
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:29,759
what happened, please.

181
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:35,965
I--I went upstairs to get him for dinner,
and he was gone.

182
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,000
Gone.

183
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:40,369
No--no note,
no sign of struggle.

184
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,205
Just vanished.

185
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,540
I called the CCPD, and they have been
looking everywhere,

186
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:47,110
but it's already been
48 hours,

187
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,678
and still nothing,

188
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,980
but then a crime scene technician
pulled me aside

189
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,416
and said that I needed to talk
to you about this.

190
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:54,717
Barry Allen?

191
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,587
Yes. That's the one.

192
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,088
Oliver, you promised.

193
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,590
- I--
- You promised me

194
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,625
that you wouldn't tell
anyone about my son.

195
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,327
Barry figured it--
that's not what's

196
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:05,761
important right now.

197
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,363
What is important is
I'm gonna do everything--

198
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:08,564
and I mean absolutely
everything in my power--

199
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,733
and we will get
him back!

200
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:12,101
What can--what can
you do, Oliver?

201
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,137
What can you do that
the entire police force

202
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,238
hasn't been able to do?

203
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,706
S-Samantha...

204
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:20,977
I'm the Green Arrow.

205
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,150
This doesn't make
any sense.

206
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,718
Well,
like I said,

207
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,487
I'm not the person
that I used to be.

208
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:32,855
Samantha, these are
my friends.

209
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,958
They're gonna help us
find William.

210
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,628
You probably remember...

211
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,429
Laurel Lance.

212
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:43,166
I am so sorry that you're
going through this, Samantha.

213
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:45,535
We will help you
get William back.

214
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,803
Look, Laurel.

215
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,839
It was one time,

216
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:53,643
and I knew that you
and Oliver were together,

217
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:57,947
but I was young
and stupid and selfish,

218
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:59,649
and I should have been
honest with you.

219
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:02,218
No. Oliver
should have been.

220
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:05,521
Come on.

221
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,860
Does CCPD
have anything?

222
00:09:10,862 --> 00:09:12,995
No. It was a clean grab.

223
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:14,697
Do we have any other
angles we can work,

224
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,499
other than Malcolm?

225
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,667
Finding William
isn't the problem.

226
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,502
Beating Damien Darhk is.

227
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,636
Every time we've
faced him,

228
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,271
we have been beaten
thoroughly.

229
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:23,639
That's because we can't
go against his magic.

230
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,640
We just need to
fight harder,

231
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:26,642
we need to fight
smarter.

232
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:27,944
You know, Oliver.
Insanity is doing

233
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,979
the same thing
over and over again

234
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:32,915
and expecting
a different result.

235
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:33,983
We need a new strategy.

236
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,084
What bout Constantine?

237
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,285
He's in Hell.

238
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,820
Really?
What's going on?

239
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:41,057
I mean, he's
actually literally in Hell.

240
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:42,692
Oh.

241
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:44,227
But I might know
someone else.

242
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:45,962
Her name is
Mari McCabe.

243
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:49,665
She possesses a totem which is
powered by magic.

244
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,167
She calls herself
Vixen.

245
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:56,639
What the hell
was that thing?

246
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,108
Cerico doesn't
pay us enough to find out!

247
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,380
Quick!

248
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,764
Aah!

249
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:28,337
Come on out.
Face us like a man!

250
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,506
I've got
a better idea.

251
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:38,914
How about I kick your ass
like a woman instead?

252
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,649
I had that
under control.

253
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:53,914
I know.

254
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:57,300
 What? Not enough in Star City
to keep you busy?

255
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,734
I need your help.

256
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,976
I have got to get me
one of these.

257
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:10,949
Mari.

258
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:11,912
Laurel, hey.

259
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,412
Good to see you.

260
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:15,748
You, too.

261
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,817
Mari, this is
John Diggle

262
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:18,851
and my sister Thea.

263
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,519
Pleasure.

264
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,088
It's nice to meet you.

265
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,090
Sorry it's under such
horrible circumstances.

266
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,425
You spoke to Felicity
on the phone.

267
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:27,727
Hey.

268
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,796
And this is Samantha,
William's mother.

269
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,366
She's a friend,
a hero in Detroit they call Vixen.

270
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:36,235
Mari and I had
an animated encounter last year,

271
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,305
and we've stayed
in touch ever since.

272
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,641
How are you gonna
help me find my son?

273
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,509
With magic.

274
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,344
Magic.

275
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,079
Yeah. It's
a long story,

276
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,081
but the short
version is that

277
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,784
this totem gives
me the ability to channel

278
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:54,287
the ashe-- or the spirit--
of any animal.

279
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,088
Do you have anything of
William's with you?

280
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,025
Yes, I do.
Just this.

281
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:00,526
It's his favorite.

282
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,365
Don't you dare tell
Barry about this.

283
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,867
Ahh.

284
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,788
He's in the city.
I think I can find him.

285
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,189
Ok. Good. Dig and I
will cover you.

286
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,991
Laurel, get in touch
with your father.

287
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:33,626
We're gonna loop in
the SCPD.

288
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,361
Felicity,
I need you to...

289
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,732
Would it be all right if you
sat with Samantha?

290
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:42,435
Working up
a search profile. Sure.

291
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,403
Thank you. Thea.

292
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,671
Yeah. Malcolm's
coming over.

293
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:47,206
I'll go talk to him.

294
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,728
We're gonna find him.
He's gonna be ok.

295
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,516
Can you feel it?

296
00:12:57,518 --> 00:13:00,686
The energy, primordial.

297
00:13:07,228 --> 00:13:08,861
What is that?

298
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:11,197
Destiny, Mr. Queen.

299
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,392
I know you're here.

300
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:42,395
There's no need to lurk
in the shadows like the bogeyman.

301
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:43,796
You haven't seen me
in a while.

302
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:46,565
And I'm not the man
I used to be.

303
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,667
Yeah, I know.

304
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:51,637
They told me.

305
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,539
Not pretty, is it?

306
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,876
Well, could have
been a lot worse.

307
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,277
Could have chopped
your head off.

308
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,414
And I would have been
better off for it.

309
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,850
He took the League away from me
and gave it to Nyssa al Ghul.

310
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:08,621
And that was more important
than saving your daughter's life?

311
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:12,758
Yeah. Heard about that
part of the story, too.

312
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,428
Refusing to bargain
with Nyssa to save me.

313
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,829
My intention was to
save your life

314
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,564
and to keep
my seat of power

315
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,332
for the betterment
of the world.

316
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:23,903
Did you tell Darhk
about Ollie's son?

317
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,104
Do you really think I'd
do something like that?

318
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,939
Just answer
the question.

319
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:28,674
No.

320
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:31,110
No, I won't

321
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:33,012
because you should
know me better

322
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,847
than to ask me
the question.

323
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,682
I know you all too well.

324
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:38,250
You should know
one thing, Thea.

325
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,520
No matter what happens,
I will always love you.

326
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:43,923
It's what fathers do.

327
00:15:02,343 --> 00:15:03,509
Crazy world
we live in, huh?

328
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:06,345
Metahumans, magic,

329
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:09,048
Oliver Queen father.

330
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,716
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you.

331
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:12,351
No, man. I totally
get it.

332
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:14,119
Samantha put you
in a tough spot.

333
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,822
Couldn't have been
an easy decision for you.

334
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,390
I totally get
why you made it.

335
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,526
She was right.
William was safer

336
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,727
when I didn't know
about him,

337
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,829
so maybe if
I never find out, I--

338
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:26,198
Can't even go
there, man.

339
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,234
You'll eat yourself
up inside

340
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:31,403
with the "what if this"
or the "maybe that."

341
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:34,340
Part of being
a parent.

342
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:35,674
Most important thing
now is focusing

343
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:38,711
on getting your boy
back home safe.

344
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:41,380
John...

345
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:43,215
How do you do it?

346
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:46,352
I know where Sara is
every night, Oliver.

347
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:49,221
I know what she's doing,
who she's with.

348
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,689
She sees my face

349
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:53,926
every single day.

350
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:57,029
I'm there for her,

351
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,833
and she knows,
and I know

352
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,903
that I would never
let anything bad happen to her.

353
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:05,571
I keep her close,
man,

354
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:07,973
and that's how
you keep your children safe.

355
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,048
Ok. He was wearing
a blue hoodie, plaid shirt,

356
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,985
gray corduroys,
and, um, a diamonds baseball cap.

357
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,453
He's a big fan.

358
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,422
Oliver likes
baseball, too.

359
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:27,860
Here's hoping that the innate fatherly
influence stops there.

360
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,529
Um, does he have any
distinguishing features,

361
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,199
freckles, birthmarks,
anything like that?

362
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,803
Oliver told me that
there was someone in his life,

363
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:41,840
someone special,
and her name was Felicity.

364
00:16:41,842 --> 00:16:43,909
He wanted to tell you,

365
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,378
and I wouldn't let him.

366
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,781
I didn't know
who he was now,

367
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:51,150
I didn't know what kind
of person he was.

368
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:52,518
That's going around.

369
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,187
Jut try and remember
that I was the one

370
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:56,455
that made him choose

371
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:59,224
between you
and knowing his son.

372
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,063
All right.
I got the whole force,

373
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,197
what's left of them
anyway,

374
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,699
canvassing for William.

375
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:09,468
Thank you.

376
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,437
You don't seem
as surprised as I expected.

377
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,806
What, that party boy Oliver Queen
knocked up some girl?

378
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:15,274
I'm amazed there
isn't an army of little Olivers

379
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:16,609
running around
out there.

380
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,577
Well, there may be.

381
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,712
Heh. Certainly
got around back then.

382
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:21,647
Yeah.

383
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,182
Ahh. You ok?

384
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,117
I don't know.

385
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,619
It's the mother
Samantha.

386
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:31,457
Um, she was with him
when--when I was with him.

387
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,859
Oh, baby.

388
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:36,929
I don't know why
it still stings.

389
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,297
It was
a million years ago,

390
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:39,698
and it's not like
I didn't know

391
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,133
that Oliver
cheated on me.

392
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:43,302
Yeah, but that's
one thing.

393
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:46,472
Knowing he had
a kid?

394
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:49,008
I'm sorry,
sweetheart.

395
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,342
Come here.

396
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,878
Thank you.

397
00:17:58,152 --> 00:17:59,618
It's Oliver.

398
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,487
He knows where William's
being held.

399
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,990
I count 4 guards
patrolling the roof.

400
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,492
Mari's in position.

401
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,054
Unh!

402
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:55,441
Ha ha ha!

403
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,076
I wondered how long
it would take

404
00:18:57,078 --> 00:18:59,878
for your buddy Oliver
to drag you into this.

405
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,213
Where's the boy?

406
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:02,581
Oh, he's fine.
I had him moved

407
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,916
about two minutes
before you and your posse

408
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:05,584
disturbed
my evening in.

409
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,219
You know what?
You might want to learn

410
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,254
to be a little bit more
discreet.

411
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,957
Have you considered
black instead of green?

412
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,425
You tell me where
you've taken him.

413
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,594
Or what? You'll fire
an arrow at me?

414
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,196
I think we've seen
that movie before.

415
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,399
I win, you lose,
rinse, repeat.

416
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:22,301
This time,
it's different.

417
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:23,569
Oh, really?

418
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:28,440
Where's the boy?

419
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:30,409
Ha ha ha!
You have some

420
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,945
very interesting
friends.

421
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,580
Unh!

422
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,688
My, my. I haven't
seen that trinket in a dog's age.

423
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,491
The M'Changa province,
am I right?

424
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,296
Stay.

425
00:19:57,705 --> 00:19:58,937
Oh, I like you,

426
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,639
and I don't like
many people.

427
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,164
I got you!

428
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:32,204
What happened?

429
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:35,674
Where did he go?

430
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:36,775
I can't track him.

431
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,677
Darhk's protected
by magic.

432
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:41,446
No, not just Darhk.
I lost William.

433
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,612
Where's William?
What happened?

434
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:55,614
We had a small setback,
but we are not giving up.

435
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:56,681
Setback?
What do you mean?

436
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,518
Hey. Blocked I.D.

437
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:02,454
Hello?

438
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:03,522
Oh. Hi, Oliver.

439
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:04,656
How is your
evening going?

440
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:07,125
Mine somewhat
eventful.

441
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:08,493
Some of your friends
stopped

442
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:10,529
by my place earlier
completely unannounced.

443
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:11,963
Very rude.

444
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,331
I want to talk
to my son, Darhk.

445
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,267
I want to know
that he's safe.

446
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:17,035
Oh, this must be the first time
your son's been kidnapped

447
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,070
because clearly you don't understand
how these things work.

448
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:20,805
I make the demands.

449
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:22,674
Well, you've made them,
and I've agreed.

450
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,442
Friday night, I'm
dropping out of the race.

451
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:28,580
Why wait? Give your green friend
less time to botch things up.

452
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:30,382
So go find yourself
a television camera.

453
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,250
I want to know that
my son is safe!

454
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:33,618
Oh, and by the way,
you're going to

455
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,187
completely endorse
Ruvé Adams,

456
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:39,558
save us all the trouble
of those pesky little write-in ballots.

457
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:45,330
He moved up
the timetable.

458
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,631
Wants me to drop out
of the race tonight.

459
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:49,701
Thea, let Alex know.

460
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:51,503
I am so sorry.

461
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:54,205
I know you brought me
here to fight magic with magic, but--

462
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:56,074
Mari, this is not
on you.

463
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,609
There is still so much
that we don't know about Darhk's power.

464
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:59,010
We--we don't--
we don't even know

465
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:00,779
what the source
of it is.

466
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:04,416
Wait. I get my powers
from this necklace.

467
00:22:04,418 --> 00:22:05,951
Without it, I'm just
a wannabe fashion designer

468
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:08,353
who lives at home
with her foster dad,

469
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:10,755
so up to now, everyone I've gone up
against with mystical powers

470
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,592
has had some sort
of totem like mine.

471
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:15,527
What if Darhk has an object
that helps him with his magic?

472
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,063
I think he does.
I walked in on him

473
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:20,065
once or twice in front
of this cabinet thing,

474
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:24,502
and inside, there's some kind of,
I don't know, idol.

475
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:25,570
Can you draw it for me?

476
00:22:25,572 --> 00:22:27,706
Yeah. I'll give
it a whirl.

477
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,874
Ok, Oliver. What if
this little art project

478
00:22:29,876 --> 00:22:31,276
doesn't yield
any results?

479
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:32,577
Well--

480
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:33,612
And what if it
takes too long?

481
00:22:33,614 --> 00:22:35,213
M-Mari
and Captain Lance

482
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:38,883
are working on a way
to eventually stop Darhk.

483
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,919
Right now, I have
to save William.

484
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:48,960
What's he saying?

485
00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:50,929
Whatever it is,
it's not good.

486
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:06,144
We have to get
out of here now!

487
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,914
Reiter, what
are you doing?

488
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,182
Proving what I know
about you is true.

489
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:13,318
You can't leave us
in here with it.

490
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,586
Reiter!

491
00:23:24,998 --> 00:23:26,364
You.

492
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:33,271
You are worthy
to pass.

493
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:50,021
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

494
00:23:50,023 --> 00:23:52,390
When I entered this race,
it was because

495
00:23:52,392 --> 00:23:55,126
no one else was willing
to step into the spotlight.

496
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:58,530
It has always been my hope
that my actions

497
00:23:58,532 --> 00:24:01,132
would inspire others.

498
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:03,034
4 months later,
and they have.

499
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,503
Knowing that,
effective immediately,

500
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:09,474
I will be suspending
my campaign

501
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:14,012
and throwing my full support
behind Ruvé Adams.

502
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,714
Now I would like
to take a moment

503
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:17,415
to thank all
of my supporters

504
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:20,885
for all of your hard work.

505
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:24,889
What you've done
will not be forgotten.

506
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:26,424
Thank you.

507
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,043
New numbers are out.

508
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,445
You're leading
by 16 points.

509
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,048
Alex, I'm sorry.

510
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,351
I know that you put your heart and soul
into this campaign, and--

511
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:53,222
And your days of speech-making
are now behind you.

512
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:56,993
Look, man. I don't
want sorry.

513
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,196
I just want
an explanation.

514
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,031
That's why I'm sorry.

515
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,348
Sucks when you can't
tell the truth.

516
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,484
Samantha told me
about her ultimatum.

517
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:25,321
I just figured that eventually
she'd trust me.

518
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,091
Yeah. You'd work your
Oliver Queen charm.

519
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,093
I didn't want to be
a part of William's life

520
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,696
without the opportunity
for you to be a part of his life.

521
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,832
John's made it
pretty clear that, uh,

522
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,333
I should have made
more of an effort

523
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,369
to be a part
of William's life

524
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,304
and that the best way
to keep him safe

525
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,506
would have been
to keep him close,

526
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,607
even with
all of this.

527
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,680
Your resignation's
all over the news.

528
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,848
Have you heard
from Darhk?

529
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,882
Not yet.

530
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:58,654
Speak of the devil
literally.

531
00:25:58,656 --> 00:26:01,324
It's not Darhk.
It's Mari.

532
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,692
She has something.

533
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,295
I e-mailed
Captain Lance's drawing

534
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:07,864
of Darhk's idol to a friend of mine
at Detroit University.

535
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,499
And did he
recognize it?

536
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,335
It's a Khushu idol,
very rare, very powerful,

537
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,303
but its power requires
a constant connection

538
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,672
to one of the earth's
Ley lines.

539
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:19,041
I never thought
I'd say this, but huh?

540
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:22,745
Ok. Think Wi-Fi
for magic,

541
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,181
and the idol is
his Internet connection.

542
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,417
If Professor Macalester's
theory is correct

543
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,718
and this map is accurate--

544
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,952
Then Darhk must be
holed up near one

545
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:31,687
of these Ley lines

546
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,156
in order for him to get
the strongest signal.

547
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,557
I'll start cross-referencing
all the locations

548
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,925
that we've
encountered Darhk.

549
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,360
And you pulled out
of the race.

550
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,628
Why isn't this man
giving me my son back?

551
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,596
He will, and everything
will be fine.

552
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,533
You keep saying that,
but it hasn't been yet.

553
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,180
You're doing everything you
possibly can.

554
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,048
You can't beat
yourself up about it.

555
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,451
Well, you don't know
me very well, do you?

556
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:08,224
Just before Christmas,
Darhk took Thea, Felicity, John,

557
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,692
held them captive.

558
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,728
We agreed that I would
trade myself for them.

559
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,531
I did,

560
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,235
and Darhk did not live up
to his end of the bargain.

561
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,306
So you're worried
that's playing itself out again now.

562
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,008
We're gonna get
William back, Oliver,

563
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,743
but when we do,

564
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:30,279
I think you should
consider that...

565
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:37,119
Maybe letting him go
isn't such a bad thing.

566
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:38,955
What do you mean?

567
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:43,926
Well, I heard what you told Felicity
about keeping him close.

568
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,795
Owl ears.

569
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,631
Uh, I never knew
my real parents.

570
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,733
I grew up
in foster home,

571
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,769
and my whole life,
I wondered,

572
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:56,405
"Who am I?
Where did I come from?

573
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,341
Why didn't my
real parents want me?"

574
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,344
A boy should know
who his father is.

575
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,146
He should,
and he will

576
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,349
but knowing what
William's going through right now,

577
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,651
I realize that I wasn't
ready for the answers.

578
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,388
Learning about
my heritage, my powers,

579
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,259
the evil my mother fled our homeland
to protect me from,

580
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,161
no child should have
to carry that burden.

581
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:20,796
I mean, look around you.

582
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,536
Oliver, the best gift
you can give him is his childhood.

583
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,471
Keep him as far away
from your world

584
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,873
for as long as possible.

585
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:37,013
I can't imagine
a greater sacrifice.

586
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,848
Isn't that what
parenthood is?

587
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,787
Hey, guys.

588
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,389
I think we
found something.

589
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,793
Darhk moves his idol around,
which makes sense, but--

590
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,161
It makes him
a whole lot harder to track.

591
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:53,696
Right,
but after referencing

592
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,131
a buttload of satellite feeds,
thermal imaging data,

593
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,233
and the Ley line map,
I think dark is located

594
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,437
out on a compound
in Sky woods.

595
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,838
Hello?

596
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,241
Very good speech.
You look great on television.

597
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,909
Nelson Plaza,
3 hours.

598
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,678
William
will be there.

599
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:12,748
Darhk says he's gonna
release William

600
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,083
3 hours from now
at Nelson Plaza.

601
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,585
There's no
guarantee with Darhk.

602
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,752
This could be
a trap.

603
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,220
And now we have a chance
to take out

604
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:19,755
his power idol thingy.

605
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,657
Ollie, without his magic,
he won't be able

606
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,192
to do this to anybody
ever again.

607
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,861
It--it will be game over.

608
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:28,064
Samantha...

609
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,198
He's your son.

610
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,334
It is your call.

611
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,402
He's your son, too,
Oliver.

612
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,207
Get him back

613
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,410
and take this
son of a bitch Darhk out.

614
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,384
I count 17 Ghosts.

615
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,119
Copy. Black Canary?

616
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:58,420
Ready.

617
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,588
- Spartan?
- I'm set.

618
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,356
Let's do this.

619
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,500
Vixen, you're up.

620
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,509
I'm guessing your insurance
won't pay for that.

621
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:22,678
Cute. Bye-bye.

622
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:26,949
When you're dead,
I'll make sure that totem

623
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,717
gets put
to better use.

624
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:34,656
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

625
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:43,699
Well, that happened.

626
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,072
Speedy, Canary,
I can't get a clear shot.

627
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:51,106
Where are you?

628
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:52,341
On our way.

629
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,199
You find William.

630
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:18,634
I'll take care
of Darhk.

631
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:22,204
I'm sorry. I can't
hear you with your throats

632
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:23,572
closing up like that.

633
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:25,173
Steady.

634
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:28,010
I've got the totem.
Has it had any effect?

635
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,478
Separating it
from Darhk didn't do anything.

636
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,913
Go to plan "B."

637
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:32,247
What's plan "B"?

638
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,869
Heh heh heh.

639
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,747
Please
don't hurt them.

640
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,591
Aah!

641
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,125
Get out of here!

642
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,822
Mom!

643
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:15,280
William!

644
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,166
Ohh!

645
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:19,491
Medics checked him out.

646
00:33:19,493 --> 00:33:21,660
He's in perfect health.

647
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:23,528
Oh, thank goodness.

648
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,632
There's someone here that
you must have missed.

649
00:33:27,634 --> 00:33:28,867
What's wrong?

650
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,635
I'm kind of
over the Flash.

651
00:33:30,637 --> 00:33:32,904
I want a Green Arrow
action figure.

652
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,711
Well, the Green Arrow is
pretty amazing.

653
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:43,048
I will let
you guys get reacquainted.

654
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,349
Hey.

655
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:45,684
Is everything ok?

656
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:46,918
Detectives questioned
William while the docs

657
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,687
were checking him out.

658
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,655
Darhk didn't take him.

659
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:52,357
It was a guy
with a missing hand.

660
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:03,401
You son of a bitch!

661
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:05,837
I assure you, Mr. Queen,
I had all the faith

662
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,539
in the world that
you would survive.

663
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,174
Huh? Well, what
about everybody else?

664
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:11,877
You are
my only concern.

665
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,914
We've gotten this
far because of you.

666
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:19,217
Let's finish it.
You, too, Miss Venediktov.

667
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:22,354
Mr. Queen seems to behave at his best
when you're around.

668
00:34:47,614 --> 00:34:49,548
Is William gonna
be ok?

669
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,051
Yeah. He's
a tough one.

670
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:54,419
Just like his dad.

671
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:58,757
Heh. Could not have
done this without you.

672
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:00,592
Thank you.

673
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:03,061
Anytime.

674
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,963
Have you thought
anymore about what I said?

675
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:07,098
I--I just got him back.

676
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,401
Let me just say for
all the frustrations

677
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:12,837
I have about my real
parents giving me up,

678
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,106
I am so grateful
I was raised in a situation

679
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:18,076
where that was
my biggest issue in life.

680
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:21,846
Best things my parents
ever gave me was that freedom.

681
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:25,116
That and this totem,
that makes me a total badass.

682
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,154
You don't need
a totem for that.

683
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:31,489
You're damn right
I don't.

684
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,391
Take care
of yourself, Oliver.

685
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:35,460
I'm just
a phone call away.

686
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:38,830
Me, too, Mari.
Me, too.

687
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:51,443
I heard you found
the boy.

688
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:52,744
You can't believe
how relieved I am.

689
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:54,179
- Cut the crap!
- Excuse me?

690
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,448
I know it was you.

691
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,617
You took him
out of spite!

692
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,452
For us. You have to
believe me

693
00:36:00,454 --> 00:36:01,820
I did it for us.

694
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:04,422
You--you purposely--
you put him in danger.

695
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:06,358
How--

696
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,093
you know what?

697
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:10,462
I'm not doing this
anymore.

698
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:12,964
This song-and-dance
where you come over to my apartment

699
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,166
and you whisper
your lies,

700
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:17,569
it is over!

701
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,804
Thea, I did it
to protect us.

702
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,973
Shut up. How could
you possibly think

703
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,775
that there was
an us to protect?

704
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:27,078
You know, sometimes,
I lay awake at night,

705
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,148
and I wonder what Robert would think
about our relationship.

706
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,452
He raised me,
he loved me,

707
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:38,023
and I threw that all away the moment
I became your daughter.

708
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:42,193
Yes. Yes, you did,
and it was your choice.

709
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:44,262
And I wish I never did.

710
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:46,731
Don't you dare speak
to me like that.

711
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:52,470
You would be dead
10 times over if not for me.

712
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:54,639
I taught you
how to fight,

713
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,007
how to be strong.

714
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:58,076
I turned you from
a delicate, spoiled brat

715
00:36:58,078 --> 00:36:59,878
into a warrior,

716
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,047
and all I've ever gotten
from you in return

717
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:04,449
is your
venomous spite!

718
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:06,384
For a very good
reason!

719
00:37:06,386 --> 00:37:08,520
You have no idea
what you are up against.

720
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:11,323
You are incapable
of seeing the bigger picture,

721
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:13,992
but I can,

722
00:37:13,994 --> 00:37:16,961
and I would rather
you hate me and be alive

723
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:19,831
than love me
and be dead.

724
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:25,970
Hi, William.

725
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:33,745
I hope you're well,
and I hope you're safe.

726
00:37:33,747 --> 00:37:37,682
There's something that I--
I want to tell you.

727
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:40,218
I wanted to
tell you before,

728
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,653
but...

729
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:45,657
But this is better.

730
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:55,767
I'm your father
biologically, that is.

731
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:59,971
As far as really being
your father goes,

732
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:02,273
I haven't earned that yet.

733
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:06,378
A father should be there
for his child every day

734
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,847
no matter what
to make sure

735
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,751
that they feel loved,
that they feel safe,

736
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:15,587
and a child should be able
to rely on their father

737
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:22,894
and go to him for--
for guidance and reassurance.

738
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:25,296
I have failed
to do that for you...

739
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:31,803
And now I'm--I'm gonna
tell you why.

740
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,609
I'm the Green Arrow,

741
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:39,077
and my life is
very dangerous,

742
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,813
which is why...

743
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:49,421
We decided to keep you
out of it for all these years.

744
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:52,590
What happened to you
in Star City,

745
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:56,628
that was my fault,

746
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,599
and I can't allow anything
like that to happen ever again,

747
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:05,537
and that's why I've asked
your mother to

748
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:09,941
move you far away

749
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:14,212
and to not tell anyone
where she's taking you,

750
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:18,750
including me.

751
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:24,656
It's also why I asked her
to wait to show you this message

752
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:26,591
until after your 18th birthday.

753
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,633
I wanted to give you
a real childhood.

754
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:37,702
I wanted to give you that gift.

755
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:44,509
Good-bye, Son.

756
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:48,613
I sure hope
it's not forever.

757
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:59,924
How much of that
did you hear?

758
00:39:59,926 --> 00:40:01,259
Enough.

759
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,529
Oliver, we need
to talk.

760
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:07,799
About a number
of things, I suspect.

761
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:13,505
Let's start with...

762
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:21,212
I can't do this.

763
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:22,413
When your son
was in danger,

764
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:24,782
I had to table
what I was feeling

765
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:26,518
about everything,

766
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,521
but now that I've
had some space,

767
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:31,723
I realize
I need space.

768
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:32,579
Felicity.

769
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:34,460
I know the position

770
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:35,660
Samantha put you in,

771
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:37,962
I know it was
an impossible decision,

772
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:39,864
but you were right.

773
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:43,501
You should have
told me.

774
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:46,838
Marriage is
about inclusion.

775
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,042
It's about leaning
on your partner

776
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:53,578
when things get
complicated.

777
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:58,750
I don't think that
you know how to do that.

778
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:04,622
I'm--I'm trying.

779
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:06,925
And now you're
sending William away,

780
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,594
and I understand why.

781
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:11,229
You know that I do,

782
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,065
but once again, you have left me out
of the decision.

783
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,369
Felicity?

784
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:31,115
Oh, my God.

785
00:41:54,963 --> 00:42:01,463
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

786
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:22,897
Greg!
Move your head.
