00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,056
I've gotten good
at picking out the types.

163
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,891
Types just like you.

164
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,194
If I'm angry,
it's because I'm dealing

165
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,445
with someone who's
willing to lie to a D.A.

166
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,063
to protect a punk kid.

167
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,732
I don't think
that's the case.

168
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,318
Either way,

169
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,121
if you do have something
you want to work off...

170
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,726
So what's the play
with Thea?

171
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,095
Do you mind if I talk
to her alone first?

172
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,347
It's been a while.

Felicity able
to pin her down?

174
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,568
She gave me an address.

175
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,286
Thea!

176
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,590
Señor.

177
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,925
Cómo puedo ayudarlo?

178
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,710
Estoy buscando
a mi hermana.

179
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:52,296
You must be Mia's brother.

180
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,048
I see the resemblance.

181
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,633
Is "Mia" around?

182
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,018
She works. At the cafe.

183
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,103
Where's the cafe?

184
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,222
- I'll show you.

[Exhales]

186
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,984
I didn't come all the way
to South America

00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,903
to have you poison me, did I?

[Laughs]

189
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,074
It's a meditative tea.

190
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:23,794
It will activate
your mind and body.

191
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,881
I think I'm going to need
a little bit more than tea

192
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:29,300
to learn how
to use one of those.

193
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,586
The Sohei Buddhist
warriors believed that

194
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,172
first you fight
with the mind...

195
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,508
then your sword.

196
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,929
I remember when
I was training

197
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,480
to be a warrior.

198
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,982

devastated
by my wife's death.

200
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,603
I was... angry,

201
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,772
and hurt.

202
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,527
The pain
was unbearable.

203
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,538
Like this.

204
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,293
You're out of your mind!
Put your hand in here!

205
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:15,763
Every warrior must learn
the simple truth--

206
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,514
that pain
is inevitable,

207
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,384
and suffering
is optional.

00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,057
Wait, Shaw. What makes
you so important?

322
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,592
I have hard intel.

323
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:51,060
Someone from Corto Maltese
hacked into the server

324
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,596
and acquired
the A.R.G.U.S. actual.

325
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,014
They want to sell it.

326
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,482
Did I mention I don't
work for A.R.G.U.S.?

327
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,568
The actual is an encrypted
data omnibus.

328
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,153
It's a complete record
of agent covers,

329
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:01,605
personal details,
affiliated soft targets--

330
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:05,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa, soft targets...
As in family members?

331
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:08,028
Yeah, as in women
and children.

332
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,915
You get why
this is so important?

333
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,426
Hi, my name is Laurel,
I'm an alcoholic.

334
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,094
All: Hi, Laurel.

335
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:19,347
A week ago, I...

336
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:22,400
Something happened.

337
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:25,937
Something that
I can't share with anyone

338
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:30,108
for several
complicated reasons.

339
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:36,614
I thought that I was going
to want to drink...

340
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,833
But I didn't.

341
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,418
Not even tempted,
really.

[Inhales and exhales]

343
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,807
But what I am is...

344
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,877
Is I'm angry.

345
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,012
And I don't know
what to do with it

346
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:54,532
or--or where to put
it. I just...

347
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:02,974
Thank you for
letting me share.

348
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:07,145
Are there any other
burning desires?

349
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:13,084
Erica. Alcoholic.

350
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,235
All: Hi, Erica.

351
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,037
My boyfriend and me

352
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,639
got into another
fight last night.

353
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,992
Some of you know,
he still drinks, a lot.

354
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:23,161
And I said something.

355
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:28,216
I know I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

356
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:33,688
I know I should
just leave him, but... I can't.

357
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,140
Maybe there's a meeting

358
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:36,808
I should be
going to for that.

359
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,011
Laurel: Once a month, Erica
gives a share like that

360
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,596
- and it's getting worse.
- Quentin: Yeah.

361
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:43,064
Do you know
the boyfriend has

362
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,432
eight assault charges
against him?

363
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:45,767
And not just
in Starling.

364
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,985
He's got warrants
out on him

365
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,570
as far off
as Coast City.

366
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:50,071
And it takes everything in me
not to go after

367
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,656
a dirtbag like that,
but the day the cops

368
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,575
start bringing their badges
into AA meetings,

369
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:56,494
that's the day that
the drunks stop coming.

I'm in position.

371
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:06,538
The sale of the actual
is going down here.

372
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,341
Only two of us. You sure you don't
want to call for back up?

373
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,544
Hey.

374
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,796
That's the only insurance
policy you're going to need.

375
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,218
They're here.

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,524
You're not worried about them
seeing our ride?

377
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,161
How'd you know the buy
was happening tonight?

378
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:34,364
I've been a station agent
in Corto Maltese for three years now.

379
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,035
I got this third-world
garbage dump wired.

What's wrong?

381

There's no buy,
is there, Shaw?

Sorry for lyin' to you,
John. Well, partially lyin'.

384
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,684
There is a buy going down,
just not till tomorrow.

385
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,603
I needed to get this first.

386

Thanks for helping me
decode the actual.

[Grunting]

394

Oliver said you weren't
going to come back, so...

395
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,303
I figured I'd come here
and try to convince you to.

396
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,638
Well, you can't.

397
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,006
Look, I get it, you're hurt.

398
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:05,175
I lied to you,
I lied right to your face.

399
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,938
But I--I need you to know
that when I said

400
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,679
I wanted to leave
Starling with you,

401
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,263
that wasn't a lie.

402
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,550
I didn't just leave
because of you, Roy.

403
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:16,720
My mother lied to me,

405
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:22,809
I had to get away from Starling City
and all the secrets.

406
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:25,812
And I found
myself here.

Isn't it lonely here?

408

That's kind of what
I like about it.

409
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:34,154
There's no one here
who knows me

410
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:37,656
or thinks of me
as Thea Queen

or Thea Merlyn.

No one who lies
to me, or...

tries to protect me
with secrets.

414

All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Thea.

in the way of that.

We got cut off.

480
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,661
According to the file
you sent me,

481
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,713
this guy is somewhat
of a hacker.

482
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,899
Let me guess--long story?

483
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:51,051
Yeah, the guy I'm looking for broke
into A.R.G.U.S's system.

484
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,936
And he left a trail.
It's faint--hacking-wise--

485
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,689
but with a little bit
of luck, I will find him,

486
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:58,942
or his laptop. I will email
you when I have something.

487
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:01,578
I'm having
a bit of a day.

488
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,114
I need you to help me find someone
by googling his phone or something.

489
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:06,083
Pinging his GPS.

490
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,952
Can I call you back?

491
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:11,088
Is this what a typical day
looks like for you?

492
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,725
Believe it or not, this is
better than most.

493
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:17,211
When Felicity has Shaw's location,
I want you to text me and I'll be there.

494
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:19,763
- Thea?
- Yeah.

495
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:21,265
Oliver, I don't
think she's going

496
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:22,966
to change her mind on this.
She doesn't want

497
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,218
to hear from anyone,
and I don't blame her.

498
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,770
I mean, we both
lied to her. A lot.

499
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,772
I know, it's why it's time
to tell her the truth.

500
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,390
Oliver, when you say
"the truth"...

501
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,226
What happened
the five years I was away,

502
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:33,777
everything we've done since
I've been back,

503
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,862
all of it.

504
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:37,397
Well, you might want
to think about that for a second.

505
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:38,782
Lies are what drove Thea
away from Starling City

506
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:40,617
in the first place.

507
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,986
The truth is the only thing
that's going to bring her back.

508
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,122
Except you won't be
telling her the truth, will you?

509
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:47,958
You'll be telling her that her brother
has been lying to her to her face,

510
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,327
with almost
pathological sincerity

511
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,712
for the past two years.

512
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:53,997
She won't believe
another word you say.

513
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:56,166
And you will lose her,
Oliver, forever.

514
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:59,720
Well, look around.

515
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:02,055
I've already
lost her.

516
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:04,641
I don't have
any other choice.

517
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,611
I hear you like
to hit women.

518
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:26,780
How about one
who likes to hit back?

I'm so sorry.

I'm too relieved to be mad at you,
I really am.

527
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:10,805
But, sweetheart...

528
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:13,040
This is crazy.

What the hell
were you thinking

530
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,544
going after that
girl's boyfriend?

531
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:19,363
There's just something
I needed to work out.

532
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,450
I know that the world
isn't fair.

533
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:26,237
I know that it's
a terrible place where...

where people deserve
to get punished.

I needed the world

What's going on

You're not being
yourself lately.

And now you're
running around,

543
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:53,097
you're tuning this guy up.
What are you doin'?!

544
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,149
Baby, you can talk to me about
anything. You know that, right?

00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:57,184
You know that.

546
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,770
I know.

547
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,826
Talk to me, then.

You promise me you'll never
do anything like this again, ever!

552
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,969
I promise.

553
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:35,940
It was a mistake;
I wasn't thinking.

554
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,736
If you want to stay
in Corto Maltese, it's fine,

555
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,789
but there's not much
here in the way of sightseeing.

556
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,407
I need to talk to you.

Look, between you
and your new best friend Roy,

558
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,561
I'm pretty sure you guys have
said everything.

559

I haven't.

Roy showed me
the note you left him.

563
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,791
And you were right
about everything.

564
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,827
I have lied,
I have kept secrets.

565
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,380
The truth is that

566
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,498
if I tell you...

567
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,168
All the things that you don't
know about me,

568
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,504
that I might
lose you forever.

569
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,891
I spent five years
in the worst kind of hell,

570
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:30,844
and there were
things that happened,

571
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:35,766
there were things
that I did...

572
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:37,484
That if--

573
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,686
if you knew,

574
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,772
you would see me
differently.

575
00:28:41,774 --> 00:28:45,492
No, I'll always
see you as my big brother.

576
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,911
I mean, no matter
what happened

577
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:51,999
to you on that island,
or who you became,

578
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:56,670
it's the secrets you kept
about my own life.

579
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,792
I mean, you lied to me

580
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:04,795
about who my father was.

581
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:12,352
Malcolm may have
been your blood.

582
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:15,055
Robert was
your father.

583
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:21,812
I lied to you
about him, too.

584
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:25,065
Dad wasn't the man
we thought he was.

585
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,951
He was better.

586
00:29:27,953 --> 00:29:31,788
And I've kept something from you
because I just...

587
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:37,044
Never wanted you
to know.

588
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:42,382
Dad made it off
"The Gambit" with me.

589
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,585
You told me he drowned.

590
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:49,172
We made it to
a life boat together.

591
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:52,426
There wasn't enough
food and water for both of us...

592
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,730
So he killed
himself.

593
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:03,437
And that is one secret
that I'm telling you now

594
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:06,740
because I need you
to realize...

595
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:10,077
mom and dad,

596
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,913
they sacrificed
themselves

597
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:15,449
so that
we could live.

598
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:19,202
But if we're not
together, then...

599

we're not even
really alive.

don't need me...

638
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:23,886
Tell Waller I died.

639
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,955
Tell her you put
a bullet in me.

640
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:32,261
If only.

641
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:34,029
Thea: I've been thinking.

642
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,883
I want to go home.
To my brother.

643
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:39,752
And all his lies
and secrets?

644
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:42,004
Maybe you haven't come
as far as I thought.

645
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:44,039
Let me prove it to you.

646
00:34:47,745 --> 00:34:50,262
[Both grunting]

647
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:08,914
Impressive.

648
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:11,033
[Both grunting]

649
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,286
I had a good teacher.

650
00:35:18,793 --> 00:35:21,927
[Laughs]

651
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,096
Looks like
you're going home.

652
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:26,465
[Both breathing heavily]

653
00:35:33,774 --> 00:35:36,392
You let me win,
didn't you?

654
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,944
I'll be seeing you soon.

655
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:40,980
Safe flight.

656
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:53,992
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

657
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,797
You ok?

658
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:04,719
She's not coming.

659
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,725
I'm sorry, Oliver.
You did everything you could, man.

660
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:15,163
Oliver...

661
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,107
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

662
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,577
Still not sure about flying
commercial, though.

663
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:32,580
Oh!
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

664
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:38,703
Thea,
are you ok?

665
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:41,589
Yeah. I'm fine.

666
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,620
Laurel?

667
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:57,742
I didn't know the Arrow
took vacations.

668
00:36:57,744 --> 00:36:59,760
Hey! What happened?

669
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:01,229
I'm fine. Please.

670
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,848
What happened?

671
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,734
I tried to do good.

672
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:08,686
It didn't work out.

673
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,071
Oh, Laurel.

674
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:13,908
I know that
it probably sounds insane.

675
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,078
It probably is, but...

676
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:20,448
Sara.

677
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,000
She gave me this.

678
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:24,285
And when I wear it,
it makes me want

679
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:27,171
to help people
like she did.

680
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:29,207
Like she's alive again.

681
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:31,209
I get it.

682
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:35,630
Sara had training.

683
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,265
She had years--

684
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,434
Oliver, I know.

685
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:43,221
Which is why
I need to start,

686
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,473
and I need
your help.

687
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:47,441
[Sighs]

688
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,063
No.

689
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:54,649
Oliver!

690
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:55,950
No!

691
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:58,286
No.

692
00:37:58,288 --> 00:38:00,621
I...

693
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,876
I want you
to consider

694
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:09,213
what would happen
to your father

695
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,832
if something
happened to you.

696
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,719
Oliver, ever since
it happened,

697
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,721
I have had this fire
inside of me

698
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:20,091
that I can't get rid of
with booze or pills.

699
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:21,726
I need another way!

700
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,979
And the other night,
even though it went wrong

701
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,681
it was the first time
since Sara died

702
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:28,532
where I haven't felt that fire.

703
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:31,168
I'm sorry,
but I can't.

704
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:35,523
And even if I could,

705
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:38,659
Sara would never
forgive me.

706
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,929
Yeah.

707
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,303
Hey.

708
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,555
Love you.
I love you both.

709
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,807
The two of you
were all I could think about.

710
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:15,980
I'm just trying
to put her down.

711
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:19,317
That's ok, I just
want to look at her for a while.

712
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,485
Ok.

713
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:23,954
I have to head
into the office.

714
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:25,573
So late?

715
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,459
I do whatever Amanda Waller
asks, remember?

716
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:35,716
You ok?

717
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:40,137
Yeah.
Just hurry back.

718
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,058
What's with this guy?

719
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,228
Outstanding warrants
for assault and battery in Coast City.

720
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,181
Got an anonymous tip
that he was in Starling.

721
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:52,817
Anonymous tip, huh?

722
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:56,153
That's a bad break,
buddy.

723
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:15,539
All right.
When can I start?

724
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,713
Do you know how many
of QC's techs

725
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:25,633
said this data
was unrecoverable?

726
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,551
Only all of them.

727
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:32,623
Seems like this would be a good time
to ask for a few days off, then.

728
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,024
[Scoffs] You
just started.

729
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:37,061
I know. But... my friend
was struck by lightning

730
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,979
and is in a coma, so...

731
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,282
Well, was.

732
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:43,951
I don't know. Um, it's--

733
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:45,403
A long story.

734
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:48,622
See ya.

735
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:50,791
Thanks.

736
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,487
You did good
over there.

737
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:22,189
I had a good teacher.

738
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,493
A judgmental, occasionally
temperamental one, but...

739
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:28,579
Those are
the best kind.

740

[Chuckles]

741
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,752
Did Thea seem...
different to you?

742
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:36,420
Her hair's a lot shorter.

743
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:39,273
But that's not what you mean.

744
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,708
What do you mean?

745
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,426
I don't know.

746
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:44,628
She say anything?

747
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,880
She may be...

748
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:48,682
seeing somebody in
Corto Maltese, or...

749
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:51,435
If Thea was with anybody else,
I've got a feeling

750
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:52,803
I'd be the last one to know.

[Footsteps]

752
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:57,775
Where is she?

753
00:41:57,777 --> 00:41:59,360
Where is Sara?
