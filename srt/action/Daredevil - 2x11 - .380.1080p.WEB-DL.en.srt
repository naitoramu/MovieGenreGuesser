1
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,197
Now, watch out.

2
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,782
One of them killed his father
with a scalpel.

3
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,743
I don't know about the rest,
but don't take any chances.

4
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:56,906
We just need to quarantine them
until the cops can...

5
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:58,329
- Claire...
- Oh, my God!

6
00:00:58,413 --> 00:00:59,497
What the hell?

7
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:11,342
Temple!

8
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,761
No! Louisa!

9
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:03,621
Don't let him
take us back down there.

10
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:37,674
So, there's this...

11
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:39,551
organization.

12
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:43,304
Its members believe in some pretty...
strange shit.

13
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:46,349
And they have deep pockets,

14
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,268
even deeper connections
all over Hell's Kitchen.

15
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:52,688
- Like a cult?
- It's kinda hard to explain.

16
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,441
They call themselves the Hand.
Nobu's one of them.

17
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:58,027
Those killers who attacked us,
I think they work for him.

18
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,862
Why did they want those patients back?

19
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:01,864
Honestly, I don't know.

20
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:09,289
That candle
that you're burning at both ends?

21
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,499
Sooner or later, it's gonna fizzle out.

22
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,501
I'm fine. Really.

23
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:19,756
You know the problem with martyrs?

24
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,301
The good ones end up dead.

25
00:05:22,385 --> 00:05:25,097
You know, it's... it's one thing
to try to take on the mob,

26
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:28,307
or to block some shady real estate deal.

27
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,392
But this stuff?

28
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,477
- Those people just killed your friend.
- I know!

29
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:34,230
I can't just let that happen, Claire.
Not in my city.

30
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,732
It's not your city anymore!

31
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:38,943
Matt, admit...

32
00:05:39,027 --> 00:05:41,403
you're in over your head.

33
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,448
There's no shame in that.

34
00:05:47,785 --> 00:05:49,287
Yeah?

35
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,414
When? Oh...

36
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,501
I'll be right down.
Thanks.

37
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,588
Hey, I gotta go.
It's important.

38
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,260
Okay.

39
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,304
Really am sorry.

40
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,225
So am I.

41
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,908
We're almost done.

42
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,203
Thanks.

43
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:33,373
Just want to go over your statement
one more time.

44
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:36,917
You're sure you didn't see anything
unusual outside your apartment?

45
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,169
Not that I remember.

46
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,254
And the man who blindsided
the two officers,

47
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:42,631
you couldn't tell if it was Castle?

48
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:43,883
Like I said in my statement,

49
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:47,220
when the shooting began,
I hit the decks and stayed there.

50
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:48,720
I didn't see anything.

51
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:51,974
Smart.
Powell, I think we're good.

52
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,436
Go ahead and pull your car around.

53
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:02,443
Are you okay?

54
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,321
It's been a long night.

55
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:07,573
Have there been any developments?

56
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:10,201
Besides making sure Castle's face
is plastered across

57
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,244
every TV channel and newspaper?

58
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,914
The DA and the medical examiner are dead,

59
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:18,167
the same asshole takes a shot at you,

60
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:21,962
and so far nobody in this entire city's
seen a damn thing.

61
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:23,422
I'm...

62
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:28,052
I'm sorry.
That wasn't, uh, very professional.

63
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:31,138
Mmm. Like you said,
it's been a long night.

64
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,681
We'll nail him.

65
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:36,393
Until then, I'm just glad you agreed
to accept police protection.

66
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,688
I appreciate the offer.

67
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,273
All right, the car's outside.

68
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:44,025
Powell and Reed
will escort you to a safe location.

69
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,864
We'll keep someone posted outside, 24/7.

70
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:48,989
Right.

71
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:52,285
If you remember anything, anything...

72
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,078
you know where to find me.

73
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:18,059
Sorry, he's, uh...

74
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:19,811
Can you give me a minute?

75
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:20,897
Thanks.

76
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,650
- Matt.
- Karen.

77
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,109
What are you doing here?

78
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,986
Brett reached out.
Someone shot at you?

79
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:30,114
Yeah, it's... it's okay.
I'm fine.

80
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:32,783
Why didn't you call me?

81
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:33,950
Would you have answered?

82
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,964
Look, Matt, I know that you mean well,
but I can take care of myself.

83
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,916
No, you can't, Karen.

84
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,377
Not if Frank Castle wants you dead.
No one can.

85
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,300
You're right! You're right!
Castle's dangerous,

86
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:46,380
and maybe I can't handle this,
but I don't want your help.

87
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:48,504
What's going on with you?
What are you holding back?

88
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,848
Frank didn't do this, okay?

89
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,683
Matter of fact, he saved me.

90
00:08:58,643 --> 00:08:59,811
What?

91
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:05,358
He was at my apartment last night.

92
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,609
And if he hadn't been watching the place,
I'd be dead.

93
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:09,446
Except the cops have it all wrong.

94
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,447
Frank didn't kill Reyes.

95
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:13,657
But whoever did knew
that Frank would take the blame,

96
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,326
and what do you know,
every cop in New York City

97
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:16,994
wants Punisher's head on a stick.

98
00:09:18,995 --> 00:09:21,332
You told this to the police?

99
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,500
- No.
- Great! Lying to the cops. Smart, Karen.

100
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,545
But that's my problem, not yours.

101
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:27,629
Frank thinks he can find this guy
faster than the NYPD,

102
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,632
and, honestly, I agree with him.

103
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:34,762
He saved my life and he asked me for time.
I... I owe him that much.

104
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:38,932
Not saying I'm going along with this,
but if Castle's not the shooter, who is?

105
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:43,562
Everything points back
to the Central Park sting.

106
00:09:43,646 --> 00:09:46,441
That's where everything fell apart.
What Reyes mentioned.

107
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:50,027
- This Blacksmith?
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

108
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,653
Frank has a source in prison.

109
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,338
Turns out the DA was right,
that the Blacksmith arranged the meet.

110
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:57,075
Why would the Blacksmith
come after you?

111
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:59,780
<i>I've been working with
Ellison at the Bulletin.</i>

112
00:10:01,499 --> 00:10:03,542
Yep. Yeah, that'll be it.

113
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,718
- When... when, when did this start?
- Ever since the trial.

114
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,298
When I was trying to find evidence
for the Castle case.

115
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:11,095
We were looking into
the Central Park shootings,

116
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,635
and I guess we're getting too close.

117
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,801
- Then you need to back off.
- No, Matt. You need to back off!

118
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,676
This is not a game, Karen.
This is dangerous.

119
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:19,431
Right, well, so was working
at Nelson and Murdock. I...

120
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:26,104
The cops have offered me protection
and I'm... I'm taking it.

121
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:28,441
So you don't have to worry.
I'm... I'm fine.

122
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,610
Look, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

123
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:34,071
- I'm gonna come with you...
- No! Matt, I'm...

124
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,907
I'm not yours to protect.

125
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:51,547
Room's been checked, it's clear.

126
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,800
You need anything, anything at all,
we'll be just outside.

127
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:57,052
Okay, thanks.
What I need is about 12 hours' sleep.

128
00:11:49,146 --> 00:11:51,231
You said you'd bring a car,
not steal mine.

129
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,774
It's a good song.

130
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,027
We used to sing along to that.

131
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,154
Imagine me doing that.

132
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:02,576
I inherited the tapes with the car.

133
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,080
Hey...

134
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,128
Look, maybe you don't wanna be here, mmm?

135
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,630
Gotta say, I'm having second thoughts.

136
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:17,383
I'm not a lawyer.

137
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:20,051
I'm not protected
by attorney-client privilege.

138
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,937
Lying to the cops,
that makes me an accessory.

139
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:24,098
Okay.

140
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,933
So, walk away. Go.

141
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:35,442
Blacksmith already tried to get me once.

142
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:37,653
I really don't wanna give him
a second chance.

143
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:44,325
He's not gonna get it.

144
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,880
Hello, Mr. Nelson.
You decent?

145
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:03,470
Oh, boo.
I was hoping to catch an eyeful.

146
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,639
No such luck.

147
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,224
It's a Foggy Bear.

148
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,810
Calm down, I also brought you this.

149
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,940
There's a, uh,
lot of extra security out there.

150
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:15,023
Oh.

151
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,817
Anything going on I should know about?

152
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:18,985
Um, I don't know.

153
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,071
I heard a hell of a lot
of noise last night.

154
00:13:21,154 --> 00:13:22,949
You didn't see Matt on the way in,
did you?

155
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:24,407
Sorry.

156
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,994
So, how are you, really?

157
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,245
Peachy.

158
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,050
I'm in the hospital with a hole in my arm
and Nelson-Murdock's kaput.

159
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:33,334
They say it comes in threes.

160
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,793
Next you're gonna tell me
Josie's burnt down.

161
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,838
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

162
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:40,675
But actually, I'm here...

163
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:42,759
to present you with a new opportunity.

164
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:44,345
People around town
have been talking about you.

165
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:46,973
About how I blew
the trial of the century?

166
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,431
Give yourself more credit.

167
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:51,101
Your opening statement
set the tone for the trial.

168
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,811
Which, if Castle hadn't been
such a lunatic,

169
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:53,937
you might've actually won.

170
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:56,608
Some are saying it was... impressive.

171
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:59,902
I lost the case.
My firm imploded.

172
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,946
And now you're a free agent.

173
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:05,199
You can finally be your own man.

174
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:10,120
What you might consider a failure
could actually be something else.

175
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,412
A new beginning.

176
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:16,042
I knew you were gonna be
sensitive about this.

177
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:17,670
That's what I like about you.

178
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:23,843
I'm just asking if it would be okay,
in the near future,

179
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,637
for me to set up a meeting.

180
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,805
Where?

181
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:30,140
All in time.

182
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:32,059
I need to float your name first.

183
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:35,146
And here I was thinking you were gonna
take advantage of me in my fragile state.

184
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:37,313
No, Franklin.

185
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,652
Not yet.

186
00:14:44,238 --> 00:14:46,782
You've already gone
above and beyond.

187
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:52,622
This has been a very traumatic day.
You sure you wanna be down here?

188
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:56,374
Ms. Temple, we get that
NYPD paperwork finished?

189
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:57,459
Yeah.

190
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:01,172
Did you mention the part
where you unethically and unilaterally

191
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,550
brought those five patients
into this hospital?

192
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,008
Whoa, easy.

193
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,803
With all due respect,
we just lost one of our own.

194
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,220
And whose fault was that?

195
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,767
The board is gonna have
a goddamn field day with this.

196
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,143
All right, stay put.

197
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,104
There's no way
he can put all this on you.

198
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,315
He'll try.

199
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:22,401
I broke the rules.

200
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,903
He came after you, Claire.
What choice did you have?

201
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,656
I'm a nurse.

202
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,075
Took an oath to save people,
not kill them.

203
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:32,787
It was you or him,
and you saved yourself.

204
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:36,624
Male. Height, 5'10".

205
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:39,460
Approximate age, 30, 35 years.

206
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:42,171
Weight, 185...

207
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,465
- What the hell?
- What is that?

208
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:49,177
- This scar, it looks like it's from...
- An autopsy.

209
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,973
That's not possible.

210
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:54,515
I've seen enough dead bodies
to know what a Y-incision looks like.

211
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,518
He was cut evenly.
Precisely.

212
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,229
That's where they spread open
the body cavity

213
00:15:58,311 --> 00:15:59,730
and examine the internal organs.

214
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:01,608
Maybe it was some sort of freak accident.

215
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:04,735
Uh, uh, unorthodox open-heart surgery...

216
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,153
Look at him.
He was gutted like a fish.

217
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:10,700
Claire, you are not seriously suggesting
that this guy's been dead before.

218
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:11,993
Wait a minute, she said what?

219
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:16,330
All right, that's it.
I'm shutting this down.

220
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:17,665
You and you, out!

221
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,709
And you, not a word to anyone, understand?

222
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,073
You don't think that this looks
just a little bit strange?

223
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,368
At least bring in the coroner,
have them check and see...

224
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:25,965
You're not hearing me.

225
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:28,508
I'm not jeopardizing
this hospital's financial future

226
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,176
over a nurse's wild-eyed...

227
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,941
Wait, all of a sudden,
this is about money?

228
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,388
That's none of your business.

229
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:35,556
This hospital was attacked.
People are dead...

230
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:38,393
Enough. I've heard all
I'm going to from you, Temple.

231
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:41,229
Go back to your job, and let me do mine.

232
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,442
Come on.

233
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:07,881
Shh! Take it easy.

234
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:09,425
Breathe.

235
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,052
It's better me than Frank Castle.

236
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,805
But he's not your only problem right now.

237
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:17,433
Give me everything you have
on the Blacksmith.

238
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:19,686
How did you hear about him?

239
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:22,980
All you need to know
is that Frank Castle wants him.

240
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,858
And he's gonna turn this city
into a war zone to find him.

241
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,151
Okay, what do you need?

242
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:29,861
Whatever you have.

243
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:31,656
Nationality, source point,
known allies, anything.

244
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,991
We don't have it.
We never had more than his code name.

245
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:36,744
That's what makes him so high value,
he's elusive.

246
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:39,468
Look, I'm telling you, three government
agencies couldn't find him.

247
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,122
The only lead we have...

248
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,417
Say it.

249
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,172
Look, it's thin.

250
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:51,884
Reyes was looking into
the Blacksmith's competition.

251
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,551
There's a new rival on the scene.

252
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:55,221
Doesn't move
half the product but...

253
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:57,180
but it's still more than everyone else.

254
00:17:57,263 --> 00:18:00,225
- Look, Reyes figured if anyone has...
- Keep your eyes forward.

255
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,436
If anyone has a clue
about the Blacksmith's identity,

256
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,147
it would be his worst enemy.

257
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,775
- Give me the name.
- We don't have one.

258
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,904
- Uh, but our intel gave us a source point.
- Where?

259
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:17,118
Look, the only place where drugs
and corruption rival your neighborhood.

260
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:19,829
Chinatown.

261
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:23,123
All right, good. Now get up.

262
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:24,457
Slowly.

263
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,342
Wherever you were going...

264
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,763
just stay there.

265
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:41,516
Not so sure stopping is such a good idea.

266
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,061
- You're not hungry?
- No, not really.

267
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,732
You don't think the neighborhood's
a little sketchy?

268
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,984
Oh, yeah.
I'm shaking in my boots.

269
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,609
Ma'am?

270
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:53,486
Just get a little black coffee over here?

271
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,243
Anything new from the cops?

272
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,789
Just that they want you dead.

273
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:04,415
Yeah...

274
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:08,334
How about that, uh... that DA?
She have anything on the Blacksmith?

275
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,921
Only that he's moving an unprecedented...

276
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:17,343
Unprecedented volumes
of uncut narcotics into Manhattan.

277
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:20,263
- How's he doing it?
- Well, that'd be the mystery.

278
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:24,475
Okay, look, there's, uh...

279
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:28,022
an unfinished highway on Long Island

280
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:31,233
that was illegally used
as a landing strip in the '90s.

281
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,069
I mean, it would require payoffs, bribes...

282
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,030
This guy's a ghost.
He works alone or close to it. I just...

283
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:37,782
- How do you know?
- I just do.

284
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:44,370
Okay, so, what, that leaves us with
railroads, shipping lines, trucks, maybe?

285
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,539
Hey.

286
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,498
Thank you.

287
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:51,712
- How 'bout you, hon?
- Sure, yeah.

288
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:56,626
Get anything else right now?

289
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:58,927
You know what, I'm gonna need about
as much black coffee

290
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,262
as this place would pump out.

291
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:02,473
So, just keep it coming.

292
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:03,850
Thank you.

293
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:08,645
You didn't seem surprised
that I owned a gun.

294
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:12,984
I guess the only thing that surprised me
is that you didn't plug me.

295
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:18,196
You pick it out yourself?

296
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,406
Why?

297
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,658
People who don't know shit about guns
usually go for something shiny.

298
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:25,913
You know, something with a...
with a fancy grip.

299
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:28,206
There's always the asshole
who gets the big hand cannon

300
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,877
that kicks like a mule
and they're too afraid to use it.

301
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:34,254
But a... 380 shows thought.

302
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:39,886
- Maybe it's not your first rodeo.
- Maybe it isn't.

303
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,640
- Almost took the shot.
- Did you?

304
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,809
And, uh...

305
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,771
can I ask you why you didn't?

306
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:53,314
Because I believe you.

307
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:00,738
I don't like what you do.

308
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:04,743
And ultimately,
I think you probably belong in jail.

309
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:06,244
But you...

310
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,331
you're honest. You...

311
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,167
you never lie to me.

312
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,837
Does he?

313
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,673
- Who?
- Come on.

314
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,590
Let's not do that.

315
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:22,511
Okay. The lawyer.

316
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:24,596
Not the other one, uh...

317
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:27,308
Murdock.

318
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:32,228
Um...

319
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:37,818
Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:43,282
He's got issues.
It's complicated, like most people.

321
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:47,410
Hard person to get to know.
I just think that inside he's...

322
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:49,455
You love him, right?

323
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:54,373
- You can't know that.
- I'm sorry, can't know what?

324
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,715
You can't...

325
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,833
Come on.
We're in court,

326
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:00,961
all that shit going on,
it's all over your face.

327
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:03,676
You can't hide that.
You love him.

328
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:06,807
Ma'am, just a little bit more.
Thank you.

329
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,475
I might have... feelings for Matt Murdock,

330
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,606
but it's just...
it's a swirl, it's a lot of things.

331
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:14,355
Like...

332
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,482
ingredients.
It's not love.

333
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,151
Ma'am, can I ask you,
do you guys always serve bullshit here

334
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:22,571
or is that just her, huh?

335
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:24,822
Fresh pot.

336
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:28,952
I'm sorry. You were saying?

337
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,417
He's the kind of man who hurts people.

338
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:38,503
Not like you, but...

339
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,590
he damages them.

340
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:44,801
Breaks them.

341
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:47,971
Sorry, is that supposed to mean something?

342
00:22:48,054 --> 00:22:50,390
So those are the people
that you get out of your life.

343
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:52,184
Is that right?

344
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,896
Look, I might generally be considered
out of my skull,

345
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:58,064
so this might not mean much,
but this could be the craziest,

346
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:00,275
most batshit thing
I've ever heard in my life.

347
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,985
People that can hurt you,
the ones that can really hurt you,

348
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,531
are the ones that are
close enough to do it.

349
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,117
People that get inside you and... and...

350
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:10,869
and tear you apart, and make you feel
like you're never gonna recover.

351
00:23:10,952 --> 00:23:13,080
Shit. I'd...

352
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:17,167
I... I would chop my arm off
right here, in this restaurant,

353
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,544
just to feel that one more time
for my wife.

354
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:24,675
My old lady,
she didn't just break my heart. She...

355
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,097
She'd rip it out, she'd tear it apart,
she'd step on that shit, feed it to a dog.

356
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,015
I mean, she was ruthless.
She brought the pain.

357
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,936
But she'll never hurt me again.

358
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:39,481
You see, I'll never feel that.

359
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:45,071
You sit here and you're all confused
about this thing, but you have it.

360
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:46,780
You have everything.

361
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:50,742
So, hold on to it.

362
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:54,870
Use two hands and never let go.
You got it?

363
00:23:56,747 --> 00:24:00,001
Now, you need to go in the back
and get the waitress.

364
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:02,170
You tell the cook and anyone else
who's back there to find

365
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,853
the biggest piece of stainless steel
and you get under it. Go now.

366
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,216
Wait. What's happening?

367
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,677
The Buick. It's rolled around the block
three times before it pulled up.

368
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:10,846
Who are they?

369
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:13,724
Just some guys who are about to
walk into a diner for the last time.

370
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:16,935
Wait, you...
you wanted them here.

371
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,981
You parked me outside like... bait.

372
00:24:21,063 --> 00:24:22,273
You need to go.

373
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,526
- You're such an asshole.
- Yeah.

374
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,654
You got that right.

375
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:10,488
Pell drop is done.
Still waiting on Lafayette and Ludlow.

376
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:16,328
Ping, your kid's messing around
with the carousel again.

377
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:19,830
<i>My kid's at basketball, asshole.</i>

378
00:25:37,183 --> 00:25:39,016
Yang, you better get up here.

379
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:06,878
Come here!

380
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:10,340
Who do you work for?

381
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:12,842
Screw you.

382
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,705
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

383
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,292
Madame Gao.

384
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:56,387
I see from the uniform
you've taken the Devil's name to heart.

385
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:02,309
Yeah, I had to...
'cause of people like you.

386
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:06,228
So, you continue your fight,
but for how long, I wonder?

387
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,898
And at what price?

388
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:18,742
- Call your men off.
- Why would I do that?

389
00:27:18,824 --> 00:27:21,494
'Cause, otherwise,
I'm gonna break their legs.

390
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:25,873
We speak alone.

391
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,086
Call them off.

392
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:37,343
They'll be gone shortly.

393
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:42,599
When you are satisfied we're alone,
we'll talk.

394
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:47,348
The Blacksmith. Where is he?

395
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:49,059
Screw you.

396
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:00,486
Where?

397
00:30:00,571 --> 00:30:01,946
Go to hell.

398
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,658
Okay.

399
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:11,456
Okay.

400
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,267
I want a place.

401
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:36,439
41st Street.

402
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:39,943
The pier.

403
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,863
I can take you.

404
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:07,513
Frank...

405
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,184
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

406
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:18,898
You need to call the police,
get protective custody.

407
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:22,068
Get away from this thing.

408
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:24,320
Get away from me.

409
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,454
Just stay away from me.

410
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:53,433
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

411
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:55,644
Hello, yes, please.

412
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:58,103
Connect me to the 15th Precinct, please.

413
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:02,650
Trust me, my men won't disturb us.

414
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:06,946
Yeah, I don't take much
on faith these days.

415
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:14,955
You know,
word was you left Hell's Kitchen.

416
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:16,997
I'm surprised you came back.

417
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,792
What made you think I ever left?

418
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:22,838
The multiple charges pending against you,
drug dealing, money laundering.

419
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,215
Oh, yeah, slavery.

420
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:27,884
That's the reason you come to me?

421
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,552
It's not enough?

422
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:32,638
I suppose after all this time,
I expected more from you.

423
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:34,389
Like what?

424
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,103
An understanding
of the real threat facing this city.

425
00:32:39,186 --> 00:32:42,064
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm looking at one.

426
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:47,696
However,
tonight I'm only after information.

427
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,656
Perhaps you should ask your police.

428
00:32:50,741 --> 00:32:52,242
I don't want you.

429
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:54,785
I want your competition.

430
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:58,748
A heroin dealer
with the street name Blacksmith.

431
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,755
And you think I can help you?

432
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,299
I know he's been
cutting into your territories.

433
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:11,844
Heroin is illegal.

434
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:17,433
And as far as territories go,
New York is only one of mine.

435
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:21,478
I could have 100 cops here in an hour.

436
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:25,024
I've grown bored with tea.

437
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:32,698
However, it does seem that our interests
have momentarily aligned.

438
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:37,620
The heroin being imported
by the Blacksmith...

439
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:40,455
is the purest I've seen.

440
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,167
He's also ruthless.

441
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:46,378
His crew has been
systematically eliminating

442
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:49,632
my chemists and street dealers.

443
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:56,347
I can end it tonight.

444
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,349
But I need a place to start.

445
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,769
My sources tell me...

446
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:04,522
his product come in by ship.

447
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,107
Which pier?

448
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,110
If I knew that...

449
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,072
this conversation wouldn't be necessary.

450
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:14,324
That's not a lot to go on.

451
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:18,078
You can be sure his goods
will be well-guarded

452
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:21,790
by professionals
clearly more capable than my own.

453
00:34:22,748 --> 00:34:23,917
Thanks, Madame Gao.

454
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,089
But I fear that the path you've chosen...

455
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:31,299
isn't going to be an easy one.

456
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,346
Yeah, it never is.

457
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:49,109
- So?
- So...

458
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:52,237
good news is, you're not fired.

459
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:54,154
But this is strike two.

460
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,449
Um... I protected you in there.

461
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:02,205
All you gotta do is keep your mouth shut,
do your job, and everything will be fine.

462
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:05,708
- That's it?
- That's it.

463
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:13,132
They're just gonna sweep this all
under the rug, aren't they?

464
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:14,801
What about Louisa?

465
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:21,516
The story is,
Louisa got killed by a junkie.

466
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:25,020
Got his hands on a scalpel,
things got out of hand.

467
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:27,647
It was very unfortunate,
and could happen to any of us.

468
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,859
- You can't possibly be okay with this.
- Claire...

469
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:35,446
There's a body downstairs
being prepped for its second autopsy!

470
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:37,656
I was willing to take responsibility
for what I did,

471
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:40,034
take whatever punishment
that they want to dole out.

472
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:42,318
- But pretending like it never happened?
- Shh. Come on.

473
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:45,956
Those killers are still out there,
and we're not gonna report that?

474
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,833
I've got no way to confirm it,

475
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:52,712
but I'm pretty sure the hospital just
received a major anonymous donation.

476
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:55,424
So, now we're taking hush money?

477
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:57,844
Shirley, Louisa was one of us.

478
00:35:57,927 --> 00:36:01,346
I don't know about you,
but I need my job.

479
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:02,891
Wow.

480
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:05,393
- What?
- Really?

481
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:07,895
That's how you're gonna play this?

482
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:11,357
Those patients were never
formally checked in,

483
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,150
which means there are no records.

484
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,277
The hospital cops aren't talking...

485
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,447
and Louisa's gone.

486
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:19,406
That makes it your word
against the administration's.

487
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:22,828
And believe me,
that is a fight you cannot win.

488
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:25,246
You already got two strikes.

489
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,623
- Yeah.
- Wait. No, Claire!

490
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:29,292
Claire, wait...

491
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:31,335
Let's just call this
strike three, shall we?

492
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:34,089
- Ms. Temple...
- I'm not sure exactly when this hospital

493
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:37,299
became more concerned
with private donations

494
00:36:37,382 --> 00:36:38,969
or saving our own asses.

495
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:40,094
But just an FYI,

496
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:44,598
it used to be a place where
job number one... was saving lives.

497
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,643
I won't be any part of this.

498
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,023
- I'm out.
- Claire.

499
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:35,525
Multiple shots.

500
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,237
I got no idea
where they're coming from. No.

501
00:37:40,237 --> 00:37:42,364
And our outside perimeter's not gonna...

502
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:40,047
You still here, chickenshit?

503
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:43,509
It's just you and me now.

504
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:46,429
You hiding?
Huh, you afraid?

505
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:48,657
Looks like you're all out.

506
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,453
That's all you got, huh?

507
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:59,960
The cash, the shit...
Just take it. Take it all.

508
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,299
- That what you think's gonna happen, huh?
- Please...

509
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:06,502
You think you're gonna
talk your way out of this shit?

510
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:18,563
I've been looking for you.

511
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,607
You're the Blacksmith.

512
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,319
- Say it.
- God, I don't wanna die!

513
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:33,286
Say it.
I want you to tell me.

514
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:35,746
Say, "I'm the Blacksmith."

515
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:43,920
Say, "I'm the Blacksmith.

516
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,549
I killed your wife."

517
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:49,177
Say it.
Say, "I killed your children."

518
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,971
- You feel me?
- I did it, I did it.

519
00:40:52,054 --> 00:40:55,433
I'm the Blacksmith.
I'm the one you want.

520
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:59,145
- Just finish it! Finish it!
- That's what you want.

521
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:07,569
Here it comes.

522
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:10,114
- Don't shoot him, Frank! Frank!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

523
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:11,574
Get outta here, Red.

524
00:41:11,656 --> 00:41:12,824
He's lying, Frank.

525
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:14,159
We're here
for the same reasons, all right?

526
00:41:14,243 --> 00:41:16,621
I want the Blacksmith just as much as you,
but he's not him.

527
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:18,663
I know when someone's
telling the truth, Frank. He's not.

528
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:19,998
Bullshit! Just get outta here!

529
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,375
He's not the man you came for, Frank.

530
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:22,752
It's me, I swear...

531
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:26,172
Are you lying to me?

532
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:27,422
Are you lying to me?

533
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,217
He's not the Blacksmith.
Put the gun down.

534
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,763
- Either way...
- You kill him, we have nothing.

535
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:35,054
...you die.

536
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:43,063
You just couldn't let it be, could you?
You just couldn't let it...

537
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:44,732
You kill him, we got nothing, Frank.

538
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:50,404
Castle's on board.

539
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:53,031
Get back to the boat now.

540
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:57,203
When are you gonna learn?

541
00:41:57,286 --> 00:42:00,080
Mind your own goddamn business!

542
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:02,125
Goddamn it, Frank.

543
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:05,460
- We want the same thing.
- That's bullshit. That's...

544
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:10,089
I don't want to fight you.
I don't want to fight you.

545
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:11,967
You want me to take it easy?

546
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,694
Stay down, Frank.

547
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:33,739
I'm so sick of you.

548
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,462
Get off me!

549
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:52,049
Just couldn't let me have it,
could you?

550
00:42:52,924 --> 00:42:54,344
You just couldn't let me have it.

551
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:56,636
One second in peace.

552
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:58,889
It was right there.
You had to sweep in.

553
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:00,933
You feel good about yourself?

554
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:04,103
Piece of shit.

555
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:06,313
Oh, come on, Frank.

556
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:09,107
It wouldn't have been the truth,
and you know it.

557
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:10,485
I can't let you start a war

558
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,902
- for the wrong reasons.
- Maybe a war is what I need.

559
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:15,656
Maybe I need that.

560
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,409
These people,
they took my children from me.

561
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:21,536
They killed my kids!
Don't you get that?

562
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:23,456
Then do right by them!

563
00:43:23,538 --> 00:43:26,208
Help me. Work with me
to find the man who gave the order.

564
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:28,252
And then what, Red?
We gonna...

565
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:31,339
We gonna bring him in for justice?
Is that what we're gonna do?

566
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:33,424
Your way's bullshit, Red.
It doesn't work.

567
00:43:33,507 --> 00:43:36,386
I need him... I need him gone.
It's gotta be permanent!

568
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:38,189
- It's gotta be finished!
- I... I understand.

569
00:43:38,221 --> 00:43:39,804
You're right.
My way isn't working.

570
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:42,850
So, maybe just this once...

571
00:43:45,101 --> 00:43:46,395
Maybe...

572
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:49,940
yeah, your way is what it's gonna take.

573
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,942
Red, just this once?

574
00:43:53,944 --> 00:43:55,821
No. No, no, no, no, no, Red.
That's...

575
00:43:57,406 --> 00:43:58,907
that's not how it works.

576
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:02,453
It's just...

577
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:05,831
you cross over to my side of the line...

578
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:09,418
you don't get to come back from that.

579
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
Not ever.

580
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:17,802
I count ten. Armed.

581
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,393
There's a lot of gunpowder
below decks.

582
00:44:26,476 --> 00:44:28,313
Any of these guys starts shooting,
this whole ship...

583
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:29,897
It'll blow straight to hell.

584
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,650
We gotta get off this boat
before they open fire.

585
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:34,277
You're goddamn right you do.

586
00:44:43,118 --> 00:44:44,243
We got him.

587
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,663
One batch, two batch...

588
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:48,165
penny and dime.

589
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:52,337
Here I come.
Here I come.

590
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,380
Been a long time, hasn't it, Frank?

591
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:56,882
Kill him.

592
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:29,540
- Just got word from Midtown.
- Who'd she get?

593
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:31,375
The Frenchman.

594
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:34,378
Jacques screwed the pooch.

595
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:36,337
What an asshole.

596
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:40,801
Now Ellie's on the war path,
working her way up.

597
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:44,471
You know, sooner or later,
she'll find you.

598
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:46,848
Kid's always been a doer.

599
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:48,350
Follow me.

600
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:54,230
A guy once told me
there's a power in surrender.

601
00:45:54,313 --> 00:45:56,984
In choosing when your time's up.

602
00:45:57,067 --> 00:45:59,277
But I chose.

603
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:05,324
Now, that asshole's dead.

604
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:09,663
I want you outta here.

605
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:13,250
If there's gonna be
a tomorrow for anyone...

606
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:16,712
you gotta follow the plan.

607
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:20,339
Go. Get me what I need.

608
00:47:17,355 --> 00:47:18,357
No.

609
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:37,417
My God...

610
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,342
- Brett?
- Be careful, Karen.

611
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:50,389
Cover these bodies.
Castle said he was coming here?

612
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:51,931
You sure?

613
00:47:55,351 --> 00:47:57,772
Fifteenth Squad Sergeant to Central.

614
00:47:57,855 --> 00:48:01,567
Pier 81 on four-one street.
I need FD and ambulances forthwith,

615
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,779
and notify Harbor to respond.
And Narcotics.

616
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:07,239
This could be the largest
heroin seizure in years.

617
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:10,409
Frank...

618
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:12,911
Why?

619
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:35,976
- You heading out?
- Yeah. You?

620
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,310
Yep.

621
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:38,853
Clean bill? Congrats.

622
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:41,607
Yeah, I'm a regular poster boy for health.

623
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,357
You going on a trip?

624
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:45,235
Something like that.

625
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:47,654
- I just quit.
- As in, your job?

626
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:50,907
As in, our mutual friend is gonna
have to get friendly with another nurse,

627
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:53,578
because the next time he needs
help at the hospital, I won't be here.

628
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:54,953
They're trying to keep

629
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:58,165
what happened last night quiet,
like it never happened.

630
00:48:58,248 --> 00:49:00,793
Oh, wow. What did happen?

631
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,377
Ask your friend.

632
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:04,212
I'm ready.

633
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:52,219
And now, it's ready.

634
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,159
Oh, you need help.

635
00:50:57,241 --> 00:50:59,161
Hey, hey!
We need some help here!

636
00:51:00,203 --> 00:51:02,621
She found him.

637
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,040
She found him.

638
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,543
What?

639
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:10,589
She found Stick...

640
00:51:11,924 --> 00:51:13,507
and she's gonna kill him.

641
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:17,929
Who?

642
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:21,726
Elektra.

643
00:52:41,263 --> 00:52:42,556
Hmm.

644
00:53:20,469 --> 00:53:22,971
We need to talk.

645
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:32,813
I'm all ears.
