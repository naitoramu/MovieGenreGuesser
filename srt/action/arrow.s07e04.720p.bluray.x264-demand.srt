1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,872
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,077
<i>After 6 years
of being a vigilante,</i>

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,033
<i>the only way to achieve my goal</i>

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,432
<i>and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.</i>

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,560
<i>Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.</i>

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,393
<i>I am no longer a hero.</i>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,872
<i>I am inmate 4587.</i>

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,914
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,816
- Where'd you get that?
- Felicity gave it to me.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,479
<i>I opened it up,
and I found this.</i>

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,518
They're GPS coordinates
for this island.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,760
I know exactly
what this is.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
Grab your stuff.
We're going back.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,080
- Back where?
- To Star City.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,896
The silencer's the only lead
we have on Diaz. We can't let her escape.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,736
Isn't this kind of what we've been
doing the whole time,

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,080
stepping in when
the system fails?

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,316
Isn't that sort of
the vigilante M.O.?

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,896
Sometimes, you have to
cross the line for that.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,116
Listen. Nobody believes
in that more than me.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,397
<i>I'm just not sure
that's what this is.</i>

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,789
You'll never get
to the Demon

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,256
<i>because you're
on the wrong level.</i>

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,714
The Demon is
on level two.

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,034
Let's go, 4587.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,475
You're going downstairs.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,030
I am Dr. Jarrett Parker,
chief psychiatrist on level two.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,631
Keeping me in here
without food or water.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,393
<i>I understand
these conditions</i>

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,119
<i>may cause
some discomfort,</i>

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,591
but your recent behavior
indicates that you are

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,759
a danger to other inmates
and yourself.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,151
Until I can determine you are
in the right mental state

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
to be with the other
inmates,

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,552
it will be just the two of us
for a while.

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm here to conduct
your psychiatric evaluation.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,194
But I'm not crazy.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,754
<i>That's what I aim
to determine.</i>

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,798
Now let's begin.

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,400
What is your name?

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
You know my name.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,672
Please answer
the question.

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,071
My name is Oliver Queen.

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,830
I don't belong here.

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,675
<i>I'm hearing someone who doesn't
want to take responsibility</i>

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,990
<i>for his actions.</i>

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,516
The choices that led
you to slabside are

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,074
of your own design.

49
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,435
You're not
understanding me.

50
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,429
A man named Ricardo Diaz
tried to kill my family.

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,069
Somebody on this level
has a connection to him.

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,039
I need to find
this person.

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
The only reason that
I am here

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
is because I put
myself here.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,196
- Do you understand?
- For the sake of argument,

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,279
what will you do
after you find this person?

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,591
I will use them
to stop Diaz.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,151
How? By hurting
or killing him

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,989
and then Mr. Diaz?

60
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,193
<i>Recidivism
is the likelihood</i>

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,595
<i>that a violent
criminal offender</i>

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,269
will commit another
violent crime when set free.

63
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,955
That is what I'm
trying to prevent,

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,999
<i>but I believe
everyone here</i>

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,191
has a chance
at redemption,

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,230
even people
like you.

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,512
I don't need your help,

68
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,160
and I don't need
redemption.

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,356
You don't?

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
No.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,955
How many people
have you hurt

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,792
besides the prisoners and guards
you sent to the infirmary?

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't know.

74
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,312
How many people
have you murdered?

75
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,796
Hmm? Would you say you
have violent tendencies?

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,829
I would say I'm trying
to protect my family.

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,476
And they do seem
like a lovely family.

78
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,199
We'll unpack this
more later.

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,475
Where is Diaz?

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,472
No food or water,

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,313
<i>heat on blast.</i>

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,954
Call this
an interrogation?

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,520
It can only get
worse for you.

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,593
You don't have the stomach to do
what you need to do.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,235
Diaz is only
getting stronger.

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,991
You have no idea
what's coming.

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,310
<i>Hey.</i>

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,995
- Any luck?
- No.

89
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,436
Actually think she might
be enjoying herself.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,194
We're gonna need to
turn up the heat.

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Any hotter, she'll
turn into soup.

92
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,155
I meant turn up
the stakes,

93
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,416
do whatever it
takes to make her

94
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,476
give us
the information.

95
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,797
- You don't mean torture?
- I don't not mean it.

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,917
Felicity, you don't
know what you're saying.

97
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,591
Torturing someone is a line
you do not want to cross.

98
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
When the Navy discharged me

99
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,920
for what I did
to a prisoner,

100
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,471
I learned the lesson
about the cost to my humanity

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,551
because I still have
nightmares of what I did,

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,710
even though
I saved lives,

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,191
so when Tobias church tortured me
for over 20 hours,

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,750
it was the universe
paying me back.

105
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,435
That's evil for evil.

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,916
I'm sorry about that.

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
I am.

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
Church broke you.

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,672
You gave up Oliver's
identity, Rene.

110
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
It worked.

111
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,276
She tried to kill
Dinah and Laurel

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,874
and us.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,679
Diaz hired her.
He's not gonna stop

114
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,638
coming after us
until we are all dead.

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,196
Oh, shoot. I was supposed
to meet with Dinah

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,520
5 minutes ago
for a town hall.

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,472
She is not going anywhere,

118
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,233
so we're gonna take a break,

119
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,278
and we're gonna figure
this out later.

120
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,989
OK.

121
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,480
All right.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,674
Star City's seen
better days.

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,752
God, this place.
I swore I'd never

124
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,639
set foot here
ever again.

125
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,479
Yeah. Me, too.

126
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,275
Sounds like I'm not the only one
with bad memories.

127
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,833
<i>The coordinates have
changed since Lian Yu.</i>

128
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,554
Something must have
triggered it.

129
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,430
Felicity. She must
know we're here.

130
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,600
Well, let's see
where she wants you to go.

131
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,198
Sorry.
Lost track of time.

132
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,674
We're just about
to start.

133
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,759
Hey, hey. Don't you want to know
what's going on in your community?

134
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,435
I need to know what's going on
for my algebra quiz tomorrow.

135
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,994
Oh.

136
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,755
The rich part of Star City
gets 5 squad cars

137
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,479
for every one that
The Glades get.

138
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,518
Ma'am, I assure you
that's not the case.

139
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,989
When my store
got robbed,

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,318
it took SCPD two hours
to get there.

141
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,278
You know who showed up
only minutes later?

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,312
That new Green Arrow.
Where were you?

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,159
I apologize
for that response time.

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,437
We are doing the best we can
with limited resources.

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,353
You and
Mayor Pollard are in

146
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,636
way over your heads.

147
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,514
OK, guys. Look.
Captain Drake is here.

148
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,632
She's trying to help.
Let's all be reasonable.

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,951
Well, facts are, Rene,
things were better off

150
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,355
with the vigilantes.

151
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,831
Huh? Yeah? Come on.

152
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,956
All set.

153
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Fire.

154
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,953
Fire! Fire!

155
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,595
Everybody stay calm,
make your way to the exit.

156
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
Let's go.

157
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,711
Guys, you heard the lady.
Move your asses!

158
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,158
Hey. I got to get Zoe.

159
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,874
Zoe, no!

160
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,235
This way. Hey.
She's over here. She's right here.

161
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,756
SweeTheart,
are you OK, huh?

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,191
I'm OK. The Green Arrow
saved me.

163
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,350
What?

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,696
<i>Although the origin
of The Glades youth center fire</i>

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,598
has yet to be determined,
the SCPD has

166
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,955
a leading suspect.

167
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,829
<i>The new Green Arrow was spotted
at the scene of the crime.</i>

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
<i>We believe he may be involved.</i>

169
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,039
<i>Now I've instructed
captain Drake and the SCPD</i>

170
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,676
<i>to utilize every resource
to find and apprehend him.</i>

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,071
<i>Vigilantism will not
be tolerated.</i>

172
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,153
What a load
of crap.

173
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,715
The guy's a hero.

174
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,360
He saved her life.

175
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,955
How's she doing?

176
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,793
Doc Schwartz says
she'll be fine.

177
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,037
They're just holding
her as a precaution.

178
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,554
<i>She's a fighter</i>

179
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,760
just like her
not-so-old man.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,798
I got her
a little something.

181
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,920
Hey, man. Isn't she
too old for that?

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,236
Do not hate on beebo.

183
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,039
He brings comfort
to people of all ages.

184
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,635
Hmm.

185
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,034
Hey. Let's let her rest.

186
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,994
So if it wasn't the new Green Arrow
that started that fire,

187
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,355
then who was it?

188
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,296
Maybe it's a homicidal
maniac running around town

189
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,834
with a shiny, new
flamethrower,

190
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,031
goes by dragon,
hates our guts.

191
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,669
- It wasn't Diaz.
- How do you know?

192
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,256
Because the perps used
an accelerant that's

193
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,590
also been used in a rash of
other fires around The Glades,

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,712
one on the same night
Diaz broke into the CDC.

195
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
That gives him
an alibi.

196
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,680
This is A.R.G.U.S.
We have to go.

197
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Keep us posted.

198
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,919
- How's Zoe?
- She'll be OK.

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,673
- Good.
- The guy who did this won't be,

200
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
not when I get
my hands on him.

201
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,157
Yeah. We'll find him
and that vigilante.

202
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,760
I've got patrols
combing the city.

203
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,280
We both know
that new Green Arrow's

204
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,039
not who you should be
looking for.

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,856
Are you implying I don't care
about finding who did this?

206
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,590
No, but the mayor doesn't give
a crap about a fire in The Glades.

207
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,336
She cares about locking up
the new Green Arrow

208
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,840
because it will
make her look good.

209
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,155
He saved Zoe's life.

210
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,471
Doesn't definitively
make him innocent.

211
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,736
What was he doing there
in the first place?

212
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm sure he has
a good reason.

213
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,840
Look. Let me help you by finding
the guy who really did this.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,957
Rene, I already have
one vigilante to deal with.

215
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
I do not need two.

216
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm not talking
about Wild Dog.

217
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,478
That's my kid there, d.

218
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,236
I became a vigilante
for her

219
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,616
because I wanted her
to be able to walk the streets

220
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,236
and not get attacked,
not have her purse stolen,

221
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
and not be offered drugs

222
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,756
because her mother died
in these streets already.

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,400
I just want
a better life for her.

224
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,631
Look. I care
about Zoe, too,

225
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,316
and I promise I will find out
who set that fire,

226
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,216
but you saw what happened
at that town hall, Rene.

227
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,760
These people have completely lost
their faith in law enforcement

228
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,759
because Diaz
corrupted it.

229
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,114
My job is to
catch whoever did this

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,640
and restore that faith.

231
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,355
All I'm asking is that
you have faith in me.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,150
OK?

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,071
Yeah. I got it.

234
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,435
Good morning.

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,234
Good morning!

236
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,832
I see you've found a way
to keep track of time.

237
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,079
I'm impressed.
An active mind means

238
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,839
<i>you're thinking
about things.</i>

239
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,670
What is your name?

240
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,676
I'm not answering
any more of your questions.

241
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,115
Still resistant. Hmm.

242
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,399
I suppose we'll have to
try a different approach.

243
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,752
Ugh! Agh!

244
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,354
What wa... what
was that?

245
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,352
That will help make you
more comfortable,

246
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,229
allow us to have
a real conversation.

247
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,355
<i>You don't have to
fight anymore.</i>

248
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,677
You've fought enough
in your life.

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,155
<i>You consider yourself
a hero.</i>

250
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,076
The question is,
when was the moment

251
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,636
the playboy son
of a billionaire

252
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,555
became the man known
as the Green Arrow?

253
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,830
<i>You can
survive this,</i>

254
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,273
make it home,
make it better,

255
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,830
right my wrongs, but you got
to live through this first.

256
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,917
You're struggling.
What do you see?

257
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,112
I'm with my father
at sea.

258
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,959
Are you on
the <i>Queen's Gambit</i>?

259
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,679
No. We're
on a life raft.

260
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,319
<i>Gambit's</i> already
gone down.

261
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,755
Was there
anyone else there

262
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
with you and your father?

263
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Yes.

264
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,397
His... his bodyguard
ha-Hackett.

265
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,830
We... there were the 3
of us who survived.

266
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,115
Ohh! Dad?

267
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Survive.

268
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
<i>Nooo!</i>

269
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,235
What?
What did you see?

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,914
I see my father asking me
to right his wrongs...

271
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,472
Right before he shot himself
in the head.

272
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,236
He sacrificed
his life for mine.

273
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,397
Is that why you became
a vigilante?

274
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,520
- Yes.
- Because he put his sins on you?

275
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,518
Would you please stop?

276
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,680
A father passes on more than
just his name to his children.

277
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,514
He provides them
their legacy.

278
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,472
What became of Hackett?

279
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,514
There was only enough food
and water for one person.

280
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,874
My dad shot him.

281
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,951
Your father shot him?
Then what?

282
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,879
Like he doesn't matter
in this story,

283
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,309
<i>just collateral damage?</i>

284
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,030
People without the last name
Queen are human beings, too.

285
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,396
They have hopes,
dreams, lives.

286
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,358
<i>Your father wasn't
a hero.</i>

287
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,155
Mr. Queen,
he was a murderer.

288
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,790
He saved me.

289
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,679
<i>He condemned you.</i>

290
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,116
He is gone,
but here you are caught

291
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,636
in the same
vicious cycle,

292
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,790
paying for his crimes.

293
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,150
How'd you get past
my SCPD detail?

294
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,480
You know I went
to mit, right?

295
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,876
It's like Harvard
for computer geeks

296
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,912
with an acceptance
rate of 6.7%,

297
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,112
<i>so if I can get in there,
I can get in</i>

298
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
pretty much anywhere
except for here,

299
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,256
which is why I had to
resort to saying that...

300
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,873
We were sorority sisters.

301
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Yeah, right.

302
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,277
Wow. So you are
actually practicing law.

303
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,216
Why does everybody find that
so hard to believe?

304
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,776
Well, probably because
you're not the real Laurel

305
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,029
or a real lawyer.

306
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,696
Ooh. Try saying that 3 times fast.
What a tongue twister.

307
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,916
OK. Listen. I am doing
this for Quentin,

308
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,976
so if you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to work now.

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,071
Yeah, I get it. I mean,
prosecuting criminals

310
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,357
must be a lot harder
than being one.

311
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,519
- You're still here.
- I have a case

312
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,915
that you might
be interested in.

313
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,755
Your Laurel might have done
the whole pro bono thing,

314
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,274
but this Laurel doesn't.

315
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,314
Hypothetically, if there was
a female assassin

316
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,194
who went by, I don't know,
the name the silencer,

317
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,072
who had... for purposes
of this illustration...

318
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,680
only attacked the D.A. with a belt
device that canceled sound,

319
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,576
well, if someone has
captured said assailant

320
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
and was holding her
hostage,

321
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:34,896
do you think the D.A. in this
perfectly random hypothetical

322
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,071
might be interested
in serving justice?

323
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,192
You kidnapped
and imprisoned the silencer?

324
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,829
No. No, not me.

325
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,037
- Just asking for a friend.
- And you want my help.

326
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,376
Yeah. I never thought this day
would come either, but here we are.

327
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,393
You are a hell of a lot more
interesting than I thought.

328
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Where is she?

329
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,352
Hey. They didn't
have strawberry,

330
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,874
so I got you
some options.

331
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,833
You still like
cantaloupe, right?

332
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,157
For, like, the 100th
time, I'm fine.

333
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,776
Shouldn't you be out looking
for the bad guys who started the fire?

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,269
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm your pops.

335
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,437
I'm right
where I need to be.

336
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,680
Besides, your aunt Dinah doesn't
want me doing that.

337
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,675
There's a fire
at the lofts.

338
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,115
Dad, you got to go.

339
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,200
You taught me only punks
forget about their community.

340
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,917
Why you always got to listen to
everything I say?

341
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,469
Hey, hey. I'm on
your side, remember?

342
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,920
He got away.

343
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,197
- Who got away?
- Jon Cortez.

344
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,120
Is he the one who's
been setting these fires?

345
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,230
Freeze!

346
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,320
Put your weapon
on the ground.

347
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,312
Raise your hands
above your head slowly.

348
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,517
- D.
- I got a call about a suspicious fire.

349
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,273
I had a hunch you
might be involved.

350
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
He's just trying to help.

351
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,513
Then he can prove that
by turning himself in!

352
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,275
Step aside, Rene.

353
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,920
No. Go!

354
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,433
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry, d.,

355
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,976
but I just couldn't
let you arrest him.

356
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,559
- Turn around.
- What?

357
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,756
Turn around!

358
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,480
Are you kidding me?

359
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,758
I warned you the last time.
I asked you to trust me.

360
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,429
Instead, you just actively tampered
with my investigation,

361
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,517
so now I have no choice.

362
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,520
Are you serious?

363
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,115
Rene Ramirez,
you are under arrest.

364
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,376
You have the right
to remain silent.

365
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,696
Everything you say
can and will be used

366
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,949
against you
in a court of law,

367
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,430
so I suggest you
shut the hell up.

368
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,075
Let's go.

369
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,475
Unh!

370
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,510
Ugh!

371
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,315
Good morning.

372
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,596
Please state your name.

373
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,629
Oliver Queen.

374
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,399
You were just now
meditating.

375
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,680
- Yeah.
- Where did you learn to do that?

376
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,231
- Hong Kong.
- Who taught you?

377
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,239
Tatsu yamashiro.

378
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,480
When we last spoke,
you mentioned

379
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,200
your father killed
a man... Hackett...

380
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,919
so you could live.

381
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,799
That's right.
I feel like my father

382
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,311
had to... Make
an impossible choice.

383
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
An impossible choice?

384
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,994
Yes.

385
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,296
How do you think
your son would feel

386
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,357
if he knew his grandfather
was a murderer?

387
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,878
Dr. Parker, please leave
my son out of this, please.

388
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,880
At times, love can
blind a person

389
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,936
to the harm they're inflicting
on their families,

390
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,158
the cycle of violence
they're creating

391
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,277
that they have learned
from their own parents.

392
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,198
I would never intentionally
harm my son.

393
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,152
Did you know that children
of the incarcerated

394
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,670
are 3 times more likely to enter
the justice system

395
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,479
than children
of non-offenders?

396
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,950
William is nothing
like me.

397
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,753
That may be true,

398
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,280
but what effect do you think
you're having on William?

399
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I think he's alive.

400
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,871
Alive but with no father,

401
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
his mother dead,
and no home?

402
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,200
Does that sound like
a good life?

403
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,149
No, it doesn't.

404
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,274
Everything that I've done I've...
I've done for my son.

405
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,193
I don't doubt that,

406
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,792
but it is my duty to point
out uncomfortable truths

407
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,754
so that you can reform yourself
so that you can become the man

408
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,553
you want to be
for your son.

409
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,473
<i>You created your
vigilante persona</i>

410
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,416
so that you could avenge
your father's wrongs.

411
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,354
Isn't any part of you concerned that
William will take your lead

412
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,193
and become a murderer
just like you?

413
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,357
Then listen to me.

414
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,754
That promise
to your father was made

415
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,754
when you were vulnerable
and desperate.

416
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,760
It tainted your mission
from the start,

417
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,156
infecting you
and now your son.

418
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,915
<i>It wasn't fair of your father
to ask what he did of you.</i>

419
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,675
You must let go
of the past.

420
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,720
Only then can you
spare your family

421
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,678
from paying
for your sins.

422
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,594
Go to hell.

423
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,153
He's not responding.

424
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,509
Prepare the machine.

425
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,633
Tell me exactly
what she said.

426
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,440
Besides telling me
to go frak myself, nothing.

427
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,434
Well, lucky for you, I've been working
on my cross examination.

428
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,320
Your witness.

429
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,272
Hello.

430
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Remember me?

431
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,674
What's the matter?

432
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,830
Cat got your tongue?

433
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,356
You have no idea
who I am,

434
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,312
what I survived.

435
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,754
You're in way
over your head.

436
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,238
I don't think I am.

437
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,840
A little advice
from someone who used

438
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,469
to work with that
psychopath Diaz...

439
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,433
<i>you think you're
being loyal.</i>

440
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,950
<i>The only loyalty
he knows is to himself.</i>

441
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,680
He'll kill you without
a second thought.

442
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,635
I'd do the same thing to anyone
who got in my way.

443
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,271
I don't think you're
hearing me.

444
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,640
Maybe I need to talk
a little bit louder.

445
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
- Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,200
Got a call...
From Rene.

447
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,317
Oh. Of course
he called you.

448
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,840
Why? To talk
some sense into me?

449
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,516
I just came by to find out
why you locked him up.

450
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,952
Because he broke
the law again,

451
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,474
and I can't keep
making exceptions

452
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,936
just because he's
our friend, John.

453
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,077
Sometimes, it's hard being
on the other side of this.

454
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,318
Enforcing the rules. Yeah.

455
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,756
That's been a tough
transition for me, too.

456
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,594
I know Rene believes he's doing
the right thing here,

457
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,797
but our circumstances
have changed.

458
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,240
There is no way any of us can help
anyone if we're arrested

459
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,192
by the FBI for violating
the immunity deal.

460
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,795
More importantly, this police
force is a complete disaster

461
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,314
after everything
Diaz did to it.

462
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,190
Dinah, you're under
pressure, a lot of pressure.

463
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,589
I get that,

464
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,400
but you sure it's not
something more?

465
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,310
Hey. You know what
helps me?

466
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,798
Spending time with J.J.

467
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,989
Family, Dinah.
That helps us through.

468
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,677
John, living
in the shadows is

469
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,274
when all the worst
things happen.

470
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,155
Oliver going to prison,

471
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,310
Vince... first undercover,
and then...

472
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,797
That's the real reason,

473
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,792
because as much as I believed
in Team Arrow,

474
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,637
I had to move on.

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,957
I had to be
a different kind of hero

476
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
for this city.

477
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah.

478
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,200
You know, sometimes, I wonder
if there's any form of justice

479
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,792
that's 100% on the level,
even at A.R.G.U.S.

480
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,416
I think sometimes you need vigilantes
and law enforcement

481
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,000
working together
to get results.

482
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,279
Quentin Lance...

483
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,072
he did things
by the book,

484
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,797
but, Dinah, Lance
was willing to work

485
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,071
with anyone
who could help him.

486
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,553
This Green Arrow
isn't Oliver.

487
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,390
I can't risk everything
for a stranger.

488
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,992
But a stranger
with good intel.

489
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,834
Rene asked me to look
into Jon Cortez,

490
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,714
a merc arsonist
with his own crew for hire.

491
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
What you do next with that
information is up to you.

492
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,679
So this was Smoak Tech?

493
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,191
Must have been something
in its heyday.

494
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,670
This was Felicity's
office.

495
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,696
You know, it makes sense
that she would lead us here,

496
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,838
but wouldn't it just be easier
for her to reach out to me?

497
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,832
Why is she
playing games?

498
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,879
I have no idea.

499
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,616
I mean, ironically, she was the one
who influenced me

500
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,438
to go into
the tech field,

501
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,436
even after everything
that happened.

502
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,076
Well, you're a lot more
forgiving than me.

503
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,717
Looks like a system Felicity showed me
when I was a kid.

504
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,792
Back then, it was
just a set of designs.

505
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,400
Can you fix it?

506
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,351
It's an extremely outdated model,
so yes.

507
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,956
Just a simple
recursive algorithm

508
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,510
followed by a little
Felicity special.

509
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,997
Freeze!
This is a restricted area!

510
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,000
What are you doing here?

511
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,434
I'm sorry about this, guys.

512
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,399
I... I was supposed to
meet an investor,

513
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,995
and, um, obviously,
I got the wrong address.

514
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,440
You're such
a bad liar. Shut up.

515
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,000
Please don't kill us!

516
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,035
I'm not gonna hurt you.

517
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,317
You shouldn't have
come back here, Roy.

518
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,678
I knew digg was the right choice
for that phone call,

519
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
and Felicity didn't
answer.

520
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,197
John's not
bailing you out.

521
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,550
Listen. I can't have
you out there trying

522
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,752
to catch those
arsonists on your own.

523
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,594
You don't like that,
you can stay locked up in here,

524
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,636
but your intel...
it was good,

525
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,671
so help me catch them
by working with me.

526
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,350
I... I'm sorr...
i... I'm sorry.

527
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,671
Just, ears are
a little clogged.

528
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,793
It just sounded like
you wanted to team up.

529
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,191
Not permanently, no,

530
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,456
but in this case,
bending the rules

531
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,360
might be the only way to
serve the greater good.

532
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,311
That sounded like something
captain Lance used to say.

533
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,315
Exactly. Look. Right now,
the SCPD on its own,

534
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,473
we just... we can't get
justice for The Glades,

535
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,111
so I am willing to give
working together a shot

536
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,197
if you do it my way.

537
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,440
"If"? I've been trying
to make this happen for weeks.

538
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,956
All right.
A.R.G.U.S. found something

539
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,879
I don't have jurisdiction to
get to... bank records.

540
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,277
Jon Cortez has been receiving regular
payments from Patbane Holdings.

541
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,915
So let me guess.
Patbane holdings isn't on the up and up.

542
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,151
It's a shell company,
one that's been buying

543
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,875
these torched-up properties
at highly reduced rates.

544
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,312
So somebody's been burning down
The Glades and then buying it back up?

545
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,591
So who's at the top
of the Patbane food chain?

546
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,194
That's what we need
to find out.

547
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,155
OK. Time to
bail you out.

548
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,800
You scared the crap
out of me.

549
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,435
You find out
where Diaz is?

550
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,793
No. She's not
being very chatty.

551
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
Of course she's not.
Make her chat.

552
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,280
That's why you're here.

553
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:33,476
I tried,
and if I keep trying,

554
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,279
I'm gonna kill her.

555
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,631
Since when did you care
about anybody's life?

556
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,713
I don't, but if she's dead,
she can't talk,

557
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
and then we have nothing.

558
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,720
Which is what we
have now.

559
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We need
that information.

560
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,999
And you're gonna get it
with a rusty screwdriver?

561
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,669
If Diaz taught me anything,
it's patience.

562
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,999
He waited 30 years
to get revenge on one person.

563
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,629
We don't have
30 years.

564
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,359
- This isn't you.
- This is the new me.

565
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,115
This is the me who doesn't wait
around to get murdered.

566
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
This is the me...

567
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
this is the me
that fights back.

568
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,274
I respect that.

569
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,797
In fact, I can actually stand being
around this new you.

570
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,156
It's just once
you do this,

571
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,233
it's... It's really hard to get back to
who you were before,

572
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,920
and I don't know
if you ever can.

573
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,838
Well, I've already accepted that
my old life is over,

574
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,232
so I don't have
anything left to lose.

575
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Hey.

576
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,440
I used to be
just like you.

577
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
Well, that I find
hard to believe.

578
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,634
On my Earth,
I loved my father

579
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,871
and my Ollie, but they were
taken away from me

580
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,120
because they were
murdered.

581
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,237
<i>It's when you lose the people
who matter most.</i>

582
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,312
Once you get through the grief,
you get angry,

583
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,720
you want revenge,
and I took it,

584
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,317
but the darkness, it swallows you
the more you feed it,

585
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,472
and digging yourself
back out to the light,

586
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
it's...

587
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,360
It's really hard.

588
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,392
<i>In fact, I wish someone
would have warned me</i>

589
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,718
before I got blood
all over my hands the first time.

590
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,440
Maybe that way, I would have been
more like your Laurel.

591
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
I don't know
what else to do.

592
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,594
We need to play
the long-term game here.

593
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,110
I need you to use
that big brain of yours

594
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,509
and think.

595
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,800
You took out
those cops.

596
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,754
They would have killed Roy
for being a former vigilante

597
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,077
just like they
would have killed me.

598
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,313
I don't understand.

599
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,552
You were police captain.

600
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
What happened?

601
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,110
That was
a long time ago.

602
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah. There were
police everywhere,

603
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,396
and you just dragged us through
the sewer to get here.

604
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,239
What the hell happened
to Star City?

605
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,274
Star City fell
when The Glades Rose.

606
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,994
<i>They built a wall.</i>

607
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,119
They closed
their borders.

608
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,596
No one outside The Glades
is allowed to enter.

609
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,598
The SCPD are basically
hired guns.

610
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,514
They protect The Glades
from what's outside their wall.

611
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,036
I think maybe we should have
stayed on Lian Yu.

612
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,789
But then we wouldn't
have gotten this.

613
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,593
What is this thing?

614
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,552
It's a new form
of electrical therapy

615
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,719
that targets areas
of memory in the brain,

616
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,560
the places where our
greatest fears are held.

617
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,317
I've used it to help reform Slabside's
more stubborn cases.

618
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,080
I don't need to be
reformed.

619
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,438
Your will is one of the strongest
I've encountered,

620
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,353
but even mountains
fall over time.

621
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,433
Don't fight it.

622
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,160
<i>You can
survive this,</i>

623
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,760
make it home,
make it better,

624
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,191
right my wrongs, but you got to
live through this first.

625
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,595
<i>Are you
on the raft?</i>

626
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Yes.

627
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,554
What is your father
asking you?

628
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,911
He's asking me
to right his wrongs.

629
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,799
And setting you
on a road to ruin

630
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,156
that will one day
poison your son.

631
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
<i>Dad...</i>

632
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,758
I'm scared.

633
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,394
It's okay, buddy.

634
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,830
Come here.

635
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,496
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

636
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,840
It's gonna be fine.

637
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,856
Those last
moments on the raft,

638
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,918
your father asked you
to redeem his own life,

639
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,510
but if you had been
in his place,

640
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,353
what would you have
told your son?

641
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,318
We're gonna die here.

642
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,472
You're gonna make it
through this.

643
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,278
You're gonna get
off this raft,

644
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,832
and you, William,
you are...

645
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,557
Are gonna have
an amazing life...

646
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,992
Because you're destined
for great things,

647
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,475
not to die
on this raft.

648
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,710
Promise me that you will forget
about me,

649
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,473
and... and go live
your life.

650
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,120
Ohh.

651
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,390
Okay.

652
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,759
- Dad!
- William, I love you.

653
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Live.

654
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,917
You were talking
just now.

655
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,397
You told your son
you loved him. Why?

656
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,794
Because he's the most important
thing in the world to me.

657
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,556
Then it is up to you to
end your father's cycle

658
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,194
for the good
of your son.

659
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,233
Do you see
that now?

660
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,875
There. Guys in cyber untangled
the Patbane Holdings web.

661
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,272
This is our guy...
Marcus Fish,

662
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,352
a real estate investor
here in Star City.

663
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,836
He managed to buy up
real estate on every Glades block

664
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,474
where a fire happened.

665
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,960
Can't be a coincidence.

666
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,597
Cortez has been getting paid
in two installments...

667
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,797
half up front,
half the day after the job.

668
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,111
There's an odd number
of payments.

669
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,113
Patbane made a deposit
earlier today

670
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,515
but no second payment.

671
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,838
That means the next attack
is happening tonight.

672
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,816
You know, I heard somebody
was trying to buy

673
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,069
the starling palladium,

674
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,469
<i>old movie house
over on 8th.</i>

675
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,869
Owner's
a crotchety bastard.

676
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,230
Ain't no way
he'd ever sell.

677
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,880
And that's just
a few blocks from here.

678
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,554
<i>I am not your enemy.</i>

679
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,912
<i>Ha! You coward.
I smell your fear!</i>

680
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,276
<i>Not fear, my son,
but compassion.</i>

681
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Hyah!

682
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,320
We got company.

683
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,111
Hey, dummy.
Hands up.

684
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,116
Watch out!

685
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,680
- Thanks for the save.
- Where are the other two?

686
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,720
Guessing over there.

687
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Freeze!

688
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
<i>Nice shot.</i>

689
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,239
Back to work.
I'll take care of her.

690
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Drop it now!

691
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
You OK, D.?

692
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:45,201
Yeah. You got the others?

693
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,713
Yeah, we stopped them.
How do we stop this?

694
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,960
The sprinklers are jammed.
There's nothing to keep this from spreading.

695
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Help me get him.

696
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,920
D.!

697
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
You guys better clear out
before the cops arrive.

698
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,160
Scpd. Freeze!

699
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,680
Whoa! Stand down,
stand down!

700
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm a friendly.

701
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,079
<i>To center ice boosher.</i>

702
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,816
<i>Boosher with the stars.
Out front for Taylor.</i>

703
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,480
<i>Boosher takes it to the blue line.</i>

704
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,075
You're not, uh, here
to arrest me again, are you?

705
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,278
Uh, no, not today.
I actually just came

706
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,472
to drop this off
for Zoe

707
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,595
and to thank you

708
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,911
and your new
Green Arrow friend

709
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,514
for helping catch
the arsonists.

710
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,155
I really appreciate
what you did tonight.

711
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,189
Feels good to be fighting
side by side again.

712
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,476
Aunt Dinah,
what are you doing here?

713
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,439
Hey. So sorry, kiddo.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

714
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,080
Just checking to
make sure you're OK.

715
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,439
Brought you
a little something.

716
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,274
This is so cool.
Is it a bird?

717
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
Yeah. It's a canary.

718
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,032
Here. Let me help you.

719
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,075
Good evening.

720
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,554
Now that you've had time
to think things over,

721
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,359
have you come
to any conclusions?

722
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,956
- Yes.
- That's good to hear.

723
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,516
State your name.

724
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,677
My name is inmate 4587.

725
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,029
Where's Diaz?

726
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,391
If your friend isn't
getting it out of me,

727
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
you definitely aren't.

728
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,438
Diaz took everything
from me...

729
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,916
my husband,
my family, my life.

730
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,753
I don't have
anything to lose!

731
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,834
- Felicity!
- I'm getting that information.

732
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,116
Upstairs!

733
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,176
What the hell
is wrong with you?

734
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,680
You told me to
use my brain.

735
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,957
Your brain? That was
you using your brain?

736
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,616
You need to stop
with your little games

737
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,920
and let the grownups
handle this.

738
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
She's gone.

739
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,520
How'd you know she was
gonna take the belt?

740
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,711
Lucky guess. The RFID chip
I installed in it

741
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,200
is gonna lead us
straight to Diaz.

742
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Wow.

743
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,791
- What?
- You're different.

744
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,032
You remind me of the Felicity
from my Earth.

745
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,376
We know each other
on Earth Two?

746
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,959
Everybody knows you.

747
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,510
You run your own empire.

748
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,599
- This girl?
- Yep.

749
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,359
Except for she's ruthless.

750
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,079
Are you prepared
to be ruthless?

751
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,675
<i>Because once the silencer
leads us to Diaz,</i>

752
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,593
we won't just be
torturing him.

753
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,030
We're gonna have to
kill him.

754
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,800
Can you handle that?

755
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,713
This is a waste of time.

756
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,670
How much longer are
we gonna be trapped in here?

757
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,515
You used to be
a lot more patient.

758
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,831
Shouldn't be
too much longer.

759
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,296
Felicity told me that making
a pattern on a Rubik's Cube

760
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,277
is like running
an algorithm.

761
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,480
Her favorite
was cube in the cube

762
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,999
because it's a puzzle
within a puzzle.

763
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,796
<i>A cube in the cube.</i>

764
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,432
Still, no answers.

765
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,639
Wait. What?
What just happened?

766
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,192
Is that some sort
of map?

767
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,239
<i>It's The Glades.</i>

768
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,552
You two remember Zoe.

769
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,951
Hi, Roy, William.

770
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,318
Wh... what are you doing here?

771
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,712
I'm with the vigilante
resistance,

772
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,470
one of the few left fighting
to save Star City.

773
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,075
Is your dad here, too?

774
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,514
My dad wouldn't be
caught dead in Star City.

775
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,593
This map shows secret routes in
and out of The Glades.

776
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,395
Where did you get this?

777
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,032
Felicity. She's the one
who sent us to Star City.

778
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,680
No. That's impossible.

779
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,877
William, I'm so sorry to be
the one to tell you this,

780
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,755
but Felicity Smoak
is dead.

781
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,794
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
