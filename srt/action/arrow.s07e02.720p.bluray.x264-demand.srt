1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,918
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,117
<i>After 6 years
of being a vigilante,</i>

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,032
<i>the only way to achieve my goal</i>

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,591
<i>and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.</i>

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,390
<i>Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.</i>

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,676
<i>I am no longer a hero.</i>

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,912
<i>I am inmate 4587.</i>

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,160
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,736
The Bureau's going
to stay in Star City

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,989
until Diaz is
brought in,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,912
but only if Oliver
will turn himself in.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,911
Diaz found Felicity.
Your wife is dead.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,355
You're OK.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,877
I can't let what happened to
William and I happen again.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,156
I have to fight back.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,471
I know I want to keep
fighting for this city.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,256
I know you've been in some
hot water here at A.R.G.U.S.,

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
burning so many of their
resources going after Diaz.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,879
This place must be
very important for you.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
It's not the place.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
<i>It's the person I'm
hoping to find there.</i>

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,000
My father...

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,400
Is Oliver Queen.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,755
William?

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,274
Vacation's over, 4587.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,515
You're lucky you only got
two days in the hole

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,313
after what you pulled.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,279
Apparently, there are
still people in here

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,036
who believe
that you're a hero.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,240
But we know
better...

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,320
Don't we?

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,511
I asked you
a question, inmate.

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,552
You don't know
anything about me.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,154
Sure I do.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,709
I grew up with kids
just like you...

36
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,599
entitled, rich.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,514
Thought the law
didn't apply to them.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,916
But look at you now...
a criminal

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,789
just like every
other bastard in here.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,997
My wife and son
were attacked.

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,715
I'll do anything
to protect them.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,514
Oh, you're back! Oh, man.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,751
The way you beat the crap
out of that grim reaper guy

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,274
was awesome.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,840
That face looked like
hamburger meat.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,956
Where is he?

47
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,833
He's gone.

48
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,816
The warden found out that
he attacked you in the shower,

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,752
got sent down
to level two.

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,439
Which is worse than
a death sentence.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,512
He's my only lead on Diaz.

52
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,557
Don't worry. He
doesn't know anything.

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,279
He just got
a nice pay day.

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,319
Right. Why do you know that?

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,153
I asked around.

56
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,311
You should be
keeping to yourself.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,950
Asking questions in here
is going to get you killed.

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,271
Not when you're asking
for the Green Arrow.

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,470
Everyone
saw what you did,

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,153
and they're all afraid
of you.

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
'Cause we're friends,

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,079
now they're
afraid of me.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,880
All right. If that prisoner
wasn't behind the attack,

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,599
then who hired him?

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,479
That scary bald guy
who attacked me.

66
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,075
Right. Brick.

67
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,594
So what's our plan?

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,070
Beat him up?
Torture him for info?

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,072
Nope. We do it my way.

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,709
A little more.

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,754
A little more.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,536
Do you want me to put
a straw in the bottle?

73
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,756
Ah, ah! Don't judge me.

74
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,559
A.R.G.U.S. is my
designated driver tonight.

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,120
Indeed they are,
and every night

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,919
until we take Diaz
off the board.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
That psycho has been
M.I.A. 5 months,

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,717
and then he goes after
Oliver and Felicity.

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,234
Why now?

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,400
Well, whatever he's up to,
now we know it's personal.

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,000
Which is exactly
why I put Laurel

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,395
on protective detail.

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
She's got to be
high on his hit list.

84
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,680
Not that I
don't enjoy talking about

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,991
all the ways that Diaz
can get to us.

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,754
Anybody have any idea how
we can get to him?

87
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,599
Well, I've been
working on that.

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,776
What the heck
is that thing?

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,096
I call it my
digi murder board.

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,376
I mean, I can probably
work on the name,

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,416
but it analyzes all the data
we've collected on Diaz.

92
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,896
Plus, it searches for
additional intel

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,216
and then it makes
predictive suggestions.

94
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,391
So it's like a brain that
only thinks about Diaz.

95
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
- Mm.
- Gross...

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,600
- Yeah.
- But also cool.

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,956
That's an electronic jammer.

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,560
What is Diaz doing
with tech like that?

99
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,896
Well, it's the same
tech he used to bust

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,736
my A.R.G.U.S. security system
when he attacked me.

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,275
Well, a model that sophisticated
is very hard to get.

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,589
Diaz has new friends.

103
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,936
Which is why I wrote
algorithms to track

104
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,555
all his known associates,
like Cyrus Broderick

105
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,915
and the Longbow Hunters.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,878
Well, this is all
great work, Felicity.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,959
Just remember you don't have
to do it all alone, OK?

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,576
We've all got your back,
whatever you need.

109
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,193
I know. Thank you.
I... I appreciate it.

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,078
But what I need is
for Diaz to go down.

111
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,391
There is somebody else
who might be able to help.

112
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,696
If you say, "the new
Green Arrow,"

113
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm gonna punch you
in the face.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,673
You did say,
whatever she needed.

115
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,616
There is only one Green Arrow,
and he's in prison.

116
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,360
OK, enough squabbling
and murder boarding.

117
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,794
Let's toast.

118
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,794
To friends reunited,
to being back home,

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,679
and to bringing that son of
a bitch Diaz to justice.

120
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,877
- I'll drink to that.
- Hear! Hear!

121
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,758
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

122
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,276
Felicity and Oliver,
they really...

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,670
They really just
left you?

124
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,434
Pretty much.

125
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
And my ex-boyfriend
wonders why

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,957
I have commitment issues.

127
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,555
I'm sorry. That's awful.

128
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,154
Yeah, he was a real jerk.

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,936
No. I was talking about
Oliver and Felicity.

130
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,795
Yeah, well, I survived.

131
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,593
So what about you?

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,034
What's your excuse
for being here?

133
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,474
Where'd you get that?

134
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,753
Oh, um, Felicity
gave it to me.

135
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,674
She said it was a symbol
of reconnection.

136
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,437
I thought it was B.S.,

137
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,275
but then, uh, 3 weeks ago,
it started to beep.

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,189
I opened it up...

139
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,391
And I found this.

140
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,995
They're GPS coordinates
for this island.

141
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,949
Wait. Why would Felicity
send you to Lian Yu?

142
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,119
Cruel joke?

143
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,635
You know, the last time
I was on this island...

144
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,793
Was the day my mother died.

145
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,911
I still have nightmares
about it.

146
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,556
But I came anyway.

147
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,712
Well, trust me,
looking for answers is

148
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,234
only gonna cause
you pain.

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,718
So what I would do is
I would take that,

150
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,917
and I'd throw it right
there in the ocean

151
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,159
and never look back.

152
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,831
Hi there. I'm looking
for global solutions.

153
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,151
Second floor, ma'am.
Everything above that's restricted.

154
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,680
Tom, can I ask you a favor?

155
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,160
I have an interview
with gs,

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,311
and I somehow ended up
here without a pen,

157
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,159
and I really need that job.

158
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,640
Of course.

159
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,116
Pardon me.

160
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,998
I am so sorry.

161
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,598
Excuse me, ma'am.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,520
Who the hell are you?

163
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,871
So much for not
making a mess.

164
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,713
I got bored.

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,990
Number 326.

166
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,197
Where the hell is she?

167
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,840
You or me?

168
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,274
Be my guest.

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,234
That never gets old.

170
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,471
We need to get out of here.
Did you get it?

171
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,555
Thanks
a million, Tom.

172
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,916
No problem.
How was the interview?

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,878
I think I nailed it.

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,829
Shortly after 0900
this morning,

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,434
a break-In was reported

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,557
at one of our off-site
facilities.

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,917
Only one item was stolen...
prototype b-24.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,593
It's an ultra...

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,896
High-density
renewable battery?

180
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,639
I didn't even know
those existed yet.

181
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,394
One super battery has enough
juice to power a town.

182
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,199
We were using them
to help refugees.

183
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,192
What kind of jerk gets
in the way of that?

184
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,256
Well, maybe you would know
if John let you in on his briefing.

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,016
Well, I do not have a high
enough security clearance.

186
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,056
Plus, I heard deputy Director Bell's
gonna be in there,

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,639
and he scares me.

188
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,916
You know, I could just get
us the unredacted report.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,720
Uh, no. I actually
like my job, OK?

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,792
Whoever did this
knows their tech.

191
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,856
They used an electronic jammer
to get past security.

192
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,600
Yes! The same tech that Diaz
used to breach my safe house

193
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
in hope Springs.

194
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,672
That is not
a coincidence, Curtis.

195
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,875
Can you tell what type of
weapons they used in the heist?

196
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,056
High-tech shield, nano-powered
darts, Sonic manipulator.

197
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,639
These are
super impressive weapons.

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,792
Not just impressive.
They're specific.

199
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,834
This was
definitely...

200
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,354
the Longbow Hunters.

201
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,671
According to our source,
Anatoly Knyazev,

202
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,878
they were hired by our old friend,
Ricardo Diaz.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,435
These assassins are
extremely dangerous,

204
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,240
and we need to find them
and shut them down.

205
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,312
You have
your assignments.

206
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,398
Deputy Director Bell,
I'm surprised to see

207
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,914
you made time for
this briefing.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,673
I wanted to check in,

209
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,195
given the reappearance
of Ricardo Diaz.

210
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,476
I know you have
a personal connection.

211
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,233
Well, I appreciate
the concerns.

212
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,720
I assure you my priorities are
in the right place.

213
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,516
Diaz is a son of a bitch,

214
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,513
but A.R.G.U.S. isn't chartered
for criminal investigations.

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,834
That's why recovering
that tech is the objective.

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,671
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,479
I know it's
the Longbow Hunters.

218
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,392
You have to let me in
on this operation.

219
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,630
A.R.G.U.S. is
handling it.

220
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,800
Told you! Ahem.

221
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,150
The Longbow Hunters are
a direct connection to Diaz.

222
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,471
They are the best lead
we've had on him in months.

223
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,155
You know it, John. John,
I need to do something.

224
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,994
I know, and I'm sorry,
but A.R.G.U.S. has its protocols.

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,176
- John...
- We will keep you updated.

226
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,954
Felicity,
just trust me.

227
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,560
Laurel...

228
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,596
We need to talk.

229
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,433
If this is about
the Conway Case,

230
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,512
I already told anastas
I need more time.

231
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,637
That is not why I'm here,
and you know it.

232
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,679
Aw. Did you miss me?
That's so sweet.

233
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,277
Laurel, you ditched your
protective detail again.

234
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,477
Perhaps you should get your
facts straight, captain.

235
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,473
Your officers had
a medical emergency.

236
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,279
Food poisoning,
I think it was.

237
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,353
Food poisoning does not
cause hearing loss or vertigo.

238
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,477
You know what does?
A sonic wave.

239
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,035
Ooh, that sounds
serious.

240
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,032
This isn't a joke, Laurel.

241
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,416
You know, I just heard
from A.R.G.U.S.

242
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,750
The Longbow Hunters are
in Star City.

243
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,433
Diaz won't be far behind.

244
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,954
Matter of fact,
for all we know,

245
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,838
he could already be
in town.

246
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,038
Now, I don't really care
if Diaz kills you,

247
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,719
but I do care
if he kills the D.A.

248
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,476
Touching.

249
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,880
Diaz kidnapped you.

250
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,998
He killed Quentin, who everyone
believes is your father.

251
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,116
Such a joke.

252
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,839
Hey, I cared about him.

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,351
Then let my officers
protect you.

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,274
It's what he
would have wanted.

255
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,997
I can take care
of myself.

256
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,234
Fine.

257
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Isn't baby-sitting

258
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,576
a little bit below
your pay grade?

259
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,514
Way below, but the SCPD
is going to keep you safe,

260
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,751
whether you
want us to or not.

261
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,200
OK, fine, whatever.
Suit yourself.

262
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,760
You might as well
make yourself useful

263
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,797
while you're here
and go get me a coffee.

264
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,234
Two sugars, no cream.

265
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,274
That's never happening.

266
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,155
Ricardo Diaz.

267
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,560
That seat's taken.

268
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,816
You're gonna tell me
where to find him.

269
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,435
Hey, you sure
you want to do that?

270
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,176
I still haven't gotten
a chance to thank you

271
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,520
for sending me to the hole.

272
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,193
I guess you don't know
your place here.

273
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,794
You may have gotten
your fight back,

274
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,554
but we're still at the top
of this food chain.

275
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,474
It's OK, boys.
I got this.

276
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,954
Diaz? Don't ring
any bells.

277
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,396
You hired those prisoners
to attack me in the shower

278
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,960
for Diaz.

279
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,677
So why don't you tell me
how I can find him?

280
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,959
You know what your
problem is, Queen?

281
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,109
You've forgotten
where you are.

282
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,032
This is prison,

283
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,679
and you're playing
by the wrong rules.

284
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,797
I'm not in any mood
for games, brick.

285
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,996
What I'm saying is

286
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,878
if you want to be
a mate of mine,

287
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,316
you got to prove yourself worthy
of my friendship.

288
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,636
What do you want?

289
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,718
I want him gone.

290
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,236
Why?

291
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,437
That is no concern
of yours.

292
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,954
You just take care
of that guard,

293
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,509
and I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

294
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,875
Everybody wins.

295
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,590
Fine.

296
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,316
Queen.

297
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,073
If you say anything
to anybody,

298
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,038
the deal is off.

299
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
Please tell me
you are

300
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,758
not hacking A.R.G.U.S.

301
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,479
From inside A.R.G.U.S.

302
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,136
Of course I'm not hacking A.R.G.U.S.
from inside A.R.G.U.S.

303
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,277
I'm hacking Interpol
from inside A.R.G.U.S.

304
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,510
That's not much better,

305
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,319
and that will still
get me fired.

306
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,518
Felicity, I really
like this job.

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,638
Look, I know how badly
you want to get Diaz,

308
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
but we need to listen
to John.

309
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,954
A.R.G.U.S. is more than
capable of doing the job

310
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,032
while we wait
and eat some snacks.

311
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm not waiting
for A.R.G.U.S.

312
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,096
That's exactly what Oliver wanted me
to do, and Diaz found me anyway.

313
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,237
OK, well, maybe we can find
the Longbow Hunters

314
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,959
without committing
espionage?

315
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,440
Can I please...
just for one second.

316
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,830
OK. Now, we know they
have a super battery.

317
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,776
Chances are they've tried to test it.
And doing that...

318
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,416
Would require an incredible
amount of energy,

319
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,096
which would, in turn,
create a power surge.

320
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,480
Which we can pinpoint and
then trace to a specific location.

321
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,160
Ohh! I miss this.
I miss working with you.

322
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,873
I miss hacking
Star City's power grid.

323
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,600
- I mean, it just feels right.
- Bingo! A huge voltage spike

324
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
in a warehouse
in Pennytown

325
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
about an hour ago.

326
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,309
- Great.
- You actually want to go there?

327
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,616
Of course you do. I really
should've thought this through.

328
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,216
Look, I'm not gonna engage
with the Longbow Hunters.

329
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,536
I'm just gonna grab one of
your T-spheres and use it

330
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,438
to track them back
to Diaz. No big.

331
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,034
Very big.
You know what?

332
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,270
I'm coming
to back you up.

333
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,750
And who's gonna back you up?

334
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,672
I might know a guy.

335
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,470
Back in town a week,

336
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,056
and you're already
sneaking out of A.R.G.U.S.

337
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,311
Behind papa diggs' back?

338
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,278
- I'm so proud.
- Thanks, man.

339
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,555
Don't encourage her, OK?

340
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,433
She's already moved
on to espionage.

341
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,636
Thanks for coming out,
Rene.

342
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,976
I know it's not the best
time to be Wild Dog,

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,216
what with the whole
25-to-life thing.

344
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,596
Wild dog's not here.
You see a hockey mask?

345
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,456
Besides, this is exactly
what we should've been doing

346
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,075
in the first place instead of waiting
for Diaz to come to us.

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,080
The scan's complete.

348
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,753
The Longbow Hunters
aren't home.

349
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,480
Damn. So we can't follow
them back to Diaz

350
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,920
if they're not here
to be followed.

351
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,156
We can go inside.

352
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,879
Curtis, relax.

353
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,696
I just want to put a couple
trackers on a few things.

354
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Five minutes, tops.

355
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,759
Are you familiar
with the expression

356
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,593
"famous last words"?

357
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,520
Grab your balls, Curtis.
We're going in.

358
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,751
They're not balls.
They're T-spheres.

359
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,776
Feels weird doing this without Oliver
and without a headset.

360
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,096
I'm more worried
about you holding in

361
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,440
so many snarky
overwatch comments.

362
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,278
Guys, look at this.

363
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
Anything worth putting
a tracker on is

364
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,280
definitely behind that door.

365
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,816
Damn. I should've included
a lock pick module

366
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,160
in my last
T-sphere update.

367
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,072
Never bring a T-sphere
to a gun fight.

368
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,439
Jackpot. Let's
plant the tracker.

369
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,240
You work on that.
I'll work on this.

370
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,456
Oh, frak. I think I just triggered
a system self-destruct.

371
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,856
Guys, we got
a bigger problem.

372
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
We're not alone.

373
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,360
Stay behind me.

374
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,274
I think I get the whole
"famous last words" thing now.

375
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,918
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot! John!

376
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,480
John, it's us.

377
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,353
You three realize you've just
compromised an active investigation?

378
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,376
Yes. But in my defense, we wouldn't
have had to do any of this

379
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,216
if you had just included
me in the first place.

380
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,038
We wanted it
as much as you did, digg.

381
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,256
Rene, before you say
another word,

382
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,034
realize that A.R.G.U.S. is quite aware
of your immunity agreement.

383
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,634
Just because you're not
wearing a mask

384
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,473
doesn't mean
you're not breaking the law.

385
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,096
You wouldn't really
turn him in, though.

386
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,440
But would you?

387
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,832
Felicity, A.R.G.U.S.
has its rules.

388
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,240
What the hell were you
thinking?

389
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,232
I was thinking about
catching Diaz.

390
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,616
There are bigger things
at stake here.

391
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,869
Like what,
batteries?

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,736
It's not just a battery,
Rene. It's a weapon.

393
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,274
Say what, now?

394
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,271
A.R.G.U.S. developed
an adapter...

395
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,016
an adapter that calibrates
the charge to power

396
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,394
a directed energy weapon.

397
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,536
It's enough to flatten
a whole city.

398
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,835
God.

399
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,752
How were we supposed
to know that?

400
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,752
You didn't need to
know that, Curtis.

401
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,957
Please just pack up the
laptop. Restore the data.

402
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,216
We need to find out what
the Longbow Hunters are doing next.

403
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,276
That could take forever.

404
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,920
The security virus wiped
the hard drive.

405
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,071
You have a better
idea, Felicity?

406
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,631
Your little stunt just blew
our best possible lead.

407
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,400
This is prison.

408
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,016
There's tons of guys in
here that would be

409
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,157
happy to handle yorke,
if you know what I mean.

410
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,277
Yorke's a hardass, but he
doesn't deserve to die.

411
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,430
Just...

412
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,959
I need to find
his pressure point.

413
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,398
Wwgad?

414
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,550
What?

415
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,994
What would
Green Arrow do?

416
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,514
Oh. I...

417
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,391
He'd have overwatch
gather information.

418
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,550
What's an overwatch?

419
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,800
We need a computer.

420
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,838
Once we get inside, we'll have
two minutes before the guards miss us.

421
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,675
You up for this?

422
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,117
Yeah. Hell, yeah. It's my
first Green Arrow mission.

423
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,834
What the hell?

424
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,151
No one moves! Everyone,
stay right where you are.

425
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,756
Control, we need
backup near the showers!

426
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
Does this thing even
have the Internet?

427
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,159
We'll soon find out.

428
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,596
Even if it does, they don't let
felons surf the web.

429
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,400
My wife taught me
a thing or two. Sit tight.

430
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,995
And we got him.

431
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,480
OK, so what are
we looking for?

432
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,317
Anything that will
give me leverage.

433
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,600
Peter yorke was born
in 1978.

434
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,831
He joins the army at 19,
serves 8 years.

435
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,116
Commendations,
injured in line of duty.

436
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,475
Started working
at slabside,

437
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,656
and he's been here
ever since.

438
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,909
He's been here
for 12 years.

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,229
No wonder he's
such a jerk.

440
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,436
He's got no complaints.

441
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,920
He's got
no disciplinary record.

442
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,913
He's a jerk, but he's
a law-abiding jerk.

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,196
No one that's clean.
There's got to be something.

444
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,515
Look at that.

445
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,711
He's got a wife
and a kid.

446
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,234
I bet a guy
like that would do

447
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,516
just about anything to
keep his family safe.

448
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,717
<i>All right!
Back in line!</i>

449
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,919
We gotta go.

450
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,195
You're still here.

451
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,670
Stubbornness must be
hereditary.

452
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,896
I'm a guy who spent over
a billion dollars trying to develop

453
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,389
affordable
magnetic levitation.

454
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,994
I don't give up
so easily.

455
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,993
Wow. You've done really
good for yourself,

456
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
considering everything
that's happened.

457
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,593
You know,
when I first met you,

458
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,830
you were
with my aunt Thea.

459
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,656
The two of you were leaving
somewhere together and...

460
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,275
you're not gonna get anywhere
with me by dredging up the past.

461
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,272
I came here to forget
about all of that.

462
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,078
When Felicity gave
me this,

463
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,595
she told me it was
about reconnecting.

464
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,470
And it led me here
to you.

465
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,119
That can't be
a coincidence.

466
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,475
I know exactly
what this is.

467
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,200
Come on.

468
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,113
Hey, where's the D.A.?

469
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,112
She said she
needed some air.

470
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,919
Damn it.

471
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,590
I'm still a ways off
from repairing the laptop,

472
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,273
but I have compiled
a list of known

473
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,352
directed energy weapons,
which could be powered

474
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,318
using
a modified battery.

475
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,712
This list has too many
potential targets

476
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,439
for this agency
to reasonably protect.

477
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,512
We need whatever's
on that laptop.

478
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,920
You blocked my computer?

479
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,514
What the hell, John?

480
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,996
That's my cue.
Heh.

481
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,399
Felicity, we can
no longer risk you

482
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,994
interfering with
this mission.

483
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,230
This is not
Team Arrow.

484
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,536
This is an
A.R.G.U.S. operation.

485
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,000
Please. I'm asking
for your patience.

486
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,673
I'm out of patience, John.

487
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,958
You have your life,
your home, your family,

488
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,838
but I lost everything,
and bringing down Diaz

489
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,832
is the only way for me
to get it all back.

490
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,718
Felicity, you can't
get it back.

491
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,599
Your old life...
our old life... Is over.

492
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,389
And taking down Diaz
will not change that.

493
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,598
Oliver's gone,

494
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,151
and he is not coming back
for a very long time.

495
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,480
I need you
to accept that.

496
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,392
I can't...

497
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,839
And I won't.

498
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,793
And I can't believe
that you do.

499
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,758
The old John would've
done anything

500
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,480
to bring down that monster,
and you're... you're here.

501
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,496
And you wouldn't even take
up the Green Arrow mantle...

502
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,432
the only thing that Oliver
asked you to do.

503
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,833
You've moved on
with your life.

504
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,480
The last 6 years actually
meant something to me.

505
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,869
So I am going to stop Diaz,
whatever it takes,

506
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,191
even if I have
to do it alone.

507
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,216
You know, just because
yorke isn't dirty,

508
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,436
doesn't mean we
can't get him fired.

509
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,239
Blackmail's pretty much
a prerequisite

510
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,913
for getting in this place.

511
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,358
I'm not about to ruin
an innocent man's life, OK?

512
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,316
Not the Green Arrow way.
Noted.

513
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,640
I'm starting to think

514
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,275
you've lost interest in
my information, Queen.

515
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,840
Yorke's clean.

516
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,435
There are other ways of
getting rid of somebody,

517
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,795
a more permanent way.

518
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,199
That's not how I do things.

519
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,873
That's not how you do
things out there.

520
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,231
You asked me
to take care of yorke.

521
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,356
You didn't say how.

522
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,397
Well, let me
make this clear.

523
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,471
You use that to get
rid of yorke,

524
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,119
or I will.

525
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,677
Cell check!

526
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,911
Cell check time.

527
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,151
You're up, 4587.

528
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,919
You know the drill.

529
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,594
Yorke, you need
to listen to me.

530
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,149
No chitchat, inmate.

531
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,553
Someone in here
wants you dead.

532
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,399
Everyone
in here wants me dead.

533
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,160
Yorke, I don't care
if you quit or transfer,

534
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,550
but whatever you do,
you need to do it today.

535
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,756
Do you understand?

536
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,216
I have no idea what kind
of game you're playing,

537
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,597
but if you don't
knock it off, I promise

538
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,080
you'll regret it.

539
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,232
I'm not playing a game.
I am trying to help you.

540
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,754
I don't need your help,
inmate.

541
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,231
I just want to do
the right thing.

542
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,070
The right thing?

543
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,358
Is that what you
were doing,

544
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,675
running around in
that costume?

545
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,599
You turned the law
into a joke.

546
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,235
The Green Arrow's
very existence

547
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,676
invited criminals
into your city.

548
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,991
You think you're
some kind of hero.

549
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,679
Have you ever
stopped to think

550
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,835
maybe all you've done
is make things worse?

551
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,196
Hey. Can we talk?

552
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,434
Not unless it's about Diaz.

553
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,336
Felicity, I want you
to know I understand

554
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,079
why you're angry
at me.

555
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,277
But I have not forgotten
Oliver or this team

556
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,033
or you.

557
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,839
But I need you to hear
why I chose

558
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,957
not to become
the Green Arrow.

559
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,990
Felicity, I watched as
Oliver, you, and William

560
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,833
lost everything
important in life

561
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,479
because of that hood.

562
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
And I wanted to.

563
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,280
I wanted to put it on
because Oliver asked me to,

564
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,834
but I couldn't.

565
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,400
The truth is...

566
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,273
I saw what the hood did
to you and your family.

567
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,280
And I couldn't do it
to mine.

568
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,838
Maybe that was selfish,

569
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
but I just couldn't make
that kind of sacrifice,

570
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,355
and I couldn't ask that
of Lyla or J.J.

571
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,599
It's not selfish.

572
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,036
I'd like to think that I'm
honoring Oliver's mission

573
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,873
without putting
that suit on.

574
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,839
I respect that you want
to keep fighting.

575
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,513
Oliver turned himself in

576
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,876
so the FBI would help us
take down Diaz.

577
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,077
I may not agree with
the decision,

578
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,715
but as long as Diaz is
still out there,

579
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,794
Oliver's sacrifice will
have been for nothing.

580
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,077
Sorry to interrupt.
John, you have to see this.

581
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,496
I was finally able to pull the data
from that damaged hard drive.

582
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,557
Train schematics.

583
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Let me guess.

584
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
One of these directed energy
weapons on your list

585
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,194
is being transported
by train.

586
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,272
Yup. It's being shipped
out of Star City

587
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,794
for testing tonight.

588
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,936
We can't let
the Longbow Hunters

589
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,189
get their hands
on that weapon.

590
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,239
John, wait. No one knows
the Longbow Hunters better that I do.

591
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,631
Felicity, if you're gonna help, you got
to do this the A.R.G.U.S. way. Deal?

592
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Deal.

593
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,676
Hey.

594
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,319
What are you doing here?

595
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,311
You know, I should be asking
you the same question.

596
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,914
How did you find me?

597
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,158
Well, I am a cop,
Laurel.

598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
What is this place?

599
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,358
Diaz bought it right after
he joined the quadrant.

600
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,999
Planning on renovating,

601
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,754
he wanted to turn it
into his own castle.

602
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,152
And you think he's
in there?

603
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,994
Well, I don't think he's welcome
at the Star City Plaza.

604
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,990
All right. Fine.

605
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Call it in, then.

606
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,039
No, no.
This is my fight.

607
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,318
Oh. Heh. Right.

608
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,755
This is what you've been
planning all along, isn't it?

609
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,496
This is why you've been
refusing protection.

610
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,193
Because you're going
to kill him.

611
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,275
Let's hope so.

612
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,716
If Diaz is in this building,
the SCPD is going to be

613
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,029
the one to take him down,

614
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,336
and we're going to do
it the right way.

615
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,194
I'm not interested
in doing things the right way.

616
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,192
That monster killed
Quentin.

617
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,794
I want to see him
in hell,

618
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,315
and I want to be the one
that sends him there myself.

619
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,396
You know, I knew you were
faking it this whole time, Laurel.

620
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,997
Becoming the D.A. and all your
B.S. talk about the rule of law.

621
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,150
You know, deep down,

622
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,994
you are still the same
lying murderer

623
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,753
who killed the man I loved.

624
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,712
I'm not that person
anymore.

625
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,235
But someone has to get
justice for Quentin,

626
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,312
and you know it.

627
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,834
So don't you dare
try and stop me.

628
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,910
Alpha team's
in position.

629
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Sitrep?

630
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,376
<i>Your train
is right on schedule.</i>

631
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,517
60 seconds till the first
car reaches your position.

632
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,432
Copy that.

633
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,034
Overwatch,
you ready for this?

634
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,112
Oh, I've been ready
for 5 months.

635
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,469
Overwatch,
I'm on the train.

636
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
<i>Copy that.</i>

637
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,136
I've logged into the train control
and management system.

638
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,958
I'm now inside the brain
of the train.

639
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,196
<i>Where's the weapon?</i>

640
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,616
It's in the fourth car
from the back.

641
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,279
- Any sign of our friends?
- Not yet.

642
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,736
You're coming up on
the bader tunnel.

643
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,037
We will have a snapshot from their thermal
imaging camera in about 30 seconds.

644
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,835
Hey. That way.

645
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
That'll be
the engineer.

646
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,157
There. That'll be the Longbow Hunters...
two of them, at least.

647
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,352
John, we got two bogies, both
in the baggage car in front of you.

648
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,954
Where's the other one?

649
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,032
Oh, my god. John,
he's right above you.

650
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,990
Hold your fire!

651
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,753
Get to the weapon!

652
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,275
Hello there.

653
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,794
It's gas!

654
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,394
Get out of here! Go! Go! Go!

655
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,916
Oops.
Guess it's locked.

656
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,096
Overwatch, we're trapped!

657
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,440
Already on it.
Hang on, John.

658
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,834
Diaz.

659
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,240
Diaz is there?

660
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Felicity!

661
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,036
Sorry! On it. Got it.

662
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,576
<i>You're almost there. The weapon is
two cars in front of you.</i>

663
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,274
Go help the others!
I'll secure the weapon.

664
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,674
Are you OK?

665
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,989
Yeah, I think so.

666
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,279
How the hell
did she do that?

667
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,357
I have no idea.

668
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,797
Diaz, freeze!

669
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,036
Hands up, slowly.

670
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,199
You miss me, John?

671
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,279
Yeah!

672
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,032
Hyah!

673
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,152
Uh!

674
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,033
I've got the battery.

675
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,349
Felicity, when I tell you,

676
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,079
<i>I need you to uncouple
that flatcar.</i>

677
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,356
What? No.

678
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,874
We can't let Diaz escape.

679
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,794
We can't let him get
ahold of that weapon either!

680
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,633
Felicity, do it now!

681
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,598
I can't. He'll get away.

682
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,517
I thought I could do it
your way.

683
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,670
And then I saw Diaz.

684
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,036
There's no need
to explain.

685
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,712
I just wanted to make
sure you're OK.

686
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,393
I'm not.

687
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,955
I understand why you did
what you did.

688
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,989
The world is a safer place

689
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,799
because Diaz doesn't
have that weapon.

690
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,954
I was wrong before.

691
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,713
You may now be working
here at A.R.G.U.S.,

692
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,269
but you're still honoring
Oliver's mission.

693
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,397
I appreciate
your saying that.

694
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,551
But I still can't rest
until I know

695
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,597
that my family is safe...

696
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,696
Which means I need to work
with someone whose focus is

697
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,439
bringing down Diaz...

698
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,359
And that someone is
not you.

699
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,790
I'm guessing that was your
last mission with A.R.G.U.S.

700
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,996
Yeah.

701
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,309
And probably
with me, too.

702
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,153
I'm sorry, Curtis.

703
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,674
What are you gonna do?

704
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,991
Find help somewhere else.

705
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,236
I don't think you
understand our deal.

706
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,433
It's a limited-time
offer,

707
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,591
and it's just
about to expire.

708
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,239
I understand.

709
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,837
I'm gonna take care of him.

710
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,910
Oliver told me what was
buried on this island.

711
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,037
When I got here,

712
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,800
I found the 4 graves
that he had mentioned,

713
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,837
but then...

714
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,912
Then I found this one.

715
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,560
So, look, I can take care of this
on my own if you want.

716
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,456
Look, I would love
to miss out

717
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,360
on staring into the face
of a desiccated corpse,

718
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,119
but I think it'll
go quicker if I help.

719
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,475
I don't get it.
It's my father's bow.

720
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,136
I can't even shoot an Arrow.

721
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,720
Why would Felicity
want me to have this?

722
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,553
I know why.

723
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,319
Wait. What the hell?

724
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,016
Grab your stuff.
We're going back.

725
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,033
- Back? Back where?
- To Star City.

726
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,790
Laurel.

727
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,920
Isn't that supposed
to be a doughnut?

728
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,439
So funny.

729
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,113
Can you give us a minute?

730
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,360
I just... uh, I wanted
to come by and thank you

731
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,120
for the backup.

732
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,555
Also, from now on, I will
be accepting protection

733
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,040
from the SCPD.

734
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,435
No more ditching,
no more complaining.

735
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,830
Well, maybe
a little complaining.

736
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,472
Well, uh,
I appreciate that.

737
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,556
Anything else?

738
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,194
No. That's it.

739
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,795
Actually, that's not it.

740
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,671
I know that Quentin
wasn't my father...

741
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,351
Not... not the father
that raised me anyway.

742
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,995
And... i guess I had
just forgotten

743
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,630
what it felt like to have
someone who cared about me.

744
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,194
And losing him, it was
the worst pain

745
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,795
that I've felt
in a very long time.

746
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,676
And I can only imagine
how you must have felt

747
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,558
after vinny's death.

748
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,670
Please don't.

749
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,717
Listen, I don't expect
you to forgive me...

750
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,637
But I have to tell you
that I am truly sorry

751
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,632
about killing vinny.

752
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,630
And I hope one day,

753
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,200
you'll see that I am
not that person.

754
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,600
Not anymore.

755
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,311
This Diaz guy seems like
a real nightmare,

756
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,474
but you sure this is
a good idea?

757
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,671
My way's not working.

758
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,039
Do I have a choice?

759
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,033
Hey. Hey!

760
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,559
What's your problem?

761
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,116
I know you're not
talking to me, inmate.

762
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,635
You've had it in for me
since day one.

763
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,712
You need to
shut your mouth

764
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,473
and get back.

765
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,356
Do your wife and son know
you're such a dick?

766
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,954
What did you just say?

767
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,791
It's Jenna and Noah, right?

768
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,519
You don't say
their names.

769
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,879
Uh! Uh! Aah.

770
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,997
You... you stabbed me.

771
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,276
- What? I didn't stab you.
- Get away from him.

772
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,176
The video! That guard
stabbed me. He stabbed me!

773
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,238
I didn't... dunbar,
what are you doing?

774
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,476
I didn't touch him.

775
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,031
- Get him out of here.
- No! Wait. No! He's lying!

776
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,510
I didn't do anything!

777
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,238
<i>Thank you for
agreeing to see me.</i>

778
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,313
You made a deal
with my husband.

779
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,835
And he's in prison
because of it.

780
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,313
Now it's your turn to hold up
your side of the bargain.

781
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,110
We're gonna take down
Ricardo Diaz...

782
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,030
Together.

783
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,634
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
