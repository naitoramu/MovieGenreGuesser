1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,088
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:06,257
<i>For 7 years, I have fought
with only one goal...</i>

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:07,759
<i>to save my city,</i>

4
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,385
<i>but now a new threat
has emerged,</i>

5
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:11,095
<i>a danger so severe,
it has forced me</i>

6
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:12,972
<i>to leave my family
in order to face it,</i>

7
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,713
<i>and it won't be enough for me
to just be the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:17,393
<i>To prevent the crisis
that's coming,</i>

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,200
<i>I am going to have to become
someone else.</i>

10
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>I am going to have
to become... something else.</i>

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,859
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

12
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,421
Turns out Connor doesn't know
his brother as well as he thinks.

13
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,725
We're all still
alive, aren't we?

14
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,156
Which means what exactly,

15
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:31,842
that your brother's not
such a bad guy?

16
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,117
What did you do?

17
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,095
- You are not gonna touch me.
- Oh, my God.

18
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,120
Because if you do,

19
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:38,087
the men who are storming
your bunker right now

20
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:39,290
will kill your brother.

21
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,543
I ignored the orders
of a cosmic being,

22
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,127
and as a result,
I watched

23
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,629
an entire world
disappear.

24
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:46,756
We're facing
the destruction of everything?

25
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,609
That's the very definition
of all hands on deck.

26
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,093
A lot of people
have died already

27
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,380
for the sake
of this mission.

28
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,031
I owe it to all of them
to find out who

29
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,264
the Monitor really is.

30
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,599
- So what's the plan?
- I'm going to Nanda Parbat.

31
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:35,888
Ollie?

32
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:38,891
Hi, Speedy.

33
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,859
Well, I'm guessing
Mia's for Mom

34
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,320
and not my Corto Maltese
alias.

35
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,821
Good guess.

36
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,326
She's beautiful, Ollie.

37
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:01,789
Where'd you get that?

38
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,416
Athena.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,668
I wasn't expecting to
find you here alone.

40
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,253
Where's Nyssa?

41
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,964
Thailand, I think.
I don't know.

42
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,884
After we destroyed
the Lazarus Pits,

43
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,262
she said she had some
League business to take care of.

44
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,640
You destroyed the Pits.

45
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,017
Why didn't you
come home?

46
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,686
Pits may be gone,
but the Thanatos Guild isn't.

47
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:28,232
I have to take them down
after what they did to Roy.

48
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,860
That's fair.
Have you seen him?

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,696
He came back here
after Star City.

50
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,740
He told me what happened,

51
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:39,243
how he killed
those men and...

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,038
He's dealing
with his own demons.

53
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:43,748
He'll be back.

54
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:47,585
I missed you.

55
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,962
I missed you, too.

56
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,174
But I'm pretty sure I'm not
the reason why you came here.

57
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,967
Last year, I made
a deal

58
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:58,471
with a cosmic being
named Mar Novu.

59
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,307
Recently, he came
to collect his debt.

60
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,850
He asked me to
help him,

61
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:06,979
but he's not very good
at sharing information

62
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,107
with the people
he's working with.

63
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,651
Sounds like
somebody else I know.

64
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:16,197
I need to be 100 percent sure
that I can trust him.

65
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,574
I know it's a long shot,
but I was hoping

66
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:22,787
that Nyssa could tell me
what, if anything,

67
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,247
the League knows
about him.

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,958
Ok. What are you
not telling me?

69
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,543
He's seen the future.

70
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,381
He's seen me die.

71
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,886
It's soon, Speedy.

72
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,642
And?

73
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,645
Take as much time
as you need to be upset.

74
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,899
Ollie, come on.
You've cheated death

75
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,402
more than any of us
have by this point.

76
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,537
This is fundamentally
different than anything

77
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,281
that we've ever dealt
with before.

78
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,617
Ok.

79
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,705
Well, let's try to figure out
what we're dealing with,

80
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:09,542
but like I said,
Nyssa's not here.

81
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,086
Sara hasn't been able
to help either.

82
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,090
We've kind of killed off
every League member, haven't we?

83
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,344
I can think
of one more.

84
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,600
William?

85
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,436
William?

86
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:30,563
Frak!

87
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:34,192
William!

88
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,237
Where is he?

89
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,864
- Aah?
- Oh. It's you.

90
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,282
I'm here. I'm ok.

91
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:43,659
I remembered how Mom
hardwired

92
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,745
the bunker's power grid
through the floor.

93
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:47,512
Gave those guys the shock
of their lives.

94
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,165
Guys.

95
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,751
This is why JJ was
going after William.

96
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,328
He's targeting
all the members

97
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,897
of the Star City
Unification Movement.

98
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:56,839
The ones that are
still alive anyway.

99
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,300
This was a city-wide
assault.

100
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,761
There's 10
confirmed dead.

101
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,222
And now that JJ knows
who they all are,

102
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,428
it's only a matter of time

103
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,767
before he wipes out
the entire movement.

104
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,478
Unless
we trap him first.

105
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,023
All we really need
is the right... lure.

106
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,775
You want to use
yourself as bait?

107
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,944
No way.
It is too dangerous.

108
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,838
Look. I know
you don't want to hear this,

109
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,423
but the Deathstrokes
have been five steps

110
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,567
ahead of us this whole time.

111
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,815
We need to gain
the upper hand.

112
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,369
Which is why we are going
to bring the fight to them,

113
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,371
take them out
in one fell swoop.

114
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,540
How? It's not
like we're gonna waltz

115
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,958
back into their
headquarters.

116
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,253
Unless that's your plan.

117
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,439
Mia, that
didn't work out

118
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:38,506
too well for us
last time.

119
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,033
Right, but we've
been there before.

120
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,217
We know the layout.

121
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,664
We can use that
to our advantage.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,845
I think this is
a mistake.

123
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,638
I'll remember that.

124
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,806
Get ready to move out.

125
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,313
Something wrong
with the uplink?

126
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,041
No, no. It's
our timing that's off.

127
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,441
JJ already went
to sleep.

128
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,861
Well, we can call him
back, wake him up.

129
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,780
No. Little man's
gone through enough already.

130
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,967
Besides, I need to know
what mission was so important

131
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:07,076
that you wanted me here
instead of Nanda Parbat.

132
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,413
Ben Turner is currently
on a deep cover op,

133
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,582
so I've been keeping
an eye on his family.

134
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,960
Sandra Hawke has never
missed a check-in

135
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,503
until yesterday.

136
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,357
So you think something happened
to Sandra and Connor?

137
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,382
I know it.

138
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,262
These pictures were taken
at an airfield in Kasnia.

139
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,639
Kasnia? That's far
from home.

140
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,909
Any chance Sandra and Connor are
meeting up with Turner?

141
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,893
Kasnia's nowhere close
to any of Turner's missions

142
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,270
past, present, or future,

143
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,022
and then there's
this man.

144
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,734
Abdul Nardoc.
He owns that plane.

145
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,652
Nardoc bills himself
as a philanthropist,

146
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,614
but intel suggests that
he has ties to local terrorists.

147
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,616
- Hmm.
- He's throwing a fundraiser

148
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,409
tomorrow at his home.

149
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,929
Odds are good that Sandra and
Connor are being held on site.

150
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,080
We need to infiltrate
and get eyes on them.

151
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,177
Why not just take
an A.R.G.U.S. recon team?

152
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,919
I've spent the past few months
trying to untangle the web

153
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,420
of corruption at A.R.G.U.S.

154
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:03,007
Until I eliminate it,
I can't trust this with anyone.

155
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,343
I need you with me, John.

156
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,804
Hmm. Must be
really important,

157
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,056
you called me John.

158
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,767
Guess I need a suit.

159
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,769
I already picked
one out.

160
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,021
Hmm.

161
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,195
I thought you guys
were friends now.

162
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:27,949
Well... not exactly.

163
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,370
Ok. Well, this place
isn't the least bit creepy.

164
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:48,177
Hold!

165
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:49,762
Leave us.

166
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,057
Your students used to
ask questions first.

167
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,059
I have learned

168
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,687
that hesitation
often proves fatal.

169
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,569
You should not have
come to this place.

170
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,363
You owe me a debt.

171
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:09,907
I'm here to collect.

172
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,791
You come here
at great peril.

173
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,502
Especially you.

174
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,005
Word of your exploits
has traveled far.

175
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,673
How is my sister?

176
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,800
She's great.
Vacationing,

177
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,301
working on a tan.

178
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,262
I see you survived
prison.

179
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:34,265
Mm-hmm. Dr. Parker didn't.

180
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,225
Heard he was killed
with a sword.

181
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,269
He received the justice
he deserved.

182
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,521
So now you're back
to your old exploits?

183
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,482
With the League gone, the region
has become quite unstable.

184
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,693
And you think training
a bunch of assassins

185
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,820
in a place like this
is gonna stabilize it?

186
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,680
I think it a wiser
course of action

187
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,157
than declaring
a one-woman war

188
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,324
on the Thanatos Guild.

189
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,785
Much as I would like
to have a debate, Talia,

190
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,540
I need to know whatever
the League might know

191
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:00,708
about Mar Novu.

192
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,085
That's an unusual name.
I'd remember it.

193
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:06,422
If it helps, he's apparently
some type of cosmic know-it-all.

194
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,340
Well, such beings
often go by many names.

195
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:11,886
If I help you,

196
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,929
I can consider
my debt paid?

197
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,432
Yes.

198
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,078
If the League has any
information concerning this man,

199
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,271
it will be found
underneath the Karan Shah.

200
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,106
The League's stronghold.

201
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,233
It has since
been destroyed,

202
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,944
but my father kept the League
records in the catacombs,

203
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:32,364
so with any luck, they're
still there waiting to be found.

204
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,827
We leave at nightfall.

205
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,287
She's still fun.

206
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,963
- You good?
- I'm fine.

207
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,883
I think I just... ack...
got some dust in my mouth.

208
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,011
Ack! Was it this
dusty last time?

209
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,262
It was worse.

210
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,972
Are you sure this
is gonna work?

211
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,974
If I can tap into
the old galaxy one cameras,

212
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,541
we should be able
to see everything,

213
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:03,354
including JJ and his
Deathstroke maniacs.

214
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,022
Pstt. Hey.

215
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,233
Someone's coming.

216
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,708
Guys, there's an office
just up here I can use.

217
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,212
Ok. System's gonna need a minute
to reboot before I can access it.

218
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,342
Look. I know you think
this is a bad idea.

219
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,511
The 4 of us taking
on all of JJ's forces

220
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:36,887
on their home turf?

221
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,764
Wasn't my
first choice.

222
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,599
Thanks for coming anyway.

223
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,351
We're a team.

224
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:43,978
I just...

225
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,313
I hope you're doing
this for the right reasons.

226
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:47,982
What do you mean?

227
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,860
I'm pissed that JJ tried
to kill William, too,

228
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,696
but we can't let fear
dictate our strategy.

229
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,574
I'm not afraid of JJ
or his idiot goons.

230
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,618
I know, but you are afraid of
losing your brother.

231
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,974
Bad news, guys.
System's in worse shape than I thought.

232
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,583
I'm gonna need
more time.

233
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,644
We should get
into position.

234
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,188
I'll stay with William
until he's done.

235
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,564
Let us know when
you're up and running.

236
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:11,589
Yeah.

237
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,933
See a lot of
unfriendly faces here.

238
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,393
How you looking?

239
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,079
Just waiting for
the security feeds

240
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,271
to finish uploading.

241
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:33,569
Hmm. Dancing undercover's
like deja vu.

242
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,155
There's Nardoc.

243
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,658
What do you say we
take a closer look,

244
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,243
find out who
his friends are?

245
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:46,457
You've come a long way
since Afghanistan.

246
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,437
Yeah. Well, sometimes,
I wish we were still on that tour.

247
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,129
Life was a lot less
complicated.

248
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,048
But we wouldn't
be married.

249
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:58,052
Hmm. That's true.
Or divorced.

250
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,970
Or remarried,

251
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,139
and we wouldn't have
our beautiful boy.

252
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,100
All the feeds are
complete.

253
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,518
Copy that.

254
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,567
Sandra and Connor are here.

255
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,856
They're being held
in a room

256
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,278
in the northeast corner.

257
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,240
Good. We'll exfil them out
before Nardoc knows what hit him.

258
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,367
I don't think it's
gonna be that easy.

259
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,826
- Why?
- We just got a hit on one

260
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,495
of Nardoc's friends.

261
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,122
The man in the black suit
and blue tie...

262
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,500
Farzad Qadir.

263
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,460
Gholem Qadir's son.

264
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:33,963
- Who Ben Turner killed?
- To save me.

265
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,173
I doubt his family's
kidnapping is a coincidence.

266
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,137
Wow. Love what
they haven't done with the place.

267
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,115
Assuming the Karan Shah
hasn't been plundered,

268
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,367
we're likely to find
what we're looking for

269
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,934
in "The Chronicles
of Al-Fatih."

270
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,644
He was the first
Ra's Al Ghul.

271
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,146
According to legend,
he was bestowed primordial knowledge

272
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,439
by one of the sky gods.

273
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,692
Now my father kept
a secret room

274
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,138
with his most valued
possessions,

275
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,487
including information
on Al-Fatih.

276
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,593
Looks like
we're too late.

277
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,429
Not necessarily.

278
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,980
"the Chronicles
of Al-Fatih."

279
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,316
So the looters just
happened to leave behind

280
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,026
the one thing
we're looking for?

281
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,653
Because the thieves did not
consider it to be of value.

282
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,238
Right. What's it say?

283
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,158
"The phoenix is
reborn in the fire.

284
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,036
The path to your
destiny follows me."

285
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,038
Speedy, you just
read Arabic.

286
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,622
You speak Russian.

287
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,793
Yes, but what does
it mean?

288
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,756
To join the League,
your old self must die

289
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,966
so that your new one
may be reborn.

290
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,095
Oh.

291
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,933
We need to burn
the scroll.

292
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,643
The scroll is
centuries old.

293
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,811
Yeah.

294
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,945
Al-Fatih took great pains
to hide his secrets

295
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,405
lest he be betrayed.

296
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,036
I believe this leads
to Al-Fatih's tomb.

297
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,680
It stands to reason
that he would attempt

298
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,504
to take his secrets
with him beyond the grave.

299
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,916
So it's a scavenger hunt.

300
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,376
It would appear so, yes.

301
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,128
Why can't everything
just be easy?

302
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,799
Actually, your situation
is more difficult than you think.

303
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,343
- Athena.
- You have always been

304
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,720
treacherous, Talia,
but bringing outsiders

305
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,932
into our sacred heart
is a betrayal

306
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,558
of the highest order.

307
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,728
I'll take that.

308
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,857
Relinquish it or perish.

309
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,278
As you wish.

310
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:07,825
Attack them!

311
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,064
Athena showing up right when
we did can't be an accident.

312
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,329
No, and neither was
her giving Athena the sphere.

313
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,915
If you're accusing me,
I'd like to point out two things.

314
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,126
First, Athena and I
are blood enemies.

315
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,294
And second?

316
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,962
She was likely
trailing you.

317
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,214
The woman who's
declared war on her.

318
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,384
Still, I don't see
why Athena would give

319
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,761
a crap about a rusty,
old scroll buried with Al-Fatih.

320
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,055
She wouldn't.
She would give a crap

321
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,599
about what else
is buried with him,

322
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,309
namely his sword

323
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,227
as revered
as the ring of Ra's.

324
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,154
Whoever wields it
commands absolute devotion.

325
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,871
Clearly Athena wants
to use it to restart

326
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,065
the League
of Assassins.

327
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,943
Yeah. Well, now she's got
the marble of destiny or whatever.

328
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,528
Actually, it's a map.

329
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:28,405
The markings on it
were constellations

330
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,699
indicating the tomb's location,
but we don't need it.

331
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,701
I've memorized them.

332
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,911
What?

333
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,539
- You memorized them?
- You didn't?

334
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,211
Ok. Listen. I'm gonna
go ahead with Talia.

335
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,522
I'd like you to go back
to her camp and wait for us there.

336
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,839
You can't be serious.

337
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,259
I will give you two
a moment.

338
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,014
Ollie, I thought
we were way

339
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,724
past this overprotective
brother thing.

340
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,892
It's not about that.

341
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,353
You came to me
for help.

342
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,938
I came to you
for answers.

343
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,984
I wasn't counting on
getting attacked by Athena.

344
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,401
Athena and I were fighting
long before you showed up here.

345
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,071
I can take care
of myself.

346
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,678
I know you can take
care of yourself.

347
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,700
If Athena is trying to restart
the League of Assassins,

348
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,244
that makes you
her chief rival.

349
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,996
- I don't care.
- I care, Thea.

350
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:22,084
If you want to help me,
just... just let me handle this.

351
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,472
Qadir must be using
Turner's family to lure him out.

352
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,517
Ok. Then we have to get out
of here right now.

353
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,394
What? What are
you talking about?

354
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,854
If Ben Turner's a target,
then so are we,

355
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,148
and every second we stay here,
we risk being made.

356
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,817
What about Sandra
and Connor?

357
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,527
Call an A.R.G.U.S.
team, Lyla.

358
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,404
- Exfil them.
- It would take a team

359
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,072
at least an hour
to get here.

360
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,591
A lot can happen
between now that then.

361
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,375
Ok, fine, but we
can't risk doing this alone.

362
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,828
- We have to do something.
- Then you leave.

363
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,746
I'll get Sandra
and Connor myself.

364
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,792
Johnny...

365
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,588
what's really
going on here?

366
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,549
You've never been one
to shy away from risk.

367
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,468
I'd never seen a world just
disintegrate right in front of my face.

368
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,809
I know what we do
requires risk.

369
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,604
I've always
accepted that,

370
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,850
but this is
different, Lyla.

371
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:31,570
Seeing a universe
just... disappear, it...

372
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,906
I don't know, it's
like...

373
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,452
like looking
into the eye of God.

374
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,122
It changes you.

375
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,082
It changed me.

376
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,753
I can't risk
losing you.

377
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,921
I can't risk that.

378
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,055
No one knows the future.

379
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,932
All we can do is
enjoy the time we have

380
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,893
with the people we love

381
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,980
and make our choices from
a place of strength, not fear,

382
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,692
and if the world
ends today,

383
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,195
there is no one I'd
rather have by my side.

384
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:21,995
How much further?

385
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,665
Patience. You realize
your sister is involved

386
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,792
in this whether you
want her to be or not?

387
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,102
She's a daughter
of the demon.

388
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,246
She has a claim
to the sword.

389
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,338
She's carried enough
of Malcolm's burdens.

390
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,715
Fate does not care
what we believe we're owed.

391
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,374
You're very familiar
with that.

392
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,465
Isn't that why
you're here?

393
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:38,929
What do you mean?

394
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,698
You carry yourself
with a heaviness

395
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,015
I've not seen
since Russia.

396
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:43,392
This is the place.

397
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,977
I've been here before.

398
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,689
Yes. When my father
vanquished you.

399
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,541
Hopefully you have
better luck

400
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,858
with the mountain
this time.

401
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,537
Down!

402
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:07,416
The phoenix up there,
it's triggering the spears.

403
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,000
Here's an idea.

404
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,687
The key to the crypt
of Ra's.

405
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,192
Looks like the entrance
right there.

406
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,361
Yes.

407
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,199
Agh!

408
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,744
Wh... what are you doing?

409
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,121
I am sorry, Oliver.

410
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,165
I can't let Athena
get to the sword,

411
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,916
but I can't let you
get it either.

412
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,100
Looks like you're down
one evil companion.

413
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,186
Hmm.

414
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,486
I thought I told you to
stay at the camp.

415
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,656
You did. Looks like
I didn't ignore you soon enough.

416
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,117
Hey. I don't have time
for an I told you so.

417
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,120
All right.

418
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,999
So Talia will take
the trail to the summit.

419
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,044
It's safer,
you conserve energy,

420
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:37,130
but going up the face
of the mountain is faster.

421
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,965
Thought you said
it was harder.

422
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,176
Yeah. I've done it before.

423
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,095
Ok. If you can do it,
I can do it.

424
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,598
- Thea.
- Ollie, just stop it.

425
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,141
Start walking.

426
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,246
Tell me you're
almost done hacking those cameras.

427
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,606
You ever hear that thing about
patience being a virtue?

428
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:56,775
Since when have
I ever cared about virtue?

429
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,737
All right. Seriously,
how much longer?

430
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,740
Ok. I just activated
the northwest quadrant cameras.

431
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,427
I just need a few more minutes
to get the rest of them up and running.

432
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,452
How many
is a few?

433
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,412
Look. I know what
I'm doing, ok,

434
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,039
so just trust me.

435
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,708
I do.

436
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,378
I d... i just...

437
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,465
William, this has
to work.

438
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,251
If we're gonna
bring Star City

439
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,510
and the Glades
back together,

440
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,388
we have to take out
the Deathstrokes for good this time.

441
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:30,267
Well, we could have if
you'd let the team use me as bait.

442
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,853
No. That is too risky,
and you know it.

443
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,379
Well, how many times have
you risked yourself for this team?

444
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,858
How many times have you beaten
up a guy 10 times your size

445
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,484
to protect someone
you care about?

446
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,587
- That's different.
- Why? Because I'm not a fighter?

447
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,029
No. Because
you're my brother.

448
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:51,371
You are the only family
I have left.

449
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:53,915
Mia...

450
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,377
look. I...

451
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,839
I appreciate you
looking out for me. I do,

452
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,550
but operating
from a place of fear

453
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,385
is not the way
to protect each other.

454
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,053
We need to trust each other.

455
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,139
It's the only way
we'll survive.

456
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,518
Found them.

457
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,898
Oh, boy. That is a lot
of Deathstrokes.

458
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,066
You sure about this?

459
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,047
- Connor, Zoe, we have eyes.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

460
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,405
- Get ready to move.
<i>- On it.</i>

461
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,202
Mia.

462
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,455
Be careful.

463
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:34,748
I will.

464
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,670
Oh,
and if you tell anyone

465
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,213
about this conversation,

466
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,174
I will kill you
myself.

467
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,154
Thought you said
this was the hard part.

468
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,114
Don't get cocky.

469
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,535
Ok. What is going
on with you, Ollie?

470
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,731
You were never this
overprotective

471
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:15,997
when I left Star City.

472
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,417
Things have changed.

473
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,587
I left my family behind,
Speedy,

474
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,633
and I miss them.

475
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,572
And every day, I wrestle
with whether or not

476
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,890
I made the right decision
because maybe I didn't,

477
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,141
and...

478
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:42,190
I saw an entire world
wiped out of existence,

479
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,318
a world that
you weren't in, by the way,

480
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,696
because I wasn't around
to protect you.

481
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,242
I'm sorry, Thea, but

482
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,703
the only way
that I can bear this

483
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,414
is if I become 100 percent certain

484
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:03,128
that my sacrifice,
that my death...

485
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,674
will protect
the people I love.

486
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,637
I need my family
to be safe.

487
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,785
You know, I've been
thinking a lot

488
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,352
about Mom and Dad lately,

489
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,971
wondering what they
would think

490
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,234
about the lives
we've chosen.

491
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,945
All the mistakes
they made,

492
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,115
all the... lies
they told

493
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:37,037
in their own very, very
messed up way.

494
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,622
They thought they
were protecting us.

495
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,166
They weren't.
They didn't.

496
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,670
No, but... it did
help us become

497
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,213
the people we are
today.

498
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,510
They turned us
into heroes.

499
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,431
We can't change
the future, Ollie.

500
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,934
The past teaches us
you might as well

501
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,394
not bother trying to.

502
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,068
When you'd stop being
my baby sister?

503
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:11,988
No. I never did.

504
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,076
I just grew up
a little bit.

505
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,120
Now can we please get
off this mountain?

506
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:20,872
Yeah.

507
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,051
We're not alone.

508
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,906
Apparently, this day
is not going the way

509
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,351
either of us
have planned.

510
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:42,894
Surrender your weapons.

511
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,105
What do you want?

512
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,399
The route to Al-Fatih's
crypt will be dangerous.

513
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,946
Always good to have a few
sacrificial lambs

514
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,156
to tell us
where not to stray.

515
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:58,827
After you.

516
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,302
Underground in Nanda Parbat.

517
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,263
What could possibly
go wrong?

518
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:42,287
Well, Indiana Jones
made this look way more fun.

519
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,003
"To survive death,
you must embrace it."

520
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,380
Well,
how do you embrace death?

521
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:55,425
The coffin.
Come on.

522
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,683
Go on.

523
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:05,935
Ok.

524
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,865
I miss watching
you kick ass.

525
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,074
This way.

526
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,288
Must be
passcode-protected.

527
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,706
This should be able
to crack it,

528
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:27,993
but it'll take
a few minutes.

529
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,500
We may not have
a few minutes.

530
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,960
If this is Qadir
and his men,

531
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,296
he'll recognize us
the minute he sees us.

532
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,048
Maybe we can use that.

533
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,758
I was standing next
to Gholem Qadir

534
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,068
the night that Turner
killed him.

535
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,260
I can distract Farzad.

536
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,887
Lyla that's
too dangerous.

537
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,513
It's our only option.

538
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,059
Hey. Just be careful.

539
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,777
- Pardon me.
- Wait.

540
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,324
You know, usually,
I detest party crashers,

541
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,160
but I'll make
an exception for you...

542
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,287
Lyla Michaels.

543
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,585
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

544
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,963
It's okay. It's okay.
My name is John Diggle.

545
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,889
I'm a friend of Lyla Michaels
and Ben Turner.

546
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,567
I'm here to help you.
I can get you out of here,

547
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,052
but you have to move quietly.
Come on, come on. Shh, shh shh.

548
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,346
Did you know I was there
the night my father died?

549
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,556
I was supposed to
stay in my room,

550
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,558
but I wanted to
hear the music.

551
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,828
Do you have any idea
what it's like to watch

552
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,271
your own father
be murdered?

553
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,897
I was just a boy.

554
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,817
I'm sorry you had to
see that,

555
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,152
but your father was
a criminal.

556
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,570
So he deserved
to die?

557
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:43,658
I will have
my vengeance.

558
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,124
You all right?

559
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:53,209
I've got Sandra
and Connor.

560
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,419
Let's go home.

561
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,592
Prisoners first.

562
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:05,054
Watch your step.

563
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,486
Ollie,
a phoenix.

564
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,614
All right. Crypt
must be through there.

565
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,408
Ok.

566
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:26,868
Thea!

567
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,330
Thank you.

568
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,540
Yeah.

569
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,338
"All beings burn,

570
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,882
but a phoenix rises
from the ashes."

571
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:43,676
Ok. I think we need
to use the phoenix tiles

572
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:44,969
to get across.

573
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,402
After them!

574
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,056
You hold them off.
I'll get Talia.

575
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,447
- Thea!
- Just trust me.

576
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,549
Talia?

577
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,138
You're too late.

578
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,606
As heir to the demon,
I have the right

579
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:39,899
to challenge you
to combat.

580
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,943
You wish to fight me?

581
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,862
Very well. I accept.

582
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,532
I hope you prove
to be a worthy opponent.

583
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,508
Your brother
trained you well.

584
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,386
Pity the tools you learned
from him he learned from me.

585
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,721
Less talking,
more fighting.

586
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,670
You were a fool
to think you could defeat me.

587
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,001
Actually...

588
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,162
you're right
where I want you.

589
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:49,802
Do you yield?

590
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,557
I yield.

591
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,782
Ahem. What's it say?

592
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,577
It says "Al-Fatih
was visited by a god

593
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,078
who possessed the power

594
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,040
to see all that is
and all that will be.

595
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,919
He believed that
if he failed to keep the balance

596
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,338
between good and evil
this god would

597
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,424
bring forth
the end of times,

598
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,219
annihilation
of all things."

599
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,514
Ollie, if that's true,
this means that...

600
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,142
it means Mar Novu
is not trying to prevent

601
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,560
what's going to happen

602
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,812
because he's gonna be
what causes it.

603
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:47,568
You're leaving?

604
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:50,154
I have
betrayed my honor

605
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,782
and the sacred
traditions of the League.

606
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,370
The sword was destined to be yours,
daughter of Merlyn.

607
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,998
I am sorry for the pain
I've caused you both.

608
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,542
What about
your students?

609
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,876
I've released
them.

610
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,146
They will follow you
if that is what you wish.

611
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,171
It's not.

612
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,257
You're their teacher.

613
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:10,967
They need someone
to follow.

614
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,213
If I was meant
to lead them,

615
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,553
I would wield
Al-Fatih's sword,

616
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,221
but you do,

617
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,307
so the honor
and the burden are yours.

618
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:19,850
Yeah. Hard pass.

619
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:21,185
It is your destiny.

620
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,145
Yeah, but, see,
about that.

621
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:27,275
I don't really believe in
the whole fate, destiny thing.

622
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,362
We can all make
our own choices.

623
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:32,530
Meaning?

624
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,491
Meaning I don't think
the world needs

625
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,368
another League
of Assassins.

626
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,539
It could use League
of Heroes.

627
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,626
It wouldn't be
a one-woman job.

628
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,589
You'd extend me
that honor

629
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,965
despite
my betrayals?

630
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,925
You made a mistake.

631
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,344
We've all made mistakes.

632
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:05,313
For not one but two women
to wield my father's sword?

633
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,401
He would be aghast.

634
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,488
I accept.

635
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,743
New phone,
better encryption,

636
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,245
and a one-way ticket
home via Hong Kong.

637
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,572
No one will be
expecting that.

638
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,760
I can't thank you
enough for all your help.

639
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,242
I mean, without
you two I'd...

640
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,502
No, no. It's the least we
could have done,

641
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,839
and you were very brave.

642
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,202
Your father would be
proud of you.

643
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:35,551
Thanks, Mr. Diggles.

644
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:37,553
Call me Dig.

645
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,263
Let's go get
our things.

646
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:49,649
Hey. They're gonna
be okay.

647
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:54,695
Yeah... and so
are we.

648
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,659
The world's gonna
keep coming for us.

649
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,977
There's nothing
I can do to stop it.

650
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,415
Neither can you,
but you were right.

651
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,419
We just hold on to each other,
we'll be fine

652
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:11,754
like Sandra and Connor.

653
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:15,800
What? What is it?

654
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:21,305
Johnny, promise me that
no matter what happens

655
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,101
you'll always remember
the good times.

656
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,646
I won't have to
because I'm not going anywhere,

657
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,524
and neither are you.

658
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,152
I love you,
Lyla Michaels.

659
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:37,488
I love you.

660
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:40,825
I love you, too.

661
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,662
Always have,
always will.

662
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,834
I'm sorry you didn't get
the answers you were looking for.

663
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,752
Got to see you.

664
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,589
- Here's what I don't get.
- Okay.

665
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:59,176
If Mar Novu causes
whatever's gonna happen,

666
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,846
why does he bring you in
in the first place?

667
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,264
I don't know.

668
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:05,975
Look. I just...

669
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,604
I know that if he ends up being
on the wrong side of this...

670
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,108
I'm gonna stop him.

671
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:17,319
If you're gonna take on
a god, Ollie,

672
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,322
you're gonna need all
the help you can get.

673
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,366
Pretty good on help
actually.

674
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,620
I have John, I have Laurel...
believe it or not.

675
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,498
Seems to me you have
your hands full

676
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,709
rebuilding the League
of Assassins

677
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,961
into a League of Heroes.

678
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:36,547
Yeah.

679
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,179
I can't believe I'm saying
good-bye to you again.

680
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,931
Well, you're not.
Think of it as a...

681
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:47,975
"See you later,

682
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,312
and please don't die."

683
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,908
One of us is gonna have
to let go first.

684
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:07,203
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,707
No Hozen this time?

686
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,418
Uh, Felicity gave
it to William.

687
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,796
I'm gonna miss you.

688
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,382
Every day, I miss you.

689
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,139
Good-bye, Speedy.

690
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:32,770
Bye, Ollie.

691
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:43,113
Tonight is the night that
we have all been waiting for,

692
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,868
the night that we destroy
the unification movement.

693
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,580
The city will be ours,

694
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,876
and there is nothing
anyone can do to stop it.

695
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:58,671
Actually, I think
there is.

696
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:00,714
You just don't know
when to quit.

697
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,275
Damn. What an entrance.

698
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,455
Mia!

699
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:36,750
You know, the human body
holds an average

700
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,044
of 5 liters of blood.

701
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,006
Let's see how much
you have, huh?

702
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,591
Hyah!

703
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,429
Are you ok?

704
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:50,222
Thanks.

705
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,779
JJ!

706
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,998
Stay with me.
We're gonna get you out of here.

707
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:13,871
Tell... tell my dad...

708
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,708
just tell... tell him
that...

709
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,170
I'm sorry
about everything.

710
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,842
That I love him.

711
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:31,931
Hey. Hey. You're gonna
tell him yourself, ok?

712
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,182
You are because we are...

713
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,017
we're gonna get you safe.

714
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:37,227
Ok? I got you.

715
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,438
Zoe, I got you.

716
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,024
Zoe?

717
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,570
No. No, no, no, no.

718
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:49,573
No. Zoe.

719
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,994
Aah!

720
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,218
You don't have the guts,
do you, huh?

721
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:10,886
You're wrong.

722
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,736
Oliver?

723
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,574
What's going on?

724
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,953
That's a very good
question.

725
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,088
Dad?

726
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:19,872
Greg, move your head!
