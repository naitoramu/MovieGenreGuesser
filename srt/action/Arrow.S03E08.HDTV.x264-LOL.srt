1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:03,869
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:05,687
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,823
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:09,925
to save my city.

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,957
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,925
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:16,460
To the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:18,462
I am someone else.

9
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:21,598
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,205
Previously,
on "Arrow" and "Flash"...

11
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:25,052
- Hello?
- It's Barry.

12
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:26,008
Barry Allen.

13
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:28,576
I woke up.
I could use some advice.

14
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,645
I don't think that bolt of lightening
struck you, Barry.

15
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:32,880
I think it chose you.

16
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:35,583
You can inspire people

17
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:37,451
in a way that
I never could.

18
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,120
So what are you guys doing
in Central City?

19
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,522
Working a case.
Suspicious homicide,

20
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:44,592
in a style where
the murder weapon...

21
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:46,594
Is a boomerang.

22
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:49,096
- Partners?
- Partners.

23
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:53,601
Barry has super powers, Oliver
has a bow and arrow.

24
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:55,870
If I had a sample I was unable
to fully break down,

25
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,706
do you think you could
isolate the genetic markings for me?

26
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,209
- What's the sample from?
- Canary's murder.

27
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,757
In position?

28
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,328
In position.

29
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,833
In position.

30
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,768
Neighborhood's clear.

31
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,670
You know, I probably
should have brought this up before,

32
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,839
but if this place
doesn't belong to the killer

33
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,675
you chased to Central City
and back, well,

34
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,677
we're going to have
a lot of explaining to do.

35
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,618
It's his.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,952
Why, because
the residue S.T.A.R. Labs

37
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:46,654
found on the boomerang
says so?

38
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,155
Because the whole
place is rigged.

39

[Beeping]

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,461
I can see a trip wire connected
to pressurized gas.

will be the same.

42
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:02,670
Our new friend doesn't want
any surprise visitors.

43
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,973
Well, he's going
to get a surprise.

44
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,770
Looks like
we interrupted his dinner.

45
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,905
We just missed him.

46
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,145
Drop your guns.

47
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,913
Sure thing.
Right when

48
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,548
you learn
how to count.

49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,417
You're outnumbered,
jerkwad.

50

You're not SCPD.

uniforms have gotten

really interesting,
neither are you.

Your flanking patterns
haven't changed in years.

55
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:03,230
Why is A.R.G.U.S.
in on this?

56
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:05,232
The man who was killed
by the Boomerang...

57
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,234
He was an A.R.G.U.S. agent?

58
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,770
Which makes this
an A.R.G.U.S. matter.

59
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,340
Bug out.
Target's not here.

60

Are we going
to let this go?

What about this
A.R.G.U.S. angle?

66
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,869
Oh, well, A.R.G.U.S. wiped all evidence
of their agent's death

67
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,872
after he was killed,
or at least they thought they did.

68
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,708
Our boomerang victim,
Kai Wu.

69
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,244
The man's profile is so clean, I should
have known it was an A.R.G.U.S. cover.

70
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:51,579
Well, now that we know
Wu is A.R.G.U.S.,

71
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,781
maybe Lyla
can get us a lead?

72
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,050
If this an A.R.G.U.S. thing, Lyla's going
to want it to stay that way.

73
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,986
Then tell her to stop
letting people get killed in my city.

74
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,024
You really don't care
about my marriage, do you?

75
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,259
Well, I would...

76
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,595
If you and Lyla
were still married.

77
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,367
Thank you
for coming.

78
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:14,969
Like I had a choice.

79
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,038
I see you made a new friend.

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,806
This is Katsu Cheng.

81
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,574
Mr. Cheng
fancies himself

82
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:22,610
something
of a munitions specialist.

83
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,445
According to HKPF,

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,782
Cheng planted an explosive device
somewhere in Hong Kong,

85
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,384
I need you to talk to him,
find out the bomb's location.

86
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:31,852
So I'm just going
to talk to him

87
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,754
and he's going to
give me information?

88
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,390
It won't be easy.

89
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:39,060
That's why I brought you
your tools.

90
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:42,196
What tools?

91
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,899
We recovered these
from the freighter

92
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:47,168
when we recovered you.

93
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,369
You're welcome.

94
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,838
You want me
to torture this guy

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,339
to find out
where the bomb is?

96
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,809
I want you to find out
where the bomb is.

97
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,045

is of little interest to me.

days coming--

Harkness got the supplies,

we can use that
to track him.

This is a follow-up.

302
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,640
Kind of.

year--Klaus Markos.

You know where
we might be able to find him?

I'm not real sentimental
that way.

310
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,621
Ok. Uh,

311
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,690
what did you
arrest him for?

312
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:19,026
Urmm...

Ok.

I cannot believe  you're a member
of the Russian mob!

Former member, probably.

319
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:37,544
We had a falling out last year.

their cyber crime operation.

Hey, nice outfit,
by the way.

This place
looks like a fortress.

00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,554

the southeast corner.

You think I'll lose
it because Harkness is after Lyla?

I'm good.

330
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:17,417
I had eight seconds to kill.

00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:22,328
Was that wrong?

than an arrow going in

He said he doesn't know!

He's lying. If you want

348
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:08,024
Here! Harkness
gave it to me. It's encrypted.

349
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,492
I had an order
ready for him.

he came.

down Harkness.

You tortured that guy.

When my friend said
your tactics made you a criminal,

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,035
I defended you because I thought
you were supposed to be a hero.

You live
in Central City,

where it's sunny
all the time

and your enemies
get cute nicknames.

You're not in
Central City.

Yeah.

367
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,550
I live in a city

368
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:09,219
where my best friend
was murdered,

369
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,321
where a woman that
I loved was shot full of arrows

370
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:13,523
and sent tumbling
off a rooftop.

371

right in front of me.

in front of me, too.

375
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:22,565
But I don't use
my personal tragedies

376
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:25,602
as an excuse to just torture
whoever pisses me off.

377
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,437
Well, I'm sorry,
Barry,

378
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:30,773
I'm not as emotionally
healthy as you are.

379
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,742
What's wrong
with you?!

380
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:34,577
When we agreed
that you were staying,

381
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,879
we decided that
it would be on my terms.

382
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,748
If that is proving
too difficult for you,

383
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,017
you know your way
back to Central City.

you and speedy?

Yeah, we're fine.

Oh.

389
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,872
We had a...

390
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,741

about the way the world works.

391

Yep.

I know what
that's like.

Well, sometimes
they don't see it.

394
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,249
There are people in the world
who deal only in extremes--

395
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,852
And it would be naive to think that
anything less than extreme measures

396
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:25,354
will stop them.

397

Sometimes bravery
isn't enough.

Sometimes the world requires
us to be bold.

00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:44,785
You have to defuse
all the bombs at the same time.

646
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:47,588
You're thinking of
multiplex. I can't be

647
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,890
in five places at once.

648
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:53,560
But I don't have to be.

649
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:54,719
Stop the countdown!

650
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:55,702
Go to hell.

651
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:56,650
Last chance!

652
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:57,899
Or what?

653
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,734
You'll inflict pain?

654
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:03,337
Ah, I can tell you've done it before,
so let me ask you this--

655
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:06,840
why are you hesitating?

656
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,373
Whoa!

657
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:52,786
Ten more seconds.

658
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:55,422
We should be able
to see at least, ah,

659
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:58,625
three explosions
from here.

660
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:01,228
Ok.

661
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,964
Everyone has
to cut their wire

662
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:06,200
exactly on three.

663
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:10,337
1, 2,

664
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:11,872
3!

665
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:19,980
[Exhales]

666
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:23,083
Screw you,
Captain Boomerang.

667
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,928
You think you've accomplished
something here?

668
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:38,665
You think you not killing me
makes you strong?

669
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:40,734
It just means...

670
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,836
You're weak.

671
00:35:45,774 --> 00:35:48,242
It means I have
some humanity left.

672
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:55,215
[Groaning]

673
00:35:57,353 --> 00:36:00,154
You just couldn't
resist, could you?

674
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:25,877
Hey, sweetie.

675
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:29,747
You only call me "sweetie" when
you want something.

676
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:32,183
I do.

677
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:41,493
I want you
to marry me.

678
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:45,497
I can't believe
I waited this long to ask.

679
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:48,199
I need you,
Lyla.

680
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:50,969
Now, forever,
official.

681
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,537
I need you.

682
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:55,039
Will you please
stop talking...

683
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,910
So I can say yes?

684
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,416
[Both moaning]

685
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,958
Some of the STR markers
on the DNA sample

686
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,127
have degraded, but I've got
a computer back at the lab

687
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:18,363
that I think will
help fill in the gaps.

688
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:20,064
Thank you,
Caitlin.

689
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,200
I'll let you know
as soon as I have the results.

690
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:24,002
I'll call this time.

691
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:25,303
Roy: It's cool.

692
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:26,905
- You guys are fun.
- So are you guys.

693
00:37:26,907 --> 00:37:29,374
Well, you could be
if you realized

694
00:37:29,376 --> 00:37:31,943
you were working
under a nightclub.

695
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:35,113
Oh, did you guys
take care of business?

696
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:36,881
Digger Harkness
is now cell mates

697
00:37:36,883 --> 00:37:39,017
with one
Slade Wilson.

698
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:42,587
We've got a Pipeline,
he's got a gorgeous tropical island.

699
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:43,888
With landmines.

700
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,657
- Caitlin: Hmm?
- What?

701
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:47,859
It's a long story.

702
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,129
What's this?

703
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:53,164
Oliver helped me
put that in while

704
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,567
you guys were
at the hospital.

705
00:37:55,569 --> 00:37:58,002
Wait, this
is for me?

706
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:00,772
For the next time
you're in town.

707
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:02,807
There'll be
a next time?

708
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:04,358
I'm still calling the shots.

709
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:05,376
We'll talk about that.

710
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,645
Yes, we will.

711
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:08,680
And then I'll call the shots.

712
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:11,783
We got a gift
for you, too, Oliver.

713
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:13,785
Early Christmas present.

714
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:16,087
Turns out S.T.A.R. Labs'
industrial fabricator

715
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:18,156
was based out
of Starling, so...

716
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:20,191
Polymer Kevlar weave.

717
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:23,661
It's 25% lighter
and can carry 15% more gear.

718
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:27,799
I've got designs I'm working up
that I'm really excited by.

719
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:29,367
It's, uh,
it's subtle.

720
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:31,803
I wanted
to replace the hood,

721
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:35,206
but, uh, Felicity
said it had sentimental value.

722
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,687
Thank you.

723
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,145
Any time.

724
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:41,279
You guys headed back?

725
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:43,514
It's possible

726
00:38:43,516 --> 00:38:46,050
that Dr. Wells didn't
sign off on us leaving town.

727
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:48,853
Hey, do you still,
like, take the train?

728
00:38:48,855 --> 00:38:51,723
Yeah, sure, if I feel
like taking a nap.

729
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:53,925
But Oliver and I have
some unfinished business

730
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:55,193
to take care of first.

731
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:56,861
You guys aren't going

732
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:58,663
to punch each other,
are you?

733
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,770
Why'd you summon me here?

734
00:39:05,772 --> 00:39:07,272
To make me feel worse?

735
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:10,208
No, I summoned you
here to give you a second chance.

736
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,377
Is this a joke?

737
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:13,511
No.

738
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:15,880
This is
Li Khuan Hui.

739
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:18,116
That name should sound
familiar to you.

740
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:19,884
You work for China White.

741
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:22,387
Chien Na Wei.
Yes, Mr. Hui is on her payroll.

742
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:24,155
He's Chinese Triad,

743
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:26,991
and he knows her agenda
here in Hong Kong.

744
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:28,459
Fortunately for you,
Mr. Hui has been

745
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:30,695
less than forthcoming
with the details.

746
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:32,997
Fortunately?

747
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:36,367
You get a stab
at redemption.

748
00:39:58,158 --> 00:39:59,724
Barry: You could have invited
everybody, they'd like this.

749
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:01,592
Oliver: Well, no, they would
love this,

750
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,628
but this is just
for the two of us.

751
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,064
You mean, the one of you.
This was your idea.

752
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:08,166
You can't expect me
to believe

753
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:10,134
that you don't want to know,
once and for all,

754
00:40:10,136 --> 00:40:11,903
who would win--

755
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:13,571
me or you.

756
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:14,972
You mean if you don't
shoot me in the back.

757
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:16,140
You got to get
over that, Barry.

758
00:40:16,142 --> 00:40:18,009
Ok, I have super powers.

759
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,111
You have arrows that run out.

760
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:23,181
I have strategy
and tactical awareness.

761
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:25,650
When I'm fighting you,
it's literally like you're standing still.

762
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:28,086
[Chuckles] That's tough talk,
you ready to back it up?

763
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:29,153
Oh, yeah.

764
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:31,122
Hey, by the way...

765
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:32,990
Yeah?

766
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:34,992
You were wrong.

767
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:36,794
When you told me
I could inspire people,

768
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:38,162
you said you couldn't.

769
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:41,366
But you were wrong--
you can inspire.

770
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:44,302
Not as the Arrow,
that guy's a douche.

771
00:40:44,304 --> 00:40:46,170
[Laughs]

772
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:48,072
But as Oliver Queen.

773
00:40:49,342 --> 00:40:51,209
Thank you.

774
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:52,977
Since we're sharing,

775
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:55,146
you were wrong, too.

776
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:56,034
When?

777
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:57,149
Right now.

778
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,151
Because you think
you can kick my ass.

779
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:01,552
I can tell.

780
00:41:01,554 --> 00:41:03,154
All right, well, if you think
you can kick mine,

781
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,822
you better do it fast.

782
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:07,291
I get it, Barry,
I get it. You're fast.

783
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:17,184
Ready...

784
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:19,152
Set...
