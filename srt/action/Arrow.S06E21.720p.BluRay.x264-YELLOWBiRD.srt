00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,201
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,252
I'm the one
who's testifying against you.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,422
<i>In a shocking fall from grace</i>

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,626
<i>the Star City council has voted
to impeach Mayor Oliver Queen</i>

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,051
<i>and remove him from office.</i>

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,761
I'm thinking about moving up your trial.

7
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,970
And I got a lot of friends
at the courthouse...

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,265
<i>Speculation that the former
mayor is secretly the Green Arrow</i>

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,267
<i>has multiplied in recent weeks,</i>

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,021
<i>after his decision to terminate
two city officials investigating him</i>

11
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,476
<i>led to his impeachment.</i>

12
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:32,105
<i>If convicted, Oliver Queen
could face a life sentence.</i>

13
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,571
<i>His fate now rests
in Star City's justice system.</i>

14
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,812
- John?
- I'm getting you out of here.

15
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:50,774
What the hell are you doing here?

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,477
I need your help.

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,229
In Star City.

18
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,737
Mr. Queen, what happened
to your face?

19
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,072
Mr. Queen, do you know who the Flash is?

20
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,540
Mr. Queen,
how long will this trial last?

21
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,752
Will you be acquitted?

22
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,793
And the media wonders
why everyone hates them.

23
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,679
Thank you, Officer,
you can wait outside.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,177
I'm right where Mr. Diaz wants me.

25
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,478
I need to have a privileged
conversation with my client.

26
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,845
Nobody's stopping you.

27
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,485
Since you fired
District Attorney Armand,

28
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,530
the DA's office has brought in
outside counsel to prosecute.

29
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,697
Okay, well, that could be a good thing.

30
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,320
I mean, someone who's not
in Diaz's pocket.

31
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,909
Have you heard of Alexa Van Owen?

32
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,985
Should I have heard of her?

33
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,739
She took down Intergang
and Bruno Mannheim.

34
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,201
She's prosecuted
CEOs and serial killers,

35
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,035
and she has CIA-caliber investigators

36
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,163
that say they can find
anything and everything.

37
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,126
Her conviction rate is 99%.

38
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,250
She called me last night
and she offered a plea.

39
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,090
Single count of
first-degree manslaughter...

40
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,338
That doesn't sound so bad.

41
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,343
...with a 15-year minimum sentence.

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,932
That sounds bad.
We're not taking that, right?

43
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,221
We're not taking any deal.

44
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,803
Look, Van Owen isn't in Diaz's pocket,

45
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,264
but we have every reason to believe
that Judge McGarvey is.

46
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,770
I mean, this whole system
is against you.

47
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,110
No deal.

48
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,526
Get me an acquittal.

49
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,900
I'm not doing it, Rene.

50
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,735
I'm not playing make-believe with you.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,822
It's a mock trial, not make-believe,

52
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,406
and we got to get our story straight.

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,116
Well, I'm planning
on pleading the Fifth.

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,496
Did you have a different
amendment in mind?

55
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,620
We can't plead the Fifth
without looking guilty.

56
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,797
We are guilty. We are vigilantes,

57
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,418
and we know Oliver is the Green Arrow.

58
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,716
Which is why we gotta lie
through our teeth.

59
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,212
And we gotta be convincing.
We gotta have our story straight.

60
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,597
Hoss, you wanna weigh in on this?
You've been real quiet.

61
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,556
Why?

62
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,801
It's not like I'm gonna have to testify.

63
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,394
Curtis, please don't tell me
you have FOMO

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,891
because you weren't subpoenaed.

65
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,894
Yeah, I have major FOMO. Don't I rate?

66
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,520
You know, maybe you're just
so much better

67
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,727
at maintaining your secret identity
than the rest of us.

68
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,695
Guys, can we be real for a second here?

69
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,522
I mean, Oliver's facing life in prison.

70
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,450
Yeah, and I guess I'm just
a little bit surprised that you care.

71
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,653
Not that I think you actually
want Oliver to go to prison, Rene,

72
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,410
- but come on...
- Oliver's a jerk.

73
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,037
My position on that hasn't changed.

74
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,127
But what also hasn't changed
is the position that he's in

75
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,249
right now.

76
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,882
He's in it because of me.

77
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,387
You're right.

78
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,013
And I think we can all agree,

79
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,136
no matter what our feelings are
about Oliver,

80
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,888
none of us would want him
to go to prison.

81
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,136
Am I right?

82
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,513
Damn right.

83
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,278
From where I'm sitting,
it's pretty simple.

84
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,106
They've got the wrong guy.

85
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,985
Oliver Queen isn't the Green Arrow
any more than I am.

86
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,703
And for the record,
I'm not the Green Arrow.

87
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,330
There appears to be
a fair amount of evidence

88
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,123
to suggest the former mayor is guilty.

89
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,241
What evidence?

90
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,494
That photo from several months ago?
That was doctored.

91
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,791
And I don't know
who they're going to find

92
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,588
to say Oliver's the Green Arrow,
but they'll be lying.

93
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,711
- You sound pretty sure of that.
- I am.

94
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,627
I'm the guy that arrested Oliver
six years ago, remember?

95
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,887
I watched him pass a polygraph.

96
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,220
- He's not the Green Arrow.
- Do you know who is?

97
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,343
I got a few guesses.

98
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,804
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
- You're welcome.

99
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,723
Oh, hey.

100
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,142
Sorry, they told me
I could come in here.

101
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,318
No, that's fine. Right? We're finished.

102
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,187
Actually, maybe we could just
get some B-roll.

103
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,108
As the Black Canary, you have to know
who the Green Arrow is.

104
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,776
I do.

105
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,114
And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.

106
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,703
Happy? Got your sound bite?

107
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,918
Good.

108
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,790
This looks bigger than the O.J. trial.

109
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,796
How would you know?
You were in, like, fourth grade.

110
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,422
Yeah, but I watch <i>American Crime Story.</i>

111
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,049
I guess John decided not to show.

112
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,096
I knew he was pissed,
but I didn't know he was that pissed.

113
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,098
Guys.

114
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,144
Hey, thank you so much for coming.

115
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,971
Well, you know, they were subpoenaed...

116
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,308
But we also wanted to show our support.

117
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,393
- Yeah, we have your back.
- Thank you.

118
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,233
Really, thank you.

119
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,651
So many reporters outside.

121
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,486
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

122
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,405
- You okay?
- I always thought

123
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,582
the worst thing
that could happen to Dad is...

124
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,371
- He'd get hurt.
- I know.

125
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,211
Okay, he's been through something
like this before. I mean...

126
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,006
Not exactly like this,
but something, and...

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,500
It's gonna be okay.

128
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,461
All rise.

129
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,224
Docket number 11-19-41-73,

130
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,472
<i>The People v. Oliver Jonas Queen.</i>

131
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,390
Status of the parties?

132
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:38,770
Ready for trial.

133
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,306
Ready for trial.

134
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,482
Then let's begin.

135
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,407
Oliver Queen is a hero.

136
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,401
He is.

137
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,200
He's saved this city more times
than anybody can count.

138
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,412
But he's done it all from behind a mask,

139
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,579
so that he could take the law
into his own hands.

140
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,333
In fact, he's taken as many lives
as he's saved.

141
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,344
So, yes, Oliver Queen is a hero,

142
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,259
but that doesn't mean
he's not also a criminal.

143
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,347
Three weeks ago,
Oliver Queen was mayor of this city.

144
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,651
In that time, he has gone
from being under indictment,

145
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,688
to impeachment, to being on trial.

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,281
How?

147
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,781
How could everything go wrong
so quickly for him?

148
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,199
I think intuitively you know the answer.

149
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,613
Corruption.

150
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,203
It runs through this city like a cancer,

151
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,129
compromising some city officials
while discrediting others, like...

152
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,423
Like the defendant.

153
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,551
Even the anti-vigilante law
that he is being charged under

154
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,046
is the work of the corrupt men and women

155
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,631
who are holding our city in their grip.

156
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,142
This may sound like a conspiracy theory,

157
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,470
but at the conclusion of this trial,

158
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,522
I'm going to ask you
what is most likely.

159
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,605
That our city's government
has been compromised,

160
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,529
or that we elected a superhero
as our mayor?

161
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,742
Ms. Van Owen,
please call your first witness.

162
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,865
The people call John Diggle.

163
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,659
Where is he?

164
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,497
A bench warrant will issue
for Mr. Diggle.

165
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,631
If he's not made to appear
within one hour,

166
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,801
he'll be held in contempt of this court.

167
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,010
Is your next witness ready?

168
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,379
Yes, Your Honor.

169
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,558
Please state your name
and occupation for the record.

170
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,344
Dr. Eliza Schwartz.

171
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,431
I'm an attending physician
at Starling General Hospital.

172
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,020
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.

173
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,226
And you've had an occasion
to treat the defendant?

174
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,862
- Yes.
- For various suspicious injuries,

175
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,938
is that correct?

176
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,447
I can't say without violating
doctor-patient confidentiality.

177
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,609
I understand.

178
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,538
Then let me direct your attention,
please, to an incident

179
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,865
when Mr. Queen was not a patient.

180
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,451
On the night of April 6th, 2016,

181
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,537
the Green Arrow
brought in the Black Canary.

182
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,544
And according to your records,
she had been stabbed...

183
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,042
Objection. Is there a question
in our future?

184
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,460
Yes.

185
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,467
That night, you were close enough
to the Green Arrow

186
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,048
to determine his identity.

187
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,227
So my question is whose face
did you see that night?

188
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,021
I was focused
on saving Ms. Lance's life.

189
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,233
I wasn't the least bit concerned
with who the Green Arrow was.

190
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,852
<i>Concerned or not,</i>

191
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,733
<i>whose face did you see
underneath that mask?</i>

192
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,236
You know, it's not bad.
Oliver might just pull this one off.

193
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,904
You want to put money on that?

194
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,199
Diaz wants Oliver in prison.

195
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,160
You'd think he'd want to kill him.
I mean, at least try.

196
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,784
What, so the Green Arrow
can become a martyr?

197
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,494
Diaz is smarter than that.

198
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,334
I have to go.

199
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,040
Diaz yank your leash?

200
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,466
Something like that.

201
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,005
You know, you don't have to go.

202
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,922
First step to standing up to him
is to stand up to him.

203
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,550
Sounds like the first step
to getting myself killed.

204
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,473
Not for nothing,
but apart from your face,

205
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,639
there's one thing
you got in common with my Laurel.

206
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,932
And what's that?

207
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,110
Neither of you would let
somebody else tell you what to do

208
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,277
or have you running scared.

209
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,072
You think your Laurel
would stand up to Diaz?

210
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,148
I know it.

211
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,034
Well, maybe if she were a little smarter

212
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,286
she wouldn't have gotten herself killed.

213
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,244
It's been one hour.

214
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,038
Mr. Diggle having not yet appeared,

215
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,249
he is hereby in contempt of this court.

216
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,501
I'm sorry I'm late, Your Honor.

217
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,590
I had some business to take care of.

218
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,005
Out of town.

219
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,138
Oliver Queen is not the Green Arrow.

220
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,054
I can't make it any plainer than that.

221
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,771
How can you be so sure?

222
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,150
From 2012 to 2016,
I was his personal bodyguard.

223
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,149
If he was running around
with a bow and arrow,

224
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,813
I would have known it.

225
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,028
- But would you admit knowing it?
- Why wouldn't I?

226
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,493
Because you were aiding
and abetting a vigilante?

227
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,698
I absolutely was not.

228
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,659
In fact, I had very limited
interaction with Oliver Queen.

229
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,906
How can that be?

230
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,993
You were head of his security
at City Hall.

231
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,627
And my job was to keep him safe.

232
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,165
And that included
not jumping off of rooftops.

233
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,500
Mr. Diggle, you can't even keep
yourself safe.

234
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,295
I mean, in the past four years
you've been abducted by Damien Darhk.

235
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,176
Your own child was also kidnapped.

236
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,682
You were hospitalized for nerve damage

237
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,010
caused by severe trauma.

238
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,636
Mr. Diggle,

239
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,849
either you travel in some
very dangerous circles,

240
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,818
or you have the worst luck ever.

241
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,023
Who was Sean Sonus?

242
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,740
- Objection. Relevance?
- Overruled.

243
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,367
- Your Honor...
- I said overruled.

244
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,652
Answer the question.

245
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,572
He was a drug dealer I investigated

246
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,749
while undercover in the
Central City Police Department.

247
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,332
And he was shot and killed
in Hub City last year.

248
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,206
Your Honor, I renew my objection
as to relevance.

249
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,006
Well, if Ms. Drake is a murderer,

250
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,584
it would certainly undermine
her credibility now, wouldn't it?

251
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,593
Objection overruled.

252
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,298
Again. Sit down, Ms. Loring.

253
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,223
So, you were not with
the Central City Police Department

254
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,099
when Mr. Sonus was killed.
Is that correct?

255
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,933
- That's right.
- Did you murder him?

256
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,561
- Your Honor!
- Answer the question.

257
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,191
I'm exercising my Fifth Amendment right

258
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,571
against self-incrimination.

259
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,997
You beckoned?

260
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,209
I saw something interesting on TV.

261
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,096
<i>And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.</i>

262
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,390
Is there a problem?

263
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,802
Not yet, there isn't.

264
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,018
You know, this would move a lot faster

265
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,724
if you would stop talking in circles.

266
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,852
You were given
the gift-wrapped opportunity

267
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,400
to say that Oliver Queen

268
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,897
was the Green Arrow.

269
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:07,985
You didn't do it, baby.

270
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,745
I wasn't aware I was supposed to.

271
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,704
Well, that's why we're here,
having this little meeting.

272
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,452
So we can set expectations.

273
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,586
The prosecution is holding you
as a rebuttal witness,

274
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,541
so when they call you,

275
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,010
you're gonna be the final nail
in the coffin.

276
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,758
If I go in and try
and convince a courtroom

277
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,056
that I'm Laurel Lance,

278
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,092
I'm gonna get made.

279
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,306
Maybe you're right.

280
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,231
You don't have a poker face.

281
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,686
For example...

282
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,194
The way you've been acting lately,

283
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,569
ever since I torched Federico
on that rooftop...

284
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,408
You've been keeping
your distance from me.

285
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,118
I don't know what you're talking about.

286
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,662
It's okay.

287
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,915
You're okay.

288
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,969
I just want to be a little clear.

289
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,009
When you take the stand,

290
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,894
I want you to give the jury
a much better performance

291
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,066
than the one you're giving me.

292
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,945
You know what I'm talking about now?

293
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,439
Good.

294
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,908
That's a good girl.

295
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,287
Gotta go to the courthouse.

296
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,336
It's not going too good, is it?

297
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,965
Hey, no, it's going fine.

298
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,513
It's fine. That was just
the prosecution's turn,

299
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,262
so when it's our turn,
we're gonna kick some major ass.

300
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,597
That's a legal term.

301
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,563
Why don't you go
and get yourself something

302
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,482
that's not too unhealthy
from the vending machine, okay?

303
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,767
Okay.

304
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,486
What will happen
if Mr. Oliver goes to jail?

305
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,112
He's not going to jail, Raisa.

306
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,736
He's not the Green Arrow.

307
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,038
I think we both know better.

308
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,543
I tanked it. I did exactly
what you said not to do.

309
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,169
Lawyer's good, D.

310
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,009
Don't worry, I'll bring it home.

311
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,428
How? We got immunity
from the prosecution.

312
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,426
If watching every episode
of <i>Law & Order</i> ever

313
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,849
has taught me anything,
it's that you can't plead the Fifth.

314
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,594
If you get cornered
and you refuse to testify,

315
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,021
- you go to jail, Rene.
- Well, then I'll go to jail, hoss.

316
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,523
But I'm not screwing Oliver over again.

317
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,232
Hey, guys, the clerk just called
the court back into session.

318
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,235
I worked in the Mayor's office
close to a year.

319
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,034
Side-by-side with Mr. Queen
every single day.

320
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,789
If he was running around
pretending to be Robin Hood,

321
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,044
- I would have known.
- And did you know it?

322
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,210
Mr. Ramirez...

323
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,844
Mr. Ramirez...

324
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,684
Did you have occasion to determine

325
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,520
whether Oliver Queen
was the Green Arrow?

326
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,810
Rene...

327
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,572
He's the Green Arrow.

328
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,365
Oliver is.

329
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,584
And you know this
because you were a member

330
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,627
of his vigilante team, weren't you?

331
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,955
Yeah.

332
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:55,258
Did you ever see the defendant kill
or maim anyone as the Green Arrow?

333
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,380
Yeah.

334
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,258
How many people did he kill or maim?

335
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,022
- I don't know.
- Ballpark it for me.

336
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,144
I don't know!

337
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,274
It's too many to count.

338
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,357
Order.

339
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,524
Order!

340
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,867
The prosecution rests, Your Honor.

341
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,793
Are you okay?

342
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,548
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

343
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,007
He picked me up from school.

344
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,680
He was with a police officer.

345
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,048
They said you were hurt.

346
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,722
He was here and we just let him walk?

347
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,266
We're not letting him walk.

348
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,021
Let's get outta here.

349
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,902
Hey, look at you.

350
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,746
Maybe you don't care about people
finding out the truth about you.

351
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,740
That's right. I don't care.

352
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,416
Whatever it takes to stop you.

353
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,119
How about taking on
the entire police force?

354
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,580
How does that sound to you?

355
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,378
You want us to light them up, boss?

356
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,297
That depends on them.

357
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,969
My man.

358
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,384
What do you want us to do with them?

359
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,557
Nothing.

360
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,435
If they had an accident
after testifying...

361
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,512
Could be awkward.

362
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,974
Hey, smile.

363
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,648
It's your lucky day, baby.

364
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,900
Okay.

365
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,657
Is this as bad as it looks?

366
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,199
Arguably worse.

367
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,956
Can we prove that Diaz
was putting pressure on Rene?

368
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,254
No, no, no. I mean,
even assuming we could,

369
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,295
the jury has no idea
who Ricardo Diaz is.

370
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:00,258
Conventional wisdom says you never
ask a client if they are guilty,

371
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,058
because the more I know,
the more it might tie my hands but...

372
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,013
I am gonna ask...

373
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,805
Are you the Green Arrow?

374
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,724
Yes.

375
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,690
Then I'm going to propose
a new strategy.

376
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,401
- Okay.
- Jury nullification.

377
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,902
- Hmm?
- You're going to admit

378
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,282
to being the Green Arrow.

379
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,744
We are then going to highlight
every single thing you have done

380
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,076
for this city,
all the times you have saved it.

381
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,708
We will argue you do not deserve
to go to prison.

382
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,916
This is a legitimate chance, Oliver.

383
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,509
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

384
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,546
I'd be putting a target on my back.

385
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,975
I'd be putting a target
on my wife and son's back.

386
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,180
I have been the Green Arrow
for six years.

387
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,023
I didn't plan on doing it forever.

388
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,568
I thought that one day
my mission would end,

389
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,567
and I would finally,
after all this time,

390
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,574
get a chance to actually live my life.

391
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,570
That will never happen,

392
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,741
if I tell the whole world

393
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,118
that I'm the Green Arrow.

394
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,671
You don't have to testify.

395
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,052
- Jean doesn't have to call you.
- Yes, she does.

396
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,350
And I want to testify.

397
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,810
I don't want you in a position
where you perjure yourself

398
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,886
because of me.

399
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,855
Well, let me just add it
to the long list of felonies

400
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,931
I've already committed for you.

401
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,649
Look, John has something planned.

402
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,358
You don't have to take the chance.

403
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,026
I will take any chance,

404
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,318
if it keeps you from being taken away
from me and William.

405
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,819
Court is back in session.

406
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,403
Here we go.

407
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:58,376
I graduated summa cum laude from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

408
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,753
with master's degrees in cybersecurity

409
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:01,924
and computer sciences.

410
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:06,176
From 2015 to 2016, I served as
the CEO of Palmer Tech Incorporated.

411
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,093
Thank you.

412
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,430
Defense moves to have Ms. Smoak
accepted as an expert witness.

413
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,140
I don't see the point of this,
Ms. Loring.

414
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,098
I want the witness to testify
to the validity of this photograph.

415
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,982
Fine, but make it quick.

416
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,519
Ms. Smoak,

417
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,485
this appears to be a photograph
of your husband, Oliver Queen,

418
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,158
- dressed as the Green Arrow.
- Yes.

419
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,863
The key words being "appears to be."
This photo has been doctored.

420
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,787
A pixel level analysis will show
almost undetectable light shifts

421
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,664
and resolution inconsistencies

422
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,874
that would not be present
in a natural photo.

423
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,038
Objection, Your Honor.

424
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,341
What is the point of showing us an
allegedly doctored photograph at all?

425
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,922
The better question would be,

426
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,254
who and why would they doctor a photo

427
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,964
to make Oliver Queen
look like the Green Arrow

428
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,094
if he were the Green Arrow?

429
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,642
I mean, which he's not.
He's my husband, I would know.

430
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,599
No further questions.

431
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,149
When was Mr. Queen arrested?

432
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,142
November 21st, 2017.

433
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,689
And when were the two of you married?

434
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,064
- November 28th.
- Just a week later?

435
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,189
Yes.

436
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,733
Is it possible that you
rushed the wedding

437
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,864
so that you could claim
spousal privilege,

438
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,571
just in case you had to testify
against Mr. Queen?

439
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,745
I've been in love with Oliver
for six years.

440
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,701
Trust me, it felt anything but rushed.

441
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,377
Let's change the topic.

442
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,667
Your father's Noah Kuttler,
the alleged Calculator...

443
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,339
- Objection.
- Overruled.

444
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,085
- He's reformed.
- But before he was,

445
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,796
did you know that he was a notorious
computer hacker and cybercriminal?

446
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,880
No, I had no idea.

447
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,511
Doesn't say much about your ability

448
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,843
to see criminality in people
close to you, does it?

449
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,720
- I would...
- And under the heading,

450
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,601
"Apples falling from trees,"

451
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,434
have you yourself ever engaged
in cybercrime?

452
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,314
No, I haven't.

453
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,362
Good luck proving otherwise,
Ms. Van Owen.

454
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,238
Roy Harper is not a vigilante.

455
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,244
He sacrificed himself
to protect the identity

456
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,038
of a man that the city at the time

457
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,078
referred to as "The Hood,"

458
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,413
or "The Arrow."

459
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,045
I've since come to learn
that the Green Arrow

460
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,167
is the same person.

461
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,923
- But that's not you.
- It's absolutely not me.

462
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:07,884
And do you know who it is?

463
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,505
Yes, I do,
but I will not reveal his identity.

464
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,137
Not even if it sends me to prison.

465
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,927
Pass the witness.

466
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,680
Well, that's convenient.

467
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,765
You're not the Green Arrow,

468
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,067
you know who is the Green Arrow,
but you're not saying.

469
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,940
Well, I keep my promises, Ms. Van Owen.

470
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,649
When did you meet this mystery man?

471
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,481
Shortly after I returned to Star City.

472
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,651
As you know, I was marooned
for five years on an island

473
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:33,735
named Lian Yu.

474
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,363
This photograph was taken
during that five-year period.

475
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,370
I'm just curious, why does Lian Yu
look a lot like Russia?

476
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,159
- Objection.
- Overruled.

477
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,082
We obtained this photograph
from a reporter

478
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,959
by the name of Susan Williams.

479
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,296
I've not been entirely forthcoming
about that period of time in my life.

480
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,011
Parts of it were spent in Hong Kong,

481
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,552
and, yes, parts of it
were spent in Russia.

482
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,471
So, you lied,

483
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,558
repeatedly and publicly?

484
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,686
You lied about being on Lian Yu,

485
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,988
and you lied about
five years of your life,

486
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,441
which begs the question, Mr. Queen...

487
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,159
What else have you lied about?

488
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,386
Quiet.

489
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,183
Quiet or I'll clear the courtroom.

490
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,387
Please state your name for the record.

491
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,147
Thomas Merlyn.

492
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,982
"Tommy" is fine if you want.

493
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,359
Mr. Merlyn, you were declared dead,

494
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,562
May 15, 2013.

495
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,736
That night, my father destroyed
a large portion of the city.

496
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,280
With the heightened scrutiny
on my family,

497
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,033
I took the opportunity
to fake my own death

498
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,490
to protect my identity as The Hood.

499
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,703
Three years ago,

500
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,668
Roy Harper confessed to being The Hood.

501
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,162
To protect me.

502
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,340
And then he was attacked in prison.

503
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,466
I have lived with that guilt
for three years.

504
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,225
I am not about to let Oliver
take the blame for me

505
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,309
the same way that Roy did.

506
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,604
And that's why I'm here.

507
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,723
To set the record straight.

508
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,433
Thank you.

509
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,309
Your witness.

510
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,648
If you're the Green Arrow,

511
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,364
how come Rene Ramirez testified
under oath that Oliver Queen is?

512
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,573
Well, I would suspect
that he was being pressured to.

513
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,327
Are you saying he perjured himself?

514
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,246
Well, I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

515
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,252
I'm just the Green Arrow.

516
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,957
And I am telling you I am the only man

517
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,129
that has ever worn this hood.

518
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,630
Mr. Merlyn,

519
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,137
you're under arrest
on suspicion of murder,

520
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,058
assault, and violation
of the Anti-Vigilante Act of 2017.

521
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,394
The bailiff will remand
Mr. Merlyn into custody.

522
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,562
Objection, Your Honor.
It's the People's contention

523
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,231
that Mr. Merlyn here
is not the Green Arrow.

524
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,349
Be that as it may,

525
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,185
I can't just let him walk out
of my courtroom.

526
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,107
You know, if it's any consolation,

527
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,532
my team is going to extract me
before I ever get to prison, so...

528
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,909
Get him out of here.

529
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,662
Your Honor, defense moves
for a dismissal.

530
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,785
Nice try,

531
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,583
but it's the jury's job
to sort out this kind of mess,

532
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,910
and that's what I'm gonna let them do.

533
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,255
Guys, on the way to Iron Heights,

534
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,681
do you think we could stop
at a drive-thru?

535
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,305
- I am starving.
- We're not going to Iron Heights.

536
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,848
Mr. Diaz really wants to meet you.

537
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,518
All right, so where did we land
on the drive-thru? It's my treat...

538
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,897
You know, six against one,

539
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,570
it's not really a fair fight.

540
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,856
You should have brought backup. I did.

541
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,533
You're cutting a little close there,
aren't you, John?

542
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,336
What's your exit strategy?

543
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:13,962
Sitting right there.

544
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,375
Well, let's go.

545
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,349
- Thanks for doing this.
- My pleasure.

546
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,719
I always wanted to say,
"I am Spartacus."

547
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,067
- It's Christopher Chance.
- Rene Ramirez.

548
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,861
I think I bought you
a perjury charge back there, Rene.

549
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,737
Small price to pay
for a clear conscience.

550
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,398
You think it worked?

551
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,073
At the very least, we've created
some very serious reasonable doubt.

552
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,953
Yeah, let's hope so.

553
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,965
When you said I didn't have
to take the "chance" of lying,

554
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,713
- that was a pun!
- I don't do puns.

555
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,794
Well, that was Christopher Chance
I did just see in there, right?

556
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:02,925
Yes.

557
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,422
I'm sorry that I couldn't loop you in.

558
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,259
We had Officer Parks listening
to every word that we said,

559
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,342
and I...

560
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,271
I didn't know Chance
was gonna use Tommy's face.

561
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,942
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess they were
thinking what's more compelling

562
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,489
than a testimony from a dead guy, right?

563
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,026
Excuse me.

564
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,362
- Mr. Mayor.
- We've got a problem.

565
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,446
Not anymore.

566
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,991
- Chance just saved our bacon.
- Laurel told me.

567
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,793
She also told me
that Diaz is making her testify

568
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:34,960
as a rebuttal witness.

569
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,708
He's sending her in there
with Chance's entire CIA file.

570
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,255
She will be telling the jury everything

571
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,679
about what you guys
just pulled in there.

572
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,093
Or Diaz is going to kill her.

573
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,392
How does Diaz even know about Chance?

574
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:55,019
'Cause Diaz has access to everything
that Cayden James learned from his...

575
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,102
It's the bug in the bunker.

576
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,610
I'm sorry, Oliver.

577
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,022
We'll think of something.

578
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,941
I'll give you guys some room.

579
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,907
Okay. Okay, so...

580
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,329
Okay, what's the something
that we're gonna think of?

581
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,626
Jean suggested that I just admit
I'm the Green Arrow

582
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,332
and we go for some sort of
jury nullification.

583
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,088
But I explained to her that

584
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,669
I would like to have a life

585
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,131
after being the Green Arrow,
but more importantly, I...

586
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,846
I cannot put a target
on you and William.

587
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,265
Let me worry about me and William.

588
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,480
Let me at least take that
off your plate.

589
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,895
That's not how wedding vows work.

590
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,814
We didn't exchange vows.

591
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,607
But if we did,

592
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,238
"exchange" means "go both ways."

593
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,903
And we fight

594
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,115
for each other, Oliver.
We protect each other.

595
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,748
We're gonna save each other.

596
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,038
I can't save anyone from behind bars.

597
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,585
We'll get you out
just like we got John out.

598
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,252
I can break out of prison, Felicity,
but then what, you know?

599
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,419
I'm not abandoning the two of you.

600
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,378
I can't make the two of you fugitives.

601
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,721
We're gonna be okay.

602
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,307
John and I have been talking, and...

603
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,427
If I go to prison, I need

604
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,270
you and William to go into
A.R.G.U.S. protective custody.

605
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,481
We're not there yet.

606
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,404
We cannot live in denial.

607
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,203
All right, we have to have a plan.

608
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,574
I can handle losing my freedom.

609
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,872
I cannot handle losing you and William.

610
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,896
I solemnly affirm to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

611
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,317
and nothing but the truth.

612
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,311
Ms. Lance,

613
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,439
the defendant here
has publicly acknowledged

614
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,616
that you were the vigilante
known as the Black Canary.

615
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,944
Is it fair to take Mr. Queen
at his word?

616
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,913
On that, at least.

617
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:20,035
And being that the Black Canary is
a known associate of the Green Arrow,

618
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,046
is it fair to say
you know his true identity?

619
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,164
I do.

620
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,916
<i>I know who the Green Arrow is.</i>

621
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,633
Good girl.

622
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,885
Over the course of this trial,
we heard Rene Ramirez testify

623
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,226
that Oliver Queen was the Green Arrow,

624
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,518
but a man calling himself
Tommy Merlyn claims that identity.

625
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,062
Ms. Lance, if you would,
please, just help me out here.

626
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,186
Who's telling the truth?

627
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,901
I got an idea, hoss.

628
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,066
- Help me out.
- Let's go.

629
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,575
Ms. Lance,

630
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,920
who is the Green Arrow?

631
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:12,962
Tommy Merlyn.

632
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,467
Oliver Queen is not the Green Arrow.

633
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,813
<i>Testimony being closed,
we'll take a short recess</i>

634
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,481
<i>and resume for closing arguments.</i>

635
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,987
No comment.

636
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,899
No comment!

637
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,113
Back up! Give her a break, please.

638
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,193
Hey, hey, listen to me.

639
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,664
- Are you okay?
- Until Diaz gets a hold of me, yeah.

640
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,532
I thought you said
you were gonna bury Oliver.

641
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,918
- That was the plan.
- What made you change your mind?

642
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,370
You did.

643
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,216
The first step to standing up to him
is to stand up to him.

644
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,006
- You can't stay in town.
- Don't worry.

645
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,137
Thanks to you, I now know exactly
what I have to do.

646
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,894
Earlier, Judge McGarvey said
it fell upon you, the jury,

647
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,527
to sort out what he deemed to be a mess.

648
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,367
True, we have contradicting witnesses,

649
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,454
and, yes, we have
conflicting testimonies.

650
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,324
But that is not a mess,
ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:26,085
That is the textbook definition

652
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,204
of reasonable doubt.

653
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,049
Fifteen minutes
after being taken into custody,

654
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,557
Tommy Merlyn was freed by members
of the Green Arrow's team.

655
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,016
Now, you might take that as evidence
that he is in fact the Green Arrow,

656
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,479
but I would like to offer you
a much more plausible explanation.

657
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:58,318
And that is, Oliver Queen has people
and resources at his disposal

658
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,154
to do whatever it takes
to keep his secrets.

659
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,995
And don't think that doesn't mean
someone falling out of the sky

660
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,411
into this courtroom with a false face
and a made-up story,

661
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,589
because Tommy Merlyn
is just another Roy Harper.

662
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,958
He's just another man

663
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,886
willing to go to prison
to cover up the crimes

664
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,759
that that man committed.

665
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,299
Don't let him get away with it.

666
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,426
Not again.

667
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,430
Not ever again.

668
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,854
What happens now?

669
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,653
It's up to the jury.

670
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,856
Yeah, but...

671
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,279
What if Diaz got to them too?

672
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,572
Dad!

673
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,574
Hey.

674
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,922
William, I love you very much.

675
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,466
I love both of you very much.

676
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,511
And whatever happens,
nothing is gonna change that.

677
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,339
- What do you mean?
- I mean that

678
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,468
the man who wants me in prison

679
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,594
controls the judge,

680
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,144
and we think it's a pretty good bet
that he has

681
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,017
a strong influence over the jury.

682
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,901
- What does that mean?
- It means...

683
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,812
I might be going to prison.

684
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,356
Okay?

685
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,158
If that happens,

686
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,405
Felicity has assured me

687
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,199
that she is going to make sure

688
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,288
you grow into the man

689
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,332
that I know you can be.

690
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,047
I don't want you to go.

691
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,708
I don't want to go, either.

692
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,886
Okay, I don't...

693
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,011
I wish it was up to me but it's not.

694
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,221
You are strong like me.

695
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,768
Stronger even.

696
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,267
So, whatever happens,

697
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,770
and wherever I am...

698
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:05,695
You need to know that I am always

699
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,617
right here with you.

700
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,663
- What is it?
- Jury's back.

701
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,415
We have a verdict.

702
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,014
Will the defendant please rise?

703
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,517
Please publish the verdict.

704
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,349
In the matter of
<i>The People v. Oliver Queen,</i>

705
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,351
on all 26 counts of the indictment,

706
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,065
we find the defendant...

707
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:36,225
Guilty.

708
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,446
Members of the jury, the court
thanks you for your service.

709
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,694
You're dismissed.

710
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,402
Defense moves for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.

711
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,406
Ms. Loring, as you know,
the standard for granting a JNOV

712
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,664
requires a verdict that no
reasonable jury could arrive at.

713
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,963
I find such a circumstance here.

714
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,340
Your Honor...

715
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,889
The evidence presented
was so conflicting

716
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,845
that it created reasonable doubt.

717
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,852
The defense motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict

718
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:12,928
is granted.

719
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,602
Mr. Queen, see Probation,

720
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,015
then you're free to go.

721
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,861
Oh, my God, how is this possible?

722
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,276
I don't know.

723
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:36,706
Congratulations, man.

724
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,246
Thank you.

725
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,331
I'm surprised Judge McGarvey
had it in him, you know.

726
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,459
I totally thought
he was in the tank for Diaz.

727
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,960
I absolutely am.

728
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,720
And Mr. Diaz isn't the forgiving type.

729
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,010
Surprise.

730
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,554
Wait, wait...

731
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,227
- When did you...
- During jury deliberation.

732
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,272
You know, the Judge can argue
that he got rolled,

733
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,568
but no one's gonna believe him.

734
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,653
Thanks again, man.
I owe you another one.

735
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,525
Yeah, well, after Kasnia,
let's just call it even.

736
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,025
Chris...

737
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,574
- Thank you.
- Yeah, always happy to help.

738
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,496
Just try not to need me again,
for at least another year.

739
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,368
Okay?

740
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,464
That was a brilliant move. Thank you.

741
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,754
Well, I wish I could take the credit,
Oliver, but...

742
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,797
It wasn't my idea.

743
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,881
Dad, you might wanna close your eyes
for this part.

744
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,600
That was just one time I was scared.
That's not cool.

745
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,432
That's not cool at all.

746
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,434
Go to your room and lock the door.

747
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,515
Is it the guy from the courtroom?

748
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,645
I said go now.

749
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,255
You can take a shot at me
if you want to.

750
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,092
Just, it's gonna ruin me
saying thank you.

751
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,431
Can't be too safe.

752
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,098
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

753
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,526
When I rolled over on you last November,

754
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,023
I was thinking about my kid,

755
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,980
even though I knew it meant
it'd take you away from yours.

756
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:32,943
I'm really sorry.

757
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,615
Apology accepted.

758
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:36,993
Look, I'm sorry if I

759
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,460
made you feel like you
couldn't come to me

760
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,037
when Watson put you in that position.

761
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,084
I'm very sorry for everything
that happened afterwards.

762
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,933
I'd never do that! It's me...

763
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,225
It wasn't me, I swear.

764
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,484
The only law that I abide by

765
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,233
is following through on my word.

766
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,530
You failed at that.

767
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,079
So what would you have me do?

768
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,875
Two men, they broke into my chambers,
they knocked me out...

769
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,881
The legal system in this country

770
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,294
is going to hell.

771
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,051
You really must be stupid,

772
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,852
showing your face

773
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,981
after the crap you pulled in court.

774
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,266
No.

775
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,061
I'm smart enough to know
there's no place I can run

776
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,654
where you can't find me.

777
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,753
I'm so sorry, Ricardo.

778
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,257
Fool me once...

779
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,431
Couldn't get it out in time.

780
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,176
Come on.

781
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,596
I had a plan.

782
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,734
Get Oliver Queen
discredited, imprisoned...

783
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,155
I worked for months to make that happen.

784
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,567
I'm so sorry to disappoint you.

785
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,115
Oh, I'm not disappointed, baby.

786
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,495
I'm moving on to plan B.

787
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,162
Killing Oliver Queen,

788
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,842
and anyone and everyone he cares about.
