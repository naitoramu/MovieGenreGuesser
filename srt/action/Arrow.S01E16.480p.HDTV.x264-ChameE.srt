1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:03,726
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:07,095
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,147
survive.

4
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,932
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,490
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:16,127
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,663
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:22,516
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:26,720
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,672
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:31,058
I'd like you to work with me
 on the Vigilante investigation.

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,010
Thank you, sir!

13
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:34,745
It's just beginning.
In six months,

14
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:37,298
the organization's vision
of what this city should be

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,016
will be complete.

16
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,485
Thousands of innocent people
will be dead

17
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:42,987
and you'll feel nothing.

18
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,622
That's not true.

19
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:46,874
I'll feel a sense
of accomplishment.

20
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:49,326
So...

21
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:50,961
How can we be of assistance?

22
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,531
Malcolm Merlyn. I want
you to kill him for me.

23
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,550
These black arrows
aren't consistent with his M.O.

24
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,801
Something
doesn't add up.

25
00:00:57,803 --> 00:01:00,804
We're dealing
with a copycat.

26
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:16,553
What do you mean, the chopper's
about to touch down?

27
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:18,572
The flight log doesn't have them
due for another 20 minutes!

28
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:21,075
Then lock down
the heliport!

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,912
I've just landed
in Starling City.

30
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,598
We agreed--
half on arrival, the other half

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
when the job is done.

32
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:53,157
Gracias.

33
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,758
Don't worry.

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,361
The man's as good as--

35
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:02,733
Guillermo Barrera.

36
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:05,953
You have failed this city.

37
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:08,105
You've built quite
a reputation.

38
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,040
And you should have
stayed overseas.

39
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:13,777
I thought about it,
but then I remembered--

40
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:17,197
I've got
a reputation, too.

41
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:48,717

43
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,686
Ahh! Ow!

44
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:16,223
Now the trick
is to keep your weight

45
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:17,941
evenly distributed.

46
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:20,361
I thought the trick was
to avoid getting into fights.

47
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:22,112
Yeah, well, Starling City's
not the kind of place

48
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,348
where you can talk
your way out of trouble.

49
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,517
Besides, if you're going
to be working with us,

50
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,572
I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that
you can handle yourself...

51
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,123
At least a little bit.

52
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:38,545
How'd it go?

53
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,547
Badly for him.
Who's him?

54
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,050
An assassin for hire
with an affinity for knives.

55
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:44,968
His name was
Guillermo Barrera.

56
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,553
Was?

57
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:48,922
So we can't ask him
about his intended target?

58
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,376
No.

59
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:54,061
Which is why I need you to
hack his phone.

60
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:55,396
Barrera's world class.

61
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:56,980
He kills high
profile targets.

62
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,265
And whatever job
he was hired for

63
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,900
isn't finished.

64
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:02,236
We need to figure out who
he was here to kill, and fast.

65
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:04,238
They are probably
still in danger.

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,656
Ok?
Yeah.

67
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,724
I have to meet McKenna.

68
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,494
Good thing she didn't meet you
at the heliport.

69
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,947
May not be a good idea
to fall for the cop

70
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,399
that's hunting you down.

71
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,168
Well, it's slim pickings
for us vigilantes.

72
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:27,878
Four.

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,197
Well, I'm more of a runner.

74
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:38,188
Why the sudden
desire to work out?

75
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,807
What else is there to do?

76
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:42,726
Well, we can try to think of
another way off the island.

77
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:43,977
There is no other way.

78
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,196
If there was,
I would have found it.

79
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,865
We can't just sit here

80
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,367
and wait for Fyers
to come and kill us.

81
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,905
I did have one idea.

82
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,373
If you go into the forest

83
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,125
and gather as much bamboo
as you can find...

84
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,077
Yeah?

85
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,962
We could build ourselves a boat,

86
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:04,298
like they did
on "Gilligan's Island."

87
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,457
That's broken.

88
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,792
It got busted
during the crash.

89
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:17,511
Did you try
to get it to work?

90
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:20,264
I'm better at pulling
things apart.

91
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,567
My father was a pilot

92
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:25,352
and he used to do
his own maintenance.

93
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,654
So you're hoping
aircraft maintenance is genetic?

94
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:29,523
No, I used to help him
and I liked it.

95
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:30,824
Then I got
pretty good at it.

96
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:33,777
So maybe I can make
the radio work.

97
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,812
You should be training

98
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:38,815
for the inevitable fight
that's looming.

99
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:41,835
I think I have a better chance of
making the radio work.

100
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,255
Hey.

101
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,673
Sorry I'm late.

102
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:49,092
No, I am. I just got
caught up at the office.

103
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,295
Me, too. Wow.

104
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:52,846
You look nice.

105
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,098
Ooh.

106
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,018
We should go inside.

107
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,803
We should.

108
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:04,274
We don't seem to be
going inside.

109
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,711
Welcome.

110
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,246
Happy Birthday, buddy.
Thank you.

111
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:13,033
Oh, this feels like
a Chateauneuf de Pape.

112
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,451
It's going to taste
like one, too.

113
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:16,086
You are a true friend.
Thank you.

114
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,071
Tommy, you remember
McKenna Hall.

115
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,791
From back in the day.
And back again.

116
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,362
Ollie.

117
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,331
Hi.
Hi.

118
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,583
Laurel, this is...

119
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,302
McKenna Hall.

120
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,327
We know each other
from the court house.

121
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,004
How are you,
counselor?

122
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:35,572
I'm well, Detective.

123
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,591
I'm going to go crack this open.
Come in.

124
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:40,561
Such a nice apartment.
So much space.

125
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,980
Oh, this is adorable.

126
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,548
How old are you here?

127
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,850
That's actually
my sister Sarah.

128
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,685
Oh, I am so sorry.

129
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,320
No, no, it's ok.

130
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:53,156
I don't know why my father
bought her that canary.

131
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:55,192
That thing chirped
night and day.

132
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:56,326
Drove us all nuts.

133
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,328
A toast.

134
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,350
To the first birthday
that I have enjoyed

135
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,868
in a long time.

136
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,670
I got my best friend back.

137
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,405
And...

138
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:11,124
I have finally
figured out why poets

139
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,794
have been in business
for the last few thousand years.

140
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,912
Happy Birthday, baby.
Thank you.

141
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,130
Cheers.
Cheers.

142
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,849
Cheers.

143
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:21,218
I think that's the food.
Oh, ok.

144
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,138
Oh, thank God,
she didn't cook.

145
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,557
Amen.

146
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:32,362
Mr. Merlyn.

147
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:35,198
Laurel.
Can I come in?

148
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,409
Oliver.

149
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:46,793
Mr. Merlyn.

150
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,546
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

151
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:52,549
What are you
doing here, Dad?

152
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,085
Happy Birthday, Tommy.

153
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,488
Just give us
a second.

154
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,391
Of course.

155
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,815
We're about to eat.
I can't stay.

156
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:12,319
Well, that works out
because you weren't invited.

157
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:15,906
I'm being honored by the
Starling City Municipal Group.

158
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,308
They're bestowing me with
their annual Humanitarian Award.

159
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,161
What, they ran out of actual
humans to give it to?

160
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:24,414
I would like you
to be there, if you could.

161
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,251
I am 100% certain
that I'll be busy.

162
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,823
You might not
believe this,

163
00:08:33,825 --> 00:08:36,426
but all I ever wanted
for you was happiness.

164
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,929
If it will allay
this tension between us,

165
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,180
I'll turn
the switch back on.

166
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,548
Save your money, Dad.

167
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,600
I don't need it anymore.

168
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:47,387
I'd still like you
to come to the event.

169
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,359
It would mean
a lot to me.

170
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,144
You know what, Dad?

171
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:00,984
Sometimes the people
that you want there the most...

172
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:02,819
Aren't.

173
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,656
You taught me that.

174
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,909
Multiple times.

175
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:41,108
Hello, Lawton.

176
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,027
I see your edge has dulled.

177
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,279
Oh, I knew
you were there.

178
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,915
I just didn't care
if you killed me.

179
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,085
What do you want?

180
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,588
My organization
has been contracted

181
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,175
to eliminate a certain
high profile individual.

182
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,694
A very well-guarded target.

183
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,546
Well, forget it.

184
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:04,131
Look, I'm retired.

185
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,083
To drink and smoke
your life away?

186
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,635
We all got to die
some time.

187
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:11,505
I need someone to die
at the right time.

188
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:14,107
And no one does it
better than you.

189
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,426
My vision...

190
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:19,029
ain't exactly
what it used to be.

191
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:20,447
No.

192
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:26,820
It's going to be better.

193
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:30,824
So...

194
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:34,745
Who needs two bullets
in the chest?

195
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:38,749
Moira.

196
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,417
Is it happening?

197
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:41,668
Yes.

198
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,286
The Humanitarian Award ceremony.

199
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,305
Isn't that
a little public?

200
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:48,308
No one will expect it.

201
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:54,147
I have very welcome news
to share with all of you.

202
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,683
Thanks to Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences Division

203
00:10:56,685 --> 00:11:00,020
and their recent acquisition
of Unidac Industries,

204
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,405
the Undertaking
which we set for ourselves

205
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:05,492
is only months
from fruition.

206
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:09,446
There's hope on the horizon
for everyone in starling.

207
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,749
We won't fail this city.

208
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:18,205
And I think I speak
for everyone here

209
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:21,758
when I say we're all
with you, Malcolm.

210
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:35,065
Jeez, this is one
paranoid assassin.

211
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,518
Barerra's got cobalt-level
encryption on his phone.

212
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,104
It's not going
to be easy to break.

213
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,765
But codebreaker
is my middle name.

214
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,326
Actually, it's Megan--

215
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,026
Felicity, can you get
anything off of it?

216
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:48,312
Just the last number
he dialed.

217
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:51,699
Which was?
A restaurant in China town.

218
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:54,335
A Jade Dragon.
I guess even hired killers

219
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,669
enjoy the city's best chow mien.

220
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,121
Yeah, Jade Dragon
is a front

221
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,156
for the Chinese
mafia.

222
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:02,343
Call the restaurant, make
a reservation for two for tonight.

223
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:04,795
You need to decrypt that phone.

224
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:08,749
I'm kind of in the mood
for Chinese now.

225
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:10,267
Hmm.

226
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:25,532
That is--that is
one big fried fish.

227
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:28,452
I was told this was the most
authentic Szechwan in town.

228
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:31,322
Whatever. I wanted to make sure
that your birthday celebration

229
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:32,773
got its due celebration.

230
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:35,376
It was a little bit, um,
tense last night.

231
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,244
Well, trust my dad to run
all the smiles out of the room.

232
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,696
He did come by,

233
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,965
and it seemed like
he was trying

234
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,967
to act a little bit dad-like.

235
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:46,720
Dad-like, that sums up
my father perfectly.

236
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,589
I know the two of you
have never been close,

237
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,674
but it couldn't have been
easy for him

238
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,593
after your mom was killed.

239
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,346
Yeah, I guess he forgot that there
were two of us in that club.

240
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,648
I'm not defending him, Tommy.

241
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,483
It's...

242
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,104
With everything
I've been through,

243
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,056
people that I've lost...

244
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:08,742
I know how hard it can be.

245
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:12,079
You probably don't
remember this.

246
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,448
Ahh...

247
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,966
We were eight.

248
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:17,634
But after her funeral,

249
00:13:17,636 --> 00:13:21,955
he left for like
two years.

250
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:24,375
And when
he did come back,

251
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,493
he was...

252
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:29,530
he was so frickin' cold.

253
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:31,982
We barely spoke.

254
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:34,518
And that's why I spent so much
time at your house.

255
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,938
From the outside,

256
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,058
it always looked
like I had a father.

257
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,610
He paid my bills,

258
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:47,281
he lived in the house,
he bailed me out.

259
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:51,869
But your dad took me
to my first hockey game.

260
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:54,571
Your dad taught me
how to fly fish.

261
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:57,574
Your dad took us
to our first R-rated movie.

262
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:01,128
Your dad taught me
but he wasn't perfect.

263
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,331
My dad made mistakes.

264
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,384
And...

265
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:12,639
We haven't talked
about this.

266
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:16,310
But I have a lot
of anger towards him.

267
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:20,314
But still, I would give anything

268
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:23,567
to have him back,
because...

269
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,905
At the end of the day,
your dad is...

270
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:31,909
Your dad.

271
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:39,082
I meant what I said
last night.

272
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:41,034
I'm...

273
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:43,287
really glad
that you're back.

274
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:56,383
I got to hit the restroom.

275
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,363
Check, please.

276
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:12,509
I hope you like
barbecue.

277
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,911
Well, don't fall over
yourself thanking me

278
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:16,797
for spending six hours up a tree
so you can eat.

279
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,465
What?

280
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,968
Great. I'll eat later.

281
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,354
You've been on that for days.
Give it a rest.

282
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:25,973
It's because I can do this.

283
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,859
Sure, kid. When pigs fly.

284
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,198
You're kidding me.

285
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,285
Can you clean this up?

286
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,654
I don't know. I don't know
how I got this far!

287
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:44,207
Continue
approach. Big jet 365.

288
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,994
Mayday,
mayday, mayday.

289
00:16:46,996 --> 00:16:49,463
This is wedgetail 325.

290
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,448
Pilot
and passenger down.

291
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,166
Big jet 365, cleared to land.

292
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,969
Runway 2-7 right, wind,

293
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,721
2-7-0 degrees, 10 knots.

294
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:00,557
I repeat--pilot
and passenger down

295
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,626
on the island
of Lian Yu.

296
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:04,728
Request
immediate rescue.

297
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,930
Cleared to land,
runway 2-7 right.

298
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:09,966
Big jet 365.
Damn!

299
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,986
They can't hear us,
and we can't call out.

300
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,439
We're still trapped.

301
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,362
Lance.

302
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:24,531
The Triad have hired
a contract killer.

303
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:26,483
Yeah? You mean the one
you put in the morgue?

304
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,785
Congratulations, you're the talk
of the station again.

305
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:31,672
They hired one,
they're going to hire another, Detective.

306
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:33,256
Who's your target?

307
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:34,991
I'm trying to find out
but I'm hitting dead ends.

308
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:36,710
I need you to put
your people on it.

309
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,495
My people don't work for you.

310
00:17:38,497 --> 00:17:40,263
And come to think of it,
neither do I.

311
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:42,015
It's not about you
and me, Detective.

312
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,718
It's about
saving a life.

313
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,188
Call me back
when you got a name.

314
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,890
Hall.

315
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:51,391
Yes, sir?

316
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,560
You and me.
We're going to catch

317
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,862
that Vigilante.

318
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:00,450
There are five exit routes
from the main floor

319
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,985
that need to be cut off.

320
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:03,853
Once the fire alarm goes off,

321
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,572
we'll have less
than 30 seconds

322
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:08,125
to disable Merlyn's
private security

323
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:11,078
and force him outside
with the others.

324
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,797
Once he's outside...

325
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,834
The rest will be
up to Mr. Lawton.

326
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:22,656
Roger that.

327
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:19,732
You look handsome!

328
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,566
I try not to.
It just keeps happening.

329
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,651
What's the occasion?

330
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:26,237
I decided to go
to my dad's thing.

331
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,272
Really?

332
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:30,325
Are you sure?

333
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:31,859
Oh, mostly.

334
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:33,644
Did you want me
to go with you?

335
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,413
No, no, no, I know
you have work to do.

336
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,498
I promise
I will be fine.

337
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,863
You look beautiful.

338
00:20:11,316 --> 00:20:12,700
Thank you.

339
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:15,403
If you're free,

340
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:18,239
maybe after the ceremony,
we could have dinner

341
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,791
and talk like we used to.

342
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,793
I'd like that.

343
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:24,495
That's my cue.

344
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:35,139
I've been trying to avoid
him all evening.

345
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:38,426
If we didn't show,
it'd look suspicious.

346
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:40,728
How can you talk
to him that way?

347
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,123
As if nothing's
about to happen?

348
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:43,777
I've been living this life
for five years.

349
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,200
Five more minutes won't matter.

350
00:20:45,885 --> 00:20:47,902
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:51,606
Now tonight's honoree
needs very little introduction.

352
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,992
It's neither his wealth
nor his name

353
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:56,944
that we celebrate here tonight.

354
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:58,579
But it is his efforts

355
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,631
in making Starling City a better

356
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:03,451
and safer place to live.

357
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:05,837
So please help me welcome

358
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,423
Starling City's
humanitarian of the year,

359
00:21:08,425 --> 00:21:10,625
Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.

360
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,700
And so that's a stage, right.

361
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:38,152
Most nights we'll have a band.

362
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:40,071
Somebody cool.
Is Fallout Boy still cool?

363
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:41,873
They broke up.

364
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,275
And never.

365
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:48,546
So somebody else
will pick the bands.

366
00:21:49,932 --> 00:21:52,133
Something
bothering you?

367
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,969
Don't say no, 'cause you're
a terrible liar.

368
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,954
Really?

369
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,723
I thought I was
getting better at it.

370
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:01,392
Mm-mmm.
What's wrong?

371
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,013
There's a lot of stuff
going on in my life.

372
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,682
Work.

373
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:10,234
Friends.

374
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:14,522
And I'm having a...

375
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:19,360
difficult time figuring out
how to fit it all in.

376
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:21,863
I've been struggling

377
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:23,247
with some of those
thoughts, as well.

378
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:24,816
Do you have any good ideas?

379
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:27,034
I think we just have
to be really honest

380
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,086
about what's going
on in our lives.

381
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,173
Think you can do that?

382
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:36,260
Come on.

383
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:37,795
I'm in! Yes!

384
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:39,964
Yes! Yes, way to go,

385
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,682
Felicity Smoak.

386
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:44,218
You don't happen
to speak Spanish, do you?

387
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,636
Arabic.

388
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,022
Oh, le sigh.

389
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:53,895
Oh, my God.

390
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,780
You know
I'm there for you.

391
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:59,400
Excuse me, Mr. Queen.

392
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:03,520
The I.T. department
has that item that you requested.

393
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,072
One sec.
Ok.

394
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,693
You find the target?

395
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:11,746
Oliver, the target
is Tommy's father.

396
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:14,665
At the awards ceremony?

397
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,918
Tommy's there.

398
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,003
Um, McKenna, Mr. Diggle
is going to take you home.

399
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:21,489
I have some unexpected business.

400
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,808
It's ok.

401
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:27,428
Lance.

402
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,380
Target is Malcolm Merlyn.

403
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:31,816
Establish a perimeter
but keep your distance.

404
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:34,318
I don't want the police
caught in the crossfire.

405
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,854
The true humanitarian
in the Merlyn family

406
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:39,090
was my wife Rebecca.

407
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,993
Many of you here
knew her.

408
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:43,560
She tirelessly
devoted herself

409
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:46,447
to helping those less
fortunate in the glades.

410
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:49,500
I like to think that if the men
who murdered her

411
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:50,902
knew her;

412
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:52,904
knew the work
that she did,

413
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:55,623
knew the person
that she was...

414
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:59,427
He would have helped her to her car,
made sure she was safe,

415
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:02,430
instead of stealing her
purse and shooting her.

416
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:12,890
The truth is, I haven't done
enough for this city.

417
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:15,192
My city.

418
00:24:15,194 --> 00:24:17,812
I failed it.

419
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,363
But I promise you--

420
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:20,865
I am not finished yet.

421
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,766
I promise you
that this city

422
00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:25,670
will be better
for all of us.

423
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,439
And on that day,
I will look

424
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:32,860
at this beautiful award
and feel that I have earned it.

425
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:35,229
I thank you.

426
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:47,675
Oh!

427
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:54,899
Mr. Merlyn, you should
head for the exit--

428
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:01,238
Tommy!

429
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:26,486
Merlyn's not taking the bait.
Change of plans.

430
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:28,571
I don't like improvisation.

431
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:30,606
Drive him upstairs
to his penthouse office.

432
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:32,909
I need to switch
vantage points.

433
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,944
Tommy!

434
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:39,349
Tommy!

435
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,584
Come with me.

436
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,620
There's an exit
on the second floor.

437
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:48,041
I wasn't leaving
until I knew you were safe.

438
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,609
Go somewhere safe.
I'll hold them off.

439
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,145
Go now!
Come on!

440
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,482
Where are we going?
Up.

441
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,150
Who are those guys?
I don't know.

442
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:15,401
They're trying to kill you!

443
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:16,953
Seems that way.

444
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:18,788
And we're going up,
without any of your bodyguards?

445
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,990
Dad! We need
to get out of here.

446
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:23,876
Tommy, take a deep
breath and trust me.

447
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:26,295
Upstairs in my office
is a panic room.

448
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:29,882
We get there,
we seal it off.

449
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,469
Merlyn's headed
to the penthouse.

450
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,686
Why do you want
Malcolm Merlyn dead?

451
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:54,407
I'll settle for you.

452
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,351
Wait!

453
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:24,771
Go!
You killed him!

454
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,939
Surely as he would have
killed you.

455
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:28,858
Move, move, move!

456
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,782
Electromagnetic locks.

457
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,349
What if they
cut the power?

458
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:39,152
This floor is on
an entire separate grid.

459
00:27:39,154 --> 00:27:40,352
The glass?

460
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:43,856
Lexan. Bulletproof.
It's over.

461
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:44,830
How did you know
how to do that?

462
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:46,243
What?

463
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:48,227
Fight.

464
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:50,213
Kill.

465
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:03,726
Dad?

466
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:30,937
Freeze! SCPD.

467
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,705
Put the bow down.

468
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:41,180
Tommy, you ok?

469
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,777
Dad!

470
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:02,952
Dad?!

471
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:12,309
Turn around slowly.

472
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:25,740
Dad.

473
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:27,291
I'm sorry.

474
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,826
I'm ok.

475
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:30,828
I'm ok.

476
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:40,537
Damn it.

477
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:43,507
You're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

478
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,677
I'll be fine, Tom.

479
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,430
No, no, no, Dad!

480
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:51,982
Dad!

481
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,851
No!

482
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:55,603
Stay back.

483
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:58,289
I'm not here to hurt
you or your father.

484
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,442
I said stay back.

485
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:08,115
Curare.

486
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:09,733
Don't come any closer.

487
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:11,452
Your father's
been poisoned.

488
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:14,371
An assassin named Floyd Lawton
laces his bullets with curare.

489
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,247
I've dealt with this before.

490
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,407
We need to dilute the poison
in his bloodstream.

491
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,660
I said stay the hell back!

492
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,629
In three minutes
he's paralyzed.

493
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,614
In four minutes,
he suffocates.

494
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:25,433
If you don't let me
help you now,

495
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:27,518
he's dead before
anybody gets here!

496
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,754
Help. How?

497
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:33,390
Fresh blood buys him time
to get to the hospital.

498
00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:36,727
A blood transfusion?

499
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:38,813
That's insane!

500
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:40,614
It's the only way.

501
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:42,700
He needs your blood.

502
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,535
You're out of time.

503
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:47,371
You need to make
a decision right now.

504
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,373
Why should I trust you?!

505
00:30:59,134 --> 00:31:02,887
Because you always have.

506
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:05,556
Oliver.

507
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,362
Ok. Ready?

508
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:29,914
Do it.

509
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:55,222
Hold his arm.

510
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:06,033
Come on, come on, come on.

511
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:10,538
You're the Vigilante.

512
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,407
Why?

513
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:16,377
Later.

514
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:18,212
He's still going to need
medical attention

515
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:20,831
to fully clean out
his system, you understand?

516
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,716
Ok.

517
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,835
Thank you.

518
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:34,929
Tommy.

519
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:37,264
I'm right here, Dad.

520
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:47,825
What did the Hood
say to you?

521
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:49,243
He didn't say anything.

522
00:32:49,245 --> 00:32:51,228
You let a homicidal
maniac talk you into

523
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,613
a homemade blood
transfusion

524
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:53,831
instead of calling
the paramedics?

525
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,866
My father's life
was at stake.

526
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:59,787
So first the Hood rescues you
and Queen from those kidnappers,

527
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:02,122
now he saves
your old man.

528
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:05,926
But he's taking down every
other one percenter out there.

529
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:09,597
Is this guy a friend
of yours, Merlyn?

530
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,050
I don't know
who the hell he is.

531
00:33:31,703 --> 00:33:35,289
If they can't hear us,
then what's the point?

532
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:37,825
Wait!

533
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,460
You still might have
done us some good.

534
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:41,778
0500 hours from my mark.

535
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,881
Final deployment
is five by five.

536
00:33:43,883 --> 00:33:45,666
That's Fyers!

537
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:48,168
I'm tuned into
the soldier's frequency.

538
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,888
Scylla is in route.
ETA 0600 hours.

539
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,556
At the southwest bay.

540
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:54,224
I'll call you when Scylla
is in my possession.

541
00:33:54,226 --> 00:33:56,243
Fyers out.

542
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,362
Who was Fyers talking to?

543
00:33:58,364 --> 00:33:59,730
I don't know.

544
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:01,398
Sounds like someone
off this island,

545
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,434
maybe his benefactor.
More importantly,

546
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:05,152
who or what is Scylla?

547
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:06,987
The Scylla and Charibdis.

548
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:11,275
It's "The Odyssey," from one
of the four nightmare chapters.

549
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:14,278
Scylla was a monster.

550
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,333
I want to meet
this monster.

551
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:22,503
Am I going alone?

552
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,920
So how's it feel
to save a one percenter?

553
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,504
Looks like Malcolm Meryln's
going to be ok.

554
00:34:46,506 --> 00:34:48,089
They took him
to Starling General.

555
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:50,441
Good thing he was wearing
a bulletproof vest.

556
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:53,460
He's not in the hospital
because he was shot.

557
00:34:53,462 --> 00:34:56,647
He was poisoned
by curare.

558
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:14,615
Lawton's alive.

559
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:17,668
I'm sorry, John.

560
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:31,048
This Lawton kick his dog
or something?

561
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,217
No.

562
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,138
He killed his brother.

563
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:46,364
What?

564
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:48,733
What is it?

565
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:50,618
You were right.

566
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,787
Scylla is a monster.

567
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,538
A Russian-made S300

568
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,191
anti-aircraft
missile launcher.

569
00:35:57,193 --> 00:36:00,711
It can simultaneously track
up to a hundred targets

570
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:03,464
while engaging
with at least a dozen.

571
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:05,833
I mean, from here,

572
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:08,419
they could shoot down
a commercial airliner,

573
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:11,722
or start a war.

574
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:19,397
Hey, you're here.
Yeah.

575
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,565
Walk with me.
Mm-hmm.

576
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,317
I heard you were
there, are you ok?

577
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:24,568
I'm fine. Fine.

578
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,353
Listen, McKenna, I'm--

579
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:29,156
I'm really sorry that I had to run
out on you like that.

580
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:30,775
Don't worry.
Five more minutes,

581
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:33,110
and I would have had
to run out on you.

582
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:37,831
Our lives
are complicated.

583
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,204
But I'm willing
to figure us out.

584
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:46,372
If you are.

585
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:51,528
Willing and able.

586
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,471
Hey. Hey, Dad.

587
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:02,806
Dad, Dad.

588
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:05,275
Take it easy.

589
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:07,260
You were shot.

590
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:10,063
The bullet was
laced with poison.

591
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:12,649
I should be dead.

592
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:16,236
I gave you
a blood transfusion.

593
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,706
Actually it was...

594
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,659
the Vigilante's idea.

595
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:24,627
He saved you.

596
00:37:24,629 --> 00:37:27,096
He did?

597
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:30,467
I was worried I was
going to lose you.

598
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:32,469
I'm not going anywhere.

599
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:36,022
You said that
after mom died.

600
00:37:36,024 --> 00:37:38,825
But you left.

601
00:37:38,827 --> 00:37:40,374
I wasn't a very good father

602
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:42,250
to you after your mother
passed away.

603
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:46,049
I was so lost.

604
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:49,252
You never told me
where you went.

605
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:58,595
I found myself in a place
called Nanda Parbat.

606
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:03,867
I met a man there.

607
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,921
He helped me
make sense of things.

608
00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:13,142
He helped me to find
a purpose for my life;

609
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:17,030
to make this city
a better place for everyone.

610
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:21,551
Especially for you.

611
00:38:21,553 --> 00:38:25,054
How are you going
to do that?

612
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:28,441
Malcolm?

613
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,945
Tommy.

614
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:35,398
Could I talk to Moira
for a minute?

615
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:55,385
Thank God
you're all right.

616
00:38:55,387 --> 00:38:58,304
We have a traitor
in our midst.

617
00:38:58,306 --> 00:39:00,473
I want you to find out who.

618
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:05,144
He just made his last mistake.

619
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:17,390
My dad's going to be ok,
thanks to you.

620
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:20,610
It's thanks to you.

621
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:24,530
No one's asked you what happened
to you out on that island.

622
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:27,066
You said "a lot."
That doesn't quite cover it.

623
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:28,585
Tommy...

624
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:30,236
I saw you
kill those guys

625
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:33,623
who kidnapped us when you
first got back, didn't I?

626
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,264
I...

627
00:39:41,266 --> 00:39:43,433
I know you have
a lot of questions.

628
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:45,418
Yeah.

629
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,555
Yeah, but for now,
just the one.

630
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:55,011
Were you ever
going to tell me?

631
00:39:58,048 --> 00:40:01,868
No.

632
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:17,216
Tommy, I just saw it
all on the news.

633
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:19,002
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

634
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:20,970
Bye.

635
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:30,163
Hello, Laurel.

636
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:33,199
Mom?

637
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,236
What are you doing here?

638
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:40,606
I need
to talk to you.

639
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:43,076
About what?

640
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:46,829
I know
I've made mistakes.

641
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:48,581
Yeah.

642
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:51,050
Yes, you have.

643
00:40:53,204 --> 00:40:55,238
Look, I have to go.

644
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,341
Why don't you send me an email
or a postcard some time?

645
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:00,576
I have something important
I need to discuss with you.

646
00:41:02,163 --> 00:41:05,682
What could be so important
after all this time?

647
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,469
It's about Sarah.

648
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:11,771
What about her?

649
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:14,059
I think
she may be alive.

650
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,159
