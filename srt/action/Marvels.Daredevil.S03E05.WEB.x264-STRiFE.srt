1
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,890
There is no corpse.

2
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,610
There's no corpse.

3
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,490
I heard you.

4
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,620
Remind Felix Manning
that I do not tolerate loose ends.

5
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,910
Yes, Mr. Fisk.

6
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,880
But the body was probably just swept
away in the current.

7
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,420
Even if Murdock
somehow escaped from the cab,

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,170
how does a blind man swim to shore?

9
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,140
This look like a blind man to you?

10
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,730
We investigated him thoroughly.

11
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,070
His associates.

12
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,900
Medical and school records all check out.

13
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,320
All confirm that Matt Murdock
lost his sight at age nine.

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,290
Yes.

15
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,870
Nevertheless...

16
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,290
a man capable of that could have survived.

17
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,850
And he threatened
to come between Vanessa and I.

18
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,360
It's time for the government
to honor our deal.

19
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,570
Thanks to my client,

20
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,780
the Albanian Syndicate
has been completely wiped out.

21
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,830
Their counterfeiting ring,
their Dark Web child pornography.

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,960
And the Jalisco connection
Mr. Fisk divulged last week

23
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,090
gave the DEA an early
and very white Christmas.

24
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,130
And in exchange
for his ongoing cooperation,

25
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,800
the DOJ will not be filing charges
against Vanessa Marianna.

26
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,350
Mr. Fisk is also entitled to the return
of certain personal belongings,

27
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,190
supervised movement within the hotel.

28
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,310
He'll get everything he was offered.
In time.

29
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,860
That time is now,
Special Agent Nadeem.

30
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,570
Unless you'd like my client
to stop talking.

31
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,990
FBI has sacrificed a great deal for me.

32
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,420
And I will continue to cooperate
and trust you'll honor your word.

33
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,930
There's a criminal I've employed.

34
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,770
A facilitator.

35
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,940
On my behalf,
he's laundered and hid money,

36
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,690
bribed law enforcement
and court officials,

37
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,950
orchestrated perjured testimony,
manufactured evidence.

38
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,570
Who is he?

39
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,830
A lawyer. Matthew Murdock.

40
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,500
Alpha Team on approach.

41
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,960
FBI. Get back in your apartment
and close the door.

42
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,590
Stack up.

43
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,300
Breach.

44
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,850
FBI!

45
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,190
Clear!

46
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,290
Murdock's been home.

47
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,660
Recently.

48
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,920
It was so nice to see you again.

49
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,250
Take care.

50
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,980
Felix Manning?

51
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,900
You haven't returned my calls.

52
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,360
Karen Page, from the Bulletin.

53
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,230
Before I go to print,

54
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
I'm obligated to offer you
a chance to comment

55
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,240
on your involvement
in laundering money for Wilson Fisk.

56
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,870
Look, if you talk to me off the record,
help me connect some dots,

57
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,790
I promise I will keep your name out of it.

58
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,670
But that is only if you talk to me.

59
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,380
You're a fixer, Mr. Manning.

60
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,180
You're a freelancer.
Other clients, a lot to lose.

61
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,980
Once this story breaks,
Fisk is gonna hang you out to dry.

62
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,020
If I were you,
I would start looking out for myself.

63
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,780
Karen Page.

64
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Daughter of Paxton and Penelope.

65
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,160
239 Kings Road, Fagan Corners, Vermont.

66
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,000
You had the back room. My guess,
Dad wanted his little girl to be safe.

67
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,210
Sadly, he should've been more worried
about his little boy.

68
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,760
Drug addicts really do destroy families,
don't they?

69
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,800
Off the record,

70
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,970
you're incorrect.

71
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,760
About what I do for a living.

72
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,270
I don't fix problems.

73
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,190
I make them disappear.

74
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,600
Karen Page?

75
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,220
- Who are you?
- Don't move.

76
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,730
FBI.

77
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,860
Uh... I have a weapon in my purse.
And a concealed carry permit.

78
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,700
Keep your hands exactly where they are
and follow my instructions.

79
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,950
Now turn around.

80
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,410
Okay. Okay.

81
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,710
Okay. Okay.

82
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,010
What do you want from me?

83
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,260
What happened?

84
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,890
Why'd you bring me here?

85
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,900
I asked him to.

86
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Is Matt okay?

87
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,650
You wanna tell me what's going on?

88
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,940
Ms. Page, I get that you
ask questions for a living,

89
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,660
but, for now, I'll be the one asking.

90
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,710
When's the last time
you heard from Matt Murdock?

91
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Um...

92
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,980
Months.

93
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,600
You haven't seen
or spoken to him in months?

94
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,310
Uh, no.

95
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,240
He give you any indication
when he'd be back?

96
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,030
Uh, no.

97
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,490
Or whether he'd be back at all?

98
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,040
No.

99
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,130
Then why have you been paying his bills?

100
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,050
He's a friend. Someone had to do it
while he was away.

101
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,640
So your friend, a blind man
who you haven't spoken to in months,

102
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,930
just ups and disappears, and you
don't file a missing persons report?

103
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,190
I figured he'd come back
when he was ready.

104
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Can you think of any reason
why Matt Murdock would go on the run?

105
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
No.

106
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,290
You were a secretary
for Nelson and Murdock.

107
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,160
Mmm-mmm. Office manager.

108
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,880
And when did the firm
first start working for Wilson Fisk?

109
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,170
Um...

110
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,300
We never worked for Wilson Fisk.

111
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,600
Is that your signature?

112
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,060
Do you remember depositing this
retainer check for a company called CGI?

113
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,150
Yes, I do. Um... Look, Matt and Foggy
took on one case for them. That's all.

114
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,650
According to my source,
CGI was a front for Fisk.

115
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,650
Well, we didn't know that at the time.

116
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,240
But you do now.

117
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,410
So you see how your last answer
wasn't technically accurate?

118
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:52,160
Okay, we never knowingly worked for Fisk.

119
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,330
They hired us through someone else.

120
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,410
Who?

121
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,290
Some executive.

122
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,710
Hang on.

123
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,360
Was it this guy?

124
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,900
James Wesley. You remember him?

125
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,400
Uh, yeah. I think that was him. Why?

126
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,990
Just trying to put the pieces together.

127
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,040
Okay. Uh... Well, here are some
other pieces for you to put together.

128
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,790
Um...

129
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,590
Felix Manning. Red Lion National Bank.
Vancorp. Any of that ring any bells?

130
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,590
I don't follow.

131
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,720
Well, instead of letting Fisk
use you and the FBI

132
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,100
to retaliate against innocent lawyers
who put him in prison,

133
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,180
why don't you ask him if he hired
a fixer named Felix Manning

134
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,400
to launder money through Red Lion?

135
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,400
Ask him if he's the true owner
of a shell company called Vancorp.

136
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Why would I do that?

137
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,740
Because it just bought
the Presidential Hotel.

138
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,740
Where are you getting this from?

139
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,700
I ask questions for a living.
I just ask better ones than you do.

140
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,380
Like, has your so-called prisoner just
bought the prison you're keeping him in?

141
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,750
Has he bought?

142
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,050
So this is what? Just a theory?

143
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,300
You have any proof?

144
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,310
Fisk is using you, Agent Nadeem.
That's what he does.

145
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,020
Is that a no?

146
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,350
Am I under arrest?

147
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,310
Not at this time.

148
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,770
Then I'm done
answering the wrong questions.

149
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,800
Is this everything?

150
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,510
Everything Felix's investigators
were able to dig up on short notice.

151
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,350
Uh...

152
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,070
This will take some time.

153
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,490
I brought an audiobook.

154
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,710
Dex, ready to go?

155
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,040
Game starts in 20. Traffic's a nightmare.
We gotta hustle.

156
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,630
What's the deal?
You don't even got your uniform on.

157
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,930
You all right, buddy?

158
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,100
Trouble in paradise?

159
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,900
Does the headmaster know you're drilling
a hole in his pile of bricks?

160
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,190
He doesn't like it.

161
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,280
He gives you a hard time,
you send him my way.

162
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,780
It's damn fine practice.

163
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,700
Hey, I got you a little something.

164
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
I was gonna wait until after the game...

165
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:11,670
100% leather.

166
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,760
That's steerhide in the pocket
and cowhide in the palm,

167
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,180
so it's nice and soft.

168
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,970
Try it on.

169
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,520
An all-star pitcher
deserves some all-star gear.

170
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,610
Come on, let's go break it in.

171
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,280
Wait.

172
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,530
Real quick, can I show you my new wind-up?

173
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,950
All right, showboat.

174
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,580
Let's see it.

175
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,640
You're in the zone, Dex.
Keep throwing those heaters.

176
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,480
Strike!

177
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,820
Strike!

178
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,570
Strike!

179
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,610
Strike! Strike!

180
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,280
Strike!

181
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,910
All right, kiddo. Pack it in.
Let's give that arm of yours a rest.

182
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
You're pulling me?

183
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,380
- I'm gonna let Kanon finish it out.
- But... but no one's gotten a hit off me.

184
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,090
I know. You're killin' it out here.
No question.

185
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,590
But I gotta give other kids
some field time.

186
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,260
You can't do this. It's not fair!
You gotta let me keep going.

187
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,270
Keep it together, okay?
Take a few deep breaths.

188
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,350
Big gulps of air.

189
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,060
I need...

190
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,190
I need to keep going.

191
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,280
If I pitch a perfect game,
then they might...

192
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,910
Dex...

193
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,960
you could pitch a billion perfect games.

194
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,670
It won't bring your parents back.

195
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,630
Okay.

196
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,140
Hit the pine.

197
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,140
Grab a Popsicle.

198
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,890
We'll talk later.

199
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,190
Well, this has been nice so far,
hasn't it?

200
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,490
Talking like this.

201
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,700
Now that we've gotten to know
each other a little bit,

202
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,530
I wonder if we could talk
about Coach Bradley?

203
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,540
What happened at the field?

204
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,290
How did it make you feel?

205
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,590
Sad?

206
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,220
Maybe a little scared?

207
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,640
I wasn't sad.

208
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
Why not, do you think?

209
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,140
He was a jerk.

210
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,890
How so?

211
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,100
How was Coach Bradley a jerk?

212
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,400
He never let me do what I wanted.

213
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,360
Didn't know shit about pitching.

214
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,450
He was your coach for a long time.
Was he always such a jerk to you?

215
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,330
What about last year
when he named you MVP?

216
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,950
Was he a jerk then?

217
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,200
No. He used to be awesome.

218
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,840
Dex, tell me...

219
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,470
And be honest.

220
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,840
We like honesty around here.

221
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,930
When you hit Coach Bradley...

222
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,690
was that an accident?

223
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,440
Whatever you say stays between us.
That's the law.

224
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,660
No.

225
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,410
It wasn't an accident.

226
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,840
Am I in trouble?

227
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,800
No.

228
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
No.

229
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,010
It wasn't your fault.

230
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,430
But I just told you, I did it on purpose.

231
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,220
That doesn't mean it was your fault.

232
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,600
It's confusing, isn't it?

233
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,480
Here, let me put it like this.

234
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,020
This is you, right?

235
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,110
Yeah.

236
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,780
This is fantastic.

237
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,320
But you see how alone you are?

238
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,370
It's just you,
surrounded by all this emptiness.

239
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,580
It's been that way
for most of your life, hasn't it?

240
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,290
Yeah.

241
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,670
I mean, most kids, they have moms or dads

242
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,550
to teach them right from wrong,
to show them how to behave.

243
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,930
My parents mostly got mad at me.

244
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,010
Yes.

245
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,770
Then they died.

246
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,940
And there were things
that you never learned.

247
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,770
You see?

248
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,520
Not your fault.

249
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,480
Good news is, you've got me now.

250
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:13,200
Now, we've got a lot of work to do,
but I think that it is going to be fun.

251
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,540
We are going to establish some routines,

252
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,160
learn to stay calm.

253
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,420
And first things first,
we're gonna practice empathy.

254
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
What's that?

255
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,840
That means being kind to someone
when they're in pain.

256
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,510
So let's say, for example, that my cat
got sick this morning and I was upset.

257
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,390
What would you say to me?

258
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,350
How about something like,
"I'm sorry. That sounds hard."

259
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm sorry. That sounds really hard.

260
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,230
Look at you!

261
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,150
You even put a "really" in there.

262
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,360
I like a fast learner.

263
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,700
I think we are gonna make a terrific team,
you and me.

264
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,420
Oh.

265
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,630
Nothing marks an occasion
like a little bubbly, huh?

266
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,470
It's a... a Cava, actually.

267
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,090
Spanish champagne.

268
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,270
It was a little farewell gift
from the chiropractor down the hall.

269
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,770
Tomorrow is my last day in the building.

270
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,650
Here. Go on.

271
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,980
I'm not 21.

272
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,820
Good for you.

273
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,120
It's been quite a challenging day.

274
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,500
Quite a few goodbyes.

275
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,250
Lots of...

276
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,130
longtime clients.

277
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,800
That... That's hard.

278
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,220
That's really hard.

279
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,970
And then there's this,

280
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,230
our last session together,

281
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,310
which I've been dreading
since my prognosis.

282
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,150
Then don't leave.

283
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,610
We can keep meeting.
I can keep getting better.

284
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,110
Dex...

285
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,490
You can't leave.

286
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,910
You are gonna be fine, Dex.

287
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,370
We prepared for this.

288
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,580
You are gonna get a job
with a nice, rigid structure.

289
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,750
You're gonna stick to your meds.

290
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,550
And if you get off track, you can...
listen to these.

291
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,970
This is every session we've had.

292
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Cycle through them again.

293
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,770
When we remind ourselves
of how far we've come,

294
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,900
we're less inclined to slip back.

295
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,860
And one last thing.

296
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,900
This is a, uh... a colleague of mine.

297
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,080
He's a fine therapist, with a lot
of expertise in your particular...

298
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,410
I don't want another therapist!

299
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,500
Are you trying to scare me?

300
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,130
No.

301
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,550
Not scare you.

302
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,550
Then what is your intention?

303
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,430
And be honest.

304
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,640
I want...

305
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,480
I want to kill you.

306
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,690
Say more.

307
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,400
Why do you want to kill me?

308
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,860
To put me out of my misery?

309
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,940
To punish you.

310
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,410
I'm not quite sure what I've done wrong.

311
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,830
I want to kill you for dying.

312
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,250
For leaving me.

313
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,710
Death always wins, Dex.

314
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,630
Eventually.

315
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,550
But when it comes quietly and naturally,
it can be a beautiful event.

316
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,520
Which is why
we never hasten it with violence.

317
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,480
I can't do this alone.

318
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,400
You remember what I did?

319
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,870
Last time I was alone?

320
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,410
Then find someone.

321
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,200
I don't want another therapist!

322
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,120
Any good person
with a decent heart will do.

323
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,460
Someone to look up to.

324
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,300
Your internal compass isn't broken, Dex.

325
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,590
It just works better when you have
the North Star to guide you.

326
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,740
Suicide Prevention, this is Dex.

327
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,160
Who am I speaking with?

328
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,040
Hi, Craig. How can I help you today?

329
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm sorry. That's hard.
That's really hard.

330
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,800
Why don't you tell me a little bit more
about how you're feeling?

331
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,130
That's a lot to deal with.
I'm glad you called.

332
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,840
You're doing amazing.

333
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,520
Tell me, Craig,

334
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,850
are you thinking
about taking your own life right now?

335
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,520
Okay.

336
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,530
Do you have a plan?

337
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,540
What kind of gun do you have, Craig?

338
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm familiar with the M11.

339
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,050
Did a couple years in the army.
Got real cozy with the M11.

340
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,260
It's reliable.

341
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,810
Let me ask you a question, Craig.

342
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,350
If this asshole stepdad of yours
is giving you so much grief,

343
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,770
why take your own life?

344
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,520
Why not...

345
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,490
Take a deep breath, Craig.

346
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,700
We're gonna work through this together.

347
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,580
I'm not going anywhere.

348
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,440
If I may ask, Mr. Fisk,

349
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,570
without getting into specifics,
what's this all about?

350
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,410
Right now, I am New York's scapegoat.

351
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,080
Downstairs, there are protesters
chanting prayers

352
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,960
to drive me out into the wilderness.

353
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,210
The attention that it brings
is an impediment for my plan.

354
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,970
Fortunately,
the public is easily distracted.

355
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,930
Which makes the solution
for my problem quite simple.

356
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,690
The city needs a new villain.

357
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,440
And I think I might've found him.

358
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,900
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

359
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,170
Looks like you need a little more time.

360
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,590
I'll grab you a water.

361
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,800
This is gonna sound random,

362
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,760
but did you used to work
at the Brooklyn Suicide Hotline?

363
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,180
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
That... was a tough job.

364
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,480
It was.

365
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,150
You probably don't remember me. I'm Julie.

366
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Dex.

367
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,950
Yeah, of course I remember you.

368
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,320
Small world, huh?

369
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,990
I haven't seen you in here before.

370
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,500
It's... it's my first day, actually.

371
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,620
I got offered double the pay
to leave my last job

372
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,210
if I could start here immediately.
Not that I'm complaining.

373
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,220
What about you?
Are you staying at the hotel?

374
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,300
No. I live here.

375
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,720
In New York, not in the hotel.

376
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,930
The FBI has an office upstairs.

377
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,310
We're guarding Wilson Fisk.

378
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,730
A G-man.

379
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,690
Excuse me, miss! Hello?

380
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,990
I need to go help that table
so they don't fire me on my first day.

381
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,530
What time do you get off?

382
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,620
In about an hour.

383
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,870
Do you wanna hang out after?

384
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,130
Catch up?

385
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,790
Uh...

386
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,670
Yeah.

387
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,130
That... That'd be great.

388
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,630
Hmm.

389
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,230
I got your coppa, your prosciutto,
your mocetta, your sweet soppressata.

390
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,190
All you can eat. Free!

391
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,070
For anybody who promises
to vote for Foggy Nelson,

392
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,200
my less handsome brother.

393
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,820
You can't do that, Theo.

394
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,370
It violates election law.
It's an illegal inducement to vote.

395
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,290
I don't see Mrs. Wobschall
calling the cops.

396
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,750
May I borrow a pen?

397
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,220
Is that an actual ballot, Mrs. Callahan?

398
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,390
I just voted for you.

399
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,470
Absentee.

400
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,270
When Wilson Fisk set off
those explosives in Hell's Kitchen,

401
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,520
I lost my husband.

402
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,900
Everything that matters, gone.

403
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,480
Except my vote.

404
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,150
I'm counting on you, Foggy.
You get that son of a bitch.

405
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,490
I will. I promise.

406
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,120
Thank you, everyone.

407
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,000
And I'll be here till close
to answer any questions.

408
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,370
Yeah, I got a few.

409
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,130
Like, what's the secret ingredient
in your world-famous Nelson's sub?

410
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,260
A soft robiola.

411
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,840
Perfect. Uh, team at work
is gonna love that.

412
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,850
Uh...

413
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:42,930
Give me six.

414
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,020
Uh, Theo can help you at the counter.
Is there anything else?

415
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Yeah.

416
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,940
When's the last time you saw Matt Murdock?

417
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,110
Who are you?

418
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,990
Crashing my campaign event,
trying to intimidate me,

419
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,330
dropping the names of my friends...

420
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,210
I'm not backing off my criticism
of the feds' love affair with Fisk!

421
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,210
You seem like a decent guy, Mr. Nelson.

422
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,300
You care about people.
About doing the right thing.

423
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm guessing that's why
you ditched Matt Murdock

424
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,180
as your law partner in the first place.

425
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,470
Am I correct?

426
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,690
You really think I'm gonna answer
a question that leading?

427
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,060
To be clear:
did you dissolve your partnership

428
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,780
because Mr. Murdock
took on Wilson Fisk as a client?

429
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,030
If you're referring to a single case

430
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,610
where we represented a client
who allegedly worked for Fisk

431
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,450
even though we didn't know
that at the time...

432
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,620
the answer's no.

433
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,450
It had nothing to do with it.

434
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,290
Nelson and Murdock
represented a lot of clients,

435
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,880
for whom all work
was completely ethical and legal

436
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,300
and protected
by attorney-client privilege.

437
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,930
When's the last time you saw Matt Murdock?

438
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,970
Two nights ago.

439
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:08,810
Where?

440
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,890
A bar in Hell's Kitchen.

441
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,560
And what did you discuss?

442
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,650
That we hadn't seen each other in a while.

443
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,110
- Did he tell you where he was going?
- No.

444
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,740
- Where you could find him?
- No.

445
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,700
Did he tell you anything?

446
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,030
That he was sorry.

447
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,240
About what?

448
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,250
That our friendship
isn't what it used to be.

449
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,000
So you didn't knowingly
give him your bar ID?

450
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,630
What?

451
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,840
Of course not.

452
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,130
Why would I?

453
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,010
So he could enter a prison,
falsely using your identity,

454
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,060
and make contact with an Albanian gang

455
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,640
linked to the murder
of nine federal agents.

456
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,230
I...

457
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,690
I didn't give him my ID.

458
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,650
Nor was I aware of anything
that he was planning.

459
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,120
But with all due respect,

460
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,620
I think you have Matt Murdock all wrong.

461
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,080
Yeah, well, uh...

462
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,750
I don't think I do.

463
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,710
I think Matt Murdock
is hiding a double life.

464
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,210
Lawyer by day and criminal by night.

465
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,260
And you and Ms. Page
both know all about it.

466
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,470
It makes you uncomfortable.

467
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,720
And complicit.

468
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,600
And that's why you're no longer
law partners or friends.

469
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,650
Because once he's finally caught,

470
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,190
you know you're on the hook
as an accessory to his crimes.

471
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,860
Or, if you're lucky,
simply aiding and abetting.

472
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,910
Remind me, Special Agent Nadeem,

473
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,740
what's Matt being charged with?

474
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,000
Nothing so far.

475
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,120
Great.

476
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,000
Then the only thing
I'm aiding and abetting is your exit.

477
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,730
Don't forget to vote.

478
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,690
Every day?

479
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,740
FDR Drive's my favorite route, too.

480
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,380
There's nothing in the world
like a winter run on the East River.

481
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,530
Between your workout habits
and new gig, it's...

482
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,660
it's almost like you're stalking me.

483
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,870
Damn. The secret's out.

484
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,460
So...

485
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,210
why aren't you in social work anymore?

486
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,760
Uh...

487
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,920
Tried to pursue my dream as a dancer.

488
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,680
It actually was going pretty well
until I tore my ACL, again.

489
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,520
I'm sorry. That must've been really hard.

490
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,100
But you were brave to go for it
in the first place.

491
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,060
I, um...

492
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,520
I didn't have a backup plan.

493
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,280
My parents made the mistake of telling me
I could be anything I wanted.

494
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,070
Must've been nice to hear,
even if it didn't work out.

495
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,240
My parents
were never really that involved.

496
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,540
Sounds like you didn't need
the message anyhow.

497
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,670
You did great all on your own.

498
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,390
So, what's it like
working for Wilson Fisk?

499
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,600
I don't work for him.
I work for the federal government.

500
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,060
Must be scary to be up close and personal
with someone so dangerous.

501
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,520
It is what it is.

502
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:50,280
Do you think a killer like that
deserves a second chance?

503
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,990
You worked at the hotline for three years.

504
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,450
I think you of all people would believe
everyone deserves a second chance.

505
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,500
How did you know
I worked there for three years?

506
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,540
You were only there for one.

507
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,670
You mentioned it earlier.

508
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,920
You quit to do ballet.

509
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,300
Did I also mention ballet earlier?

510
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,430
Specifically?

511
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,930
I guess I... I just assumed.

512
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,310
Anyway, um...

513
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,900
It's late. I should get home.

514
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,400
You're ditching me?

515
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,360
No, not at all. I...

516
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,730
I just have to go feed my dog.

517
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,360
You don't have a dog.

518
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,240
How do you know that?

519
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,120
Julie, you're misreading this.

520
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Let me pay for dinner.

521
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,500
We'll go for a walk in the park.
I'll explain.

522
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,710
Dinner's on me.

523
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,790
Julie.

524
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,250
You're very special to me.

525
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,710
Let go of me, Dex.

526
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,630
Please.

527
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,470
I said let go!

528
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,520
Just being at Matt's apartment,
and his bloody clothes...

529
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,860
And I just... It threw me.

530
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,940
Nadeem's smart. I probably gave him
everything he needs to figure it out.

531
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,610
Wait. You told the FBI
that Matt is Daredevil?

532
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,070
No, no. Of course not.

533
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,620
They know he's hiding something.

534
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,380
It's not what they think, but this is bad.

535
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,080
This is really bad. Infinitely bad.

536
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,540
- We could all go to jail.
- Foggy...

537
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,580
I should've never let Matt
tell you his secret.

538
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,420
This is my fault.

539
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,420
I'm not gonna let you pay
for our shitty mistakes.

540
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,920
If it comes to it,
I'll plead in exchange for your immunity.

541
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,130
Foggy...

542
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,220
You always see the good in people.

543
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,060
But you put us on such high pedestals,
you can't see who we really are.

544
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,940
I didn't tell the FBI Matt is Daredevil.
I did something worse.

545
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,690
Karen, breathe.

546
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,150
I'm in trouble.

547
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,780
Tell me what happened.

548
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,320
I'm gonna need attorney-client privilege
before I can.

549
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,740
Okay, um, give me five bucks.

550
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,050
Good enough. I'm officially your lawyer.

551
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,340
Do you remember the... the Healy trial?

552
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,470
And there was that...
that guy from... from CGI

553
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,310
who offered us a stupid amount of money
to take his case?

554
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,810
Yeah, how could I forget that creep?

555
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,320
His name's James Wesley.

556
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,740
He worked for Fisk.

557
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,820
He disappeared shortly after that,

558
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,790
and they think
Matt had something to do with it.

559
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,450
That's crazy.
Matt had nothing to do with that.

560
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,160
I know. But if they keep investigating,
they're gonna find out that I did.

561
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,710
What?

562
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,260
I killed him.

563
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,400
Shit. Shit.

564
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,390
It's good to see you, Dex.
How was your week?

565
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,680
I'm scared, Dr. Mercer.

566
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,100
Scared? What's making you scared?

567
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,720
Alpha Team on approach.

568
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,060
FBI. Get back in your apartment
and close the door.

569
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,070
Stack up.

570
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,910
Breach.

571
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,450
FBI!

572
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,990
Clear!

573
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,250
Murdock's been home.

574
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:59,370
Recently.

575
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,250
Command post, we're clear.
Suspect's not here.

576
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:08,170
NYPD has been advised. Citywide BOLO.

577
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,550
Suspect Matthew Murdock
to be considered armed and dangerous.
