your big plan?

326
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,904
A woman that we've never met
or even heard of?

327
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:21,773
Oliver doesn't like
to speak about the past.

328
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,175
Apparently, he's not so forthcoming
about the present, either.

329
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,144
My son was killed by the virus

330
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,112
Ra's intends to use
on your city.

331
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:30,281
Are you--you're
Akio's mother?

332
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,750
Oliver was with me
when it happened.

333
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:36,387
He knows that the danger
you all face is very real.

334
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:37,922
Ok, you know what,
how many times are we going

335
00:15:37,924 --> 00:15:39,390
to believe him after
everything that he's done?

336
00:15:39,392 --> 00:15:43,228
I am not privy
to your history with Malcolm.

337
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,797
This request
comes from Oliver.

338
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,465
We're not sure
that's any better at the moment.

339
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,802
Look, I am not
playing a game here.

340
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,938
My daughter lives
in this city, remember?

341
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,407
This is everything I have
on the bioweapon.

342
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,977
I've arranged passage
for all of us to go to Nanda Parbat.

343
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:00,411
If you're coming...

344
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:03,414
be at Ferris Air
before sunrise.

345
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,424
Charming.

346
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:15,994
It's a sublet. I won't
be here for much longer.

347
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,296
What about
the auto shop?

348
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,465
It's...temporary.

349
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,267
Sure, they don't ask
a lot of questions,

350
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,769
but it's inevitable someone
puts two and two together.

351
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,872
How about your
other night job?

352
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:30,041
I figured I'd just leave
the crime fighting to the cops.

353
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:32,543
I kind of just want
to be normal.

354
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:35,179
Yeah? And how's that
going for you?

355
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,448
I am so bored.
[Both laugh]

356
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,486
Yeah, well,
that's why

357
00:16:41,488 --> 00:16:43,921
I brought you this.

358
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,426
Malcolm stole it
out of impound.

359
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:51,896
Don't worry--I made him promise
nobody would get killed.

360
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,631
I never thought I'd see
this thing again.

361
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:55,667
I figured since everybody
thinks that

362
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:57,468
Roy Harper
is the Arrow,

363
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,104
They don't have to know
that he's Arsenal, too, right?

364
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,639
Hmm.

365
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,141
So that's why you came here?

366
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:05,443
Just to give me this?

367
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,946
Well...yes, this.

368
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:11,849
And...

369
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,078
How could we not
know about this?

370
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:42,206
How could anyone not know about
a terrorist attack in Hong Kong?

371
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,107
Because Beijing had us believing
that these deaths were caused

372
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:45,542
by a local chemical spill.

373
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:47,344
You don't really
believe Merlyn?

374
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,346
Well, looking at this, we can't
afford not to believe Merlyn.

375
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,615
He is a mass murderer
who has lied to us so many times

376
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,150
it should be
a drinking game.

377
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:55,285
And I have never
even heard of this Tatsu person.

378
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,520
Felicity, I don't know
if you're right

379
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,722
that Oliver's gone
forever or not.

380
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,757
The truth is, for me,
it doesn't matter.

381
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,226
If there's even a possibility of this
kind of danger in my city,

382
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,695
I'm reporting for duty.

383
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:06,697
Me, too.

384
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,132
I don't believe them.

385
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:11,601
And even if I did,
I can't go back there.

386
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,638
Not after what they did
to Oliver.

387
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:22,418
Relax, my child.

388
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,383
Another order
I cannot follow.

389
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:27,419
You speak to me
as though I'm a monster.

390
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:28,954
I'm your father,
Nyssa.

391
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:31,723
Then why do you ask me
to marry someone I do not love?

392
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,159
When I was in a desert

393
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,428
tending to some affairs,

394
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,864
I crossed paths
with a woman.

395
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,132
She was breathtaking

396
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:44,669
in her visage
and fortitude.

397
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:48,173
Her name
was Ameena Raatko.

398
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:52,177
I had taken
other lovers before,

399
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,879
but she was different.

400
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:56,478
She had a wit
and a fire about her

401
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:59,332
that I found myself
I could not live without.

402
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,567
So she became my concubine

403
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,502
and the mother of my child.

404
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:17,182
This was my gift to her
in honor of you.

405
00:19:17,184 --> 00:19:19,218
A gift that she gave me.

406
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,787
And so I kept it
in the hopes that one day,

407
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,923
you would wear it
on your wedding day.

408
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:29,328
You expect me to marry Al Sah-him
because of some trinket?

409
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,598
I expect you to marry
Al Sah-him

410
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,433
because it is my will.

411
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,435
You defy that,
and I will

412
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:39,939
see you suffer the pain
of a thousand deaths.

413
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,090
Tatsu: I am sorry
to intrude.

414
00:19:58,092 --> 00:20:00,993
Mr. Merlyn said that
I would find you here.

415
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:05,765
That might be the only
thing he's ever said that isn't a lie.

416
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,733
I did not come here
to convince you

417
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:09,602
of the threat to your home.

418
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,004
There's nothing I can say
that you will believe,

419
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:14,640
more than what you have seen.

420
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,778
Then why
are you here?

421
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,714
To speak with you
about Oliver.

422
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:24,850
During his recuperation,

423
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:26,886
Oliver spoke of you.

424
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:30,523
Of how his last thought
before the fall

425
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:33,759
was of you.

426
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,529
You love him...still.

427
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:39,899
Oliver belongs
to Ra's now.

428
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:42,401
If you believe that,
you must fight for him.

429
00:20:42,403 --> 00:20:45,204
There is no
"him" left.

430
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:47,907
I thought as you do once.

431
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,210
My husband, Maseo,

432
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:54,747
was consumed by
the League's darkness.

433
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:58,217
I was so convinced
that he was lost to me

434
00:20:58,219 --> 00:21:02,221
that I didn't even try
to reach him.

435
00:21:02,223 --> 00:21:04,590
Don't make my mistake...

436
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:06,759
Felicity.

437
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:15,996
Are you sure
Shrieve will be here?

438
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:18,698
Do you know of any other rogue
U.S. army bases in the area?

439
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,331
Shrieve will have
reinforced the station

440
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:22,733
since the last time
we were here.

441
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:31,409
Two there.

442
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,122
Waller took you
from Lian Yu

443
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:35,257
because she saw
something in you.

444
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,860
My son needs that from you.

445
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:41,229
The killer inside.

446
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,865
Sir, this is
a restricted area.

447
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,296
Is that
a Masamune blade?

448
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,033
A katana.

449
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:02,868
Passed on for centuries
within my family.

450
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,904
The first son
of each generation.

451
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,107
You are not
a son, Tatsu.

452
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,877
No, I am not.

453
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,679
Let's get this
over with.

454
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,148
The plane's ready;
It should be big enough for all of us.

455
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,449
Including her.

456
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:19,585
Thought
you weren't coming.

457
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,553
I changed my mind.

458
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,922
But if you betray us,
I'll make sure the whole world knows

459
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:27,326
that you are alive,
and where they can find you.

460
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:46,803
Laurel: So this
is Nanda Parbat.

461
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:48,971
Next time, we should
really look into getting some horses.

462
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:51,374
You think they rent
horses here?

463
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:52,942
There won't be a next time.

464
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,312
Malcolm:
There it is.

465
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:58,247
The plane Ra's
intends to use

466
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:00,850
to spread the Alpha
Omega over Starling.

467
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,852
I need to be within
50 yards to breech the plane's

468
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:04,687
internal mainframe
and navigation software,

469
00:23:04,689 --> 00:23:05,847
but then I should be able to remote
ground the thing.

470
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,848
Quiet.

471
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:08,489
I don't see anything.

472
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:14,096
There'll be more.

473
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:21,103
[Men yelling]

474
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:32,081
Get to the plane.
We'll cover you. Go!

475
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:34,283
[All grunting]

476
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,526
Close enough.

477
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:15,758
Maseo: Surrender now,
and you might live.

478
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,093
Maseo.

479
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,361
Maseo is a memory.

480
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:20,263
Our child was gone,

481
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:22,598
and you left me when
I needed you most.

482
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,334
But you can still

is disappointing.

650
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:50,008
Because I expected
more loyalty

651
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,710
from a man whose
daughter I saved.

652
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:54,946
The last time I appeared
before you in chains,

653
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:57,348
I offered my fealty,

654
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,218
and I am here
to offer it again.

655
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,987
You had nothing
to offer then,

656
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,223
and you have nothing
to offer now.

657
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:06,558
I have the name
of the person

658
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,893
who betrayed you
to Al Sah-him's friends.

659
00:35:08,895 --> 00:35:11,362
It wasn't Maseo Yamoshiro.

660
00:35:11,364 --> 00:35:13,698
It was Oliver Queen.

661
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,136
[Chuckles] He's been
lying to you all along.

662
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:27,916
What's this?

663
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:28,594
I'm sorry, Oliver.

664
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,286
My name is Al Sah-him.

665
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:33,088
Not according to Mr. Merlyn here.
You see, he claims

666
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:36,324
that you've been
deceiving me the entire time.

667
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:38,293
I have killed
for you.

668
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:40,729
I have severed all
ties to my past.

669
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,697
I have hurt people
who were friends to Oliver Queen,

670
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,400
and if you hadn't
have stopped me,

671
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:47,435
I would have murdered your daughter
at your command.

672
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:49,004
But what if this is all
just part of your own

673
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,972
elaborate ruse?

674
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:54,576
Then I will have nothing
and no one to go home to.

675
00:35:54,577 --> 00:35:57,211
Oliver Queen is dead,

676
00:35:57,214 --> 00:35:59,381
and the Arrow
is gone.

677
00:35:59,383 --> 00:36:01,783

Excuse me, I'm,
uh, looking for--

681
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,342
Jason's friend,
yeah, I remember.

682
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:30,011
He said you probably
would be stopping by.

683
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:32,013
Oh. Can I talk
to him?

684
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:34,682
I don't know where he is.
He came in an hour ago to quit.

685
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:37,385
He, uh, said
to give you this.

686
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:45,393
Roy: Dear Thea, I wasn't supposed
to make it this far.

687
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:48,196
I was supposed to end up
in jail or dead by now.

688
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:51,266
But then I met you, and you made me
want to be the man

689
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:53,234
I saw through your eyes.

690
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,837
And now all I want to do
is give that back;

691
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,206
help you be the person
you can be without Oliver,

692
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,741
without your father,

693
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:01,543
and without me.

694
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:03,011
Living on the run
from the police

695
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,313
isn't the life
you deserve, Thea.

696
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:08,083
It's not what Oliver
gave up his life for you to have.

697
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:10,218
Whatever happens with me,

698
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,454
I'll always love you.

699
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:15,390
P.S.--Thanks for the suit,

700
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,326
but I always thought red
was more your color, anyway.

701
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:33,441
So what did
Oliver say to you?

702
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:37,011
Nothing worth hearing.

703
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:41,082
You were right
about Oliver.

704
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,617
I should have
listened to you.

705
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:48,723
I told you about Oliver.
You were supposed to--

706
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,226
I was supposed to do
what, Mr. Merlyn?

707
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,727
Grant you mercy?

708
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,829
I am.

709
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:56,598
Because this death will be
a lot shorter

710
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,399
than the one I had
planned for you.

said is true,

if you're going to do anything,
now is the time!

714
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,879
Al Sah-him has said that
the swordswoman is inoculated,

to another chamber.
