1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,480
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,279
I had no idea you
were one of them.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,429
The district attorney's
office

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,591
will not be pressing
charges on your friends.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,718
Tomorrow, you will issue one
of these to each of them.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,553
They'll each be deputized
like Mr. Queen.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,552
Felicity used to force
this stuff on me.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,074
There's another solve.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,317
This could be the key
to finding our mom.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,471
I want our children
to know

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,995
that they are the most
important thing to us.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,355
You said, "children."

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,635
I'm pregnant.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,479
Ha ha!

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,553
Becoming part of
the SCPD is

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,717
a great responsibility.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,314
The whole city will be
watching you,

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,551
holding you to
the highest standard.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,040
And now that you're
working with us,

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,271
you need to learn
how we do things.

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,113
We have rules, protocol.

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,476
And abiding by them
is critical.

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,439
<i>The use of excessive force
will not be tolerated.</i>

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,716
<i>Your objective is to
defuse the situation,</i>

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,314
<i>not escalate it.</i>

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,513
<i>Firearms
should only be used</i>

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,795
<i>as a last resort.</i>

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,719
<i>Do not discharge your weapon
unless you are fired upon,</i>

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,393
<i>or your life is in danger.</i>

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,120
<i>All evidence against
a suspect must be gathered</i>

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,510
<i>within the parameters
of the law.</i>

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,876
<i>Any evidence obtained not
in that manner</i>

33
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,350
<i>will be deemed inadmissible.</i>

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,595
<i>In tactical situations, avoid
suspect-based decisions.</i>

35
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,070
<i>This only leads to chaos
and confusion.</i>

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,913
And, above all,
follow the orders

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,356
of the commanding officer
on-site.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,352
Wearing the uniform
of an SCPD officer

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,476
is an honor.

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,119
It isn't just a uniform.

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,359
It's a symbol of
the law, of justice,

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,193
of transparency.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,758
Thank you,
sergeant Bingsley.

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,478
Any questions?

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Rene.

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,109
He does know we have
our own uniforms, right?

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,230
Heh heh.

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,872
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,110
Oh, hey!

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,590
How's my favorite new
team of recruits doing?

51
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
Missing the good old
days when catching a bad guy

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,400
didn't involve homework.

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,836
Ah. Well, this is
uncharted territory,

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,673
so the SCPD just wants
to make sure

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,274
we're on the same page.

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,397
It's a lot, but it'll
be worth it.

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,312
I mean, we can finally
work together

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,232
and on the right side
of the law.

59
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,176
Wait. Does that mean that
the Black Canary's back?

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,635
Well, I did get a clean bill
of health from the doctor.

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,836
You all are deputized,

62
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,759
so no reason I can't be
captain and Black Canary.

63
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,917
Within the confines of the law,
of course.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Of course.

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
I want to be clear.

66
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,359
Just because you've
been deputized

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,397
doesn't mean you have
the latitude to operate

68
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
the way you once did.

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,916
You work for the SCPD now.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,072
And this arrangement is
on a provisional basis.

71
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,856
Your actions will determine
how long it lasts.

72
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,234
Mm-hmm.

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,231
I think she's
starting to like us.

74
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,400
Well, that was a different
type of workday for us.

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,790
Can you believe that Pollard
made us go through all that?

76
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,520
Well, I know we're not
used to doing things

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,150
by the book, clearly,
but this partnership is

78
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,560
what's best for the city.

79
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,960
But she's seen what
you can do.

80
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,496
I mean, she knows what
we're capable of.

81
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,496
Just trust me. There's no use
arguing with the mayor.

82
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,716
- Can...
- you hungry?

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,514
Want a tartine,
some sauteed broccolini,

84
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
something like that?

85
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,035
As much as I appreciate the
"master chef" initiative

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,236
that you
got going on here,

87
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,976
are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,913
Because you are
100% agreeable and zen

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,673
about this whole
police 101 thing.

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,479
I want this partnership
to be done right

91
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,080
and to be legitimate
from the beginning

92
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,674
for our baby

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,376
because I did not get
that chance with William.

94
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,680
This partnership's
not gonna work

95
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,896
if she forgets
who she's hired.

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,912
The partnership
has to work, Felicity,

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,117
because working with
the SCPD

98
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,078
and not
hiding in the shadows,

99
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,039
I truly believe

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,634
that's what's best
for the city.

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,073
Then we can stay here,

102
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,516
and our children
can grow up safely.

103
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Well, if you believe

104
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,311
that this is
what's best for the city

105
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,438
and what is ultimately
best for our family,

106
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,000
then I agree.

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,275
We're a team, too.

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
Always.

109
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,236
Except maybe we don't,
you know,

110
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,119
until the city's safe
and our family is

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
really secure,

112
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,794
that we don't, you know,
tell anybody

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,396
about what's happening
in here.

114
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,914
Because I think it's
too early,

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,296
and I don't want anybody
crying and asking

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,595
about, like,
if it's a boy...

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,717
- for the... for the city.
- Yeah, for the city.

118
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,280
And for our family.

119
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,395
It's for a better future.

120
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,039
Yay.

121
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,757
So about that tartine.

122
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,040
I'm starving.
I'm also nauseous.

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,952
Are they all staring
at you or me?

124
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Both. You reek of money,

125
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,116
and, well,
I'm undefeated.

126
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,836
Don't wander off.
Don't talk to anyone.

127
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Let me handle this.

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,456
You don't even know
what we're looking for.

129
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,200
Sure I do. It's
a tape mini thingy.

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,990
A microcassette player
or an answering machine,

131
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,309
old tech from the eighties.

132
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,516
It's the only thing

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,736
that'll let us listen to the
message Felicity left for us.

134
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,638
Right. I'm gonna talk
to my contact.

135
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,870
Look, I know
these people.

136
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,237
They're lowlifes,
criminals, like me.

137
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,599
Just stay here
and don't do anything.

138
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,114
W...

139
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,273
Bingo.

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,074
Something catch
your eye?

141
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,119
Uh, yeah. How much for
this piece of junk?

142
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,554
Our best
microcassette player.

143
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,155
It's incredibly rare.

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,832
I'll give it to you
cheap.

145
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
$1,000.

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
Cheap?

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,154
Look, you and I both know

148
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,736
that no one else is
interested in this.

149
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,559
Except you, it seems.

150
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
700.

151
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,949
- 400.
- 600.

152
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,157
500. Final offer.

153
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,713
We have a deal.

154
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,277
Good doing business
with you.

155
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,794
Let go. Let
go. Ugh!

156
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,720
You're making
a big mistake, man.

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,590
You're stupid if you think
you can come at <i>Los Halcones.</i>

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,478
Stop talking!

159
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,313
Him next.

160
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,834
Hey, what the hell...

161
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,477
15 seconds. Impressive.

162
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,960
Let's try a leg next.

163
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,517
Last night, 4 <i>Los Halcones</i>
gang members

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,512
were found dead
in a warehouse.

165
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,670
Whoa.

166
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,116
That's some <i>face/off</i> level
weirdness right there.

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Do we know
what caused it?

168
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,600
The bodies had
bullet wounds,

169
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,512
but there were no shells
found at the scene.

170
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,911
Autopsy revealed traces of
an unidentified substance,

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,435
which caused a chemical
reaction with the blood

172
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
that resulted in tox...

173
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,319
their skin melting off.

174
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,757
The proper term is
toxic epidermal necrolysis.

175
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,194
- But, basically, yes.
- Yeah.

176
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,456
OK, how can a bullet
just disappear?

177
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,656
There have been rumors
of a new weapon

178
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,034
making its rounds
on the street.

179
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,656
Toxicology is working
up labs now.

180
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,816
We should have a better idea of what's
going on in the next few hours.

181
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,576
Or I could just put it
into my trusty mass spectrometer

182
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,936
and then compare it to all
the government databases

183
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,520
that I've hacked...
um, accidentally tapped into.

184
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,776
It would just be
so much faster.

185
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,176
I'm sure it would,
but, um, I think we're

186
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,317
just gonna wait to get
results when we get them.

187
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,710
In the meantime,
let's talk suspects.

188
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,315
The blackout gang.
Never heard of them.

189
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,736
Right.
They came onto the scene

190
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,336
about a month or so after
you went to prison.

191
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,874
They are
some bad dudes.

192
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,110
And with
the vigilantes gone,

193
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,431
they've been causing a lot
of trouble in The Glades.

194
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,116
You know,
that place you guys tend to forget.

195
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,078
<i>Los Halcones</i> are
their main rival.

196
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
So we're looking at
a gang war.

197
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,193
It seems that way.

198
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,440
All right. I want everybody
working their contacts, OK?

199
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,637
And I want eyes on
the hideouts for both gangs.

200
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,056
You think maybe
we should pay a visit

201
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,196
to the <i>Los Halcones?</i>

202
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,272
I don't think so.
You heard Pollard.

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,616
She's looking for any
opportunity

204
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,472
to disband this partnership.

205
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,279
Got to run our leads
the SCPD way.

206
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,119
- Oh, sorry.
- That's OK.

207
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,313
I thought I told you
to stay put.

208
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,874
If I had, I wouldn't
have found this.

209
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,634
I know you think I'm just some rich idiot,
but I...

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,949
Had it.

211
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,316
The cassette player.
It was right here.

212
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,710
Let me guess. Little girl
bumped into you.

213
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,473
Seemed cute, innocent.

214
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,554
Felix... he played you.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,920
You couldn't have just
listened to me, could you?

216
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,634
Wait.

217
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Blackstar.

218
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,714
Screw you, Felix.

219
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,598
You might think twice

220
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,149
before you swing that
right hook at me.

221
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,832
One word from me, and
you'll be in SCPD custody.

222
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,149
Ha ha!

223
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,879
No problem, sir,
right, Blackstar?

224
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,599
We're just passing
through.

225
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,158
District attorney Laurel Lance.

226
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,152
Yes, I'll accept
the charges.

227
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,714
Put the prisoner through.

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,274
I don't know what you thought
was gonna happen here,

229
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,113
but you're wasting
my time.

230
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,192
There's no way
that I'm...

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,354
Fine. I'll be
right there.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,559
Visitors aren't
typically allowed entry

233
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,835
in the cell block.

234
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,071
Slabside doesn't say no
to this D.A.

235
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,077
So, tell me, what
exactly am I doing here?

236
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,310
Ricardo Diaz is dead.

237
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,514
Why hasn't this been
reported yet?

238
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, you,
of all people, know

239
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,072
slabside's under
some major scrutiny,

240
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,152
so they're trying
to cover it up,

241
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,119
saying he was shivved
by another inmate,

242
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,520
but that's a lie.

243
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,835
And you know the truth.

244
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,879
Better.
I know who killed him.

245
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,556
Oh. Oh, I get it.
You have demands.

246
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,633
Oliver made me a promise
before he left here.

247
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,552
He said he'd get me
my freedom.

248
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,398
- Where is it?
- We're working on it.

249
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,630
Work faster.

250
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,679
The terms of your
sentence are rock solid.

251
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,433
There's a lot of
red tape,

252
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,239
especially when
A.R.G.U.S. is involved.

253
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,630
Well, then I guess
we're done here.

254
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,039
Ricardo Diaz died
the death that he deserved.

255
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,115
I don't care who did it.

256
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,634
Yeah, but you're
still here.

257
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,871
I told you I can't
get you out of here

258
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,553
any faster.

259
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,993
Then I want to see my son,

260
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,834
and not through
a wall of glass.

261
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,674
I want him here with me.

262
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,598
Do that,
and then we'll talk.

263
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,936
One of my officers just
received word from a contact

264
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,040
the blackout gang will be
convening for a weapons buy

265
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,474
tonight in orchid bay.

266
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,216
Sounds like our best chance to
get our hands on the new weapon.

267
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,993
Take down the supplier
while we're at it.

268
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,309
Get the unit ready
to move out.

269
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,869
- Whoa. Scpd's coming with us?
- Yeah.

270
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,792
Look, that's really gonna
cramp our style.

271
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,874
No. We just need to learn
to suit up together.

272
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,873
About that.
Pollard really wants to make sure

273
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,600
that we're treated the same
as any other officer.

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,160
But we're not like
any other officers.

275
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,395
No, that's true.

276
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,597
But for now, we still have
something to prove.

277
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,959
And so we will be
wearing, um, this...

278
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,549
Out in the field.

279
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,438
Pollard's taking
away our threads?

280
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,479
Look, it could be worse.
She wanted to put you in standard blues.

281
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,673
That's also not all.

282
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,679
We can't use
our normal weapons.

283
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,997
I know. We have to use
SCPD standard issue.

284
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,479
We'll make it work.

285
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
We got to make it
work.

286
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,794
Alpha team's
in position.

287
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,199
No sign of
the seller yet.

288
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,672
Bravo's in position.
Overwatch, do we have eyes, please?

289
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,433
Hold on. Pulling up
thermal now.

290
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,556
From satellite?

291
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,256
What did I tell you
about off-the-books hacking?

292
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,839
You said no public
resources.

293
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,798
This is private.
Loophole.

294
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,353
Yeah, looks like
you got incoming.

295
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Looks like a vehicle.

296
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,640
That's our supplier.

297
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
Where's Mr. Midas?

298
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,475
He was unable to make it,
but he sends his regards.

299
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,395
Midas, as in the big cheese
ceo at midas medical?

300
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,517
I trust you were
happy with your sample.

301
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,193
Very.

302
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,034
We'll take as many of those
bullets as you have to sell.

303
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,954
Start moving in.
Do not engage until the buy is complete.

304
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,635
All 4 of us can't go in
together. We'll be spotted.

305
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,473
We don't split up.
That's protocol.

306
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,960
On my signal.

307
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,520
Have you seen
all the blind spots?

308
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,776
We need to maintain
the element of surprise.

309
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,120
This isn't up
for debate.

310
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,520
Now. Scpd! Freeze!

311
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,674
Go! Move!

312
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,840
Let's get out of here.

313
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,598
I'll get the supplier.
You guys take that case.

314
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,070
Hey!

315
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,592
They're using
the poison bullets!

316
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,999
Damn it. Fall back!
All units fall back!

317
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,631
Overwatch, the SUV's
heading south.

318
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,552
Can you track it?

319
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,395
No, I can't, because this dinosaur
of a system just crashed.

320
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,795
Did you not listen to
anything I said in training?

321
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,315
Following protocol is
not optional.

322
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,640
Your protocols
are flawed.

323
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,595
That's not the problem.

324
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,400
The problem is your refusal
to participate in our system.

325
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,896
We don't need a lecture on
how to handle ourselves

326
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
on the field.

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,376
Clearly, there was
a miscommunication.

328
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,835
Is that what you'd call it?
I'd call it a disaster.

329
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,400
OK. We just need
to simmer down.

330
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,576
Because of you,
we have no evidence.

331
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,636
Without the evidence,

332
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,837
we'll be lucky to put them
away for a year.

333
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,718
How we do things matters!

334
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,237
Then you're doing things
the wrong way.

335
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,036
And you're putting
this on us?

336
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,999
Sending two teams
into the field

337
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,639
was a mistake.

338
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,150
You should've
listened to me

339
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,391
and let us do things
our way.

340
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,233
This is our way now,
Oliver.

341
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,791
And I'm sorry. But we're all gonna
just have to get used to that.

342
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,351
Excuse me.

343
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,392
Oh. Sorry. Heh.

344
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,456
So I'm sensing
some tension here,

345
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,536
but I'm just gonna cut right to it
because csis were able to recover

346
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,950
the bullet that went
into the officer's armor.

347
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,256
Thank god he was
wearing that, right?

348
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,720
I mean, nobody wears
helmets anymore.

349
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,791
Anyhoo, I ran
a tox screen on it

350
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,056
to see why it was making people
go all wicked witch of the west.

351
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,136
I'm melting.

352
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,256
I'm melting.
Oh, what a world!

353
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,556
Ahem. Hey.
What'd you find?

354
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,235
Chlormethine is a cytotoxic
agent derived from mustard gas.

355
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,136
But that chemical weapon
was banned decades ago.

356
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,336
Except when it's used
for medicinal purposes,

357
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
like chemotherapy.

358
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,399
Let me guess. All roads
lead back to midas medical.

359
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,136
It is one of 4 labs
in Star City that still uses

360
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,436
chlormethine as
an active ingredient.

361
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,115
And the buck stops with
this guy, James midas.

362
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,151
I met this guy at
an SCPD fundraiser.

363
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,795
He's got deep pockets.
It does benefit the SCPD.

364
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,394
OK. We got
to bring him in.

365
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,711
Not until we have proof
that he's behind this.

366
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,633
Dinah, he got
name dropped at the buy.

367
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,359
His company produces
the chemical.

368
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,715
How much more proof
do you need?

369
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,996
The concrete kind.

370
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,416
After what this department went
through last year with Diaz,

371
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
we have all eyes on us.

372
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,798
We just need
actionable intel.

373
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,616
Then we can get a warrant,
search his company.

374
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,176
You get a warrant,
he's gonna know we're coming,

375
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,759
and I know that you
know that.

376
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,416
I know that if we don't
do things the right way,

377
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,794
then everything
we've worked for

378
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,317
since you got out of prison
will be for nothing.

379
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,392
Is that a risk you're
willing to take?

380
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,511
Well, that could've
gone better.

381
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,831
All the training,
the rules. And now this?

382
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,576
We are not gonna be able
to make Star City safe

383
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,876
if we're constantly being
micromanaged by the SCPD.

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,656
Well, that was our first time
out in the field all together.

385
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Maybe it'll get easier.

386
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,936
What if it doesn't
get easier? What, then?

387
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,136
Well, we go after
midas our way.

388
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,276
No, you heard Dinah.

389
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,558
We do things their way, or this whole
agreement is just gonna blow up.

390
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,393
We just have to
prove to the SCPD

391
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,516
that our way is
better,

392
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,240
and then they will
be adapting to our side

393
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,520
instead of
the other way around.

394
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,597
All they want to do is
bring this guy in.

395
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,752
We deliver midas,
everybody wins.

396
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,632
Have I told you lately
how smart you are?

397
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,393
Well, I never get
tired of hearing it.

398
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,994
I want mint chip.

399
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,120
Do we really expect
one of these boxes

400
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,716
to magically connect midas
to those poison bullets?

401
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,280
There's always
a paper trail.

402
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,600
How many more boxes
are there?

403
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,976
Monroe's about to bring up
another half-dozen

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,275
from the file room.

405
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,352
So #readfaster.

406
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,109
You know,
Felicity was right.

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,795
We should've digitized
these files years ago.

408
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,952
Maybe Oliver was
right, too.

409
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,839
Maybe we go after
midas the vigilante way.

410
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,759
There is no more
vigilante way, OK?

411
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,309
There is only the SCPD way.

412
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,834
It's my job to enforce it.

413
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,799
Look, I get it.
You're the captain,

414
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,633
but you're also
the Black Canary.

415
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,836
I thought that came
first.

416
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,070
- It doesn't.
- Since when?

417
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,790
Since I stuck my neck out to
make this partnership work.

418
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,600
Vigilantes cannot operate
without SCPD sanction.

419
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,399
The sooner all of us
understand that,

420
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,199
the better it's gonna be
for all of us.

421
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,999
Everyone's got something
at stake here, d.

422
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,391
But if this fails, I'm
the one who loses my job.

423
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,994
It's my ass on the line.

424
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,216
I don't understand
why this is

425
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,233
so hard for all of you
to understand.

426
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,433
Captain Drake.

427
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,112
Yeah. OK, great.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

428
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,795
That was Monroe.
He found us probable cause.

429
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,712
I'm going to
get my warrant.

430
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,477
I just got
the first quarter reports.

431
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,280
We're already up 60%
from last year.

432
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,591
Yeah, I wanted you
to hear it from me.

433
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
See you tomorrow.

434
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,431
James midas, you have
failed this city.

435
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,194
You have some balls
showing up here.

436
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,316
You know who I am?

437
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,993
Chlormethine.

438
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,994
You've been
weaponizing it.

439
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,992
Now I want
to hear you say it.

440
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,196
I press one button,

441
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,317
the whole city comes
to my rescue.

442
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,276
Yeah. Not with that circa 2017
first build security system.

443
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,976
I don't understand why people
don't just click "update"

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,036
when it says "update."

445
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,594
Try again, James.

446
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,434
I'm not telling you anything.
You can't touch me.

447
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,670
Really? Come here.

448
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,714
Stop! You'll regret this.

449
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,950
Not as much as you.

450
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,192
Now tell me what you
know about chlormethine.

451
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,509
Go to hell!

452
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Wrong answer.

453
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,273
Wait. Wait!

454
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,714
I'll tell you everything.

455
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,395
I did it, OK? I've been using
chlormethine to make the bullets,

456
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,676
and then I've been selling
them to rival gangs.

457
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,399
Good.

458
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,512
Overwatch,
you get all that?

459
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,719
Signed, sealed, delivered.

460
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,190
Good.
James midas, by the authority of the SCPD,

461
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,840
you are under
arrest. Come here.

462
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,671
Again, James, you have
my personal promise.

463
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,400
There will be consequences
for this egregious mistake.

464
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,278
I appreciate that,
Emily.

465
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,636
I used to have such
faith in the police.

466
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,552
I'd hate to think
Star City's finest

467
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,040
have become
nothing more

468
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,555
than a bunch of
bullying thugs.

469
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
So you're just
cutting him loose?

470
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,714
We have no grounds
to hold him.

471
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,916
He confessed.

472
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,195
While you were
dangling him

473
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,873
over a vat of
hydrofluoric acid.

474
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,474
OK, he was never in
any danger.

475
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,119
Yeah, well, that's
not his story.

476
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,456
You know, instead of
using this case

477
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,153
to work within the
confines of the law,

478
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,356
you all went rogue.

479
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,399
And you,
you let him.

480
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,711
It's time for you
to make a choice.

481
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,634
Are you the captain
or are you a vigilante?

482
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,634
I'm the captain.

483
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,398
Then start acting
like it.

484
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,872
I asked you to be
patient.

485
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,996
It wasn't working.

486
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,639
Well, it would've.
I had a warrant.

487
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,279
If you had listened
to me,

488
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,238
we could be searching
midas' house right now

489
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,119
instead of being told to
stay 5 miles away from him.

490
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,839
But now we have nothing.

491
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,200
Go on.

492
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,355
Oh! Connor.

493
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,999
Hi, dad.

494
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,672
Come here, my little hawk.

495
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,200
I missed you so much,
little man.

496
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,600
Thank you.

497
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,950
Go take a seat on
the bed.

498
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,714
Dad owes Ms. Lance a chat.

499
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,197
I don't know what to say.

500
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm a woman of my word.

501
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,399
And I'm a man of mine.

502
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,312
The Night Diaz died,

503
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
I was serving another
stint in solitary.

504
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,113
The guard forgot
to close the meal slot

505
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,839
after delivering dinner.

506
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,116
So when I heard yelling,

507
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,510
I got up to get
a better look.

508
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,160
The killer walked
right by my cell,

509
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,799
wearing green leather,

510
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,156
but it wasn't Oliver Queen.

511
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,832
Whoever's been running
around dressed up

512
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,152
as the Green Arrow,
that's your murderer.

513
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,513
They killed Diaz.

514
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,150
"I'm the captain"?
Really?

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,798
I've know you
a long time, d,

516
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,136
and I've never seen
you roll over

517
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,416
the way you just did
with Pollard.

518
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,397
She's the mayor, Rene.

519
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,358
And she can put an end
to this whole operation

520
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,716
anytime she wants.

521
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,359
That's not the point.

522
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,874
You've been yelling
at me,

523
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,189
been yelling at
Oliver,

524
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,396
and pretty much
acting weird

525
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,874
ever since
the weapons buy.

526
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,431
So what's up, d?
What's going on?

527
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,597
At the weapons buy,
I tried to use my cry,

528
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
but something went wrong.

529
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,594
It didn't work right. It...

530
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,797
It hurt like someone
was scraping knives

531
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,758
along the inside
of my throat.

532
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,674
I'm sorry.

533
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,480
Being captain is the only
thing I have left.

534
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,236
I can't be the symbol
of being on both sides,

535
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,677
both SCPD and vigilante,
because I am...

536
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm not the Black Canary.

537
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,752
Not anymore.

538
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,516
That's a bunch of crap,
and you know it.

539
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,510
Your cry doesn't
make you the canary.

540
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,589
Did you know that
the pin you gave Zoe,

541
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,797
she wears to school
every day?

542
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,360
You think she wears
that pin

543
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,119
because of your cry? No.

544
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,638
She looks up to you
because you're the person

545
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,791
who will go above and
beyond to do what is right

546
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,156
no matter the personal
consequences.

547
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,431
That's who you are
no matter what.

548
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,114
Even if that's true,
it doesn't matter anymore.

549
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,396
Of course it does.

550
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,712
You say you can't be the
symbol of being on both sides.

551
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,190
That's exactly what
you are.

552
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,354
You really
fixed this place up.

553
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,800
Yeah, I thought
we'd need it

554
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,473
once the whole team
got sanctioned.

555
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,315
Oh, it's good to be back.
So good to be back.

556
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,999
How long till we're
up and running?

557
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,878
Just a couple minutes.

558
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,759
I can't believe that
confession got dismissed.

559
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,034
Hey.

560
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,396
I had a feeling I'd
find you two here.

561
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,598
So I take it you are
going after midas.

562
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,736
He knows we're on to him,
so we need to move fast

563
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,035
before he dumps
the evidence.

564
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,696
Right. And what about
working with the cops?

565
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,120
Oh,
you've seen what a train wreck

566
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
that's been?

567
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,590
We all know that we
operate better on our own.

568
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Now, I would like for you to
be onboard with this,

569
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,159
but if you're not,
I would just...

570
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,072
I would ask you
to stay out of our way.

571
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,152
Oliver, I will always
have your back,

572
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,096
but you're giving up
on this partnership

573
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,536
before you're really
giving it a chance,

574
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,871
as if you're up against
a clock I don't know about.

575
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,112
So what don't I know about?

576
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,520
We're having
a baby.

577
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Really?

578
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

579
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,997
It's a little early.
We're not telling anybody yet.

580
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,391
That's amazing!
This is wonderful!

581
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,836
It would also explain
a hell of a lot.

582
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,515
We don't want a child born
into a city like this.

583
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,952
Our mission is
not complete.

584
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,096
So we're going
to go about this

585
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,176
the only way that
we know how,

586
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,795
without politicians and
without a precinct.

587
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,152
We're going to do this
the Team Arrow way.

588
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,754
OK, and that
would work

589
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,399
for a while.

590
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,472
And then, uh,
then I have to say,

591
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,336
we will be right back to
where we started, Oliver,

592
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,637
without a team, you
in prison, us on the run,

593
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,599
and a city no closer to being
saved than where we started.

594
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,876
Our partnership with
the force

595
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,110
is not working.

596
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,736
Then we have to find a way
to make it work.

597
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,559
Compromise, do whatever
you have to do

598
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,996
because if you want a new
future for this baby of yours,

599
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,549
it won't come by doing the
same thing we used to do.

600
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,200
We have to... we have to be
something else...

601
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,239
Something better.

602
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,720
You should've let me
take him

603
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,916
and the cops.

604
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,616
I can handle a couple of
poorly-trained goons

605
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,320
who don't know their
right from their left.

606
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,032
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

607
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,190
Nothing.

608
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Spit it out.

609
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,359
I just half-expected
you to shout,

610
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,636
"Felix, you have failed
this city."

611
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,679
Well, that's
a dumb thing to say.

612
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,353
That's what our dad
used to say.

613
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,476
Oh.

614
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,158
You reminded me of him
back there.

615
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,431
So how do you suggest we
get this cassette player

616
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,840
if you're not gonna let me beat
the living hell out of him?

617
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,954
I have an idea.

618
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,357
Got it. Only cost me
my next two fights.

619
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,476
Better be worth it.

620
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,313
Oh, this is perfect.

621
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,919
Care to share the plan?

622
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,435
What is the one thing the
SCPD wants more than anything

623
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
in this city?

624
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,240
- To kill vigilantes.
- Exactly.

625
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,800
So let's hope
this works.

626
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,176
I got a canary sighting on the
south side of the Star City bazaar,

627
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,873
headed east.

628
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,155
Let's go!

629
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,696
<i>Vigilante
sighted on south side of bazaar.</i>

630
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,712
- Heh heh.
- You're a genius.

631
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,792
I am, like, literally.

632
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,716
I warned you
to stay away.

633
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,553
We are not good listeners.

634
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,710
Your friends are off
chasing a canary.

635
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,076
Well, that's what they
think anyway.

636
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,992
You'll regret this.

637
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,117
- Dick.
- Nice punch.

638
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah.

639
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Thank you.

640
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,478
Wow. The place
looks great.

641
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,153
Wow.

642
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,633
Why did you guys
call us here?

643
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,836
To apologize.

644
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,435
We shouldn't
have gone off-book

645
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
to go after midas.

646
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,632
I appreciate that.

647
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,713
And while we're clearing
the air here,

648
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,632
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

649
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,431
OK? I was hard on you.
I was too hard.

650
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,473
You guys want to hug
or something?

651
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,656
Why don't we
save the hugging

652
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,512
until after we
catch midas?

653
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,273
The second reason that
we called you here.

654
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,000
We found a lead. Or
Felicity found a lead.

655
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,719
In trying to find
where midas is storing

656
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,792
his skin-melting poison,
I was able to alter

657
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,991
my security system algorithm
to track DNA

658
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,470
anywhere in Star City.

659
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,880
You have midas' DNA?

660
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,056
Well, it turns out he's not as
squeaky clean as we thought.

661
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,151
I got his DNA
from the SCPD archive.

662
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,754
He was arrested
15 years ago.

663
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,456
Thank goodness the police
are record hoarders.

664
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,120
And since he has a record
and we work for the SCPD,

665
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,316
<i>voila!</i>

666
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,631
I interfaced with the SCPD's
surveillance system

667
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,296
and was able to legally
monitor everywhere

668
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,312
midas has been
in the last two weeks.

669
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,551
Country club, office,
home, and...

670
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
And a warehouse
registered

671
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,757
to what is clearly
a shell corporation?

672
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,136
Obviously, he's keeping
the chemicals there.

673
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,496
And look whose
DNA is there right now.

674
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,096
Midas is probably trying
to destroy the evidence

675
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,315
as we speak.

676
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,280
He can try, but he's
not gonna get away with it.

677
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,430
We're gonna get him.

678
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,074
We want to do things
the right way this time.

679
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,791
That means doing
a few things differently.

680
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
What did you have
in mind?

681
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,553
First things first...

682
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,637
Suit up.

683
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,749
I want all of this gone,

684
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,957
not a single drop
left behind.

685
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,872
Overwatch to Team Arrow.

686
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,314
I have confirmation on midas

687
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,710
and a crapload
of gun-toting goons.

688
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,116
What about the chemicals?

689
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,351
<i>Being loaded
into the back of a truck.</i>

690
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,760
Dinah, what's
your status?

691
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,035
Almost in position.

692
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,237
Take it to the reservoir.

693
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,392
Anyone tries to stop you...
I don't care who it is...

694
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,880
kill them.

695
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,696
Guys, you may want to speed things up.
They're about to move out.

696
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,976
If those chemicals reach
the reservoir,

697
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,514
everyone in Star City
will be at risk.

698
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,472
We can't let
that truck leave.

699
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,512
No, we won't.

700
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,117
Hyah! Hyah...

701
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,437
You have the right
to remain silent.

702
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Now!

703
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,400
Get me out of here,

704
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,119
and I'll double
your salaries.

705
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,990
Bad news, guys.

706
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,231
Midas is about two minutes
away from being a free man.

707
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,633
We've got to stop him.

708
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,359
You go. I'll secure
the evidence.

709
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,270
We're taking heavy fire!
We're cornered!

710
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,512
Man, I really missed
our toys.

711
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,190
The chemicals are
secure. Where's midas?

712
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,594
James midas,

713
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,640
you are under arrest.

714
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,632
Not tonight.

715
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,633
You think this is gonna work
out better than last time?

716
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,919
Because now I'll have your
badge and your costume.

717
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,672
Uh!

718
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,473
I don't think so.

719
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,314
Thanks to all those chemicals
we just confiscated,

720
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,596
you're going away
for a long time.

721
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,959
Like I said...

722
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,753
You're under arrest.

723
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,319
James midas is
in SCPD lockup.

724
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,696
We got what we need
to put him away

725
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,234
for a very long time.

726
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,232
Thank you for doing it
the legal way.

727
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,357
Thank you for letting
us do it our way.

728
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,590
And for joining us.

729
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,875
We missed you,
canary.

730
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,553
I missed her, too.

731
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,472
Thank you for reminding
me of that.

732
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,856
Wait.
Why do I get the feeling

733
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,936
the canary flight was a
one-night-only kind of thing?

734
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:27,115
I'll be back in the field,
just, uh, without my cry.

735
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,879
When my nerve was ruptured,
it created lasting damage.

736
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,958
I'm... I'm sorry,
Dinah.

737
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,272
Well, Dinah, cry or no cry,
you are the Black Canary.

738
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,589
You proved that tonight.

739
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,516
Thank you.

740
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,114
You know what else
we did tonight?

741
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,319
We forced Pollard's hand.

742
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,638
I leveraged her
relationship with midas

743
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,518
to convince her
to sign off on creating

744
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,637
a special
vigilante task force.

745
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,073
We're still sanctioned
by the SCPD,

746
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,719
but we're operating
as our own unit

747
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,753
out of the bunker
in our suits.

748
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,752
And the anti-vigilante law?

749
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,514
It's on her desk for repeal.
She's gonna sign it.

750
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,109
So we're like the black ops
for the SCPD now?

751
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,200
That's cool.

752
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,576
I'm just glad
we're all back.

753
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,080
It feels right.

754
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I'll second
that.

755
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,879
It's nice to be
part of a team again.

756
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,872
And be here
at the bunker...

757
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,679
the sweet bunker.

758
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,480
Do you guys feel like hitting up the,
uh, "sweet" bar?

759
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,616
You guys go ahead.

760
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,416
I ate something that's not gonna
mix well with alcohol.

761
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,557
Yeah. I'm gonna hang
back, too, guys.

762
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,915
OK.

763
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,195
I got you
something.

764
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,714
Gee, you shouldn't have.

765
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,957
Well, it was the only
thing that Lyla said

766
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,269
helped her with
her nausea.

767
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,397
They're ginger
candy chews.

768
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,994
Oh, god. I'll try anything.

769
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,833
Morning sickness
or not, Felicity,

770
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,798
you have not
missed a beat.

771
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,837
You were absolutely
amazing out there today.

772
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,240
Your tech was
phenomenal.

773
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,360
Well, Curtis would've had
5 ideas to make it better,

774
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,715
- but...
- Well, maybe...

775
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,393
But if Curtis was
still at A.R.G.U.S.,

776
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,776
I would've asked him
to buy your tech.

777
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,136
And I'm sure A.R.G.U.S.
wouldn't be

778
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,550
the only corporation
hunting for it.

779
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,277
And I think that's more
than a security system

780
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,999
you're working on.

781
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,753
I think you're on
to something big.

782
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,797
Thank you for coming in.

783
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,679
I'm Laurel Lance,
district attorney.

784
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,035
I know who you are.

785
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,680
And I know who you
are, too.

786
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,477
Emiko Adachi.

787
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,631
Your mother was
killed a year ago.

788
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,234
Your father is
Robert Queen.

789
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,000
And for
the last 7 months,

790
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,276
you've been running
around the city

791
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,874
dressed like your
brother.

792
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,236
And you've also managed
to endear yourself

793
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,754
to Oliver
and his team.

794
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,672
I also know that
you were at slabside

795
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,036
the night that Ricardo
Diaz burned to death.

796
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,075
What's your point?

797
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,470
That you're lying about
who you really are.

798
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,515
You're not a hero.

799
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,910
And I wonder how Oliver
and his team will feel

800
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,071
when they find out that
their new vigilante friend

801
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,392
murdered Diaz
in cold blood.

802
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,758
I'm guessing family
dinners are gonna be

803
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,354
a little bit more
awkward.

804
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,672
And, uh,
what makes you think

805
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,640
they will believe
a word you say,

806
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,079
Black Siren?

807
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,951
Do you think I'm showing,
just even a little?

808
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,231
I think you look
exactly the same.

809
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
How you feeling?

810
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,840
Oh, I feel like I
could sleep for 2 weeks.

811
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,519
Oh, yeah.

812
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,070
Hey, so in between
updating the SCPD's tech

813
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,038
and taking down evil CEOs,

814
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,999
I was brainstorming
baby names today.

815
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,674
Any frontrunners?

817
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,753
For a boy, I've
always liked Lucas.

818
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,750
Yeah. Lucas.

819
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,800
That's good.

820
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,678
I may have thought
of a name for a girl.

821
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,989
Yeah?

822
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,750
Mia.

823
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,636
Short for moira.

824
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,914
Sweet and fiery.

825
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
I love it.

826
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,240
And regardless of
whether we have

827
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,312
a boy or a girl...

828
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,312
I just want to make
sure that...

829
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,159
She or he end up...

830
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,958
Growing up in a better
and safer Star City

831
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
than I did.

832
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,634
Yeah.

833
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,155
I want that for both
of our children.

834
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,758
They'll always have
each other to lean on.

835
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,638
And we'll always have us.

836
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,836
What are you
waiting for?

837
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,479
Let's play
the damn thing.

838
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,711
I don't know.
What are you waiting for?

839
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,280
Fine.

840
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,510
Maybe I should do it.

841
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,656
It's not as easy
as it look...

842
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,160
just give it to me.

843
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,671
This is some, like,
feelings thing, isn't it?

844
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,240
Well, I haven't heard
Felicity's Voice

845
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,115
in almost two decades,
so, yeah, it is.

846
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,000
Look, whatever
she says on there,

847
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,993
it's clear she wanted
both of us to hear it...

848
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,958
Together.

849
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,997
All right. Let's just
get this over with.

850
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,352
<i>William and Mia,</i>

851
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,680
<i>you know,
this is the first time</i>

852
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,399
<i>I've ever said
your names together?</i>

853
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,678
<i>20 years, and I avoided ever saying
your names in the same sentence.</i>

854
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,594
<i>It feels like the work of a paranoid,
overprotective mother.</i>

855
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,558
<i>I guess we really do
turn into our parents.</i>

856
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,960
<i>I'm rambling. Sorry.</i>

857
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,715
<i>Not just for the rambling.</i>

858
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,350
<i>For everything, but mostly for
keeping the two of you apart.</i>

859
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,816
<i>I'm not asking
for your forgiveness,</i>

860
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,435
<i>but just know that your father
and I did it to protect you.</i>

861
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,959
<i>We did it because we love you.</i>

862
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,896
<i>Now that you've found
each other,</i>

863
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,400
<i>I just have
one request.</i>

864
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,231
<i>Give these coordinates
to the team:</i>

865
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,634
<i>47.6119 North, 122.3301 West.</i>

866
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,273
<i>And then get the hell
out of Star City.</i>

867
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,273
<i>And whatever you do,
don't come looking for me.</i>

868
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,036
So we're
ignoring her.

869
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,600
Definitely.

870
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,911
I know where these lead.

871
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,918
That's where.

872
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,878
We're going over the wall...

873
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,356
To The Glades.

874
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,634
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>
