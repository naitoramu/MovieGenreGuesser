1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,595
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:04,921
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,592
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,262
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,272
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,024
<i>But by night, I'm someone else.</i>

7
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,810
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,771
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,149
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,573
You are not going to be Bratva Captain
for much longer.

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,411
Susan Williams. She's suspecting
that Oliver's the Green Arrow.

12
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,574
What are we gonna do?

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,789
Hack into her computer,
and find out what's there and delete it?

14
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:35,953
- She has...
- Everything.

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,965
Apparently, I have been plagiarizing
my stories for the past two years.

16
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,548
And my laptop is filled
with incriminating evidence.

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,596
But now, I've been thoroughly discredited.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,301
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

19
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,219
Thea asked me to put a few things
on Susan's computer and...

20
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,388
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Thea asked you?

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,105
<i>The Mayor's Office ordered
the falsification of autopsy reports</i>

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,149
<i>to protect the identity
of Detective Malone's killer.</i>

23
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,856
<i>If any of these allegations prove true,</i>

24
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>it would likely trigger impeachment
proceedings led by the Mayor's...</i>

25
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,491
This might be
the end of my administration.

26
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,160
When did you learn
the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone?

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,328
Why did you protect the Green Arrow?

28
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,168
We have no comment at this time,

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,254
but we will have
something for you shortly. Thanks.

30
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,473
I've called in every favor I could.
I still don't know how this got leaked.

31
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,850
We know how it got leaked.

32
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,345
It's Prometheus.

33
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,389
He sent the ACU after me
as the Green Arrow,

34
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,058
and now,
he is coming after me as the Mayor.

35
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,976
For something he set you up for
in the first place.

36
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,690
Nobody's saying the guy isn't smart.

37
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,948
We're just gonna have to be smarter.
What's the plan, boss?

38
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,198
We don't have a plan yet,

39
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,662
but if we lose this office,
then Prometheus wins.

40
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,198
I just realized,
am I allowed to be in here?

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,082
Usually, the detail stands outside.

42
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,458
Better go blend in.

43
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,245
Okay, well, on the political front,

44
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,960
I think the plan should be to deny,
deflect, obfuscate...

45
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,420
- That's just gonna confuse people...
- Yeah, but that's the point.

46
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,213
What if we tell the truth?
A version of the truth.

47
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,975
"The Green Arrow is a good guy
and I gave him the benefit of the doubt."

48
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,385
You know what, it worked on Pike.

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,103
I'll tell the vultures
you're gonna be making a statement.

50
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,481
Okay, do you want me to write you a draft?

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,483
No, I'll write it.
I need you to handle something for me.

52
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,643
Okay.

53
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,187
- You need to make things right with Susan.
- Ollie...

54
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,823
You got her fired
under false pretenses, Thea.

55
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,076
Only because I was trying to protect you,
which is what I'm doing now.

56
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,035
- Yes, Adrian.
- Mr. Mayor.

57
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,824
What's this?

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,335
My letter of resignation, in which I take
sole responsibility for the cover-up.

59
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,121
- No.
- The cover-up was my idea.

60
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,998
I approved it. I'm the Mayor.

61
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,961
And if this impeachment proceeding
goes the way that I think it will,

62
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,340
not for long.

63
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,395
The Council has broad powers to run
impeachment hearings as it sees fit.

64
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,401
It calls its own witnesses,
enters its own evidence,

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,562
they take a vote, majority rules.

66
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,276
But Oliver can't defend himself?

67
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,407
It's not a criminal trial.

68
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,944
The Council needs a pound of flesh,
and I'm volunteering.

69
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,455
- And I've already said no.
- Yeah, I'm persistent.

70
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,868
I have a better idea.
Be my lawyer at the hearings.

71
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,627
- Mr. Mayor...
- It's "Oliver".

72
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,585
And I'm not your boss anymore,

73
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,374
I'm your client.

74
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,383
I have many reasons for killing Anatoly.

75
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,803
Biggest is his poisoning Bratva
with American scum.

76
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,843
Fine.

77
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,134
What?

78
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,105
Take them.

79
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,400
What'd you do?

80
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,812
Extend our lives by length of good movie.

81
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,452
All right, lady, do your thing.

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,253
That was not your thing.

83
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,127
Boss is getting impeached
and you're down here playing marbles?

84
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,332
Actually, this was your idea.

85
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,546
You're the one who encouraged me
to lean into

86
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,709
the strengths with my tech, remember?

87
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,298
You said that.
We were walking down the alley,

88
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,462
you were like,
"Lean into your strengths..."

89
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,630
- You literally said that!
- I didn't...

90
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,051
Anyway. These are two inventions of mine,

91
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,390
two autonomous mini-drones.

92
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,726
One with offensive,
and the other with defensive capabilities.

93
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,392
So, what,
you can't handle yourself on the field,

94
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,232
you've gotta give yourself
a pair of balls?

95
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,565
That was... That was too harsh, wasn't it?

96
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,826
You think? Yeah, it was,
but, you know what? You recognized it.

97
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,578
- Yeah, 'cause I'm trying to work on...
- Yeah, that's progress.

98
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,082
Anyway, Paul's big problem
with me being Mr. Terrific

99
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,618
was the fact that he was worried.

100
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,412
But now, he doesn't have to worry
with these bad boys in my arsenal.

101
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,047
Sounds like you got
the emotional logic all figured out.

102
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,378
<i>L</i> do.

103
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,511
Now, if I can just get
these damn things to work.

104
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,923
<i>News of the cover-up sent shockwaves
through City Hall,</i>

105
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,893
<i>forcing Council members into enacting
a rarely-used impeachment clause.</i>

106
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,846
<i>Mayor Oliver Queen's administration
might be over.</i>

107
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,355
That woman never reports good news.

108
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,851
It'll work out.
I'm just waiting for my opening.

109
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,360
There's that optimism again.

110
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,613
Chase is representing me,
so I'm gonna beat this.

111
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,067
How are we doing with the
data pull from Prometheus' mother's house?

112
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,744
The sniffer pulled about
a petabyte worth of data,

113
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,904
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack,

114
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,744
- but I am working on it.
- Good.

115
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,908
There's something else
that I could use your help with.

116
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,247
- Okay.
- Susan Williams.

117
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,083
- Oh.
- She's not returning my calls.

118
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,123
Am I really the best person
to come to for love-life advice?

119
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,418
She's not returning my calls
since you and Thea got her fired.

120
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,757
Well, in my defense, I didn't know
that was gonna be Thea's play.

121
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,173
I know, but I still need your help
because Thea is not budging.

122
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:27,221
Look, I know how severely problematic
what I'm about to say is,

123
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:32,985
but Susan is your girlfriend,
so, if anyone is going to fix it,

124
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,645
- I think it has to be you.
- I'm trying,

125
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,438
but like I said,
she's not returning my calls,

126
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,822
and you may have noticed,

127
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,824
I'm sort of facing an impeachment
this week.

128
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,328
- Okay. Yeah, I'll do my best.
- Thank you very much.

129
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,534
Um...

130
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,993
For what it's worth,

131
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,463
and everything I know about politics
I got from <i>Keepin' it 1600,</i>

132
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,131
but I do think
you're gonna beat this thing.

133
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,462
What makes you so sure?

134
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,629
To Star City,
Mayor Oliver Queen is a hero.

135
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,487
Bang.

136
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,366
This marks only the second time
in the 140-year history of this city

137
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,625
that a mayor has faced impeachment.

138
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,038
In 1898, Mayor Prescott
was removed from office.

139
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,960
We'll see what fate awaits Oliver Queen,
who's stepping into the building now.

140
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,057
Hey, I'll catch you up there, all right?

141
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,021
- Hi, Susan.
- Sorry, busy reporting for my new blog.

142
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,476
I'm sorry, I've been trying...

143
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,438
My first entry will be about
how you never took this job seriously.

144
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,484
As Mayor, you've just phoned it in.
You'll only ever be that other guy.

145
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,565
But, of course,
I can't write that

146
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,822
because no one will believe me
now that you've trashed my credibility.

147
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,699
I had nothing to do with that,
but I am working

148
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,576
- to make it right, I'm...
- Whatever. You deserve today.

149
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,913
Hey, so, what do you think
Oliver's chances are?

150
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,253
Come to order.

151
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,339
We're about to find out.

152
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,634
We recently learned
that Detective William Malone

153
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,972
was murdered by the vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.

154
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:34,098
It appears
that the Mayor knew some time ago,

155
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,940
and actively worked to hide the fact,
even from the SCPD.

156
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,356
Today, the Council considers
two grave questions.

157
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,782
<i>Did Oliver Queen's actions
violate the oath he took faithfully</i>

158
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,196
to serve Star City?

159
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:55,460
<i>And should he therefore be
removed as Mayor?</i>

160
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,122
- Hell to the no!
- What he said.

161
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,458
It's Paul. Should I take it?

162
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,752
I'm not gonna take it.
Maybe I should take it.

163
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,012
No, no. Okay, I'll take it.

164
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,385
- Hey.
- This is so completely unfair.

165
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,050
Yeah, that seems to be
going around lately.

166
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,261
So, you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?

167
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,644
He told you? Of course he told you.

168
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,396
Well, did he also tell you
it was a mistake?

169
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,102
- I mean, on my part at least?
- Felicity.

170
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,517
I'm putting the toothpaste
back in the tube, okay?

171
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,684
- And how is that going?
- Well...

172
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,649
- Felicity, what's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

173
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,812
This week it was Oliver's girlfriend.

174
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,105
Last month,
he tells me you're getting involved

175
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,273
in some stuff
you shouldn't be involved in?

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,532
Well, that is a matter of perspective

177
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,910
considering that that "stuff"
helped get you out of prison,

178
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,071
- and General Walker's gun-sights.
- What're you talking about?

179
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,956
"Pandora"?

180
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,291
It's a data cache compiled
by a group of hacktivists called Helix.

181
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,582
They collect electronic dirt
on literally billions of people,

182
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,091
including General Walker.

183
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,718
So, when I asked for it
to get you off, they...

184
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,379
That's a bad choice of words.

185
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,173
They gave me the whole package.

186
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,592
And you're still in bed with these people.

187
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,351
What? You make it sound like
it's a bad thing.

188
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,853
Pandora's just a tool.

189
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,228
Sounds to me like this could be a weapon.

190
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,060
Okay. And is there a problem if it is?

191
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,271
- It depends, Felicity.
- On what?

192
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,810
On how you use it.

193
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,858
My autopsy showed that
mortal injury on the deceased

194
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,777
was consistent with the edging of
the arrowheads used by the Green Arrow.

195
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,823
I have here,
your original Cause of Death Report,

196
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,709
<i>in which you conclude
that the Green Arrow killed Malone,</i>

197
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:21,371
but this report,
it was never included in the case file.

198
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,585
Why is that?

199
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,374
The DA came to me, and I...

200
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,669
You're referring to Adrian Chase?

201
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,636
That's correct.

202
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,548
He instructed me to revise the report
to indicate

203
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,887
that the Throwing Star Killer
was responsible.

204
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
This report.

205
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,310
And you went ahead and signed it,
even though you knew it was fake,

206
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,770
<i>and then passed it along to the police.</i>

207
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,230
Is that the case?

208
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,441
- Yes.
<i>- Why?</i>

209
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,981
Did Mr. Chase threaten you?

210
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,571
He didn't have to.

211
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,488
He said the request came
from the Mayor himself.

212
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,824
The Mayor?

213
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,165
Yes, he told me
the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone.

214
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,705
And did Mayor Queen say why?

215
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,332
He said the Throwing Star Killer,

216
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,876
a man we've been calling Prometheus,
manipulated him.

217
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,044
<i>Did he say why this Prometheus</i>

218
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,714
would wanna orchestrate
Detective Malone's murder?

219
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,882
No.

220
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,469
<i>Standing here today, do you believe
what Mr. Queen has told you?</i>

221
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,107
Honestly, I'm not sure.

222
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:27,191
<i>He's clearly been determined to protect
the Green Arrow for his own purposes.</i>

223
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,823
I think the question here is, why?

224
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,157
Coming through.

225
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,330
Who's most in our corner?

226
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,214
- Pollard, believe it, or not.
- That's not surprising.

227
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,920
She can't call in the marker
I owe her for helping

228
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,551
with the gun reform if I'm impeached.

229
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,802
I'll touch base with her,

230
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,555
see if I can get her to call you
to testify in your own defense, okay?

231
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,566
Okay, well, I...
I have a very political idea.

232
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,820
I'm listening.

233
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,610
Like Adrian said, the Council needs
somebody thrown to the wolves,

234
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,449
and I think it should be Malone.

235
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,658
- Thea!
- What?

236
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,165
Half the SCPD is corrupt,
so, it's not hard to believe.

237
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:26,000
And he is no longer with us,
so, he wouldn't really mind.

238
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,507
That way, the cover-up is
no longer about the Green Arrow,

239
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,046
it becomes about protecting Malone's
reputation for the sake of his family.

240
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,055
Now you're gonna
destroy his reputation. No.

241
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,308
- But, Ollie...
- Thea, it's not even a question.

242
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,636
Okay.

243
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,060
How do we think the Council's gonna vote?

244
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,852
It's a pretty even split
with Kullens as the swing vote.

245
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,447
Hold on!

246
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,095
My target's the Mayor and his corruption.

247
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,349
He surrenders,
I'll let the rest of you live.

248
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,393
Good man.

249
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,731
Good woman.

250
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,064
Hey, hey, get to safety, get to safety.

251
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,322
- Quentin, the driver!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

252
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,255
You want me? Come on!

253
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,856
Lucky you. You get one more day.

254
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,615
Okay, all right.

255
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,826
Look, I appreciate what you're doing,
but I'm fine.

256
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,615
Mr. Mayor, all due respect,

257
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,127
your head's bleeding and our concussion
protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.

258
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,788
Well, I'm the Mayor, so I'm suspending it.

259
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,965
The, uh. Your driver, he's okay.

260
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,296
Yeah, he took a hit on his shoulder,

261
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,052
and he's got a bump on the head,
but he's fine.

262
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,090
And before you ask, he didn't see you turn
all Bruce Lee back there.

263
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,633
- Where's Dinah?
- She's doing her job, working the scene.

264
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,473
All right, I gotta get to the Bunker, l...

265
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,887
- Oh, boy.
- Easy, Ollie.

266
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,930
You know
there's a concussion protocol, right?

267
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,269
Yeah, so I've heard.

268
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,354
- This was Vigilante?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,488
Apparently, because of the
impeachment hearing, I'm a criminal.

270
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,820
- You okay?
- Oh. Never felt better.

271
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,164
Hey, so, I made sure the unis keep
all the press behind the cordon.

272
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,496
Trust me, you don't want them
snapping shots of you in an ambulance.

273
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,831
Yeah, no ambulance.

274
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,995
But I'm tougher than I look.
I'm gonna get back to the office.

275
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,379
Where have I heard that before?

276
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,883
Hey, look, while under threat
of the impeachment,

277
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,920
you can't exactly amend by-laws,
so that concussion protocol?

278
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,258
Yeah, it's a thing.

279
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,924
It's okay, Ollie,
I can go back to the office

280
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,013
and tell everyone
we're gonna be working overtime.

281
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,180
Plus, I'm never getting into a limo
with you again.

282
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,147
Oliver's on his way to Starling General,
but don't worry, he'll be fine.

283
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,859
I heard shots were fired on the motorcade.

284
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,569
Yeah, flipped our limo in the air.

285
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,860
- Cool.
- Not "cool," more like "ow,"

286
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,448
and Oliver might be concussed.

287
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,330
But in the meantime,
there's still the Vigilante out there.

288
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,490
Okay, Rene and I
are gonna hit the streets,

289
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,001
see if we can't muscle the Vigilante's
whereabouts out of some people.

290
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,288
Curtis, let's check the Key Hole satellite
and CC thermal cams.

291
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,956
Actually, hold on. I need a favor.

292
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,965
Okay, if this is about Susan Williams,
I'm already on it.

293
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,172
No, it's about the impeachment.

294
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,053
You said that Pandora
has dirt on a lot of people, right?

295
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,465
Yeah, if by "a lot of people,"
you mean "everybody," then, yeah.

296
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,723
What about Councilman Kullens?

297
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,100
Last time I checked,
he's part of "everybody."

298
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,385
- Why?
- You know why.

299
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,595
Oh. Oh!

300
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,101
You wanna blackmail him?

301
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,939
No. It's not blackmail, it's politics.

302
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,113
<i>In the wake of the attack,
Councilman Kullens</i>

303
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,900
<i>has called a brief recess
to the impeachment hearings.</i>

304
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,448
<i>If the Mayor is medically cleared,
the Council will vote tomorrow.</i>

305
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,078
Okay.

306
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,412
Well, sounds like you need a note
from your doctor, Mr. Mayor.

307
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,202
This is ridiculous,
I know what real injury feels like.

308
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,417
I can only imagine, given your other job.

309
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,333
And you're right, your CAT scan is clear.

310
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,878
- Good.
- Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast.

311
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,048
Look, I can't discharge you without
a few more hours of observation.

312
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,340
Doctor Schwartz...

313
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,181
People can withstand only so much strain.

314
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,688
And being both Mayor and him,
it's unsustainable.

315
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,348
I assure you, my body can handle it.

316
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,860
I'm not talking about your body,
Mr. Queen.

317
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,440
I'm talking about this.

318
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,526
The mind needs rest,

319
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,818
or at least someone to take your thoughts
off all the evil you face each day.

320
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,454
Doctor Schwartz,
are you prescribing me a girlfriend?

321
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,490
Or just a friend.

322
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,137
<i>Hi, this is Susan.
I can't come to the phone...</i>

323
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,816
"Demand an exam"?

324
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,572
Yeah, it rhyme better in Russian.

325
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,156
<i>Spros dopros</i> is Bratva way
to call <i>Pakhan</i> to account for actions.

326
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,743
Captains all listen,
maybe Pakhan lose position.

327
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,327
That's good news!

328
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,993
That's good. That means we can
overthrow Gregor without a fight.

329
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,079
No. Everybody knows about
Gregor's deal with Kovar.

330
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,998
No, no, we still end up dead.

331
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,509
Men who call, vote, are killed
if Pakhan keeps position.

332
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,760
Anatoly, why bother?

333
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,513
I did not want to die
in hospital basement.

334
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,008
That's... Fair.

335
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:16,020
Look, all we have to do is find evidence
that Gregor's deal with Kovar

336
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,146
benefits him and not the Bratva.

337
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,853
Yes, but where are we going to find that?

338
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,857
I have to go.

339
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,695
Code says you have one hour to finalize
personal affairs before <i>Spros dopros.</i>

340
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,858
I can do that.

341
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,698
But you must have Captain with you,
who is not me.

342
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,032
I'll lose him.

343
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,864
I'm really good at losing people.

344
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,836
I've got bullet fragments and casings
coming out of my ass,

345
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,424
but nothing new.

346
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,716
All right, I'll catch you back downtown.

347
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,692
Hey, Johnson,
gotta make room for a tow truck.

348
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,238
- Anything?
- Nada.

349
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,907
Peeps on the street are actually
more afraid of the Vigilante than us.

350
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,075
What about you?

351
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,835
Vigilante changes artillery supplier
every week.

352
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,079
Every lead goes cold.

353
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,497
We could really use
a break right about now.

354
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,129
<i>I think I got something.</i>

355
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,964
Yes! I totally manifested that!
What do you got?

356
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,973
When my sonic cry hit Vigilante,
it knocked off a small piece of his visor.

357
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,929
It looks like it's lined
with some kind of circuitry.

358
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,093
Well, that means it's manufactured.

359
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,761
Maybe I can link to back
to where he bought it from.

360
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,929
I think I can do you one better.

361
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,599
My T-Spheres can actually track the tech
to the individual user.

362
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,984
Except they won't be ready
till the iPhone 16 is released.

363
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,110
- Ye, of little faith...
- What's a T-Sphere?

364
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,316
Curtis' balls.

365
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,279
They're something really fascinating,
and of my own personal invention.

366
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,993
I realized that quantum computation

367
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,911
<i>- could be</i> used to...
- All right, yeah, forget I asked.

368
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,697
<i>I'll bring you guys the visor, okay?</i>

369
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,992
Copy that, we're here.
Curtis, this is on you now.

370
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,284
Challenge accepted.

371
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,499
Hey, seriously, man,
what's up with your balls?

372
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,710
I mean, you were literally gonna
throw those things in the trash.

373
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,001
Paul called, asked me to dinner.
Like, a date.

374
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,670
Like, I'm gonna get my man back.

375
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,555
I told you, hoss,
some piece of tech ain't gonna...

376
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,058
Look, I know Paul,

377
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:22,309
he wouldn't be asking me to go out
to dinner if he wasn't ready to reconcile.

378
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,401
Personal call?

379
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,284
Uh, yeah, I had a family emergency.
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,196
Don't be. Family's important.

381
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,492
Hey, why don't I log that in for you?

382
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,501
So you can handle your emergency.

383
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,036
Uh...

384
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,048
Don't worry, I'll take good care of this.

385
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,675
And, uh, I hope everything's okay
with your family.

386
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,648
- Oliver Queen is mine.
- Not if I kill him first.

387
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,319
Yes.

388
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,080
I'd like to report a sighting
of Vigilante.

389
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,583
This is District Attorney Chase.

390
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,553
<i>Hey, Oliver's out of the hospital,
headed to City Hall.</i>

391
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,929
Any word from Dinah?

392
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,933
Um, she's at the precinct, trying to
recover that piece of Vigilante's visor.

393
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,060
What about you, Felicity?

394
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:29,941
And don't tell me that it's traffic cams,
we both know they're on autopilot.

395
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,400
I sent Thea something
to sway Councilman Kullens.

396
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,485
Apparently, he's the swing vote
on Oliver's impeachment.

397
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,648
Pandora?

398
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,783
Officially, his wife died in a car crash.

399
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,115
Unofficially, she crashed the car
on purpose.

400
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,280
- Suicide?
- He used his clout to cover it up,

401
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,993
so I'm guessing
he's not gonna want it uncovered.

402
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,124
And you are okay with this, right?

403
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,332
I think the city needs Oliver
to keep being Mayor.

404
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,418
Felicity, Kullens is not a criminal,
he's a human being.

405
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,128
He's a politician,
that's hardly the same thing.

406
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,339
A human being that went through
a very tragic accident,

407
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,344
a very private one.

408
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,012
Come on, this isn't you.

409
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,139
Well, it pretty much is.

410
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,470
Okay, do you know what your superpower is?

411
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,185
- Computers?
- Empathy.

412
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,352
Big, reflexive, pure empathy.

413
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,737
- Well, maybe I'm fresh out.
- Because of Billy.

414
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,321
It's a dark world.

415
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,156
And for the past four years,

416
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,823
I have watched you and Oliver
and Laurel and Thea and Roy,

417
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,662
I've watched all of you
use a little darkness to fight it.

418
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,667
That's true.

419
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,375
Sometimes, we do fight fire with fire,

420
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,086
but every time we do, Felicity,
every single time,

421
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,381
we risk being burned.

422
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,141
Well, some days, I can't help but feel

423
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,268
as if this city
wants to collapse in on itself,

424
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,179
and all we're doing is
delaying the inevitable.

425
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,019
No, we're preventing it.

426
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,854
We're the good guys,
don't you forget that, all right?

427
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,145
Whack-a-mole.
We got Prometheus, the Vigilante.

428
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,985
And the one wild card I thought
maybe might be on our side,

429
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,649
<i>just murdered a cop.</i>

430
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,988
- Nah, the Green Arrow got played.
- I don't know.

431
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,495
What I do know is
the next Mayor owes me a raise.

432
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,249
Yeah, I'll put in a word with Mayor Queen.
He's not impeached yet.

433
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,579
All right.

434
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,925
Please tell me you didn't send it.

435
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,217
The thing with Kullens' wife,
he doesn't deserve that.

436
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,849
- Felicity told you, didn't she?
- Thea...

437
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,135
I haven't sent the email, okay?

438
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,351
Ollie, don't look at me like that,
it's politics!

439
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,018
There's about to be a vote,
so it's time to play hardball.

440
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,027
This isn't hardball, this is cruel.

441
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,405
What would be cruel is
the people of this city

442
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,780
not having you as the Mayor.

443
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,068
The Anti-Crime Unit,

444
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,158
low-income housing,
commonsense gun legislation.

445
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,073
Ollie, in the short amount of time
you've been doing this,

446
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,913
you've done a remarkable job.

447
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,670
Please, just let me do what I have to do
to help you keep doing that.

448
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,706
Felicity told me about this Kullens thing

449
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,715
because of something
that John said to her.

450
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,513
Thea, when you fight fire with fire,
you are probably gonna get burned.

451
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,720
I won't. It'll be fine.

452
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,054
Like it was with Susan?

453
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,473
You destroyed her career,
now you've graduated to blackmail.

454
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,602
Where does it stop?

455
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,009
Magic hands.

456
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,930
The magnetic resonance frequencies
within Vigilante's tech

457
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,387
are now communicating with my T-Spheres.

458
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,017
Great. So what does it mean?

459
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,224
Can we catch the Vigilante, or not?

460
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:41,483
Well, cross your fingers
and your toes.

461
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,359
<i>It's working!</i>

462
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,870
The T-Sphere's picking up on the signal
from the piece of visor!

463
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,703
Yeah, but the other one's still wonky.

464
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,867
No, no, it's not.

465
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,002
It's actually tracking
the rest of the visor.

466
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,038
- Let's take down this SOB.
- Without Oliver?

467
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,004
If Vigilante gets to him, we'll be
doing this without Oliver permanently.

468
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,713
- Let's suit up.
- Suit up!

469
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,299
Oh. Sorry, I thought since Oliver's gone,
I would, probably...

470
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,214
But it makes more sense probably for you...

471
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,475
I'll make sure I'll work on
the timing there. Promise.

472
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,563
- Balls.
- My. T-Spheres. Don't call 'em "balls."

473
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,729
You speak with Pollard?

474
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,695
She won't call you to testify
without Kullens' blessing.

475
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:31,905
We're not gonna get that.

476
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,569
And the Council hearing directly
from you

477
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,487
is only one of two ways
I can see us winning this thing.

478
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,531
- What's the second way?
- You won't like it.

479
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,826
Does it involve
offering up a sacrificial lamb?

480
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,835
Either me, or Detective Malone.

481
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,085
Oliver, this impeachment
is about punishing someone,

482
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,545
and if you don't offer up a name,

483
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,756
this'll be the last time
you're looking out that window.

484
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,763
If the Council is not gonna let me
testify at the hearing,

485
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,223
then I need to take my case
directly to the public.

486
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,229
- A press conference?
- Yeah.

487
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,641
Mind filling me in on
who you're throwing under the bus?

488
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:10,902
The Green Arrow.

489
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,917
Right here.

490
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,886
And, stop.

491
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,218
- Dude, we got him?
- I think so.

492
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,432
- Oh. This is bad.
- Why <i>is that?</i>

493
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,222
<i>The building that
you just stopped in front of?</i>

494
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,436
Well, City Hall is located
directly behind it, offering

495
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,442
perfect line-of-sight to where
Oliver is giving his speech.

496
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,444
It's the Vigilante's Book Depository.

497
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,900
Felicity, we need you
to check the blueprints.

498
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,064
<i>Yeah, already on it.</i>

499
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,154
Okay, the sixth floor is under renovation.
Dollars to donuts...

500
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,568
That's where he'll be.

501
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,309
Yeah. I'm listening.

502
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,191
Yeah, copy that.

503
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,611
Vigilante is across the street.
Sixth floor.

504
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,870
He's gonna take you out as soon as
you walk outside into the open.

505
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,498
- Is the team on site?
- Yeah.

506
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,789
Then it'll be fine.

507
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,358
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

508
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,147
<i>I'd like to thank the City Council
for conducting these hearings</i>

509
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,986
<i>with honesty and integrity.</i>

510
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:21,871
<i>Simply wish that I could've done the same
with regards to the Green Arrow's</i>

511
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,124
<i>murder of Detective William Malone.</i>

512
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,541
- Terrific, where is he?
- This way, this way!

513
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,593
What's so funny?

514
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,724
I think I just found
a new use for my T-Sphere.

515
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,013
Your what?

516
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:54,362
<i>When I took the oath of office,
I promised to be honest and forthright.</i>

517
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,942
<i>I never wanted to be a politician</i>

518
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:02,111
<i>who relied on dirty politics
or underhanded tactics.</i>

519
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,122
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

520
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,125
Oh, no.

521
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:19,128
<i>And in the spirit of that transparency,</i>

522
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:23,094
<i>I think I owe everyone an explanation
as to why</i>

523
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,179
<i>I covered up what the Green Arrow did.</i>

524
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:54,835
<i>I did it in a misguided attempt
to protect everyone from the tragic news</i>

525
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,090
<i>that the Green Arrow
had become a cop killer.</i>

526
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,250
What?

527
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,718
<i>That a man we had put our faith in
had failed this city.</i>

528
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,179
<i>I didn't think that we could afford
to lose another hero.</i>

529
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,518
<i>Hey, Vigilante!</i>

530
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,554
I got two of these.

531
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:19,404
- Nice aim.
- That's the thing, they aim themselves.

532
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,484
Awesome!

533
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,121
Awesome!

534
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,040
You're awesome. That was badass.

535
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,580
- That mean no more ball jokes?
- Hell, no.

536
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,717
Remind me to thank Cisco
for that upgraded Kevlar.

537
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,885
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, but what about Oliver?

538
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,720
<i>But the truth is more important,</i>

539
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,481
<i>and the truth is that
the Green Arrow has gone rogue.</i>

540
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,566
<i>We must disavow him, we must hunt him,
and punish him for what he has done.</i>

541
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,031
<i>Green Arrow is not a hero.</i>

542
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,573
<i>He is what's keeping Star City from being
the best that it can be.</i>

543
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,705
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

544
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,802
They're still deliberating.

545
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,932
Well, that's taking longer than I thought.

546
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,594
Yeah, well,
you gave them plenty to think about.

547
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,106
So, how's it feel, huh?
Making yourself into a villain like that?

548
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,601
Susan Williams is here.

549
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,769
You want me to say you're busy?

550
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,610
No! No, I'd like to tell the truth
for the rest of the day,

551
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,194
if at all possible. Please send her in.

552
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,734
All right.

553
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,236
<i>Susan, please.</i>

554
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,697
Thank you.

555
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,787
I'm glad you're here.

556
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,454
- Susan, I'm very sorry.
- I got my job back.

557
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,171
An anonymous hacker confessed
that the plagiarism story was fake.

558
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,462
Said they were just messing with us.
My boss apologized.

559
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,347
Well, that's good news.
Still though, I'm really sorry.

560
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,474
Are you? What I mean is,

561
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,727
you didn't know about this
beforehand, did you?

562
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,683
No, I had no idea.

563
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:19,440
But once you did,
you made them make it right. Right?

564
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,023
- Are we off the record?
- Yes.

565
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,486
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

566
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,988
So, what happens next?

567
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,450
You mean, what do I do with your secret?
I keep it.

568
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,365
I care about this city,
and you're working double-time

569
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,996
to make it a better place.

570
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,546
I do appreciate that, but I meant,
what happens next with us?

571
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,666
Uh...

572
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,295
Sorry to interrupt,
but I think you'll be happy that we did.

573
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,761
Council voted

574
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,220
against impeachment.

575
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,598
Thank you so much, Adrian,
I could not have done this without you.

576
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,516
Are you kidding me? No thanks needed.

577
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:05,483
You're not just my boss, Oliver,
you're my friend.

578
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,489
I'm gonna go give Thea the good news.
I'll be right back.

579
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,777
Okay.

580
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,709
Hey, no need to pack up, we won.

581
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,211
We both get to keep our jobs.

582
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,871
Yeah, not...

583
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,165
Not both of us.

584
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,215
Look, Ollie, you... You were right. I...

585
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,590
I am getting deeper and deeper
into the mud lately,

586
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,385
and it's like my bloodlust last year,

587
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,304
except instead of arrows and swords,

588
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,974
I've replaced it with
politics and slanders, so I am...

589
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,984
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that you have to quit, Thea.

590
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,520
- I need you here...
- Ollie, please.

591
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,906
Please don't ask me to stay,
because I will.

592
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,782
I will for you.

593
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,113
But I am broken. Okay?

594
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,166
I need you to let me go.

595
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,253
Let me go, so, I can try to fix myself.

596
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,748
Well...

597
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,673
- Your resignation's accepted.
- Thank you.

598
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,860
My resignation letter's on the desk.

599
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,827
When I signal,
you must align with Anatoly,

600
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,285
who called <i>Spros dopros,</i>
or Gregor, our incumbent <i>Pakhan</i>.

601
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,950
Now, let's get this over with quickly.

602
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,296
Hey, stop!

603
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,136
Mr. Queen, you do not have floor.

604
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,720
Just give me 10 seconds,

605
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,228
listen to what I have to say,
and if you don't like it, shoot me.

606
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,890
As you wish.

607
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,151
This laptop contains
80 million rubles in transfers

608
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,317
from Kovar's accounts
to accounts that Gregor controls.

609
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,908
Yes, we know this,
to spread among Bratva captains.

610
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:25,544
It also contains 40 million rubles worth
of bank transfers from Kovar

611
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,873
that Gregor hasn't disclosed.

612
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,335
Open it. Ask him if it's true.

613
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:37,760
<i>Is this true, Gregor?</i>

614
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,357
40 million rubles. So, it's true.

615
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:51,190
If anybody wishes to cast a new vote,
please do so now.

616
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,035
It seems that
you are deciding vote, Viktor.

617
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,246
What say you, my friend?

618
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,456
We have a new Pakhan.

619
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,001
This is most disappointing.

620
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,553
I liked many of you.

621
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,852
- Council isn't impeaching.
- Yes!

622
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,179
- Still the mayor.
- Whoo!

623
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,690
Yet, the Green Arrow is
Public Enemy Number One.

624
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,270
We've dealt with
the police on our backs before.

625
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,527
Not like this, one of their own is dead.

626
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,686
Dinah's right.

627
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,732
And now we know just how much the police
can interfere with our work here.

628
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,150
Can I go?

629
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,284
I'm kind of
getting back together with Paul.

630
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,116
It's a big deal.

631
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,782
- Can I leave? Can I...
- Yes! Yes, of course. Go.

632
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,043
Have fun.
Everyone should have fun tonight.

633
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,748
Just quickly though,

634
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,630
I might have buried the headline here.

635
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,585
You all saved my life.

636
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,128
And five months ago,

637
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,968
I never would've thought
that was possible.

638
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,849
Thank you for working hard,

639
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,683
thank you for banding together,
thank you for being...

640
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,770
Sorry. L...
I mean, thank you for saying thank you.

641
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,436
Wow. Man to man, that means a lot,
but I'm really late to see Paul, so...

642
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,945
- Give Paul my best.
- Thank you!

643
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,607
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

644
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,827
Oh. Thank you.

645
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,866
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,211
Sorry, we were stopping an assassination.

647
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,043
Can you believe
I stopped an assassination?

648
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,299
Wow.

649
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,972
So, on the way over here,
I rehearsed what I would say to you.

650
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,808
How I would win you back,

651
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,099
tell you I love you.

652
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,932
You know, I just started with...

653
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,022
That was definitely not
how I planned on opening,

654
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,691
but can I start again? I'ma start again.
When I came to...

655
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,824
It's nice to see you, Curtis. I mean that.

656
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,157
As much as you're going to think
that I don't.

657
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,619
What?

658
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,420
Are you divorcing me?

659
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,876
I'm sorry. I really am.

660
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,531
- Felicity!
- Hi!

661
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,657
Lam so glad you got in touch.

662
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,660
- Though I am a little surprised?
- Yeah, me, too.

663
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,072
Well, "surprised" isn't actually

664
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,366
the right word to describe
how I'm feeling.

665
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,580
What's the right word?

666
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,040
Ready.

667
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,295
A good friend of mine

668
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,752
told me that if you're gonna try
to fight fire with fire,

669
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,962
you're gonna get burned,

670
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,052
but then another friend of mine

671
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,885
came through something
pretty scary tonight

672
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,799
because he had backup,

673
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,347
a team.

674
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,933
You're accepting the invitation
to join Helix?

675
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,225
Yes. Full throttle.

676
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,732
Susan.

677
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,651
Oh. Hey.

678
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,371
- I thought we could talk.
- About?

679
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,578
An exclusive.

680
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,210
Can we set up the meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.

681
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:45,091
The thing is that this story,
it's important.

682
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,258
You could call it life or death.
