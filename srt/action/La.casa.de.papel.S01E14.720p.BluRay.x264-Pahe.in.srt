1
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,401
Call Alberto, isn't he
the best of the scientist?

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,561
Well, let him come.

3
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:09,721
Get out of the car.

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:11,401
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,121
Aah!

6
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,881
You're under arrest for assault on authority.

7
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,241
I'm calling from the police station,
I'm under arrest.

8
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,241
Where's the record of his arrest?

9
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,321
I want you to cross-check all the fingerprints.

10
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:29,641
with the spoon of sub-inspector Rubio.

11
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,561
How are we going to get out?
- Through a tunnel.

12
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,601
You're gonna have the hostages
digging in the boiler cellar.

13
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:38,401
We'll go out through another tunnel.
Just open it from vault number three.

14
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,561
from vault number three...
to a hangar I already have planned.

15
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,641
Earth!

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,921
to a hangar I already have planned.

17
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:48,681
I want to make you a deal.
If you want, you can come with me.

18
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,881
After the end, you can have everything I have.

19
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,281
with everything I've got.

20
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,961
Where the fuck are you going?

21
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:58,601
Turn around.

22
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,201
Quick! Mónica, open the door!

23
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,761
I'm gonna count to five and
then I'm gonna shoot him.

24
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,521
One...! Ah!

25
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,961
- You're coming with us.
If you crossed the line,

26
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,921
You crossed the line,
I'm not leaving you lying in the gutter.

27
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:15,361
Sometimes we try to help someone,
but the first to sink is oneself.

28
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:18,161
I tried to help your mother
every fucking day of my life.

29
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:21,081
- What'd you do?
- I left her in a Martorell roundabout,

30
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,721
it was either her or us.

31
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,801
- As soon as we get out, you and I are nothing.

32
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:28,921
Sub-inspector Rubio is coming out of the coma,

33
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,841
is the only person who knows who I am.

34
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,001
You have to go and check if it's a trap.

35
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,801
And if it isn't, finish him off.

36
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:42,481
They left me an envelope for you.

37
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:45,721
Sooner or later, this will all be over.
And then you and I will meet on the beach. Pick one.

38
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:47,721
I'll meet you at the beach. Choose one.

39
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:50,201
Palawan.
- Palawan.

40
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,761
The archipelago is a little above.

41
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:58,881
You're being held for collaboration

42
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,881
in the hostage assault to the
Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

43
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,601
You slept with me because
I'm the lead inspector.

44
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,961
You want me to believe you have feelings for me?

45
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,361
It's something that's happening
to both of us, you know?

46
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,281
From now on what you have to say

47
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,081
you say it directly to the judge.
- I'm so sorry, Raquel.

48
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,401
Keep going...!

49
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:18,121
What are you gonna do to me?

50
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:23,841
We're going to request
unconditional and isolated imprisonment.

51
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:26,801
At 24 hours you say you want to make a pact,

52
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:29,921
it's possible that in that transfer
I can do something for you.

53
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,281
"If he had commanded me to be saved,
how was it possible

54
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,441
that he wasn't there?"

55
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:45,321
It's a call to Alison Parker's phone.

56
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:48,081
Río, it's Tokio. I'm going through
the heaven's gate.

57
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,241
In a minute.

58
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,561
Tokio's coming back!

59
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,121
- Tokio's coming back!
Get down!

60
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,801
- We have to open the door, dammit!

61
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,281
Shoot the target, shoot the biker!

62
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,001
Come on!

63
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,241
No! We've got to cover her up, damn it!

64
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,681
- Shooting kidnapper.

65
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,041
Dad, look out!

66
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,961
- Unit three, behind you, behind you!

67
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:27,441
Aah!

68
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,161
It's fucking crazy.
- What's that?

69
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,441
- Well, all this, Dad.

70
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:18,121
- This time it goes well, I'll tell you.
- This time?

71
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:21,681
- It's got to go well.
- We deserve it, don't we?

72
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,001
- Of course!

73
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:36,241
Help! Help!
- The first-aid kit!

74
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,001
- Get the fucking first-aid kit!
- Cover the wound!

75
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,001
- Look at me, look at me.

76
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,801
- Don't worry, this is a scratch
on the side, that's all.

77
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:48,801
On the side, on the side.

78
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,041
There's no exit wound, the bullet's inside.

79
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:57,081
- Nairobi!
- I am, I am!

80
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:59,081
- Fucking hell, he's bleeding out.

81
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:02,801
- Don't worry, I've got a lot blood.

82
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,561
Can't you see I've eaten a lot of black pudding?

83
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:09,161
- Okay, hold him for me. Berlín, morphine.
- Take it easy.

84
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:13,481
- Okay, let's see. Okay, okay.
I'm going to put him an IV.

85
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,001
Let me go, let me go.

86
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:21,201
- It's okay.

87
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:23,521
- Pull there, Denver.

88
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,441
- Wait, wait.

89
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,881
I'm going...
I'm going to put him an IV.

90
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,001
- Breathe slowly.

91
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:45,761
Breathe slower.

92
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,201
Pulse is firing.
- Gauze.

93
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,601
That's it.

94
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:54,401
Easy, Moscú.

95
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:57,441
It's all right.

96
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,041
You're gonna be okay.

97
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,561
Hey, are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

98
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,201
Oh, yeah?
- Easy, Moscú.

99
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:11,801
Easy, Moscú.

100
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,121
It's okay.

101
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:38,721
He's been shot three times, Río.
That's three shots.

102
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:06,601
What a son of a bitch.
- Raquel.

103
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:18,761
I freed myself. I could have escaped,

104
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,441
I could have killed you, Raquel.

105
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,561
You didn't want to believe
that polygraph you brought either.

106
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,801
Well, look, this is proof that I'm telling the truth.

107
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:56,881
Well, you just screwed up with this act of love,

108
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,641
cause I'm gonna put you
in the gaol for 80 years.

109
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,921
Get up, slowly.

110
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:25,641
Hands on your head. And turn around.

111
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,081
Don't move, what the fuck are you doing?

112
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:35,201
Stay, stay! Stay! I told you!

113
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,001
Hands on your head.

114
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:56,921
Don't take another step.

115
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,361
Raquel, I will not stop.

116
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:21,641
You're gonna have to kill me.

117
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:57,441
Fucking hell.

118
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:01,161
Son of a bitch, my phone.

119
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,641
Three shots, three shots in the stomach.

120
00:12:56,481 --> 00:12:59,761
We have to call a doctor,
we can't do anything.

121
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,121
It's time to keep a cool head, Tokio.

122
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,321
I'm not just thinking about Moscú.

123
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,201
I'm going to call the Profesor.
- The Profesor is not here!

124
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,121
I've called him a thousand times,
I don't know where the hell he is!

125
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,881
We have to call the inspector.
- We can't do that,

126
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,041
you know, it's not in the plan.
- What plan?

127
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,081
You know what my plan was?

128
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:27,761
Kill you.

129
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,081
But now it's Moscú that's dying,

130
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:34,361
so don't ever tell me again
what's not in the fucking plan.

131
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:56,881
This is Colonel Prieto.

132
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,681
- I'd like to speak to Inspector Murillo, please.

133
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,801
- NIC has taken over.

134
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:08,161
- Colonel, it's Fonollosa.
I would like to ask you

135
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,761
what you're wearing,
but I don't have time for small talk.

136
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:13,601
One of our men just got shot three times,

137
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,721
I want a surgeon in here now.

138
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:19,801
- You know what I want? Stop breaking my balls.

139
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:22,721
You pulled Silene Oliveira out of a police van.

140
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:24,481
and snuck it back into the factory,

141
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:28,321
have placed explosive devices that,
thank God, have failed.

142
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:31,321
Do you really think you're in
a position to ask for anything?

143
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,481
Look, it was a clean rescue on our part.

144
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,761
You, however, have started to shoot.

145
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,321
It would be nice if you could help save the life.

146
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,241
of this man.
- Listen to me carefully.

147
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,961
If you want to save that man's life,

148
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:48,001
take him out the front door, unarmed, and an ambulance

149
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:49,721
will be waiting to take care of him.

150
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,041
- We're not giving up our man, Colonel.

151
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,961
- Then you' Il have another corpse in the band.

152
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:02,241
Have you located the inspector?
- We're on it.

153
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,081
Helsinki, how do you see it?

154
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,081
- It's not a shot in the leg.

155
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,841
Stomach is a very bad area, Moscú. Very bad.

156
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,201
We need a surgeon.

157
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:02,361
- How much time do we have?

158
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:06,281
- Hours.

159
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,241
- 11, 12, 13.

160
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:12,961
But without a surgeon, we don't do anything.

161
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:18,001
- How many impacts do I have?

162
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:22,961
- That's three, Dad.

163
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,481
That's three.

164
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,241
- What a racket I've got down there.

165
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:36,361
- Moscú, they don't want
to put surgical equipment in,

166
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:39,521
but we have an ambulance out there
to take you to the hospital.

167
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,881
- Well, you can tell the police

168
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,441
to be fucked a lot, because I'm not going back

169
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,601
to jail.

170
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,761
That wall's got three blows
to go to the other side.

171
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,521
That's ten hours of work.

172
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:05,921
Start digging

173
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,481
and I'll take care of it, okay?

174
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:12,601
- Hold on, Dad, hold on.
I'll open that tunnel

175
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:13,841
even if it's head-butting.

176
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:16,401
Gentlemen, we're out of here.

177
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,281
There's been a shooting.
What happened?

178
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:35,161
I've got Moscú like a sieve, three shots.

179
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,321
Where is it?
- In the belly.

180
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:43,401
I don't think they hit the liver,
the rest I don't know.

181
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,521
How do you see him?

182
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:53,441
Fucked up.

183
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,361
But Moscú says it doesn't want
to go out, that in a few hours

184
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:58,721
we can enter the tunnel.

185
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,201
I've got the Serbs here,
we're going to dig, too

186
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:06,521
from this side. And I will locate
the Ukrainian doctor.

187
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,641
Anyway, you have to get out
as soon as possible.

188
00:19:13,241 --> 00:19:15,881
I've been discovered, Andrés.
I don't know how long

189
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,961
it's gonna take the police to show up here.

190
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:25,641
What's new?

191
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,361
What's going on?

192
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:31,401
What's he doing here?

193
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:35,441
Will somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?

194
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,401
- Did you know that Sergio Marquina,
aka the Profesor, is Salva,

195
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,761
the brain from the heist? The man

196
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,641
you've been seeing in the bar for five days.

197
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:47,361
- Yeah, I just found out a few hours ago.

198
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:49,841
- You got a call from that man,

199
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:53,241
he was calling you from the police station
in Canillas, where he was being held.

200
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:57,241
Minutes later you went, set up a scene

201
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,481
to get him out of there and destroyed the record

202
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:02,361
where his fingerprints were.
- Then I didn't know who he was.

203
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:05,001
- The evidence you destroyed
would have identified him

204
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:08,081
as the man who forced the zeta
from which the Russian was threatened

205
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,001
not to make the robot portrait.

206
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,881
from the Ibiza that you found in the scrap yard

207
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,921
and from which Ángel stole a spoon,

208
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,761
incriminating him before the accident.
- Then you took him

209
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:19,841
to the gang's house in Toledo, right?

210
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,481
- And you put him in my car,
where there was the only evidence

211
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:24,641
of judicial value I could get out of the house.

212
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:27,481
- The chimney papers and the evidence are gone.

213
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,281
- After knocking out Inspector Vicuña.

214
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:33,481
- And when Ángel did his job
and threw his suspicions at him,

215
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:36,201
you kicked him out of the investigation.
- And as a culmination

216
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,321
of this beautiful story,
while you were destroying your partner,

217
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,361
you were banging the boss of the gang.

218
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:50,321
- All right, all right.

219
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,881
To begin with, that man can't be here,

220
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:57,641
He has a restraining order,
so if he's not

221
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:00,241
500 meters from me in five minutes,

222
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:01,761
I'm gonna have him arrested.

223
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,841
I didn't know who that man was.

224
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:21,201
And I'm gonna prove it.

225
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,761
I can tell you where he's hiding.

226
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:41,441
What the fuck did you do,
leave my mother in a roundabout?

227
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:45,601
All my life making me think
she was a motherfucker.

228
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,521
- It was her or us.

229
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,561
I'm not breaking your head
because we need you

230
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:54,201
to get out of here.
As soon as we get out,

231
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:56,601
you and I are nothing.

232
00:21:57,641 --> 00:22:01,361
Two strangers, Denver and Moscú.

233
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:03,041
Fucking hell!

234
00:22:33,481 --> 00:22:36,761
Can somebody explain to me
what the fuck this is, please?

235
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:41,161
Not that way. We said in one million rolls,

236
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:44,041
please. To the limit I want it, shit.

237
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:50,601
We're gonna keep printing bills
for a few more hours.

238
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:53,121
Then stop the machines
and erase all the records.

239
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:56,001
I want everybody working full!

240
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,561
We're leaving now!

241
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,281
As you hear it.

242
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,841
I've heard of another very good place,

243
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:06,201
at the Federal Reserve.
- Come here for a minute.

244
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,681
How's Moscú?

245
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,001
- Steady.

246
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,801
- We still have a few hours left, don't we?

247
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,121
Shall we make 500 bills?

248
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,361
- The 500 notes are from Russians
and people with lousy taste.

249
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:25,521
I'm not Russian, do I seem to you
to have lousy taste?

250
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:27,841
- Berlín...
- I have dubious tastes...

251
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:29,881
- Berlín, should I print or not?

252
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:35,441
- 100 and 200.
- Torres!

253
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:38,081
Torres.

254
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:43,561
We stop machines, change plates
and start making

255
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,961
200 and 100 bills.
- In hand.

256
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:02,241
You like to jump from
stone to stone in puddles.

257
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:05,201
And at every step you take, a stone sinks.

258
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,961
You're leaving corpses on the verges.

259
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:16,481
Who came up with the armored car heist,

260
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,681
you or your boyfriend?

261
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:30,841
Well, now your boyfriend's a corpse.

262
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:33,601
And so is your mother.

263
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:39,841
I'm sure you were aware of the damage
you were doing to your mother.

264
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,481
I thought I'd never see you again.

265
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:22,241
What's the matter with you?
- He told me.

266
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,881
That I'm leaving corpses
wherever I'm going.

267
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,321
Berlín kicked me out and I went back in.

268
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,321
And I've put everyone's life in danger.

269
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,761
For fuck's sake I had to go back.

270
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,641
And now the body is Moscú.
- Moscú is no corpse, okay?

271
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:47,841
He's gonna be fine and we're all
gonna get out of here together.

272
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:48,961
together.

273
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:53,561
I'm a fucking black cat crossing paths.

274
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:56,361
You're a black panther.

275
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:58,401
My black panther.

276
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:26,641
How are you?
- Fucking right now.

277
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:29,721
You have no fucking idea
how much I love you,

278
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:31,721
no fucking idea.

279
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:33,401
I love you, too.

280
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,481
Let's start getting the money out of here!

281
00:26:54,641 --> 00:26:56,601
Come on, come on!

282
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,761
The ones in the other room, too!

283
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:08,041
Ariadna, Ariadna. Ariadna.

284
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:10,961
Not you, come.

285
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:13,721
Leave that there.

286
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:37,881
Denver.

287
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:40,561
Denver.

288
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:47,241
You have to stop, you have to stop,
this doesn't make any sense.

289
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:50,281
Leave the pickax.

290
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:53,041
Put your pickax down and
go convince your father.

291
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:55,481
He needs to be taken to the hospital,

292
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,961
can't wait any longer.
- There's only one way out

293
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:00,281
and it's through this tunnel.
And I'm going to do it with my father.

294
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:05,001
You know why, huh? Why?

295
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,921
Because when we get out of this,
you're not going to be dressed

296
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:14,601
in a red overalls, you're going
to be in white, gorgeous.

297
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,201
And I'll be waiting for you at an altar.

298
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,961
And I need my father to be there, by my side,

299
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:22,521
so he can see it, so he can grab my shoulder

300
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,321
and get excited, you know what I mean?

301
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:27,521
I'm not gonna stop, I'm not gonna stop.

302
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:31,041
- Well, we get to work?
- To work.

303
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:35,561
Shall we go?
- Let's go.

304
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,721
- There's not much left!
- There's nothing left, damn it!

305
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:44,001
- There's little left, Río, there's little left!
- Not two meters!

306
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:48,761
Have you thought about my proposal?

307
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,441
A short but passionate love story?

308
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,441
In a tropical country?

309
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,481
What about a fully-fledged inheritance?

310
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:08,041
800 million to be divided.

311
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:13,481
- That's the least of it, Berlín.

312
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,761
I like the idea of going away with you.

313
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,721
Although I'm very sorry,
because you're going to die.

314
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:33,161
- You're gonna be a beautiful widow.

315
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:41,961
You and I have
to get married, huh, Ariadna?

316
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:48,361
I've never made it in a white dress.

317
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:50,641
At night.

318
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:55,601
How about on a beach, under the stars,

319
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,921
by some wild rite with a lot of light

320
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:01,681
and a lot of fire?

321
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:06,161
Beautiful, huh?

322
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,321
Will you marry me, Ariadna?

323
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:21,681
Hey.

324
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,361
I'm sure there are people who think
that living with a dying man

325
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:32,321
it's boring. And they're wrong,
it's the opposite.

326
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,481
It's going to death.

327
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:45,721
Driving without a seat belt.

328
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,201
Riding a motorcycle without a helmet.

329
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:54,681
Diving without a bottle.

330
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:59,841
Releasing the reins definitively to a borderless.

331
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:05,721
And drink.

332
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:13,441
How do you see it, some little
Berlín kids running on the beach?

333
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,481
It's a joke.

334
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:40,081
So in that direction you've given us

335
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:42,041
is where Mr. Marquina is supposed to have

336
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:45,281
his center of operations,
in that cider factory, right?

337
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:46,601
- Yes.

338
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:50,481
What's this?
- It's a warehouse.

339
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,601
There's nothing in there.
A dilapidated car,

340
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:02,841
a lot of junk, but no sign
of an operations center.

341
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:10,561
- Are you sure about the address you gave us?

342
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:13,681
Oh, yes, I do. And I was there.

343
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,681
And what did you go to do?

344
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:24,641
Make love.

345
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:35,601
"Our first slogan was no names,

346
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,401
no personal relationships.

347
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,601
The Profesor had imagined
an affectionless heist,

348
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:45,921
but when I saw him there, smiling at me,

349
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:49,001
I realized He was the closest thing to a father.

350
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:50,681
I've ever had in all my life."

351
00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:53,641
What are you laughing at, big guy?

352
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:55,881
Of your witticisms.

353
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:01,561
Escape and return to the factory again.

354
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:02,921
You see.

355
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,881
Dressed as a cop and everything.
James Bond style.

356
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:10,721
Now that' s really fucked up the cops.

357
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,041
He's shaking.

358
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:19,401
Moscú, Moscú, eh.

359
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,321
Hey.

360
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:24,161
He's white as snow in Stalingrad.

361
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:26,001
His pulse is 35.

362
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:29,321
He needs a transfusion, get the plasma.

363
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:30,561
Moscú
- Let's go.

364
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,281
Zero negative.
- Hey, hey.

365
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:38,761
That's it, you're here again.

366
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,961
That's it, you all right?

367
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,761
That's it, you're here.

368
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:47,721
You're here, huh?

369
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,281
How's the tunnel going?

370
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:52,761
We're very close now.

371
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:07,441
Honey, honey. Baby.

372
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,841
Why don't you get some rest, huh?

373
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,441
Isn't it?

374
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:17,361
Let's go.

375
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,441
Dragan, downstairs.

376
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,521
Inspector.

377
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,041
I'm afraid the inspector can't speak to you,

378
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:28,921
is being investigated
for possible collaboration

379
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:31,401
in the robbery and for obstruction of justice.

380
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:34,441
But you know all that, don't you?
Because of the special trust

381
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:35,561
you have in her.

382
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:41,641
We know who you are, Salva.
Or rather, Sergio Marquina.

383
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:46,041
So you no longer need to use that GPS voice.

384
00:36:58,241 --> 00:36:59,401
Colonel Prieto.

385
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,281
We've got a man dying because of your gunshots.

386
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:10,361
If you don't get a doctor in here by now,
you'll have been convicted him.

387
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:13,481
The only one who's condemned that man is you.

388
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:17,241
Him and all the people whom you' re tearing apart

389
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,161
with this heist,
including your friend the inspector.

390
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:23,601
How can his conscience bear it?

391
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:27,281
Listen, if you want, afterwards,
we talk at length about

392
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,281
the health of my conscience and yours,

393
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,561
but now we need a doctor.

394
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:36,241
There's no more afterwards, Mr. Marquina,
we know you' re close.

395
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:39,321
And we know the position
of the three repeaters

396
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:42,401
who logged the calls you made to the inspector.

397
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,681
for the last five days.

398
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:48,961
We will search house by house.
And when you least expect it,

399
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,281
we'll knock at your door.

400
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:56,361
So stop complicating things
and turn yourself in.

401
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:03,201
As I said to the inspector,
surrender was never an option.

402
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:06,921
I'll wait for you.

403
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,641
Not everyone lets us into their homes,

404
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:21,881
There's a lot of people on their side,
they're the heroes of TV

405
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,601
and we, the guys who want
to put them behind bars.

406
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,961
- Call Judge Andrade and get a warrant.

407
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,361
- We can't break down the door to 10 000 homes,

408
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:32,721
we're talking about a radius of 850 meters,
that's what the repeaters cover.

409
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:35,921
We have to be more precise.
- All right, we'll be more precise.

410
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:39,281
But call Judge Andrade and get a warrant.

411
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,641
- I see you have everything under control,

412
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,641
so I don't quite understand
what I'm doing here.

413
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:46,601
Am I under arrest?
No, inspector, you' re not under arrest,

414
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,881
you' re being investigated.

415
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,521
- All right, then I'm off.
- Inspector.

416
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:54,081
Before you leave,
I need you to hand over

417
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:55,201
your badge and your gun.

418
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:06,641
- And now you can bug my phone if you want.

419
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,201
Wait, wait.

420
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,681
You go ahead, I'll go get you new overalls.

421
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:26,801
Hi.

422
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:01,321
Ari.

423
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,721
Why did you sabotage the escape plan?

424
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:12,681
Because of Denver?

425
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:19,401
Is that why you hit Arturo,
because you have something with him?

426
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:23,961
Mónica, did he rape you?
- No.

427
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:33,601
Why are you with him?

428
00:40:35,761 --> 00:40:36,961
Because I love him.

429
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:43,601
Because I love him,
I know it may sound absurd,

430
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,921
that maybe you think it's crazy,
but... But it's real.

431
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:49,921
It's real, Ari.

432
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:52,601
It's the first time anyone's ever

433
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,521
looked me in the eye and been honest.

434
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,001
He really loves me.

435
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:04,321
What about you?

436
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:07,201
Are you with Berlín?

437
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:17,641
Pure survival.

438
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,841
I thought he was killing people.

439
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:28,521
That they'd killed you, too.

440
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,401
I thought it was the only way to save me.

441
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:40,201
I hate Berlín, I hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

442
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,921
And now the asshole thinks
I have feelings for him,

443
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:45,041
that we're living a love story.

444
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:47,681
He wants me to marry him
when we get out of here,

445
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,361
to take care of him. He is sick.
- I know.

446
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:54,521
And you're gonna do it?

447
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,361
It'll only be a year,
I don't know, we'll...

448
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:02,601
Travel around the world, living like kings.

449
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:07,681
And going to fancy places and that's it.

450
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,041
There are thousands of people
who accept proposals like this on a daily basis.

451
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:14,201
Ari.

452
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:16,921
But is it worth it?

453
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,441
I'm gonna take all his money.

454
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:25,681
This guy fucked up my life, Mónica,
he fucked up my life.

455
00:42:25,841 --> 00:42:29,321
I take four tranquilizers a day
so I can withstand his presence.

456
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,281
He raped me, he raped me.

457
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,201
When he will be by my side
and can no longer move

458
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:39,441
and depend only on me,
I will tell him what a son of a bitch he is

459
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,001
and all the damage he's done to me.

460
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:10,521
The calls made by the suspect

461
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:12,721
the last five days have been recorded

462
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,961
by these three repeaters
located here, here and here.

463
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:19,041
Except for the one he did
from the police station in Canillas.

464
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:22,321
- You were right,
it's a very wide radius.

465
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:25,281
Gómez, ask the Telecommunications Department

466
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:27,801
to triangulate the signal
to delimit the area of action

467
00:43:27,961 --> 00:43:28,921
of the suspect.

468
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:32,401
- Everything would be easier if Ángel was here.

469
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:35,761
- He's the only one who knows
the exact location of the hideout.

470
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:12,241
"The inspector was on the edge of the abyss,

471
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,361
doing a balancing act to avoid going to the hole

472
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:17,641
definitely, thinking about
how ridiculous and absurd

473
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:21,881
was to switch from inspector
to suspect in a couple of minutes.

474
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,481
And she decided to do what his mother
had told her so many times:

475
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:45,521
to run after the bad guys.

476
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:05,841
Raquel had smelled a trace.
And in the absence of a sub-inspector

477
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:09,241
with whom conduct the investigation,
she opted for another kind of help."

478
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:12,401
Look at Paula's markers, with the bitten caps,

479
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:14,561
like you did.
- Thanks, Mom. Give it to me.

480
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:19,481
Let's see, the day of our first date
I arrived 25 minutes early.

481
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:23,521
I called him, he told me
he was leaving at that moment.

482
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:24,641
See you now.

483
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:28,321
We meet here, at the Hanoi.

484
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,441
He came on foot and it didn't take him
more than five or seven minutes.

485
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:34,961
Too bad, for one that didn't turn out crooked.

486
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:37,241
And what good is it to know
how long it took him to get here?

487
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,921
- To find how many meters
he was from the cafeteria.

488
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:45,201
In that time he could only travel, at most,

489
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:46,361
500 meters.

490
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,441
More or less...

491
00:45:52,641 --> 00:45:55,081
The place where he's hiding
is inside this area,

492
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:57,081
he had to pass through one of these streets

493
00:45:57,241 --> 00:45:59,201
to get to the cafeteria. And I'm sure

494
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:02,361
that some security camera
recorded it. I have to delimit,

495
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:03,481
Give me another one.

496
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:10,401
I'm going to seize
the surveillance footage from that area

497
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,281
to try to reconstruct his route.

498
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:16,121
Are you sure what you're doing?

499
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:20,961
Mom, I'm gonna find that man no matter what.

500
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,601
Be careful, daughter.

501
00:46:53,321 --> 00:46:55,961
We've got a very badly wounded,
with three bullet impacts in his abdomen

502
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:58,121
and he' s been like that for hours.

503
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,121
Where is he?
- It will take me a while to get him out,

504
00:47:00,281 --> 00:47:02,681
I don't know exactly how long.
And listen to me,

505
00:47:03,561 --> 00:47:05,561
I've got the police tracking me down.

506
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:08,961
Is it safe for them?

507
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:11,721
They already know and agree with their part.

508
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:13,961
Yours would be ten million.

509
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:19,001
I need a box of abdominal laparotomy,

510
00:47:19,161 --> 00:47:22,241
volumetric respirator and surgical equipment.

511
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:25,681
Can you get it?
- I'll take care of it.

512
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:51,881
Good morning, sir. Inspector Murillo.
I need the recordings

513
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,961
from the security camera out there,

514
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,481
those of October 23rd.

515
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:03,361
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

516
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:05,161
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

517
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:19,601
Thank you.

518
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,761
Have you figured anything out yet?

519
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:54,761
I'm starting to draw the route
he came to the cafeteria by.

520
00:49:56,441 --> 00:50:00,721
Look, that segments the area in this triangle.

521
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,521
If he came to Hanoi through here,

522
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:06,681
means his lair is very close, in this area.

523
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:08,961
I gotta get back out there, Mom.

524
00:50:14,441 --> 00:50:17,081
The bulk of the calls
have been made in this area,

525
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:19,481
so he had to move through these streets.

526
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,321
I want you to seize the security camera tapes

527
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:24,521
in this área. Get a warrant from the judge.

528
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:47,881
I told the kid.

529
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:53,081
What's that?

530
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:56,201
What I did to you.

531
00:50:58,961 --> 00:51:02,281
That I abandoned you
in that Martorell roundabout.

532
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:05,961
I went back to that roundabout.

533
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:11,961
because I dreamt you were cleaning windshields

534
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:13,401
at that stoplight.

535
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:19,121
I took the car and drove.

536
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,561
Hours and hours.

537
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,961
Because I wanted to fix my mistake.

538
00:51:29,561 --> 00:51:31,841
Don't talk, rest.

539
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:36,281
I showed your picture to everyone passing by.

540
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:45,441
And now your son

541
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:49,961
he told me he hates me.

542
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:57,921
Your son adores you.

543
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,441
It doesn't matter what he says,

544
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,081
I know he doesn't hate you.

545
00:52:07,361 --> 00:52:08,401
I deserve it.

546
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:13,281
I took his mother away from him.
- No.

547
00:52:15,641 --> 00:52:16,961
No, you did very well.

548
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:21,401
You have a wonderful son.

549
00:52:24,401 --> 00:52:27,481
Strong, noble...

550
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:34,121
And if so, it's because of you.

551
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:37,721
I did what I could, honey.

552
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:42,721
He comes out a little reckless.

553
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:55,161
I've never been happier

554
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,601
like the day I met you.

555
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:05,481
If I have to go somewhere now,

556
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:11,921
I'd like you to go there, to the village party.

557
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:19,401
And dance with you, together.

558
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:25,801
With the moon, under the coloured lights.

559
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,241
I love you.

560
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:33,201
Forgive me.

561
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,681
Forgive me.

562
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:57,761
I'm sorry.

563
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:00,721
I... I'm sorry.

564
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:04,481
I'm sorry...

565
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:13,201
Very much.

566
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:28,401
<i>Father, I come bleeding</i>

567
00:54:29,121 --> 00:54:32,081
<i>from the ports of Cabra.</i>

568
00:54:32,481 --> 00:54:35,321
<i>If I could, young boy,</i>

569
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:38,641
<i>I'd help you fix that trade.</i>

570
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:59,121
<i>Green, how I want you green,</i>

571
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:02,681
<i>green wind, green branches.</i>

572
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:07,241
<i>Green, how I want you green,</i>

573
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:12,361
<i>green wind, green branches.</i>

574
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:17,401
<i>300 dark brown roses</i>

575
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:21,081
<i>Your white shirt has grown.</i>

576
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:24,521
<i>Your blood oozes and flees</i>

577
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:28,681
<i>around the corners of your sash.</i>

578
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:36,281
<i>The two friends climbed up.</i>

579
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:40,241
<i>up to the high balconies</i>

580
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:43,561
<i>leaving a trail of blood.</i>

581
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:47,881
<i>Leaving a trail of teardrops.</i>

582
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:05,801
<i>But who will come? And from where?</i>

583
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:09,441
<i>Where's that bitter little girl?</i>

584
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,521
<i>How many times she waited for you!</i>

585
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:16,401
<i>How many times would she wait for you,</i>

586
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:20,801
<i>Green, how I want you green,</i>

587
00:56:21,241 --> 00:56:24,681
<i>Big hoarfrost stars</i>

588
00:56:24,921 --> 00:56:27,681
<i>come with the fish of shadow</i>

589

00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:35,121
<i>Green, how I want you green,</i>

591
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:38,641
<i>green wind, green branches.</i>

592
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:41,921
<i>They come with the shadow fish</i>

593
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:45,121
<i>that opens the way to dawn.</i>

594
00:56:45,561 --> 00:56:48,881
<i>come with the fish of shadow</i>

595
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:52,281
<i>that opens the road of dawn.</i>

596
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:05,361
Hey, hey, hey.

597
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:08,961
What are you doing?
- Listen.

598
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:19,041
Can you hear it?

599
00:57:20,361 --> 00:57:21,761
- That's them.
- It's them.

600
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:24,201
- How much further do you think it is?
- 30 or 40 cm.

601
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,241
I'm telling you.
- Come on, throw it.

602
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,041
Profesor!

603
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:53,921
They're here, they're here.

604
00:57:55,001 --> 00:57:57,561
Hey! They're here.

605
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:03,601
It's them, for fuck's sake!
- Come on, the last one, the last one!

606
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:05,281
Profesor!

607
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:01,961
Daughter, the ink will go through the wall.

608
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:04,681
Mom, where are your car keys?

609
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,921
Daughter, that car hasn't been started in a long time.

610
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:10,201
Well, it's about time we took it for a spin.

611
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:36,921
Profesor, eh!
- Hey, excuse me.

612
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:44,721
Denver, Denver.
- What is it, Mónica?

613
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,401
Tell my father to hold on, we're almost there,

614
00:59:47,561 --> 00:59:49,321
we're almost there.
- Up you go.

615
00:59:49,481 --> 00:59:53,721
What? Mónica, I'm not going up there now.
- Listen to me, Denver, Denver.

616
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,201
What?
- Go upstairs.

617
00:59:58,321 --> 00:59:59,321
You have to go up now.

618
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:07,241
I'm not going up there now.

619
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,521
Denver, stop, stop.
- I'm not going up there now!

620
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:15,201
No.

621
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:21,281
It's very close, Mónica.
- Listen, you have to go up now.

622
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:26,321
Do you hear me? Look at me,
if you don't come up now, you'll regret it

623
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:28,601
the rest of your life. Get in.

624
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:32,841
Get in, come on.

625
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:36,281
Hey! Come on.

626
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:39,041
Let's go.

627
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:53,801
Let's go, let's go!

628
01:01:29,441 --> 01:01:30,641
I'm here, Dad.

629
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:36,441
You just have to hold on a little longer,
because we're gonna make it.

630
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,681
Isn't that right, Río?
We were digging like crazy.

631
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,761
You can hear the Serbs next door.

632
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:44,841
- You take it easy.

633
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:48,161
- Oh, Dad.

634
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,201
What...

635
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:56,001
That thing I told you I hated you...

636
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:01,841
I don't get that from you.

637
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:05,121
I don't get to hate you, okay?

638
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:11,361
You did what you had to do with Mom.

639
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,681
And me, hating you, it doesn't work for me.

640
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:27,161
- Mónica.
- What?

641
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:31,041
I'll give you 300 million if you keep it.

642
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:34,401
This guy's a dead loss.

643
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:38,521
I brought him to you here.

644
01:02:41,561 --> 01:02:44,201
Now I'm going on vacation.
- Of course I will.

645
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:46,401
Take care of her.

646
01:02:55,041 --> 01:02:56,041
Gentlemen.

647
01:02:59,561 --> 01:03:00,841
I haven't introduced myself.

648
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:06,921
Agustín Ramos.

649
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:11,561
It's been a pleasure.

650
01:03:24,521 --> 01:03:25,681
I love you.

651
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:31,641
- I love you too, Dad. Very much so.

652
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:36,441
And I'm not gonna let you go.
Río, bring all the fucking explosives

653
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:38,921
that we have left,
I'm going to blow that tunnel anyway.

654
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:41,001
- No.

655
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:45,761
If you blow up the tunnel, you bury them all.

656
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:48,641
- Oh, Dad.

657
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,321
- We've got to move on.

658
01:03:55,161 --> 01:03:58,401
And remember, no mirrors.

659
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,161
All right.

660
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:04,481
All right.

661
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:08,401
But I don't know if I could.
- I love you.

662
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:14,961
I love you, too.

663
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:17,761
I love you, too.

664
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:31,041
<i>For the lack of your lips</i>

665
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:36,201
<i>I cried for the first time.</i>

666
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:40,441
<i>And I cursed to know you</i>

667
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:44,881
<i>for not stopping loving you.</i>

668
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:50,441
<i>I wanted to make you my wife,</i>

669
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,401
<i>Without love I wasn't going to stay.</i>

670
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:56,601
<i>I was pulling a gun</i>

671
01:04:57,201 --> 01:05:00,481
<i>and fate brought death.</i>

672
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:10,081
<i>Mary, my life, my love,</i>

673
01:05:11,001 --> 01:05:14,561
<i>I promised I'd come back,</i>

674
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:18,601
<i>But I won't come back,</i>

675
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:23,161
<i>I got caught by the police.</i>

676
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:26,841
<i>Mary, my life, my love,</i>

677
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:30,961
<i>I won't stop loving you,</i>

678
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,761
<i>I shot you down,</i>

679
01:05:35,761 --> 01:05:39,561
<i>You'll never see me again</i>

680
01:06:50,001 --> 01:06:51,841
Our Father who art in heaven,

681
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:55,321
hallowed be thy name.

682
01:06:56,481 --> 01:06:58,681
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

683
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:02,561
Forgive us our trespasses, just as we forgive.

684
01:07:02,721 --> 01:07:03,921
those who trespass against us.

685
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,321
Lead us not into temptation

686
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:10,401
and deliver us from evil.
Amen.

687
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:17,081
The only instruction is there's no order

688
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,881
for any of those motherfuckers to get out alive.

689
01:07:19,121 --> 01:07:21,801
Get everyone to transport the money,
we've got to get out now.

690
01:07:23,841 --> 01:07:25,841
Going in is going to a slaughter and you know it.

691
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,081
If they go into the tunnel, we're all dead.

692
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:30,681
Unit, ready?
- Yes, sir!

693
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,761
The prosecution has issued an arrest warrant

694
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:35,441
against Inspector Murillo, from now on

695
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:36,641
she is in search and arrest.

696
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:41,081
You were in the hideout of that guy, the Profesor.

697
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:42,201
Tell us the address.

698
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:47,961
I need to know your name.

699
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:52,921
I hate you! I hate you!

700
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:57,921
Son of a bitch, you son of a bitch, you fucking bastard.

701
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,321
Take cover!

702
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,601
They're in the basement.

703
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:10,561
We got them in a mousetrap they can't get out of.

704
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:12,921
Let's go now. Now!

705
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:15,201
Now!

706
01:08:19,441 --> 01:08:20,401
Aah!

707
01:08:20,921 --> 01:08:22,441
Hands up, where I can see them!

708
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,801
Come on, come on!

709
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:36,521
Tokio!
