Yeah, not so fun there.

325
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,640
No, it's dark and it's cold.

326
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,268
-And you're so alone.
-OFFICER: Sir?

327
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,188
-You're so...
-Sir?

328
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,315
...goddamn fucking alone.

329
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,649
(indistinct radio chatter)

330
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,906
(keys jingling)

331
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,910
Swim free, little fish.

332
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,203
You made bail.

333
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,206
(squishing)

334
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,083
(laughter)

335
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,464
(laughter continues)

336
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,508
Hey, man.

337
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,967
Want a Fresca?

338
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,763
Thanks.

339
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,348
Hey, I know you.

340
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:21,893
Yeah, you're, uh, Raven...
Ravenwing.

341
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,688
It's Eagle. Eagle the Archer.
Out of Cleveland?

342
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,690
We met, like, five times
at Vought-Con.

343
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,902
I mean-- mm.
No, that doesn't matter.

344
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,779
You bailed me out?

345
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,240
-Yeah.
-Why?

346
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,867
Because even heroes need
a hand once in a while.

347
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,118
Come on.

348
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,832
The Translucent franchise,

349
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,960
especially Invisible Force 2,
is...

350
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,462
Please.

351
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,881
My baby needs a mother.

352
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,969
Oi! Shut your trap,
you dumb bird,

353
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,472
or else I'll bollocks you.

354
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,809
But that's exactly what
William Butcher did.

355
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,104
He murdered Vought Vice
President Madelyn Stillwell

356
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,858
using upwards of 30 pounds
of C-4.

357
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,568
Why would William Butcher
do it?

358
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,946
Disgruntled, perhaps,
over his deceased wife,

359
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,489
a former Vought employee.

360
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:21,411
And why was Madelyn Stillwell's
baby found safe in a yard

361
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,204
17 miles away?

362
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,623
It is a puzzle.

363
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,126
Where is Monsieur Charcuter?

364
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,588
-Why hasn't he called?
-Who cares?

365
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,881
He could be dead.

366
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,173
(chuckles):
No. No.

367
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,675
He's too much of an asshole
to die.

368
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,219
-(shushing)
-...or any of his known
associates--

369
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,306
Marvin Milk, Hugh Campbell,
or this man,

370
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,266
whose real identity
is unknown--

371
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,854
please call 1-888-0-CRIMES.

372
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,314
Christ.

373
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,691
(sighs)

374
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,736
We gotta get out of here, now.

375
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,405
Good passports do not
come cheap.

376
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,616
I sell the RPGs,
smuggle in the Kalashnikovs.

377
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,784
We have enough money.
That's it.

378
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,373
-Where will you go,
Petit Hughie?
-Could just stay here.

379
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,417
With Frenchie's gangbanger
friends.

380
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,544
The cots, they got 31 flavors
of semen on them.

381
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:12,629
You'll love 'em.

382
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,506
Oh, and you have a better idea?

383
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,634
No, maybe we can stay,
all of us,

384
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,801
in your mother's asshole.

385
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,472
Or... maybe we could not run.

386
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,933
FRENCHIE:
You are like a record
that is broken.

387
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,352
Well, we shouldn't just give up.

388
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,270
Guys, we get some Compound V,

389
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,980
we-we bring it to
The New York Times,

390
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,315
we burn Vought to the ground.

391
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,775
MOTHER'S MILK:
You got some V, Hughie?

392
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,235
-'Cause I don't.
-We could...

393
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:39,197
get some.
Someone could help us get it.

394
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
And who might that be?

395
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,827
FRENCHIE:
You did not hear the television?

396
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,746
We are famous now.

397
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,247
-Butcher even more so.
-Fuck Butcher!

398
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,499
We don't need him.

399
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,000
A-Team had Hannibal.

400
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,002
Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin.

401
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,879
Beatles, Brian Epstein.

402
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,381
We don't need Butcher.

403
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,718
FRENCHIE:
Okay, who's going to
be our captain? You?

404
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,680
I mean, guys, just-just-just
hear me out.

405
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,016
Shut the fuck up!

406
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,647
This is over.

407
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,616
(door closes)

408
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,349
(sighs)

409
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,565
(door closes in distance)

410
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,217
(pulsing)

411
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,026
(exhales sharply)

412
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:01,923
Homelander, hi.

413
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,466
-(bottle drops)
-Ashley.

414
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,093
(clears throat)

415
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,471
Glad to see you're, uh,
making yourself at home.

416
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:11,307
Yeah.
(chuckles)

417
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,392
Renovation is definitely
overdue.

418
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,062
It's like 2003 called,
they want their office back.

419
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,271
You know?

420
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,565
Huh. I liked it.

421
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,776
Yeah, me, too.
It was really great.

422
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,654
Homelander, I just want
to thank you again

423
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,823
for recommending me
for this job.

424
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:31,744
I was so surprised
to get the call.

425
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:34,956
I am gonna fill
Ms. Stillwell's shoes

426
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,791
as best I can.

427
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,628
God rest her soul.

428
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,754
Yeah.

429
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,966
God rest it. Yeah.

430
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,096
Any luck catching her killer,
that Butcher maniac?

431
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,268
No, not yet.

432
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,312
But we will.

433
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,856
Oh, good news.

434
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,482
I think I found a hero.

435
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:05,236
Perfect candidate
to replace Translucent.

436
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,363
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

437
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:08,823
So soon?

438
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,158
He's in the gym right now.

439
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,284
You want to meet him?

440
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,286
Do I?
(chuckles)

441
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,204
Lead the way.

442
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,749
♪ ♪

443
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,501
(grunting)

444
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,009
That's Blindspot, right?

445
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,761
A differently abled
member of The Seven.

446
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,308
We're gonna poll through
the roof with millennials.

447
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,311
Inclusion's a big priority
to them right now.

448
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,896
-HOMELANDER: Amazing.
-And then I think we find

449
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,731
an ethnic or female
or, fingers crossed,

450
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,608
an ethnic female
to replace the Deep,

451
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,859
and we're golden.

452
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,865
(laughs)

453
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,910
Homelander, wow, you're...

454
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,870
It's-it's an honor, sir.

455
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,206
Wait. Hold on.

456
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,499
-You can tell it's me?
-Mm-hmm.

457
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,585
(laughs)
Wow.

458
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,171
That's-that's impressive.

459
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,381
You don't need super eyes
when you have super ears.

460
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,635
Can I just say, that is amazing.

461
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,763
And you, my friend,
are a true hero.

462
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,640
Not because of what you do
for a job,

463
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,850
but... (sighs)

464
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,393
well, because of what
you've overcome.

465
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,978
Thank you.

466
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,314
That means everything
coming from you.

467
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,691
Aw, stop it. Come on.

468
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,027
Hey, guys, um,

469
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,863
-I just have one question,
if that's okay.
-Yeah.

470
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,531
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

471
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,410
All right, so...

472
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,412
what happens if, uh,

473
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,289
I don't know, I do this?

474
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,041
-(high-pitched ringing)
-(shouting)

475
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,753
(screaming)

476
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,216
And now you're just another
useless fuckin' blind guy.

477
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,135
(screaming continues)

478
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,596
This must be some kind
of a joke.

479
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,348
Ashley...

480
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,686
What made you think I would ever
allow a cripple into The Seven?

481
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,814
For fuck sakes, Ashley,
don't look at him, look at me!

482
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,315
(Blindspot groaning)

483
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:09,568
Ashley! Look at me.

484
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,989
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Let's get one thing straight.

485
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,075
The only reason you're here
and not doing corporate PR

486
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,994
for fucking Diva Cups

487
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,787
is that I brought you here.

488
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,957
You are dispensable,
which means you answer to me.

489
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,375
Okay. Okay.

490
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,463
From now on,
I will set my own agenda,

491
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,881
I'll approve my own marketing

492
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,925
and write my own talking points.

493
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,012
You will tell me everything
that goes on

494
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:39,098
on the 99th floor,
and I mean everything.

495
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,850
Every call, e-mail, group chat.

496
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,562
If a fucking light bulb
goes out, you will tell me.

497
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,483
And, Ashley, in no fucking way

498
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,612
do you decide
who goes in The Seven.

499
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,824
I decide.

500
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,493
Do we have an understanding?

501
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,245
Yes.

-ANNOUNCER: Translucent was
laid to rest today,

503

surrounded by his family,
friends, fans

504

ANNOUNCER 2:

this arrest.

512
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,232
America's hottest crime-fighter
is giving law enforcement

513
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,402
a superpowered makeover
in Citizen Starlight.

514
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,112
Coming this fall from Vought.

You know how it is.

Don't want to get stuck

Okay.

524
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,545
So, what's your poison?

525
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,213
You a leg guy?

526
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:38,968
Uh, d-- a-an arm,

Holy shit! Holy shit!

Thank you. That was so...

I-I can keep the arm, right?

538
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,782
Yeah, just keep it refrigerated.

539
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:52,166
For an extra grand,
I'll let you chop off my dick.

Holy shit. Sit him down.

Shit.

00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,632
Listen, he's broken
every single bone in his arm.

552
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,509
Broken half his ribs.
I can't do nothing here.

553
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:44,927
You got to take him
to the hospital.

-Hospital...

Translate for me, Frenchie.

556
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,806
Tell him to take him
to the hospital.

FRENCHIE:
They promised me.

They would only smuggle in guns

FRENCHIE:
Supe Terrorist.

How about this one?

How does it make you feel?
Anyone?

583
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,528
-I hate it.
-That's a strong reaction,
Margaret.

584
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,155
I'd love to follow up on that.

585
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,656
What do you mean
when you say you hate

586
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,116
the term "Super Terrorist"?

587
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,076
I just mean, it's really scary.

588
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,494
It makes me want
to lock the door

589
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,037
and hide under the bed,
you know?

590
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,539
Which means a double-digit drop

HOMELANDER:
I keep saying

593
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,503
"Super Villain"
is the better term.

594
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,006
MARGARET:
Uh, "Super Criminals" sounds
like something in a cartoon.

595
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,842
Jill, ask them what they think
about "Super Villain."

596
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,344
Uh, what about the term
"Super Villain"?

597
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,514
That sounds better to me.
More exciting.

598
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,392
-More exotic.
-JILL: Okay.

599
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,564
JILL:
Okay, turning our attention
back to these,

600
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,608
which do you prefer?

601
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,652
"Saving America,"
can I get a show of hands?

602
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,281
Okay. How about
"Saving the World"? Wow.

603
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,950
Unanimous, strong reaction.
So what is it about...

604
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:40,078
Nope. It's "Saving America."

605
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,706
Uh...

606
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:46,001
I-I don't know. I-I feel like
"Saving the World" has a...

607
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,338
JILL:
Okay. But is there
something specific

608
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,548
about "Saving the World"
that "Saving America..."

609
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,259
It's Americans that are gonna
keep us in the Army,

610
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,512
not the fucking world.

611
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,514
It's "Saving America."

612
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,933
Mm-hmm?

613
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,893
-Pull the trigger.
-(pats back)

614
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,187
Great. Great.

-No need to apologize.

621
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,345
Okay.

622
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,805
Oh, shit.

00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,598
-You scared me.
-EAGLE: Oh, that's just Carol.

624
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,600
Good friend.

625
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,604
Carol, this is the Deep.

626
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,274
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Deep.

627
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,526
Would you like a Fresca?

628
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:55,988
Thank you.

629
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,118
Anyway, no need to apologize.

630
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,453
We've all been there.
It's tough.

631
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,123
(grunts)

632
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,375
-Been where?
-Rock bottom.

633
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,752
I...
(sighs)

634
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,838
I don't think
I'm at rock bottom.

635
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,382
EAGLE:
Uh, f-for me,

636
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:20,220
my aha moment came with
a hostage situation at Kroger.

637
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,264
Multiple shooters.

638
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:27,769
I showed up, I'm letting
arrows fly, my aim is perfect.

639
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,813
But...

640
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:37,029
...there's only so many arrows
a quiver can hold.

641
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,865
I just ran out.

642
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:45,329
And then, we lost
a lot of good people that day.

643
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,457
Then you start to question,

644
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:52,711
like, fucking arrows
against TEC-9s?

645
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:56,548
-But?
-But I came to see

646
00:36:56,590 --> 00:37:00,802
that archery isn't irrelevant,
it's timeless.

647
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:05,432
It's a pure and ancient art.

648
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,643
Carol helped me see that.

649
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,645
And what are you, his therapist

650
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,356
-or something?
-(laughs): No.

651
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,193
No, therapy's
very destructive, actually.

652
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,362
You could say I'm his teacher.

653
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,156
What about you, Deep?

654
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,492
What-what about, what about me?

655
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,285
How did you end up here?

656
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,747
You can tell her, Deep.

657
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,918
(chuckles):
Tell her what?

658
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,544
About your drinking.

659
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,755
About your self-esteem issues.

660
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:39,174
-Really open up, Deep.
-No, I don't...

661
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,801
I don't have a drinking...
(laughs softly)

662
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,761
-I'm fine.
-This is a safe space, Deep.

663
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,722
CAROL:
If you don't have
any self-esteem issues,

664
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,933
why are you constantly
demeaning women?

665
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,352
-That's a good question, Deep.
-Okay, thank you.

666
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,979
You know what? I don't know
what the fuck this is,

667
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,272
but it's weird as fuck,
so I'm leaving.

668
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,108
W-We just want to help.

669
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,902
-Carol really helped me, Deep.
-No, thank you.

670
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:01,571
Help you get back
into The Seven.

671
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,800
NEWS ANCHOR:
Yesterday, the Deep was found
drunkenly ranting at children

672
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,803
at Splash Zone
in Sandusky, Ohio.

673
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,431
He was later arrested
and taken to Sandusky...

674
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,933
(speaks French)

675
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,353
...he was released on bail
shortly after.

676
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,813
Did you make this?

677
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,993
You wrote something.

678
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,372
"Boy."

679
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,207
What boy?

680
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,210
I do not understand. What boy?

681
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,844
(huffs)

682
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,263
Okay, so?

683
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,891
They were wired the money
from a blind account

684
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,768
to smuggle the bastard in.

685
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,269
Cold trail.

686
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,937
Amazing fucking friends
of yours.

687
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,231
I never said they were
my friends, huh?

688
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,317
I only said we will be...

689
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,028
safe here.

690
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,654
Okay, okay, all right.
What do we do?

691
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,282
Oh, you just call 911.

692
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,992
What, an anonymous tip?

693
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,827
Yeah, I'm sure that'll go
straight to the mayor.

694
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,496
You saw that video.

695
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,747
What if he does that
to-to an airplane?

696
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,499
Or the fucking Brooklyn Bridge?

697
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,418
So, what's your big plan,
Hughie?

698
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,254
Okay, the CIA lady, right?

699
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,589
Rayner.

700
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,342
Right, the same CIA

701
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,511
that wants to clamp our nuts

702
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,096
into some jumper cables.

703
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,098
We could call Butcher.

704
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,974
For the last time,
we don't need Butcher.

705
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,851
Then what?

706
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,980
We should...

707
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,024
call Annie.

708
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,026
(chuckles)

709
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,487
"Call Annie."

710
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,825
Annie?

711
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,577
Yeah.

712
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,580
You mean Starlight?

713
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,085
'Cause that's who she is.

714
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:24,297
Vought has her phone
so bugged...

715
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,675
they're praying
that you do that.

716
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,389
Oh, no.

717
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,974
You fucking called her?

718
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,810
No, no. I'm not,
I'm not stupid, okay?

719
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,481
-I texted her.
-Oh, fuck.

720
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,859
And then we met up, but we're
getting some Compound V.

721
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,403
-Fuck you, Hughie!
Are you fucking crazy?
-M.M., easy!

722
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,863
-Are you fucking crazy?!
-We were careful!

723
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,030
-What the fuck are you doing?!
-We used burner...

724
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,158
-We used burner phones.
-Kid, you don't get it!

725
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,659
They could've been
following you.

726
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,745
They could be watching us
right fucking now!

727
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,708
If you're the fucking reason

728
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,501
why I can't finish

729
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,336
that Vermont country dollhouse,

730
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,880
I will fucking end you.

731
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,339
You've been walking
around for days

732
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,008
like you want to kick my ass,

733
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,260
so do it already.

734
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,058
Goddamn it.

735
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,561
(sighing)

736
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,979
Shit!

737
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,902
I don't want to kick
your ass, Hughie.

738
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:30,530
I just don't want to get dragged
back into this shit, all right?

739
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,325
I want to get home to my wife

740
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,160
and my kid.

741
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,245
That's it.

742
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,707
If I still can.

743
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,375
This guy could kill
a lot of people.

744
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,337
Hughie... let somebody else
handle it, okay?

745
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,463
There's no one else!

746
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,797
No one's coming to save us.

747
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,090
You don't get it.

748
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,343
You are not a soldier.

749
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,137
You're not a spy.

750
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,723
You're just a kid that
sells stereo equipment.

751
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,016
No, I don't!

752
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:01,228
I don't have a job.

753
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,149
Or Robin.

754
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,776
Or my dad.

755
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,654
Or Annie.

756
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,240
One way or another,
they all, uh...

757
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,663
Now all I have is this.

758
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,748
This.

759
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,251
Which is really fucking
depressing, but it's true.

760
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,382
So, maybe I can't be Lee Marvin.

761
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,134
But I can be Harry Potter.

762
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,638
Or, uh... you know, John Connor

763
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,766
or-or-or what's her name
from The Hunger Games.

764
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:40,892
Katniss.

765
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,729
Yeah, the point is
I could be the person

766
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,731
that nobody thinks is awesome,

767
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:49,776
but it turns out they're
kind of fucking awesome.

768
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,738
M.M.

769
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,198
Listen, we help the CIA lady,

770
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,034
she could help you maybe
get back to your family.

771
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,578
Did you ever think of that?

772
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,375
(sighs)

773
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,876
My baby needs a mother!

774
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,463
Oi! Shut your trap,
you dumb bird...

775
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,758
or else I'll bollocks you.

776
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,887
MAN (on TV):
But that's exactly
what William Butcher did.

777
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,891
Gecko?

778
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,685
Is that you?

779
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,145
Starlight?

780
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,439
I mean, Annie, hi.

781
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,482
-Hi.
-Oh, my God, hi!

782
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,528
Look at you,
big-time Seven hero.

783
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,738
Oh, shut up.

784
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,323
You know, I-I work
in Vought Tower

785
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,908
at the, uh, labs on-on 67?

786
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,577
Oh, you don't say?

787
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,995
I see your posters everywhere.

788
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,580
They're marketing
the shit out of you.

789
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,831
(scoffs)

790
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:48,001
I'm happy for you, really.

791
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,420
Buy you some coffee?

792
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,672
(laughs) Thank you.

793
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,216
Yeah, at the, uh, Capes for
Christ Bible Camp, yes, totally.

794
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,052
Mm-hmm, that Passion play
we put on?

795
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,678
You were the best Jesus.

796
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,679
I mean, no one's gonna take

797
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,056
a nail through the hand
like I can.

798
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,475
And Big Game was Pontius Pilate.

799
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,311
Oh, my God, those freckles.

800
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,937
You know he wanted
to make out with me?

801
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,898
-Pontius Pilate
and Mary hooking up?
-Mm-hmm.

802
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:10,940
Ooh, "sacri-licious."

803
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,192
Yeah, we never did.

804
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,610
Why not?

805
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,612
-He was so cute.
-Yeah, it just,

806
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,113
it was what Ezekiel always said.

807
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,448
And my mom, too.

808
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,033
That God is watching over you,

809
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,077
every second.

810
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,079
You know, I thought
that He was watching us,

811
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,539
and I thought
that He'd be upset.

812
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,166
Yeah, it's a,
it's a messed up thing

813
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,667
-to tell a kid.
-Yeah.

814
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,836
But looking back?

815
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,506
I should've made out
with Big Game.

816
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,966
I should've done
a lot more stuff.

817
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,510
Because...

818
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,929
there is nothing

819
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,931
up there.

820
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,559
There's nobody in the sky
watching over us.

821
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:51,231
Not God, not Homelander.

822
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,442
Not anybody.

823
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,696
It's all just...

824
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,865
lies.

825
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,044
I need a favor.

826
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,504
Yeah.

827
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,173
Yeah, anything
for a Bible Camp alum.

828
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,346
(clears throat, smacks lips)

829
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,515
I need you to go
into the labs on 67,

830
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:28,226
and steal me
a sample of Compound V.

831
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,356
Um...

832
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,024
I, uh...

833
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,609
I don't,
I don't know what that is.

834
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,319
Ah, see?

835
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:42,073
Another lie.

836
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,284
I know how we're made.

837
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,744
And it is not Jesus.

838
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,956
I can't.

839
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,040
I mean, it's impossible.

840
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,125
I'm a nobody there.

841
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,585
I'm a lab rat.

842
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,211
They cut off my limbs
and they grow back.

843
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,255
-I can't get you...
-You have to.

844
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,008
Or I put this
on Facebook tonight.

845
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,597
Gecko,

846
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,432
former teen star

847
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,101
of Vought Summertime Clubhouse,

848
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,438
working as an S&M hooker

849
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,732
as a side hustle?

850
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,446
I'm sure inquiring minds
will want to know.

851
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,199
Annie?

852
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,658
I thought that we were friends?

853
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,203
I'm sorry.

854
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,787
But...

855
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,873
we're not anything.

856
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,883
(helicopter blades whirring)

857
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,092
Hi.

858
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,677
You know who we are.

859
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,888
But let's meet another hero.

860
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,016
This is Lance Corporal
Dan Miller.

861
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,477
Dan and the other brave
Marines of Second Battalion

862
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:56,022
are helping keep you safe
from the Super Villain threat.

863
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,732
We're proud to fly
alongside them.

864
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:00,443
And now, we could use
your support.

865
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,446
That's right, Maeve, with our
new campaign, Saving America.

866
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:05,907
Here I go, you guys!
Wish me luck.

867
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,660
Oh, FYI, not a real base.

868
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,746
As if Homelander and Maeve
are gonna eat MREs

869
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,748
and piss in a ditch
with the rest of the grunts.

870
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,750
Uh, hey, yeah, hi, we're
filming right now. Excuse me?

871
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:19,295
Also, you might recognize
"Army Boy" as Hotel Clerk #2

872
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,297
-from "The Devil's Breath"
-Hello, excuse-- okay.

873
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,174
episode of Criminal Minds:
Beyond Borders.

874
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,592
Well, hello!

875
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,636
Oh, my God, hi!

876
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,137
My nana's your biggest fan.

877
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,264
I'm Stormfront.

878
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,723
-Great.
-Oh, right, yeah.

879
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,559
From Seattle, right?

880
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,773
Uh... Portland, actually,
Your, uh, Highness.

881
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:41,067
Holy shit!

882
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,111
Your eyes are really
fucking blue up close.

883
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,445
(chuckles)

884
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,573
You are... fun.

885
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,491
It's been a hoot,
but we got work to do,

886
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,243
so... let's get back to it.

887
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,370
Oh, totally, uh,

888
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,455
they just wanted me to meet you.

889
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,748
Who?

890
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,209
Oh, the boys on 82.

891
00:47:58,251 --> 00:48:00,503
-I'm the new girl.
-Wait...

892
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,839
what are you talking about?

893
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,340
Oh! Hi.

894
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,092
I'm in The Seven.

895
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,595
Replacing Translucent.

896
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,847
God bless his soul.

897
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,057
Ink's barely dry, but, uh,

898
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,809
yeah, reporting for duty,

899
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:17,270
so... fuck yeah!

900
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,397
Um, no, I don't think that
this is, it's not true.

901
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,899
I don't know anything
about this.

902
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,276
Wow!

903
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,322
Well, uh, Stormfront?

904
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,741
Who delivered the good news?

905
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,161
STORMFRONT:
Oh, uh, Mr. Edgar,

906
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,496
the big guy?

907
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,124
-MAN: All right, back to one.
-Wonderful.

908
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:40,126
Great.

909
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:42,879
All right!

910
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,466
-Great!
-MAN: We're going again, people.

911
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,677
Well, I think
this is going great.

912
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,891
MOTHER'S MILK:
You know,

913
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,809
you ain't John Cusack, man.

914
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,937
You ain't got
no motherfucking boom box.

915
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,939
-Sorry?
-You want to get back together

916
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,650
-with Starlight.
-No. No-no, I don't.

917
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,151
Yes. Yes, you do.

918
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,737
But this ain't the way
to do it, Hughie.

919
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,530
You can't keep
pulling this shit, man.

920
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,783
Calling her, texting her.

921
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,576
Are you crazy?

922
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,702
You know, you sound
like Butcher.

923
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,537
-She's on our side.
-I know.

924
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,081
I'm saying this for her, kid.

925
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,957
You're putting her in danger.

926
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,585
Homelander finds out that
she's been talking to you?

927
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,046
She's fucked.

928
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,423
The deeper you keep pushing her
into this thing,

929
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,926
the deeper in the meat grinder
she goes.

930
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,348
RAYNER:
How are you guys doing?

931
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,308
MOTHER'S MILK:
We're hanging in there.

932
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,893
RAYNER:
Has Butcher contacted you?

933
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,061
Nope.

934
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,605
He's completely ghosted.

935
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:45,650
Do you think he killed
Madelyn Stillwell?

936
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,443
MOTHER'S MILK:
I'd like to think
that he didn't.

937
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,655
But I... I don't know.

938
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,742
Deputy Director,
I know this might not be

939
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,953
the best time to ask,
but do you ever...?

940
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,621
Hear about your family?

941
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:02,458
Your daughter is, uh,
starting soccer, I think.

942
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,338
Soccer?

943
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,841
Um, ma'am.

944
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,592
Can M.M. see them?

945
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,138
You know what, let's,
let's see if this checks out.

946
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:18,057
And I will see what I can do.

947
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,186
Thank you, ma'am.

948
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,646
Okay, so give me
the description of this guy.

949
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:27,442
All right, uh,
about five-ten, 165,

950
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,445
black hair, wearing
knockoff jeans and sneakers

951
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:34,031
probably from Taiwan,
maybe India.

952
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,659
You got all that from the video?

953
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,619
So, the other shoe drops,

954
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,455
and it just crushes us all.

955
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,540
MOTHER'S MILK:
Meaning?

956
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:46,169
Meaning I've been trying
to put this puzzle together,

957
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,504
and there's a missing piece
and it's been driving me nuts.

958
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,506
And I think you
just handed it to me.

959
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,008
Okay, so, then, what's
the whole picture?

960
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,885
The whole picture-- it's Vought!

961
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,220
It's a fucking coup
from the inside.

962
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,222
HUGHIE:
Wait, what are you
talking about?

963
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:03,352
Uh, ma'am, your nose.

964
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,984
-Fuck!
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
-Holy shit!

965
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:14,530
-Holy shit! (screaming)
-Come on! Get in!
Go, go, go, go, go!

966
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,574
Must be a Supe out there.

967
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,534
Are-are our heads gonna explode?

968
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,286
Frenchie, who do you know
who could do that?

969
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:21,329
No one!

970
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,872
Are our heads gonna explode?!

971
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,583
Look, I have a daughter.

972
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:29,170
I'm worried about
Super Terrorists, too.

973
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:31,130
But that does not mean

974
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:34,258
that Vought can use
that fear to control us.

975
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,885
-Morning.
-Mr. Edgar, I'm sorry, I...

976
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,220
EDGAR:
That's all right, Samantha.

977
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,596
Busy day. (chuckles)

978
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:39,806
Morning, Homelander.

979
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:40,890
(TV turns off)

980
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,475
To what do I owe the pleasure?

981
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,477
Well, you never come up to 99.

982
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,854
So, figured I'd pay you a visit.

983
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,148
-What a lovely idea.
-(chuckling): Right?

984
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,234
After all,
you run a superhero company,

985
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,278
and, uh, you never check in
with your superheroes,

986
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,364
do you?

987
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,741
Like, uh... oh, I don't know...

988
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,202
around the hiring of that girl,
for example.

989
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,579
You wished to be consulted
on Stormfront?

990
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,581
Well, why not?

991
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,292
I signed off on all the rest.

992
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,961
I'm the leader of The Seven.

993
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,129
For which you have
my undying respect.

994
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,298
See, I don't think I do.

995
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,008
No.

996
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,469
Not even Madelyn would've dared

997
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:20,304
to try and pull
this kind of shit.

998
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:23,432
Of course you know how important
you are to everyone at Vought.

999
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,893
No, no. Stan.

1000
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:28,855
I am Vought.

1001
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:31,691
You show my photo to some
illiterate fucking camel jockey

1002
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,776
in the middle of the Sahara,
he's gonna turn around and say,

1003
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,904
"Homelander,"

1004

1009

about Frederick Vought?

1011
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,566
Excuse me?

1012
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,151
Frederick.

1013
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,485
Vought.

1014
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:22,700
Our esteemed founder.

1015
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,328
Well, I don't know, um,
not a lot, probably.

1016
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,622
I only read his autobiography...

1017
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,832
-five times?
-(chuckles softly)

1018
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,918
Not the self-serving bullshit

1019
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,420
that we peddle to the
shareholders, the real story.

1020
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:37,882
-Enlighten me.
-Got his doctorate from Munich.

1021
00:53:37,924 --> 00:53:39,884
Ahead of his time in genetics.

1022
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:43,679
Such the rising young star
that in '39,

1023
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,307
Hitler appointed him
chief physician at Dachau,

1024
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:49,310
where he enjoyed
a ready supply of human subjects

1025
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,188
on which to test his earliest
iterations of Compound V.

1026
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:56,484
For which we condemn in
the strongest of possible terms.

1027
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,236
Early in '44,
he felt the winds change,

1028
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,489
got spirited away to the Allies.

1029
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,574
When Oppenheimer was
flailing with the bomb,

1030
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,411
Dr. Vought already had practical
applications of Compound V

1031
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,663
tested in the field.

1032
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,207
Heroes like Soldier Boy,

1033
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,876
killing Germans by the dozen.

1034
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:17,088
So, Roosevelt pardoned him,

1035
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,341
and he became
as Wonder Bread American

1036
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,885
as Disney and Edison.

1037
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,388
Well, this is
a truly fascinating,

1038
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,016
if not slightly condescending
lecture, but, um...

1039
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,352
I don't think
I see the point, Stan.

1040
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,895
The point is...

1041
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,523
that you are
under a misconception

1042
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,233
that we are a superhero company.

1043
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,651
We are not.

1044
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,529
What we are, really,
is a pharmaceutical company.

1045
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:45,032
And you are not
our most valuable asset.

1046
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:48,828
That would be our confidential
formula for Compound V.

1047
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,413
Which you,
man-child that you are,

1048
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,249
released into the wild.

1049

you're talking about.

1051
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,130
Well, let me remind you.

1052
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,799
You slipped Compound V
to terrorists all over the globe

1053
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,468
to get you and your cronies
into national defense.

1054
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,304
But maybe at the cost of
destroying the whole company.

1055
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:12,018
I don't think I appreciate
your tone, sir.

1056
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,811
Not much at all.

1057
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:18,149
And I don't appreciate that the
FDA now knows about Compound V,

1058
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,693
or that it's
only a matter of time

1059
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,361
before the public finds out.

1132
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,980
What the fuck are you wearing?

1133
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:11,483
That is a good question.

1134
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,110

We got a Supe Terrorist,
Rayner's blown her canister,

1140
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,961
and we're the most wanted cunts
in the country.

1141
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,341
