00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,515
(as Homelander):
Exactly.

165
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,226
All seven of us.

166
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,312
Holy shit.

167
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,772
(sighs)

168
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,274
Holy shit.

169
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,359
That is the moment

170
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,196
The Seven became...

171
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,698
The Seven.

172
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,741
Rousing music.

173
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,286
♪ Hans... ♪

174
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,079
♪ Zimmer. ♪

175
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,290
Title card:
Dawn of The Seven.

176
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,791
Cut to black.

177
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,297
-That is amazing.
-Thank you.

178
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,673
ASHLEY:
Wow, I am very impressed.

179
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,300
BOURKE:
Thank you so much.

180
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,802
And, gang,
that's just the teaser.

181
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,804
Look, this is not just
a superhero...

182
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,765
You look like shit.

183
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,225
Had a big night.

184
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,520
And I want to shoot the whole
thing hand-held, right?

185
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,855
very Greengrass, very grounded.

186
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,107
I want to take the audience
and literally put them--

187
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,400
boom-- right there
in the action.

188
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,402
But what's the plan
on Translucent?

189
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,070
That's a great question. Okay,
we're gonna take a stuntman,

190
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,822
put him in a jumpsuit
and just CG him out.

191
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,950
And... fuck,
I don't want to jinx this,

192
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,328
but Lin-Manuel Miranda
wants to do the voice.

193
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,872
-I love Hamilton. Oh, man.
-The world loves Hamilton!

194
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,498
-Oh, my God,
you think he'll do a...
-STORMFRONT: Excuse me.

195
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,208
-I'm sorry to interrupt
this lovefest,
-No, of course.

196
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,710
-I just want to be a part of it.
-Understood.

197
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,879
Um, this... (growls playfully)

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,464
-Great work.
-Thank you so much.

199
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,467
This script is a great start.

200
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,385
Really good bones.

201
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
Uh, I just have a few headlines.

202
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,139
Yeah, totally.
Listen, we can tweak dialogue

203
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,682
right up to
the day of production.

204
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,226
Yeah, it's not really tweaks.
It's more...

205
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,771
global.

206
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,315
Okay, yeah.
What are we, um...

207
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,941
What are-what are we thinking?

208
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,402
Oh, um, like, uh...

209
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:55,364
you write all women as either
unknowable Hitchcock bitches

210
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,157
or Michael Bay fuck dolls.

211
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,826
I mean, I get that a lifetime
of jerking off to Transformers

212
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,495
didn't exactly make you popular
with the ladies,

213
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,580
but, um, a little effort
would be nice.

214
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,873
You know what I'm saying?

215
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,166
Um, excuse me,

216
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,667
but I do have two sisters.

217
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,877
Thank you very much.

218
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,879
-Oh.
-And, uh, excuse me,

219
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,173
but Homelander really loves
this script.

220
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,926
-So...
-Oh, okay. Where is he?

221
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,970
(phone buzzing)

222
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,808
STORMFRONT:
Ashley?

223
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,604
Um, okay. Okay. Okay, uh,

224
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,272
just, you know, continue doing
what you're doing.

225
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,982
Um, I just have to get to my...

226
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,526
I have to... I have a...

227
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,027
Uh, I just have to get
to my next thing.

228
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,155
I have a, um,
I have a-a noon...

229
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,616
(breathing rapidly)

230
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,576
Can someone open this, please?!

231
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,790
-ASHLEY: Okay.
-STORMFRONT: Okay!

232
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,500
I got a few more headlines.

233
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,879
-(elevator bell chimes)
-Mr. Edgar.

234
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,841
Sir, if this is all true,
I will get a strategy together

235
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,676
with crisis management and PR.

236
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,011
-We're fine for now, Ashley.
-Sir, is it true?

237
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,389
-What they're saying?
-We're investigating.

238
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,932
Sir, I have to tell you
something.

239
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,392
We have to tell Homelander,

240
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,352
and I have to admit something
to you. I...

241
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,939
You don't have the faintest
idea where Homelander is.

242
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,109
He will know
when I want him to know.

243
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,111
Just keep the rest
of the infants on 99

244
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,738
in check, will you?

245
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,203
(shuddering exhale)

246
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,414
THOMAS ROBERTS:
...and if you are
just tuning in,

247
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,708
we have some major
breaking news.

248
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,043
Superheroes are not born
but made,

249
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,631
in fact created by a chemical
serum, Compound V,

250
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,718
produced and administered
by Vought International...

251
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,511
-(chuckles)
-...the company that has been

252
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,389
the corporate face
of superheroes for decades.

253
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,016
-(sonic boom)
-Now, we don't know

254
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,392
where their superpowers

255
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,227
-actually came from.
-What... did you do?

256
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,271
I don't know
what you're talking about.

257
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,272
Oh, come on.

258
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,566
I saw you with the V
in your hand.

259
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:58,028
Yeah, and you let me
walk away with it, so...

260
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,863
this is kind of on you, too.

261
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,365
If I go down, you come with me.

262
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,534
Pretty sure they'd kill us both.

263
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,411
(sighs heavily)

264
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,414
You don't get it.

265
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:14,211
You don't fuck with the money.

266
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,797
You never fuck with the money.

267
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,261
We're gonna lose everything--
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses...

268
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,264
There are more important things.

269
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,185
You know, the only people
that say that...

270
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:33,271
are the people who grew up
with money.

271
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,273
ROBERTS:
...provided evidence

272
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,609
proving Vought has been
administering Compound V

273
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,570
to children for decades.

274
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,656
Our very own reporting suggests

275
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,408
the parents also received
a very generous payment.

276
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,452
-It started when I was nine.
-Now, after the kids

277
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,996
were treated with Compound V,
they were then monitored...

278
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,416
I was at the mall.

279
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,877
And we, uh...

280
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,922
we passed the pet store...

281
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:06,513
...and I heard the goldfish
begging for their lives.

282
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,557
They were begging.

283
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,356
And after that, I...

284
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:20,569
The beach, the aquarium,
Red Lobster...

285
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,913
I mean, I thought
I was going crazy, you know?

286
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,627
But my mom said it was a gift.

287
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,259
That I was born this way.

288
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,388
But I wasn't.

289
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,978
It didn't have to be this way.

290
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,188
-I could've been normal.
-ROBERTS: But early reports

291
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,190
seem to suggest the first
manifestation of powers

292
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,067
-can cause fear and anxiety
-(sobbing)

293
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,694
in the affected children,

294
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,446
especially if they are not
carefully guided

295
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,905
through the process.

296
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,284
-(sobbing)
-So far, Vought has refused

297
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,202
to release a statement.

298
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,331
Likewise, Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum,
former C.S.O. at the company,

299
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,374
refusing comment.

300
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,793
He's been in seclusion
since an undisclosed accident

301
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,670
-left him paralyzed.
-(answering machine beeps)
-Uh, hey.

302
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,506
-Is this you?
-Vogelbaum all but disappearing
from public life.

303
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,133
You did it.

304
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,718
We did it.

305
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,346
Um, call me. Call me back
when you get a chance.

306
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,764
-(phone beeps off)
-...on their stock price,

307
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,641
which is already
falling today,

308
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601
-MOTHER'S MILK: Did what?
-signaling a huge trend

309
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,436
that could be potentially
catastrophic

310
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,271
to Vought's bottom line.

311
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,274
-You did this?
-(newscast continues)

312
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:45,487
Uh, yeah. S-Starlight did,
mostly, I'm pretty sure,

313
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,240
but I just gave her
an old alley-oop.

314
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,868
(quietly):
Hughie.

315
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,453
Hughie, yes!

316
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,996
-Okay. (laughing)
-Hughie!

317
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,790
Dude, look at what you
fucking did.

318
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,583
-Oh, my God.
-You lads touchin' yer tips?

319
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,085
MOTHER'S MILK:
Look at what the kid just did.

320
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,628
Me and Starlight, but yeah.

321
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,963
-Petit Hughie?
-The fucking kid.

322
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,715
-Mm!
-(kisses)
-Oh, shit.

323
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,966
Yes!

324
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,386
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Nice one.

325
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,429
MOTHER'S MILK:
That's all you got?

326
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,891
We've been trying to do
this shit for years.

327
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,768
Vought's finally fucking
going down,

328
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,395
the kid did it,
and "nice one"?

329
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,313
All right, real nice one.

330
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:24,609
You can't even give me this,
can you?

331
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,696
Not one goddamn win.

332
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,906
I'll tell you what.

333
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,574
When we're all done here,

334
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,535
I'll buy you a nice, big,
family size bottle

335
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,913
of top-shelf lube
and I'll tickle your balls

336
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,708
till you beg me to stop
and even then I won't.

337
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,042
I just won't do it.

338
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:45,046
But right now, we got
a Supe terrorist below deck

339
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,383
and shit could go sideways
just like... (snaps)

340
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:57,016
So all of ya, keep your fucking
eyes on the ball, yeah?

341
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,567
(pats arm)

342
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,569
Don't worry about him.

343
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,028
Yeah, fuck him.

344
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,321
You did great.

345
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,876
(birds chirping,
dog barks in distance)

346
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,794
Isn't this great?

347
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:27,130
-Yeah.
-(Homelander chuckles)

348
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,550
Your mom ever bring you up here?

349
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,968
No.

350
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,344
Nah.

351
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,805
Of course not.

352
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,476
You see, that is why a boy
needs his father.

353
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,064
Hey, I think it's time.

354
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:49,027
Yeah. You ready?

355
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,864
Um... ready for what?

356
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,908
To jump.

357
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,503
Wait, you can't be serious.

358
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,463
I'm not going to jump.

359
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,340
Ryan, you're my son.

360
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,510
You can fly, just like me.

361
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,096
I-I... I don't want to.

362
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,099
You take a big, deep breath,
you step off

363
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,726
and your body will just
do the rest.

364
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,019
It'll just take over.

365
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,813
But I-I can't fly.

366
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,231
I'll just fall
right off of here and get...

367
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,482
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

368
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,276
You're gonna love it.
I promise.

369
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,861
I'm nothing like you.
I-I can't fly.

370
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,655
You can. You can.

371
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,073
I promise you can.

372
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,158
(breathes deeply)

373
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,661
Dad, please.

374
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,288
Please, don't make me jump.

375
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,958
(clicks tongue):
Aw.

376
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,252
Buddy.

377
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,965
You called me Dad.

378
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,593
(chuckles)

379
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,762
(Ryan gasps, screams)

380
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,476
(sputters)

381
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,728
-(door opens)
-BECCA: Ryan.

382
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,730
God. Ryan!

383
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,898
Hey. Hey, hey.

384
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,316
What did you do?

385
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,278
It's fine. It's a 20-foot drop.
Relax.

386
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,279
Inhuman fucking monster.

387
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,488
-Come here.
-Don't help him up.

388
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,824
-Let him do it himself.
-Come here. Baby, hey.

389
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,659
Hey, Ryan, I need you
to wake up.

390
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,412
Baby, can you hear me?
I'm right here.

391
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,080
-I don't think he's breathing.
-(laughing)

392
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,582
-He's fine.
-I don't think he's breathing.

393
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,792
-I don't think he's... (gasps)
-(gasps) Mom?

394
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,460
-Hi. Hi.
-Look. See?

395
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,879
-Told ya.
-Hi, sweetie.

396
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,255
Are you hurt? (kisses)

397
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,423
Does anything feel broken?

398
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,716
-Oh, for God's sake, broken?
-Let me see.

399
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,426
Come on, look at him.
There's not a scratch on him.

400
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,512
You know why?
'Cause he's my son.

401
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,264
And you, you... (scoffs)

402
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,057
...you're raising him
to be a pussy.

403
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,350
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

404
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,643
I'm his father.

405
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,353
You don't get to say that
after what you did.

406
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,355
What I did to you...

407
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,190
was give you a son,

408
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,192
that you are raising

409
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,278
-like a little girl.
-(Ryan breathing rapidly)

410
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,654
Let go of me.

411
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:00,283
-He's mine.
-Get your hands off of her!

412
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,202
(Ryan breathing rapidly)

413
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,246
(rapid breathing continues)

414
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,046
Good boy.

415
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,756
See?

416
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,717
-I told you.
-What?

417
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,760
You're just like me, Ryan.

418
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,303
No, I'm not like you.

419
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,804
I'm nothing like you!
I fucking hate you!

420
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,889
Leave us alone!

421
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,849
Hey, hey, it's okay.
I'm not angry.

422
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,477
-Ryan.
-Go away!

423
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,562
-Buddy, it's o...
-Leave us alone!

424
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,065
Ryan, this is a good thing.

425
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,526
(door opens)

426
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,569
(door closes)

427
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,283
(door opens)

428
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,043
So, um...

429
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,509
These are horrible,
powdered cheese things,

430
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,011
but, um, if you're hungry?

431
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,684
Fuck you.

432
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,436
So you do speak English.

433
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,609
Thirsty?

434
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,660
-(slurps)
-You know,

435
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,705
the way you talk
with your sister...

436
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,915
it's no sign language
I ever seen.

437
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,714
I just want to help her.

438
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,761
I can help her.

439
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,596
Tu comprends?

440
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,016
You understand?

441
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,274
The night our parents
were murdered...

442
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,070
...Kimiko just stopped talking.

443
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,905
Can't talk.

444
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,783
She's never made a sound since.

445
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,453
In the camp,

446
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,290
we were alone week after week,

447
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,918
just the two of us, for years.

448
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,633
We... came up a language

449
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,511
so we could get through it.

450
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,847
(laughs softly)

451
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,017
I-It saved us.

452
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,770
Both of us.

453
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,942
Will you teach me?

454
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,324
(slurping)

455
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,534
(sighs)

456
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,037
(clears throat, sniffs)

457
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,539
(quietly):
Please.

458
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,418
Fuck you.

459
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,223
I think your sister
is very special.

460
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,603
And she loves you very much.

461
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,503
(grunts)

462
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,094
(straining)

463
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,854
(can crinkling)

464
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,194
(groans in pain)

465
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,238
(breathing rapidly)

466
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,742
I don't know anything about
this Compound V monkey business.

467
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,369
If someone gave it
to my little Maeve,

468
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,204
I sure as hell didn't know.

469
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,206
-Bullshit he didn't know.
-(turns off TV)

470
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,666
I remember this one weekend

471
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,585
where he made me do
three mall appearances

472
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,211
and a photo shoot
for Teen Vogue,

473
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,631
all to get the cash for
my braces, which he then blew

474
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:28,050
at the five-dollar table
at Circus Circus.

475
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,427
ELENA:
Maybe this is what

476
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,469
we've been waiting for.

477
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,430
What do you mean?

478
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,099
They've lied to you from
the beginning, all of them.

479
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,101
You don't owe them anything.

480
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,978
Maybe this is our chance
to leave while we can.

481
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,313
Elena...

482
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,357
if we do that,
you know what'll happen.

483
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,986
I'll call you back.

484
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:50,198
(phone beeps off,
sets phone on table)

485
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,742
Not, uh, interrupting, am I?

486
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,368
No, of course not.

487
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,495
Great.

488
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:09,050
It's funny, you know, uh...

489
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,764
...of all the people here,

490
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,267
I've known you the longest.

491
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,686
Yeah.

492
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,108
Sometimes it, um,

493
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,779
just seems like you're
the only person I can lean on.

494
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,490
Yeah, I...
I-I feel the same way.

495
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,287
You do?

496
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,957
Of course.

497
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,502
(inhales deeply)

498
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,630
(sighs heavily)

499
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,428
You...

500
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,348
Oh... fuck.

501
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,225
Life, huh?

502
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,226
(exhales)

503
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,019
(patting hand)

504
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,273
It's crazy.

505
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,191
(sniffs)

506
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,401
Who's Elena?

507
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,736
Elena's an old friend.

508
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,535
Since when do you have friends?

509
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,622
I was just venting
about all this fucking bullshit.

510
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,041
What bullshit?

511
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,543
Wait, you haven't heard?

512
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,129
Where have you been?

513
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:34,552
(helicopter blades whirring)

514
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,723
What the fuck?

515
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,391
MAN (over speaker):
This is the NYPD.

516
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,393
This boat's been
reported stolen,

517
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,728
and you're all under arrest.

518
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,937
I repeat. This is the NYPD.

519
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,647
This boat's been
reported stolen...

520
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,566
I thought you said this boat
belongs to a friend.

521
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,693
Gather on deck and get
your hands in the air now.

522
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,780
Well, a stranger is just
a friend you ain't met yet.

523

MOTHER'S MILK:
Don't fuck this up.

BUTCHER:

525
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,617
MOTHER'S MILK:
Vought's almost toast,

526
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,202
we're almost home free...

527
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,746
I said I ain't gonna fuck it up,
all right.

528
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,165
-(radio clicks)
-Ahoy, gents.

529
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,208
I am the captain
of My Big Wet Dream.

530
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,588
I'm holding papers,
signed by the owner,

531
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,715
for the lease of this vessel.

532
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,676
So there must be some kind
of misunderstanding...

533
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,511
Look out!

534
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,263
(water splashing)

535
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,058
Get his hands!

536
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,976
(Kenji grunts)

537
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,947
Time to go!

538
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,366
(frustrated grunting)

539
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,576
Hey, what are you doing?
We gotta help 'em.

540
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,203
BUTCHER:
Trust me, they're already dead.

541
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,204
-You don't know that.
-(engine starting)

-We have to try.
-Hughie.

Literally everyone
is on their way here right now.

544
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,125
We stay here, we die, too.

What?

549
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,064
I wasn't the one
who fucked that up.

Time for what?

568
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,735
For you. It's your time.

569
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,237
To get back into The Seven.

570

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,533

Holy shit.

Who?

574
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,705
Alastair Adana, the...

575
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,206
the leader of the Church.

576
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,375
He sits in the First Chair.

Cool.

00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,630
Guys, with everything going on,

00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,466
I just, I don't think
I can do it right now.

No, Deep.

This is your journey.

You're ready.

00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,972
You have been ready all along.

584
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,559
Now, get out there
and be a hero.

585
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,232
My dad always used to say,

586
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,525
"Where there's smoke,
there's fire."

587
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,069
So Vought lied to us
about Compound V.

588
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,280
What else are they lying
to us about?

Jesus. What about
the pharmaceuticals?

593
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,748
Pfizer's circling, "dismayed
at our lack of ethics."

594
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,166
BARASSI:
Investor lawsuits,

00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,667
breach of fiduciary duty,
non-disclosure.

596
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:54,793
SKILTON:
We have exposure
for fraud, assault,

597
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,086
infliction of bodily harm--

598
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,088
all policy exclusions,
no coverage.

599
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,131
We have two options.

600
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,008
Option one, deny.

601
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,635
High risk, high reward.

602
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,762
But if we deny
and they nail us,

603
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,180
if there is a legit
whistleblower,

604
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,389
there's no coming back.

605
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,849
That's bankruptcy,
criminal charges,

606
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,601

Which one is it?

Stan.

615
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,040
A power drink can, Frenchie?

616
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,542
You're a goddamn idiot.

617
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,502
I was trying to help her.

00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,797
Where the hell are your mates?

619
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,173
New deal--
you gotta bring him in.

620
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,008
Grace,
we're three miles offshore.

621
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,927
You just crashed
a police helicopter.

622
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,221
Not exactly keeping
a low profile.

623
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,808
All right,
where do you want us to go?

624
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,351
CIA safe house Hazlet.

625
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,644
Be there in 30.

626
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,563
And Butcher?

627
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,772
Yeah?

628
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,358
Please be careful.

629
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,152
I will.

630
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,071

631
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,990

-Fuck me.

632
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,825
(phone dialing)

633
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,702
AUTOMATED MESSAGE:

635
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:16,542
Hey, uh, Annie, it's me again.

636
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:20,504
I was just wondering, have
you ever seen the music video

637
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,549
for that Billy Joel song
"You're Only Human"?

638
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,218
There's this kid
and he's climbing up a bridge

639
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,178
and he's-he's gonna
kill himself,

640
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,097
but then Billy Joel
steps out with his harmonica

641
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,599
and tells him stop,

642
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,601
you just have to wait
for your second wind,

643
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:37,605
and now I-I feel like
I'm-I'm that kid

644
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,607
and I'm gonna drown,

645
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,650
and...

646
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,364
...and thank God
I found my second wind

647
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,284
because it's-it's you.
(sniffles)

648
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,328

00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,801
MOTHER'S MILK:
We're at our breaking point,

817
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,053
at each other's throats,

818
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,763
and you keep pushing us
and pushing.

819
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,641
-It's like...
-Right over the fucking
finish line.

820
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,935
We just need to keep
our shit together

821
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,979
a little bit longer.

822
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,189
Okay?

823
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,024
We hand the cunt over,

824
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,818
and I get Becca
and you get your girls.

825
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,986
-Butcher, Butcher,
-We're right fucking...

826
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,112
-Butcher, Butcher.
-we're right there.

827
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,948
Hughie's not gonna make it.

828
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,117
And you need that kid,

829
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,661
more than any one of us.

830
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,872
He's your canary.

831
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,916
My canary?

832
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,752
You let your canary die,

833
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,296
how you gonna know
when you've gone too far?

834
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,881
Oh.

835
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,926
I mean, what a load of bollocks.

836
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,641
Hell, I tried, all right?

837
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,643
The kid doesn't want
a part of me,

838
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,603
so fuck him.

839
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,568
Come on.

840
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:17,118
-(flies buzzing)
-(softly): Lucy.

841
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,954
I promise
we'll harvest your blubber.

Deep.

845
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,377
-Homelander.
-Hey.

846
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,586
-Hey.
-What happened?

847
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,879
They killed her.
They fucking killed her, man.

848
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,130
-What?
-I just was trying to help out.

849
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,423
-You know, I got
some intel on the boat.
-Okay...

850
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,800
We started to cut them off
and then, fuck,

851
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,426
they just ran right into her.

852
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,929
I'm so sorry. I was just,
like, gonna try to stop them.

853
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,472
-I tried to cut them off...
-Okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

854
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,057
So you're saying th-there's
people with the terrorist?

855
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,767
Look at me. You're saying
they're not alone?

856
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:42,018
I think so.

857
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,728
All right. Did you get
a good look at them, or...?

858
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,146
DEEP:
Not really.

859
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,856
I was too busy
worrying about Lucy.

860
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,150
Oh, Jesus. Right. Lucy.

861
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,819
DEEP:
But I think they went off
in the storm drains.

862
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,904
Can't be too far.

863
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:56,324
Uh, who invited you, exactly?

864
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,701
Starlight.

865
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,662
Listen, what I did
was unforgivable.

866
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:01,997
-Oh, God.
-I'm going to do everything
in my power

867
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,291
-to renew my light.
-Mm.

868
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,418
Not just for you
but for all the female people

869
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,961
-that I've offended.
-STORMFRONT: "Renew your light"?

870

Did you just fucking join
the Church of the Collective?

871
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,216
-Maybe.
-You're an idiot.

872
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,802
Hey, easy on the religious
persecution, okay, new girl?

873
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,388
Starlight, maybe one day
you can welcome me back

874
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,474
into The Seven, but I know
my road is long and hard.

875
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,684
Are you serious?

876
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,397
There is no fucking way

877
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,065
you're coming back.

878
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,109
There's no need for language.

879

HOMELANDER:
All right, enough.

880
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,696
We do not have time for this.

881
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,616
Look, I am with you, sister,

882
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,411
but first we have to go get
the terrorist, okay?

883
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,167
All right,
everyone in the tunnels.

884
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,418
-Yeah, everyone in the tunnels.
-Not you.

885
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,880
Anyone gets eyeballs
on the target,

886
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,381
he's mine, understood?

887
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,592
DEEP:
Go get 'em.

888
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,552
Noir.

889
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,763
All right, you...

890
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,223
need to hang back a bit. Okay?

891
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,351
-Okay.
-Still got some work to do
with the ladies,

892
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,435
but it's going to be okay.

893
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,686
You'll be back in no time.

894
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:08,730
-Really?
-Sure.

895
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,607
One other thing. You, uh,

896
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,442
you ripped your vest.

897
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,735

898
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,612

Shouldn't we...
take him to the police?

HOMELANDER:
Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

944
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,954
Kill him.

945

EDGAR:
I know the news of Compound V
came as a shock to everyone.

1016
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,961
As you can imagine,

1017
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,422
this has been a very difficult
day for the Vought family.

1018
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:40,801
Our focus now will be
to learn the truth.

1019
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,638
As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation

1020
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,516
into Compound V,
but let me be clear:

1021
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,978
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

1022
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,648
We believe it was the work
of a small,

1023
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,108
disaffected group of scientists

1024
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:00,237
led by former Vought employee
Madelyn Stillwell.

1025
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:04,325
But sadly, there are more
important matters at hand.

1026
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,160
Everyone at Vought

1027
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,579
sends their thoughts
and prayers

1028
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,874
to those families
that were affected today.

1029
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,834
Though it is important
to acknowledge

1030
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,003
that this tragic event
could have been far worse,

1031
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,090
today's attack underscores

1032
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,717
just how dangerous the threat
of Super terrorists has become.

1033
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:25,763
And, at a time like this,
America needs its heroes

1034
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:27,056
more than ever.

1035
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:29,433
We live in a dangerous world.

1036
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:33,145
Our brave heroes were already
fighting terrorists overseas,

1037
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,524
but now, America faces this war
on a different front:

1038
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:38,943
right here at home.

1039
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:40,486
These enemies
will stop at nothing

1040
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:41,487
to infiltrate our borders

1041
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:43,364
and attack our citizens.

1042
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:47,368
Our superheroes are
the last line of defense.

1043
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,454
And today, the death toll
would have been much higher

1044
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,958
had it not been for the brave
actions of our newest hero,

1045
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,252
Stormfront,
