They want us to believe
that Vought superheroes

00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,062
are the only answer. What else
are they lying to us about?

-Out of The Seven.

when I met you.

Stop fucking lying to me.

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,196
And you love her?

8
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:34,952
We shouldn't feel so calm or
safe. So, what are we gonna do?

00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,288
Cross our fingers that
Homelander's gonna save us?

167
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,775
she probably murdered Raynor.

168
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,027
Annie's trying
to figure out why, but...

169
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,528
you know, who the fuck knows.

170
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,030
Well...

171
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,740
as long as Starlight's
on the job,

172
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,075
we're sorted then, yeah?

173
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,496
I'm not...
I'm not mad, you know.

174
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,289
What you mean?

175
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,209
I-I just want you
to know that, um...

176
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,128
yes, you are leaving us holding
the bag on this shitshow,

177
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,380
but I want you to know
that I-I get it.

178
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,382
It's, uh, Becca.

179
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,092
I'd do the same thing.

180
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,385
I'm not mad.

181
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,222
Well...

182
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,640
wouldn't matter if you were.

183
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,642
Uh, how is she?

184
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,644
Lovelier than the day
I met her.

185
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,562
(toy squeaking)

186
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,982
-(squeaking)
-Where are you?

187
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,525
Heading off grid.

188
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,818
Argentina, maybe.

189
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,278
Early retirement.

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,613
Butcher?

191
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,699
Yeah, what?

192
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,744
You could've said goodbye.

193
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:43,292
I know we've been
through some shit together.

194
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,715
You were...

195
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:53,218
you were always like my canary,
I suppose.

196
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,721
Thank you.

197
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,140
-Goodbye, Hughie.
-Your canary...

198
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,475
Hello?

199
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,024
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

200
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,736
(phone clangs in can)

201
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,738
CLAIRE:
On your feet, soldier.

202
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,411
Take me home to Lallybroch.

203
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,662
HUGHIE:
What are you watching?

204
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,958
A show called Eat My Dick.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,169
Okay.

206
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,338
Have you seen Frenchie
or Kimiko?

207
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,007
No. No, not...
for a while. Why?

208
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,884
(quietly):
Fuck.

209
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,802
Uh, listen, I just got
off the phone with Butcher

210
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,346
and I think something
might be wrong.

211
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,973
Like really, really wrong.

212
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,059
What would make you think that?

213
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,646
He was nice and...

214
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,692
...called me his canary?

215
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,783
Tell me everything he said.

216
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,422
(distant explosion)

217
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,840
Agent Pearson, sir.

218
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,717
(coughs)

219
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,098
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

220
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,808
Agent Cruz,
I thought we'd lost you.

221
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,810
I got by with a little help
from a friend.

222
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,186
PEARSON:
Huh, so?

223
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,021
Good news or bad?

224
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,984
Yeah, I'd say that's good news.

225
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,277
BOURKE:
And now the CG mutants approach.

226
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,363
PEARSON:
And there's the bad news.

227
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,407
There's no way
we can restore the grid

228
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,575
if we don't get that flash drive
to the Tower.

229
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,327
But how are you gonna get
through all of them?

230
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,703
STARLIGHT:
Don't worry.

231
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,125
Girls get it done.

232
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,835
And cut on rehearsal.
No one move.

233
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,336
-No one move. No one move.
-MAN: Cut on rehearsal!

234
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,838
-Starlight. I'm not touching.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

235
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,172
-But can you just take a step?
-Mm-hmm.

236
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,298
Yeah, so keep going closer.

237
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,591
Can you mark her
closer to Stormfront?

238
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,926
Let's mark her, please.

239
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,177
And let's just pretend...

240
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,178
like you like her, okay?

241
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,805
(both laughing)

242
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,473
(laughing):
Okay, if I have to.

243
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,933
Okay. Okay, good stuff.

244
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,476
Let's try one for that.
All right, good.

245
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,270
We should've shot that.

246
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,855
I mean, clearly you like me.

247
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,899
You've been eye-fucking me like
a lovesick stangirl all day.

248
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,943
Why is that?

249
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,446
I don't know. I think
that you're a good actor.

250
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,657
And I just, I feel like
a friggin' fembot up there.

251
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,618
(chuckles)
You know...

252
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,455
BOURKE:
Everybody, can we please
stand by to roll.

253
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,873
Let's try to make our day.

254
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,083
-How about that? Okay.
-Thank you.

255
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,460
♪ Extra, Extra. ♪

256
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,212
And turning now
to superhero news,

257
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,174
former Seven member the Deep
surprised everybody last week

258
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,926
when he married
Cassandra Schwartz,

259
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,344
an anthropology professor
at Vassar,

260
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,096
in an intimate ceremony.

261
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,183
-Now, the couple has asked...
-Banana saltwater taffy.

262
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,267
God bless.

263
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,852
Ron can't live without it.

264
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,770
-(chuckles)
-(doorbell rings)

265
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,317
Billy?

266
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,527
-Hello, Judy.
-WOMAN: Who's this?

267
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,154
He's my nephew.

268
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,697
(teakettle whistling)

269
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,075
(whistling slows, stops)

270
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,411
For Christ's sake, Billy,
you got to ring your mum.

271
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,497
Where's my boy?

272
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,790
Your mum and dad
are flying over, you know.

273
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,752
Your mum's worried to death
about you.

274
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,253
No.

275
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,713
You tell 'em no.

276
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,382
It'd be a waste of a perfectly
good plane ticket.

277
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,551
JUDY (sighs):
Your father's quite ill.

278
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,637
The cancer's spreading fast.

279
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,347
Yeah, well, not fast enough.

280
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,517
I ain't seeing 'em.
Now, where's me boy?

281
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,272
(dog panting)

282
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,565
Oi, Terror.

283
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,402
You little rascal, eh?

284
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,654
Look at you, you little fucker.

285
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,489
You haven't changed a day.

286
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,575
How's about you and me go
for a little stroll then, eh?

287
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,577
Yeah?

288
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,621
Come on.

289
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,099
So this is what it all
comes to, eh?

290
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,312
Metamucil and ringing our dicks
out for a few drops of piss.

291
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,939
(scoffs)

292
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,111
I used to think that you, me and
Becca would grow old together.

293
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,405
Bloody stupid.

294
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,532
Turns out she don't...

295
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,786
(scoffs)

296
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,624
(sighs)
What the fuck was any of it for?

297
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,550
BOURKE:
Yes.

298
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,176
There he is, there's my guy.

299
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,220
Looking spectacular, as always.

300
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,471
-How we doing?
-Good.

301
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,931
-Feel good?
-Yeah. Uh...

302
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,224
Are you ready, huh?
You ready for this...

303
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,517
this big fucking scene today?

304
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,935
Yeah, well,
that's-that's basically

305
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,395
what I wanted
to talk to you about.

306
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:56,980
-Great. Yeah.
-'Cause I did a little bit
of a rewrite

307
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,190
and I want you to take a look.

308
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:01,401
-(A-Train clears throat)
-Wow.

309
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,236
-(laughs nervously)
-(A-Train clicks tongue)

310
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,739
What a... lot of work.

311
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,115
Yeah, I...

312
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,493
I just felt like the dialogue
was a little... off.

313
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,245
You know, A-Train...

314
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,623
-would never say
any of this shit.
-Right.

315
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,082
And you definitely
just don't need that

316
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,419
giant expo dump at the end.

317
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,839
Your... big farewell speech?

318
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,466
(both chuckle)

319
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:28,178
Honestly, I think it's better
if we just leave it open-ended.

320
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,471
-Okay.
-You know what I mean?

321
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,556
Uh, where we can just play
it in looks

322
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,433
and just not a whole bunch
of words.

323
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,393
-Right.
-Maybe make it
more of a question.

324
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,395
Like, is A-Train really
leaving The Seven?

325
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,105
-Yeah.
-We don't know.

326
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,025
-We don't know.
-We don't know.

327
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,568
Yeah.

328
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,153
Yeah, I think
we're just gonna go ahead

329
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,905
and do the scene as scripted.

330
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,365
But thank you for putting
all this thought into it,

331
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,741
right, it shows
you got a lot of heart.

332
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,826
Take that heart,
put it in the scene.

333
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,745
All right, good stuff.

334
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,830
I'm not doing it.

335
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,582
(mouthing)

336
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,417
I'm not doing this shitty scene.

337
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,712
Well... (chuckles)

338
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,175
That is way above my pay grade.

339
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,137
Bring that up with Ashley.

340
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,723
Right? Right.

341
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,308
Ooh, by the way.

342
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,935
I got the crew
a Vietnamese crepe truck.

343
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,561
They make a gluten-free
banh xeo.

344
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,106
It is... (inhales)
fantastic.

345
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,524
You're going to be great, baby.

346
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,525
-Where are we going?
-WOMAN: Oh,

347
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:24,943
we need to see you in Wardrobe.

348
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,737
KATIE COURIC:
Deep.

349
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,699
You look so happy.
I hardly recognize you.

350
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,825
Katie, I'm in love, you know,

351
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,493
to an extraordinary woman

352
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,495
I'm now blessed to call my wife.

353
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,164
-(Cassandra chuckles)
-Ah, that-that's really nice.

354
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,376
Well, let's address
the elephant in the room.

355
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,544
Shall we?

356
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,629
Well, you know,
I'm-I'm glad you asked,

357
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,339
because, uh, yeah, you know,

358
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,093
Kevin here has had some
issues in the past.

359
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,636
But people grow.

360
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:55,140
And if you could see the letters
that he writes me.

361
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,350
I mean, you would know
what a beautiful soul he has.

362
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,393
Oh, thank you.

363
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,602
Well, she's only saying that

364
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,146
'cause I make her
breakfast in bed, so...

365
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,439
-(laughs) Oh, stop.
-French toast.

366
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,482
(both laughing)

367
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,988
So, you are both members of
the Church of the Collective.

368
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,323
-Mm-hmm.
-It's not realistic.

369
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,034
Alexander Hamilton wasn't
no Puerto Rican.

370
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,911
That's the point.

371
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,873
It's a metaphor for the
immigrant experience in America.

372
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,708
But he was a white guy.

373
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,543
Ah.

374
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,546
You know what's really good?

375
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,256
Dear Evan Hansen.

376
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,799
Can we help you?

377
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,723
(music playing)

378
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,433
She's just a girl.

379
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,643
Show her a picture of kittens
or some shit.

380
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,062
(man laughing)

381
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,064
How 'bout I show her
my motherfuckin' dick?

382
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,399
(indistinct chatter)

383
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,698
Bitch ain't right in the head.

384
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,450
(Russian pop song playing)

385
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,493
Fuck!

386
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,288
Holy shit!

387
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,585
(grunting)

388
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,754

00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,892
(song continues)

391
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,853
Merde.

392
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,231
♪ ♪

393
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,044
JUDY:
Oi, Billy.

394
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,463
You should've told me
you were bringing company.

395
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,091
Oi, who's this one
remind you of?

396
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,261
Isn't he the spitting of Lenny?

397
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,890
No.

398
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,017
Thought you were retiring.

399
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,770
Argentina, right?

400
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,772
I am.

401
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,776
What are you doing here?

402
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,778
Well, Hughie heard a dog toy
on the phone.

403
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,490
And I know you keep Terror
at your aunt's, so...

404
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:18,825
Brilliant as ever.

405
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,118
Time to go.

406
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,911
Come help us with Stormfront.

407
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,872
Came all this way for that,
did you?

408
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,457
No, we...
we came 'cause we're worried.

409
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,585
Your cunt sense tingling, is it?

410
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,005
Well, don't you worry--
I'm sorted.

411
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,756
Where's Becca, man?

412
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,216
Becca?

413
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,886
What's he talking about?

414
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,013
Waiting for me
at the Hampton Inn.

415
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,598
-So...
-(claps hands)

416
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,309
lots of thanks,
time to piss off.

417
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,477
We're not going anywhere.

418
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,399
Right.

419
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,152
JUDY (clears throat, chuckles):
Just so you know,

420
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,529
that's Terror's girlfriend.

421
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,241
-What?
-His fuck pig.

422
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,707

423
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,920

(lock clicks)

425
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,395
Black Noir's here.

426
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,065
What?

427
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,902
MOTHER'S MILK:
It wasn't us-- we were cautious.

428
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,071
We swapped cars, no toll roads.

429
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,073
It's not you. It's me.

430
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,951
He must've tracked me
from Becca's.

431
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,328
JUDY:
Billy, what's this all about?

432
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,039
It's complicated.

433
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,624
Becca's not with me.

434
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,543
You... couldn't get her out?

435
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,007
She didn't want out.

436
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,845
I'll explain everything,

437
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,640
but right now we're
in a little bit of trouble.

438
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,558
I'm sorry, Judy.
I shouldn't have come.

439
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,852
Okay, maybe...

440
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,938
maybe we can make a run for it.

441
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,189
Just get to the car.

442
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:16,567
No, he moves faster than a car.

443
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,280
But if he wants to kill us...

444
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,992
he'll have to do it
with an audience.

445
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,497
(siren wailing,
truck horn honking)

446
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,541
MAN (over speaker):
This is the fire department.

447
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,459
A natural gas leak
has been reported.

448
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,837
Everyone out of your homes.

449
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,172
I repeat, a gas leak
has been reported...

450
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,883
Nice one, M.M.

451
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,094
Let's hope they stay a while.

452
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,388
Ma'am, do you have
any nails, ball bearings,

453
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,932
electrical wiring,
pressurized aerosol products.

454
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,892
I need a can about this big.

455
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,436
Really appreciate it.

456
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,315
STORMFRONT:
Team Britney, 2007.

457
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,900
-(laughter)
-Remember the meltdown?

458
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,653
Oh, ooh, yeah, that...

459
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,572
But, you know...

460
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,407
You're a firecracker.

461
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,451
-Mom?
-STORMFRONT: Oh, hi.

462
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,453
Annie.

463
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,913
Oh, you-you-you look so pretty.

464
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,624
What...?

465
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,168
-What are you doing here?
-I-I'm in town.

466
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,961
I've been texting you for days.

467
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,672
I-I-I wasn't trying
to ambush you, I promise.

468
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,175
Did you get any of
the Vietnamese crepes?

469
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,593
'Cause they're dope.

470
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,763
No, no, no, I'm good. Thanks.

471
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,351
Your mom was telling me

472
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,853
about the hero pageants
you used to do.

473
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,271
(feigns laughter)

474
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,606
Lucky.

475
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,733
My mom would never let me.

476
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,110
Adele did not go in
for that sort of thing.

477
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,572
I had to do all my speeches
to a brush in the mirror.

478
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,574
I like this one.

479
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,576
Mom, this isn't a great time.

480
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,952
I-I know that you're busy,

481
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,955
but you don't have
to entertain me, I promise.

482
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,707
I-I wanted to see you,
sweetheart.

483
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,126
I... I miss you.

484
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,962
(slurping)

485
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,672
(chuckles weakly)

486
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,259
I think that this is something

487
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,013
that we need to discuss
in private.

488
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,099
Donna, can I tell her?

489
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,184
-Tell me what?
-Look, your mom

490
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,853
is so sorry
about the Compound V,

491
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,272
and she understands
that keeping that a secret

492
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,399
really hurt your relationship.

493
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,151
Yeah, and that I-I used you
as a trophy

494
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,945
to make myself feel important.

495
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,321
I know that now.

496
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,157
Why are you talking to a
stranger about our relationship?

497
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,408
She's not a stranger.

498
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,701
She's your teammate.

499
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,206
(clears throat)

500
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,209
Annie, the-the whole world
knows about Compound V.

501
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,588
I mean,
lots of parents did what I did.

502
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,300
I... I'm hoping that you'll...

503
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,386
that you'll forgive me.

504
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,679
Please forgive me, Annie.

505
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,267
This is not the time
or the place for this.

506
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,270
Look, everyone is upset
about Compound V.

507
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,898
I mean, someone was so upset,
they leaked it to the press.

508
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,025
Can you imagine how angry
that person is?

509
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,069
Whoever they are?

510
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:11,450
I'll let you two hash it out,
but I just think...

511
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:15,830
if it was me, I'd be grateful
to have a mom like Donna.

512
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:26,382
Honey, please?

513
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,719
I need to get back to set.

514
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,849
Do you need someone
to drive you back to your hotel?

515
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,059
No, I'll-I'll-I'll get a cab.

516
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,187
(quietly):
Okay.

517
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,771
SETH:
Okay,

518
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,857
now, Queen Maeve, a goddess,

519
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,484
but our Empress of the
Otherworld struggles inside.

520
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,237
Questions of identity
rock her to her core.

521
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,406
-Until she meets...
-Elena.

522
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,074
The connection is immediate,
all-consuming.

523
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,702
A sweet sapphic love blossoms,

524
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,078
raising Maeve's consciousness

525
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,080
and revealing
her own inner truth.

526
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,458
She's gay, and it's okay.

527
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,792
-It's...
-Powerful.

528
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,878
She's more than just
a superhero now.

529
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,880
She is a symbol.

530
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,173
Representation matters.

531
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:10,760
She's #BraveMaeve.

532
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,471
We're recommending
a multipronged image makeover.

533
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,640
First, guest spots on Queer Eye.

534
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,849
Then, an exclusive
"It Gets Better" PSA.

535
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,184
Kimberly Peirce might direct.

536
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,144
Grand marshals at the New York
and Chicago Pride,

537
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,938
because you are two
proud lesbians.

538
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,064
(snaps fingers)

539
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,273
You know Maeve is bi, right?

540
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,608
ASHLEY:
Yeah, you know what?

541
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,068
I just feel like lesbian
is a bit of an easier sell.

542
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,653
A bit more cut-and-dry.

543
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,071
-Now, for Elena...
-Me?

544
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,364
You're going to love it, yeah.

545
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,740
Why am I a part of this shit?

546
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,868
We are going with
a polished, tailored look.

547
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,620
(Elena sighs)

548
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,664
-That looks like menswear.
-Pew research shows

549
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,040
that two feminine women
in a relationship

550
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,875
sends a problematic message.

551
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,585
Yeah, this isn't
Penthouse Forum.

552
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,462
SETH:
Americans are
more accepting of gays

553
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,215
when they're in a clear-cut
gender role relationship.

554
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,384
-Like Ellen and Portia.
-ELENA: Okay.

555
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,843
Let's get one thing straight.

556
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,931
I have no interest in being
in a public relationship.

557
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,182
Oh, you will be compensated.

558
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,434
I am not for sale.

559
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,604
Really?

560
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,023
You're not going
to say anything?

561
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,159
(smacks lips)

562
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,495
-I'll fix this.
-Yeah.

563
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,956
Elena.

564
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,541
Elena, wait.

565
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,502
If they want a lesbian Ken doll,

566
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,212
they can find someone else.

567
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,966
I am going to cash in
my vacation days

568
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,050
and go stay with my sister.

569
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,052
No. You can't do that.

570
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,888
Why? I'm not under contract.

571
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,890
This is Homelander.

572
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,184
Okay? And he's fucking with me.

573
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,853
And if you go out there,

574
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:48,274
Elena, there is nowhere you can
go that he won't find you.

575
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,650
Please.

576
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,444
Stay.

577
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,488
I can't protect you
if you leave.

578
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,617
But what are we gonna do?

579
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,161
(Elena sighs)

580
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,331
We're gonna take
that motherfucker down.

581
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,126
-You trust me?
-Yeah.

582
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,423
(indistinct radio chatter)

583
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,845
Okay.

584
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,430
Is this right?

585
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:23,976
Just like Home Alone
except way less delightful.

586
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,647
Butcher?

587
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,567
No.

588
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,570
It ain't right.

589
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,199
What's going on?

590
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,618
That ninja cunt's here
for me, isn't he?

591
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,746
Yeah, but you can't go
out there-- he'll kill you.

592
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,627
(scoffs)
So...

593
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,337
So that's it?

594
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,715
Expecting a happy ending,
were we?

595
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,926
Well, I'm sorry, Hughie.

596
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,929
It ain't that kind
of massage parlor.

597
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,182
Now, I can keep him busy
for a little while, yeah?

598
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,935
Give you lot a chance to leg it.

599
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,230
I'm knackered.

600
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,734
I could use a little lie-down.

601
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,614
Fuck you.

602
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,032
What, am I supposed
to be impressed

603
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,284
by this blaze of glory
jerk-off shit?

604
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,744
Guess not.

605
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:27,081
You don't think I thought
about cashing it in after Robin?

606
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,125
'Cause I do.

607
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,045
Still.

608
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,089
A lot.

609
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:41,178
But I don't.

610
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,682
(scoffs)

611
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:49,186
And the thing that kills me
is that your wife is alive.

612
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,730
She just doesn't want you,
that's all.

613
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,109
Say that again.

614
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,569
So you don't have shit.

615
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,196
Welcome to the fucking club.

616
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:03,242
I mean, come on, what do, what
do any of us have? Besides...

617
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,748
Who the fuck asked you
to come here?

618
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,876
Eh?

619
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,045
I don't need your help.

620
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,590
Jesus, you're fucking pathetic.

621
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,926
You're so scared
of being alone, Hughie.

622
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,595
First you latch onto Robin,

623
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,305
then Starlight, and now me.

624
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,806
Well, you know what, son?

625
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,476
I ain't interested.

626
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:38,319
Look, just get out
of the fucking way.

627
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,826
Don't make me move you.

628
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,371
You can move him,

629
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,874
but good luck with me.

630
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,510
(car horns honking in distance)

631
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,618
Que se passe-t-il?

632
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,084
She wanted the job.

633
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,086
You have her doing hits?

634
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,922
The Albanians
have her doing hits.

635
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,466
I'm just a girl
getting ten percent.

636
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,802
-You...
-(quietly): I'm sorry, pumpkin,

637
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,721
but I told you,

638
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,516
she's no kitten.

639
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,185
She can make her own choices.

640
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,565
Why?

641
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,028
How is this stopping Stormfront?

642
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,407
I know you blame yourself
for your brother,

643
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,659
I know the rage you feel,

644
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:12,788
but this... this is not the way.

645
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,623
This is poison for your soul.

646
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,083
I know.

647
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,799
Come with me, mon coeur.

648
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:30,264
I got my own baby brother
killed!

649
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,060
He was the only thing
that mattered to me!

650
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,314
Stop trying to help me!

651
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,691
I don't want your help!

652
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,610
I don't understand
what you're saying

653
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,695
because you won't teach me!

654
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,287
Fuck this.

655
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,913
Fuck you.

656
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,586
Go be a monster.

657
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,723
DEEP:
Remember when you were young

658
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,309
and the world was full
of possibilities?

659
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,852
Before all the mistakes,

660
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,647
heartbreaks
and disappointments?

661
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,067
What if you could go back
to the way things were?

662
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,488
I used to be angry,
insecure and unsure.

663
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,448
But thanks to the Church
of the Collective,

664
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,409
I now know the kind of man
I want to be.

665
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,495
The kind of man
who calls out injustice

666
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,288
-when he sees it.
-WOMAN: Stop.

667
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,457
-MAN: Come on.
-Hey, dude.

668
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,959
That's not cool.

669
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,296
The kind of man who stands up
for what's right.

670
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,633
Come on, guys, knock it off.

671
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:50,636
The kind of man who sees
the potential in all of us.

672
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:53,305
So join us at the
Church of the Collective,

673
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:56,725
and be the person
you were always meant to be.

674
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,234
(scoffs)

675
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,361
That's a bunch of bullshit.

676
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:08,570
STORMFRONT:
Didn't used to be.

677
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,364
Church used to mean something.

678
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,157
Oh, what, are you a member?

679
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,660
I was, long time ago.

680
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:15,786
Hmm.

681
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,913
That place used to be pure.

682
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,834
And then they just started
letting all kinds of people in,

683
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,378
you know?

684
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,047
I don't know.

685
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,259
So, why don't you tell me?

686
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,428
Well, I think you do know.

687
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,306
Some people are quality
and others are...

688
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,350
garbage.

689
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,144
-(bell rings)
-MAN: We are rolling.

690
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,146
Oh, by the way,

691
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,732
I heard they're retiring you?

692
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,610
So unfair.

693
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,574
Do you have a problem?

694
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,659
Of course not.
Why would you say that?

695
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,662
(slurping)

696
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,040
Can I have a word? Please?

697
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,712
Adam tells me you don't
want to do the scene.

698
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,881
I just can't be a part
of something I don't believe in.

699
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,550
Look, I know it's not easy
losing your job. Okay?

700
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,011
When I got fired, I tindered
my way through Barcelona.

701
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,388
Everyone in that city
ate my paella.

702
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,890
Fucked a guy with elephantiasis.

703
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,893
But I got through it,
and so will you.

704
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,352
Yeah, but I'm still
making it happen.

705
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,229
I mean, my A-Trainers sell
how many fucking pairs per year?

706
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,564
Look on the bright side--

707
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,399
you served four years longer
than Mr. Marathon.

708
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,318
Now, that is something, okay.

709
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,197
But... please.

710
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,074
Let me just...
talk to Homelander.

711
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,702
We both know
that's not a good idea.

712
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,496
I'm sorry.

713
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,290
I'm not saying the lines.

714
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,793
Okay, this can go
one of two ways.

715
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,753
One: You leave The Seven
with your dignity

716
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,296
and your severance package
intact.

717
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,590
Or two: You get fired

718
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:52,925
for breaching
your morality clause

719
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,551
by shooting up Compound V

720
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,136
and giving yourself
a fucking heart attack

721
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,096
in the fucking process.

722
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,349
It's your choice.

723
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,403
A-TRAIN:
You know, the truth is...

724
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,073
I've been running my whole life.

725
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,410
Think it's time
that I stay put for a while.

726
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,372
It's time I went home.

727
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,917
I know this is
dawn of The Seven.

728
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,505
But it's sunset on A-Train.

729
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,591
It's been a good run.

730
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,884
BOURKE:
Cut!

731
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:38,178
(bell rings)

732
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,389
Hey, dude. That was awesome.

733
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,226
Awesome?
A-Dog, that was fucking gold.

734
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:47,396
Buddy, look, I'm ready
to move on, but how do you feel?

735
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,856
You want another one?
Just let me know.

736
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,817
No, man, go ahead and move on.

737
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,026
All right, check it! Moving on!

738
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,736
Tiffany, we need you
over at Mo-cap.

739
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,946
-MAN: Good day.
-TIFFANY: Yeah,
going over there now.

740
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,447
(overlapping chatter)

741
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,782
NEUMAN (over speaker):
Yes, it's true.

742
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,411
Vought has all the money
and the power.

743
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,289
And we have,
no offense, jack shit.

744
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,456
-(laughter)
-MAN: We love you, Victoria!

745
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,543
But after Homelander's
war crime...

746
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,961
(crowd clamoring)

747
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,754
...how can I stay quiet

748
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,965
and still look my daughter
in the eyes?

749
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,884
I can't. I know you can't.

750
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,093
And guess what.

751
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:21,179
The House Judiciary
can't either!

752
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,723
Finally!

753
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,474
We are going to hold hearings

754
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,519
-on Vought and Compound V!
-(applause and cheering)

755
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,563
Yes! Yes!

756
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:32,232
(crowd gasps)

757
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,734
(crowd quiets)

758
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,694
Hey, everyone.

759
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,992
May I?

760
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,829
Thank you.

761
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,582
Congresswoman Neuman, everybody.

762
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,709
Isn't she great?
Didn't you love that little

763
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,837
"Walk Like an Egyptian" dance
she did online?

764
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,464
So fun.

765
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,007
I loved it.

766
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:59,301
But fun is not what
we're here for, is it?

767
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,011
-No, no, no, no, no, fuck.
-Let me just start by saying

768
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,221
how pleased I am
to see you all here.

769
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,307
Everyone get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

770
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,225
-Fuck you. Get out.
-...that we live in a country

771
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,645
where all your voices
can be heard.

772
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,897
I know that some of you
are a little upset

773
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:15,442
by that video online
of me stopping the terrorist,

774
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:19,905
and I just want you to know
that I understand.

775
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,282
I'm upset, too.

776
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,409
I mean, come on, guys.

777
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,286
Nobody wants innocent people
to get hurt.

778
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,705
Of course not.

779
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,834
But sadly,

780
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,796
well, the bad guys,

781
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:38,382
they don't think like us.

782
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:44,012
And so, sometimes...

783
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,305
well, these things just happen.

784
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,598
(crowd murmuring)

785
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,433
MAN:
Wait, this happened before?

786
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,978
-MAN 2: How many times?
-Well, no, h-hold on, guys.

787
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,857
My point is, we all have
the same goals, don't we?

788
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,443
-To keep our country safe.
-(shuddering): No.

789

WOMAN:
So American lives are
the only ones worth protecting?

790
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,823
Of course not.

791
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,826
But if you've served with our
amazing soldiers, like I have,

792
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,830
you would know that freedom
comes at a price.

Everyone just calm down.

Calm down.

Do you really have
those pictures?

988
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,140
Of course I do.

Well, this is food

All right.

996
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,414
Hi.

997

Maeve, oh, my God. Hi.

00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,458
-What brought you here?
-Oh!

999
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,918
Wait, are you...?

1000
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,503
Uh... do you want
to check this out?

1001
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,088
-Oh, fuck no. No.
-Okay.

1002
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,215
Listen, uh, we should talk.

1003
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,425
Yeah.

1004
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:13,052
If any of these Moonies

1005
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,470
are gonna help you
get back in The Seven,

1006
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,764
and that's a big if,

1007
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:19,434
then you're gonna need
a woman to...

1008
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:24,147
tell everyone that you're not
a complete piece of shit.

1009
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,607
I could be that person for you.

1010
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,192
Wait, you think
I'm a piece of shit?

1011
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,402
Fuck yeah.

1012
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:32,113
The point is, I can help you.

1013
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:33,823
If you help me.

1014

-Hmm.
-P.A.: Yeah,

Okay, sorry.
Just trying to help.

She didn't just lie to me

yeah, he stole the V

you leaked it to MSNBC.

gonna feel when I tell them?
