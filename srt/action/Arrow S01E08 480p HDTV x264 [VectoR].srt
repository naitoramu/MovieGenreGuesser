My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,296
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:10,064
to survive.

4
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:11,565
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,101
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,287
to use the list of names
he left me

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,439
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,576

I must become someone else.

invested in doesn't exist.

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,086

a warehouse in Starling City.

[Gasps]

647
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,241
Helena, easy. Easy.

648
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:28,044
You were lucky.

649
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:30,630
Am I supposed
to be grateful?

650
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:31,914
Helena--

651
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:33,099
He's a monster.

652
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:36,019
A criminal.
Why would you save him?

653
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:39,422
I didn't save him.
I saved you.

654
00:36:39,424 --> 00:36:41,441
You think that because
you've killed,

655
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:44,060
you understand what it's like
to have blood on your hands.

656
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:45,678
You don't understand.
You don't understand

657
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,031
the toll
that it takes on you,

658
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,783
especially
when it's your father.

659
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,051
I'm not going to stop.

660
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:54,070
The police
have him in custody.

661
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:56,439
He's going to jail
and then on to prison.

662
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:57,991
They don't have
any evidence on him.

663
00:36:57,993 --> 00:36:59,492
They do now.

664
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,445
The laptop.

665
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:03,897
He's going away, Helena,

666
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,082
for the rest of his life.

667
00:37:06,084 --> 00:37:08,951
This...is justice.

668
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:10,720
Then I guess you were right.

669
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,672
I'm more interested
in revenge.

670
00:37:12,674 --> 00:37:14,924
Stay out of my way, Oliver,

671
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:18,678
or I'll make sure your secret
doesn't stay secret.

672
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,097
Helena.

673
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:26,936
What I did,

674
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:29,072
everything that I've done,

675
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:32,492
I've done because
I care about you.

676
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:38,114
Too bad I can't say
the same.

677
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:51,544
Hey, you.

678
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:52,845
Thanks for the call.

679
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:55,515
What are
ex-sisters-in-law for?

680
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:57,800
Mm.

681
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:05,725
Chili cheese fries
with jalapenos. Hmm.

682
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,863
That's a cry for help
if I've ever seen one.

683
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:12,148
Ahh...

684
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,950
I don't know what hurts worse,

685
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:18,037
this or getting shot
with a curare-laced bullet.

686
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,707
Been there, done that.
Definitely the bullet.

687
00:38:20,709 --> 00:38:22,525
Ah...

688
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:25,128
[Sighs]

689
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,098
You know, Oliver, I'm
no expert at this, but...

690
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,536
I don't think love is about
changing or saving a person.

691
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:35,555
I think it's about
finding the person

692
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:37,340
who's already the right fit.

693
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,345
One day you will.

694
00:38:42,347 --> 00:38:46,549
I think I burnt
that particular bridge.

695
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,651
Napalmed it, actually.

696
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,886
So things didn't work out
exactly as you planned.

697
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,355
You did save
Frank Bertinelli's life.

698
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,107
He'll be doing time
for a while.

699
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,159
Justice wins out.

700
00:38:56,161 --> 00:39:00,563
Helena
doesn't see it that way.

701
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:04,233
You opened up,
took a risk with your heart.

702
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:06,736
The Oliver I met
a few months ago

703
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:10,072
would not have been
able to do that.

704
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:12,608
And when you meet
the right person,

705
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,744
you'll be ready for her.

706
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:25,888
[Both laughing]

707
00:39:29,777 --> 00:39:31,194
What are you doing?

708
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:33,279
It needs to be dark in here
for me to do this.

709
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:35,565
If I had had more time
to think of that sentence

710
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,617
it wouldn't have sounded
so dirty.

711
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,101
Look.

712
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:46,292
I don't see anything.

713
00:39:46,294 --> 00:39:47,877
I got these
from applied sciences.

714
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:49,629
They're able to pick up
the subvisible variations

715
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:51,664
in the UV spectrum.

716
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,751
Now look at the book again.

717
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:13,469
[Thunder]

718
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:20,993
Hi.

719
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:22,912
Now, look,

720
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:24,664
I'm sorry about last night.

721
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,816
It just--I let it
get too far

722
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:29,168
sitting at the same table.
That was...

723
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,453
that was stupid.

724
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:34,257
No. I was stupid.

725
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:38,494
I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

726
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,131
My dad cut me off.

727
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:43,966
He froze all my funds.

728
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:47,303
I am living on fumes.

729
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:48,805
Really?

730
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,507
Why didn't you
say anything?

731
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,276
Embarrassment,
shame, jealousy,

732
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:56,779
probably a few other emotions
I'm not used to feeling.

733
00:40:56,781 --> 00:40:59,198
Tommy, my trust fund
is your trust fund.

734
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:01,901
No.

735
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:04,153
That is the easy answer.

736
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:08,374
And believe me,
I have loved easy answers.

737
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:10,376
What I need is a job.

738
00:41:12,529 --> 00:41:14,213
I'm trying to change.

739
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:18,200
Not sure into what yet,
but...

740
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:21,254
I don't want to be
what I was anymore.

741
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,340
It just so happens
that I have

742
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,041
a general manager
position

743
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:28,377
that is available.

744
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:31,514
You're probably
the guy for the job.

745
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:33,516
Will I be getting dental?
This smile wasn't cheap.

746
00:41:33,518 --> 00:41:36,602
I'll look into that.
Thank you.

747
00:41:36,604 --> 00:41:38,070
Thank you.

748
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:40,022
You're welcome.

749
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,078
You okay?

750
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,414
I will be.

751
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,116
Something happen with Helena?

752
00:41:50,118 --> 00:41:52,218
We had a falling out.

753
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,906
But I have a feeling that
I will be seeing her again.

754
00:41:57,326 --> 00:42:02,326
