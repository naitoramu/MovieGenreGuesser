1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,083
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,206
No, Adrian!

3
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,879
The two of you are
working for Ricardo Diaz.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,797
You're both fired
effective immediately.

5
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,294
<i>Obviously, the Mayor terminated us
to impede the prosecution</i>

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,803
<i>of his activities
as the Green Arrow.</i>

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,302
<i>What Oliver Queen did
is an impeachable offense.</i>

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,759
The way you lead alienates everyone

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,644
and everything around you. Look...

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,643
You put the team at risk by lying.

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,647
You leave a trail of bodies
every damn place that you go.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,946
My trail of bodies
does not include my own brother.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,989
Truth is, Oliver, you have
become a better man,

14
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,533
but with your focus split,

15
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,076
a worse leader.

16
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,246
If I'm gonna be the best version
of myself, it can't be with you.

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,251
You told Rebecca what's going on?

18
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,128
You kidding?
She'd have my nuts in a vise

19
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,375
if she knows I was on the take.

20
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,331
She doesn't get it.
It's a different city now.

21
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,415
It's a different world.

22
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,255
We better call back up.

23
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,633
- It might just be a power surge.
- It's not. Call back up now.

24
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,142
What the hell?

25
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,849
Come on out, you son of a bitch.

26
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,518
Where's Diaz?

27
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,520
Somewhere inside
surrounded by 100 cops.

28
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,813
You'll never get...

29
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,902
- He's here.
- That was predictable.

30
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,614
Lockdown mode, now. Protect Diaz.

31
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,892
Where's Diaz?

32
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,941
Where's Diaz?

33
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,022
In there.

34
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,451
This is gonna be fun.

35
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,346
<i>Allies are in short supply
for Mayor Queen as the city reacts</i>

36
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,175
<i>in the wake of the sudden
firing of Captain Kimberly Hill</i>

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,554
<i>and D.A. Samir Armand.</i>

38
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,554
<i>Though City Hall maintains
the firings had no relation</i>

39
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,139
<i>to the ongoing investigation</i>

40
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,350
<i>into the Mayor's reputed
vigilantism as the Green Arrow,</i>

41
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:36,529
<i>sources within the City Council say
that impeachment is highly possible.</i>

42
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,610
You know, they can't
actually impeach you for firing

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,236
two people on Diaz's payroll.

44
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,077
They can if they claim
I did it to protect myself.

45
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:47,867
We need rock-solid proof
that they're working for Diaz.

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,949
That's why you have me.

47
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,580
But in the meantime,
I have something else.

48
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,251
I just have some more evidence on
how Diaz has corrupted the SCPD.

49
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,628
So, ever since Dinah and
company got fired,

50
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,756
I have been monitoring
the station's internal security feed.

51
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,132
Every night at 10:13,

52
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,430
this happens.

53
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,507
Whoop!

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,012
Forty-five minutes later,

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,473
the feed goes back online
like clockwork.

56
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,687
He's monitoring his minions-in-blue.

57
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,065
- He's gotta be.
- I agree.

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,521
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,022
you need to stop
thinking it right now. It's bad.

60
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,400
I can't make a move
on Diaz unless I know where he is.

61
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,032
And you just told me where he is
every night at 10:13.

62
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,236
You can't storm the bad cop
castle by yourself, Oliver.

63
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,946
- It's suicide.
- If I get Diaz, this is all done.

64
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,499
The investigation,
the corruption, the impeachment...

65
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,121
All of it, I stop all of it.

66
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,828
You can't go there alone.

67
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,379
You will not come out.

68
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,335
You need help.

69
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,712
All of our help quit.

70
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,670
Well, maybe John
has changed his mind.

71
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,629
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,885
Hey, Oliver.

73
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,595
John?

74
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,562
- What do you need?
- Well, Felicity said that

75
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,235
she needed to update
the code on my chip.

76
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,521
She also said that
you would be at City Hall.

77
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,902
Well, I said he might be.

78
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,655
I didn't say he would be.

79
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,861
And, yeah, I parent-trapped you,

80
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,162
but it was a little naive
of you to think that I wouldn't

81
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,864
considering how well
you know me, you know.

82
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,247
Now that we are all together,

83
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,498
we can talk about what happened.

84
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,546
I'm pretty sure John has
said everything he needs to say.

85
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,964
I think you're absolutely right.
I did.

86
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,040
Guys!

87
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,092
This isn't about
what he said, or what he said,

88
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,045
or your egos. We have
bigger problems at hand here.

89
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,300
We need to stop Diaz.

90
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,635
And we have some pretty good intel.

91
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,841
Good intel tends to fall apart

92
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,675
in the hands of bad leadership,
don't you think?

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,557
Oliver, come on,
it doesn't have to be that way.

94
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,096
How would you like it to be?

95
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,308
Well, it doesn't change
the fact that neither of you

96
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,392
can take down Diaz alone.

97
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,277
I think there's more
than one way to catch Diaz.

98
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,863
I've been offered a job at A.R.G.U.S.

99
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,939
Are you gonna take it?

100
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm thinking about it. Why?

101
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,736
Last time you needed something
from A.R.G.U.S., you had to steal it.

102
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,195
Oliver.

103
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,828
You keep that attitude, man,
you're gonna end up all alone.

104
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,043
I have listened to your advice
for the last six years.

105
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,338
I think I've earned a reprieve.

106
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,555
That is not how
I thought that would go.

107
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,677
Sure it was.

108
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,470
This is who he is, Felicity.

109
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,768
And no one knows that more than you.

110
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,683
Elected officials cannot fire

111
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:22,145
the very law enforcement
personnel investigating them.

112
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,777
To do so, is the definition
of obstruction of justice.

113
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,030
Captain Hill and D.A. Armand were
actively sabotaging the city

114
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,202
by allying themselves
with Ricardo Diaz.

115
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,324
I was not obstructing justice.
I was serving it.

116
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,957
From what I understand, Ricardo Diaz
is a second-rate drug dealer

117
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,255
who was released
from prison on a technicality.

118
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,874
I fail to see your point.

119
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,177
The idea that he could
compromise a police captain

120
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,097
and a District Attorney is laughable.

121
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,016
I assume that the Mayor
will get a chance

122
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,095
to address the City Council,
lay out the facts as he sees them?

123
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,977
Preliminary impeachment
proceedings begin this afternoon.

124
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,685
The Mayor will have a chance
to plead his case, of course.

125
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,734
For your sake, Mr. Mayor, and
for the sake of your administration,

126
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,192
I hope you have something
more concrete to offer the council

127
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,324
other than unsupported suspicions.

128
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,038
And I know we haven't
always gotten along,

129
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,087
but I do believe in due process.

130
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,174
I'll make sure the council
approaches this fairly.

131
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,593
I will see you and
the council this afternoon

132
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,715
with evidence.

133
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,969
You mind if I ask
what evidence exactly?

134
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,098
Felicity's working on it.

135
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,850
I guess that's
somewhat reassuring.

136
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,728
On the bright side, if I
get impeached, you get promoted.

137
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,561
I'm not much
of a politician, Oliver.

138
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,818
Well, with Diaz running the city
it's not really politics, is it?

139
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,191
Is that the only thing bothering you?

140
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,275
Diaz?

141
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,160
You've looked better.

142
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,617
John quit.

143
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,537
I'd say he quit the team, but

144
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,207
there's no team.

145
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,003
He seems to think
I'm to blame for that.

146
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,300
- Well, I don't see it that way.
- You're not there, Quentin.

147
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,376
Yeah, I know.

148
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,137
But I was there when
The Hood first showed up, remember?

149
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,682
And that guy bears
very little resemblance

150
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,009
to the guy I'm talking to now.

151
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,560
I mean, look at you, you're
the mayor, you're a family man.

152
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,896
You're out busting
your hump every night for this city.

153
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,482
I've seen how much
you've changed, Oliver.

154
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,809
So, why is all this happening?

155
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,190
Cayden James and Diaz,
they've done a number.

156
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,406
But things will get better.
You just gotta stay the course.

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,401
Where are you going?

158
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,037
Going to check in on Felicity,
see if she's making any progress.

159
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,833
And I promised William that
I'd take him to his science fair.

160
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,789
It's not the best timing.

161
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,620
I think schools plan it that way.

162
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,504
William, you outdid me.

163
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,052
For my science fair project,
all I did was hack Napster.

164
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,174
What's Napster?

165
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,216
Wow, I am getting
older by the minute.

166
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,134
I can't believe you cloned a cabbage.

167
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,720
When I was a girl,
cabbage grew in the ground.

168
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,354
Well, you're a long way
from home, Raisa.

169
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,430
That I know.

170
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,811
I'll put these in the car.

171
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,017
Thank you.

172
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,979
I just really hope it's better than
Sarah Epstein's solar hot dog cooker.

173
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,237
She's really been talking it up.

174
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,190
We're going to be late. Where's Dad?

175
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,274
- He'll be here...
- Hey.

176
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,610
Finally, let's go.

177
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,492
Yeah, I know. I just gotta talk
to Felicity for one second.

178
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,698
- But we're already late.
- Just a minute, I promise.

179
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,411
Council's convening.

180
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,297
I promised them
I would show them something.

181
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,499
Prepare to be happy.

182
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,924
Documentation of threats from Diaz

183
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,173
to Hill's family and
bank statements proving

184
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,050
that he paid for Armand's
son's cancer treatment.

185
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,130
That's it. That's good work.

186
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,931
Yeah, it's really good work.
It might be too good work.

187
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,180
Without the SCPD, the only
person that can really obtain

188
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,351
this type of evidence is...

189
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,145
Well, as far as
the council is concerned, is...

190
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,814
- You.
- Are you telling me that

191
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,937
the single piece
of evidence that will stop

192
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,520
this imminent impeachment
is also the evidence

193
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,570
that will directly connect me
to being the Green Arrow?

194
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,239
I mean, you can tell them that
you're married to a super-hacker.

195
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,315
- It's not funny.
- I know,

196
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,198
I tried to plant a fake trail,
it's just that I ran out of time...

197
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,620
You ran out of time,

198
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,744
because you're focusing
on making John and I reconcile

199
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,541
instead of doing your job.

200
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,584
Hey, I'm on your side here.

201
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,787
- Are you on my side?
- Yes, of course...

202
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,372
- Are you sure you're on my side?
- How can you say something like that?

203
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,456
What is wrong with you?

204
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,631
Dad, you said
you'll only be a minute.

205
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,050
I'm in the middle
of something, please.

206
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,628
- We're gonna be late.
- Well then, we're gonna be late!

207
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,223
Buddy, I'm really sorry.

208
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,230
- Get out.
- Felicity, it was an accident.

209
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,024
I will take care of William.

210
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,609
Get out.

211
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,456
What's wrong?

212
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,133
Looks like you half expected me to be
a member of the League of Assassins.

213
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,463
No, I thought I heard something.

214
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,383
- How's William?
- He won't come out of his room.

215
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,134
Look, I don't...

216
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,221
I have no idea what came over me,

217
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,729
what made me lose it
on him like that.

218
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,152
Everything's piling up.

219
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,480
Yeah, I know.

220
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,274
I think we should
take some space, Oliver.

221
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,500
I'm sorry, what?

222
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,703
How you lost it on William,

223
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,668
that is crossing a line.

224
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,833
I know that you
have a lot on your plate.

225
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,169
Diaz, John, then the impeachment,

226
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,256
but that is no excuse. It can't
be an excuse. He is your son.

227
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,845
And you just showed him
the man his father really is.

228
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,053
That is not the man that I married.

229
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,154
Hey.

230
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:08,912
You okay?

231
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:09,992
Thanks for coming.

232
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,750
Listen, I've... I know
I've said this already, but

233
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,665
you don't look good.

234
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,041
Felicity...

235
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,763
Felicity found proof that

236
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,470
Hill and Armand are in bed with Diaz.

237
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,641
That's great.

238
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,177
It's great.

239
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,722
Why you got a face
that says otherwise?

240
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,024
Council's gonna ask me
how I got that evidence.

241
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,648
And you don't exactly
wanna tell them it's your wife.

242
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:40,072
Just shine a big fat light
on the suspicion I'm the Green Arrow.

243
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,783
What are you gonna do?

244
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,572
I don't know.

245
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,497
My wife wants a separation.

246
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,334
I lost my temper in front of my son.

247
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,413
I scared him.

248
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,045
It was really bad.

249
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,382
Well, you know,
just apologize to the kid,

250
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,304
sleep on the couch
for tonight, and...

251
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,973
A separation just seems
a little extreme.

252
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,473
But, Quentin, with everything
that's been happening,

253
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,014
it feels like par for the course.

254
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,097
You're talking about John Diggle?

255
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,185
John, Curtis, Rene, Dinah...

256
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,315
Why haven't you quit?

257
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,192
The promise of a raise.

258
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,867
You said...

259
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,616
You said I've changed.
I appreciate what you said.

260
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,211
Why does everyone keep leaving me?

261
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,748
It's the thing about change, right?

262
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,670
You hope you're doing the right thing
by becoming a better person,

263
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,472
but you're also
becoming a different person.

264
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,844
Some people, they just...

265
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,309
I guess, like John,
they just react badly.

266
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,931
That's one possibility.

267
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,011
What's the other?

268
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,313
That I haven't really changed at all.

269
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,148
Come on, I don't buy that.

270
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,894
What you told me about John
and Curtis, all those guys,

271
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:00,978
they got their own issues.

272
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,529
They're just putting them on you.

273
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,198
And Felicity?

274
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,735
Felicity loves you, man.

275
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:09,827
That thing with her
and William,

276
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,280
it's gonna blow over.
Don't worry about that.

277
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,324
My advice,

278
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,786
you just gotta focus on what's
right in front of us now, okay?

279
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm gonna reach out
to Samanda Watson.

280
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,627
Maybe she can help cover us on this.

281
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,004
Quentin, the woman
wants me in prison.

282
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,801
But she also wants justice, right?

283
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,379
Taking down a crime boss
who's overrun a city

284
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,181
seems to fit the bill in my eyes.

285
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,884
Yeah, call her.

286
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,895
Now, listen.

287
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,893
That council meeting's in an hour.

288
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,190
I gotta focus.

289
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,944
I gotta push this stuff
out of my head, but I'll be there.

290
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,687
See you back at City Hall.

291
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,344
Hello, Oliver.

292
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,554
Long time.

293
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,019
No, you...

294
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,059
You killed yourself.

295
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,310
Funny thing.

296
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,988
You never did go back for my body.

297
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,782
Guess you were
somewhat preoccupied, right?

298
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,317
Still

299
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,028
seems a little careless.

300
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,114
Come on, man.

301
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,996
You've seen people come back from
what seemed like certain death.

302
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,619
As I recall,

303
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,629
you once were stabbed

304
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,714
and fell off of a mountain,

305
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,337
yet, here you are.

306
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,750
Do it.

307
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,415
I didn't last time.

308
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,967
And then I killed
the mother of your son.

309
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,674
I'm not playing games this time.

310
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,891
This time, I'm coming
for you and Felicity and William.

311
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,137
Anyone and everyone
who's ever been close to you.

312
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,062
There's only one way
that you can stop me.

313
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,636
Now, wasn't that better?

314
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,354
You know,

315
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,767
you might just have to
start considering the possibility

316
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,443
that I'm just not killable, Oliver.

317
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,191
No, Adrian.

318
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:36,985
You're dead.

319
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,576
You're still on Lian Yu.

320
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,091
I'm hallucinating.

321
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,399
I knew you'd kill me.

322
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,064
Or try to.

323
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,985
I always was the one person
who saw you for the murderer you are.

324
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,274
What are you doing?

325
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,193
Oh.

326
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,154
You're running a blood test.

327
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,286
You think you've been
dosed with something.

328
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,575
You know,

329
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,954
there is another explanation,
a more likely one,

330
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,084
in my considered opinion.

331
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,509
You're finally going crazy.

332
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,009
It's completely understandable,
Ollie, you've lost every thing,

333
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,799
even the people I couldn't
manage to take from you.

334
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,559
I really like this Ricardo Diaz.

335
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,807
If he didn't exist, I'd have to
think him up myself.

336
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,146
He's going about
all this exactly right.

337
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,227
Don't hurt the people that you love,

338
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,439
just get them all to abandon you.

339
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,024
It's actually the easiest
thing in the world.

340
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,452
I told you this, Ollie,
I told you this, man.

341
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,121
Everything you touch dies.

342
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,579
What you're going through right now,

343
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,911
losing your team, your wife,

344
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,621
the impeachment, all of it,

345
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,458
it's happening just like
I told you it would.

346
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:18,713
And nothing in that
blood test is gonna change that.

347
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,635
Well?

348
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,095
Vertigo.

349
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,399
It was absorbed through my...

350
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,439
Kullens.

351
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,607
Friend of yours?

352
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,609
Apparently not.

353
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,957
Don't. Don't go talk to Quentin.

354
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,585
You're not in the state of mind
to be talking to him right now.

355
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,506
He might have you committed,

356
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,884
which would be a shame,

357
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,008
since by my count, he's the only
person still left in your corner.

358
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,298
Okay, Felicity,
William and I will be fine.

359
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,758
I just need to talk to them.

360
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,388
Maybe. But what about the rest?

361
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,186
It's tough to say
you're in a good place

362
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,229
when your oldest friend
leaves you high and dry.

363
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,557
John made his choice.

364
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,643
Deep down, you know he's right.

365
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,944
You've changed, sure.

366
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,027
Maybe you are a better Oliver Queen,

367
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,951
a happier Oliver Queen.

368
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,325
But it has sure made you
a worse hero.

369
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,326
You have a wife, a son,

370
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,878
you're the mayor,
all of which, yes, may be going away,

371
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,251
but still, it's a fair assumption

372
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,552
you're stretched too thin, buddy.

373
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,264
Maybe you've gotten so good
at being Oliver Queen,

374
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,060
that the Green Arrow's
mission is suffering.

375
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:52,189
You may be happier,
but the people that you love,

376
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,807
they're not.

377
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,481
Hey, what's Vertigo do?

378
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,189
Does it show you your worst fear?

379
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,319
You're not my worst fear, Adrian.

380
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,660
You're nowhere close.

381
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,529
Oh.

382
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,540
I know. Your worst fear is yourself.

383
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,955
Your worst enemy is yourself.

384
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:19,045
Guys like me, Ricardo Diaz,
Damien Darhk, Ra's al Ghul...

385
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,801
When it comes
to destroying you, Oliver,

386
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,089
we all come in second place.

387
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,726
You're the one enemy
you can't defeat.

388
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:44,983
Yes, Quentin.

389
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,989
Hearing's about to start,
where the hell are you?

390
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,494
Well, Kullens dosed me with Vertigo,
and I've been dealing with it.

391
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,372
Didn't you say that Diaz was
dealing Vertigo these days?

392
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,920
Well, Kullens is working
for Diaz apparently.

393
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,214
<i>Now, listen.
Where are we with Agent Watson?</i>

394
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,507
She's mulling it over.

395
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,800
She gotta mull faster.

396
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,127
<i>All right, I'll give her
another call.</i>

397
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,587
Listen, just get down here
as fast as you can. All right?

398
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,671
I'm on my way.

399
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,031
Ollie.

400
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,962
Why are you looking at me like that?

401
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,347
Ollie, are you okay?

402
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,599
I don't know.

403
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,846
You know, if you tell her the truth,

404
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,054
she'll just think
you're crazy, Oliver.

405
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,272
You'll break her heart
all over again, nobody wants that.

406
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,818
Hey. Hey, you can
tell me anything, you know that.

407
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,524
I know that.

408
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,816
I need to leave.

409
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,321
I thought the boat left at 6:00.

410
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,777
What?

411
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,864
The <i>Gambit.</i> The trip that you're
going on with your father.

412
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,575
I ran into Sara. She said
that you hadn't packed yet.

413
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,785
Do you want me to help you?

414
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,745
Look at how innocent she was,
how much she loved you.

415
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,964
You destroyed that.

416
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,542
- Ollie?
- Tell her about her future, man.

417
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,674
Tell her about what happens
when she becomes the Black Canary.

418
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,550
<i>Ollie, please help me.</i>

419
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,844
Please, I'm scared.

420
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,426
I don't wanna die.

421
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,769
This is gonna destroy my father.

422
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,475
He can't handle this.

423
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:39,974
She's got a point.

424
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,942
My question is,

425
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,192
why did you let her become
the Black Canary in the first place?

426
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,981
She's a lawyer!

427
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,067
What, after a couple
of self-defense classes,

428
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,651
and a few sparring sessions with you,

429
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,283
you think she's ready
to go handle thugs and killers?

430
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:58,992
It was a mistake.

431
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,452
Yeah, your mistake.

432
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,037
Which I had to pay for.

433
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,167
It was a mistake.

434
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,339
But I knew you.

435
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:13,223
And I knew that you'd
do it with or without me.

436
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,139
I thought this way
I could protect you.

437
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,346
How did that work out for you, Ollie?
Huh?

438
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,478
Yeah, "Ollie."

439
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,400
How'd that work out for you?

440
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,069
For me, not too good.

441
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,854
Mmm-mmm. I gave you an out.

442
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,070
I told you to stand down.

443
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,734
- Stay down!
- No way!

444
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,164
You know,
John came to see me in here.

445
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,783
Felicity, too.

446
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,543
But you were nowhere, hoss.

447
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,995
He's got a point, Oliver.

448
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,171
If your conscience
is so sparkly clean,

449
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,418
why didn't you check on Rene?

450
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,295
Rene made it clear...

451
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,177
Matter of fact,
all of you have made it clear

452
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,754
that you don't want
anything to do with me.

453
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,339
Always a comeback for everything.

454
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,674
That's enough.

455
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,343
It's not real.

456
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,684
Raisa?

457
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,023
It's not safe here for you.

458
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,366
A man came.

459
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,991
Hey, hey, hey.

460
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,162
Raisa, what man?

461
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,955
With a dragon tattoo.

462
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,333
He wants to hurt you.

463
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,837
I tried to stop him.

464
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,838
Well, the lady wouldn't
go down without a fight.

465
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,053
Your wife and kid aren't here.

466
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,473
They're at some science fair.

467
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,266
Come on, come on, come on.

468
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,810
You still think this isn't real?

469
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,727
Does that feel real enough for you?

470
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,894
Argh!

471
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,612
I always wonder

472
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,815
why nobody just does that.

473
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,742
Kill you straight.

474
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,286
Turns out it'd be a waste of time.

475
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,952
You're more dangerous as a martyr

476
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,325
than you are as Green Arrow.

477
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,786
But before that happens,

478
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,585
there's a lot left of you

479
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,008
that I wanna break.

480
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,967
Yeah, Quentin, hi. I'm gonna
need that hearing delayed.

481
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,629
I'll explain everything.
I'm on my way to City Hall.

482
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,100
You have failed this city.

483
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,888
And you know why.

484
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,976
Because I got away from you.

485
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,900
We were never
supposed to have partners.

486
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,694
There was never
supposed to be a John Diggle,

487
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,988
a Felicity Smoak,

488
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,070
a Team Arrow.

489
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,702
There was never
supposed to be a Green Arrow.

490
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,034
There was only the mission.

491
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,786
I lost sight of that.

492
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,162
You lost your city!

493
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,922
And now, you know what you have to do

494
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,465
to get it back.

495
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,676
It's been over an hour.

496
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,311
Where is the Mayor?

497
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,356
Well, why don't you ask Ricardo Diaz?

498
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,310
Apologies for being late.

499
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,273
Over an hour late.

500
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,607
And we certainly hope you've come
with something worthy of our time.

501
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,650
One minute.

502
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,240
- Are you all right?
- No.

503
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,748
Where are we with Watson?

504
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,784
We're on our own.

505
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,709
It's our only card.

506
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,294
Are you sure you wanna play it?

507
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,215
It's our only card.

508
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,351
Mr. Mayor...

509
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,649
Okay, this flash drive

510
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,278
contains financial data
and correspondence

511
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:41,191
linking Captain Hill and D.A. Armand

512
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,615
with a known felon
named Ricardo Diaz.

513
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,241
Known by whom?

514
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,493
I've never heard of a Ricardo Diaz.

515
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,792
By design, he's kept
a very low profile.

516
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,044
How did you obtain
this purported evidence

517
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,919
against our former
police captain and district attorney?

518
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,302
The Green Arrow gave it to me.

519
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,006
Or perhaps, you gave it to yourself.

520
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,136
I'm not the Green Arrow.

521
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:09,640
Not according to the police captain
or D.A. that you fired.

522
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,222
And it also seems rather convenient

523
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,436
that you're not the Green Arrow,

524
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,395
but enjoy a close,
personal relationship with him.

525
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,606
That go down how you expected?

526
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,738
Are you aware we can impeach you
not just for obstruction of justice,

527
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,869
but for perjury
and vigilantism, as well?

528
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,827
Okay, I am so sorry, but something
very urgent has just come in,

529
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,378
and I need to speak
to the Mayor, please.

530
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,454
So, please...

531
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,627
Ten minutes tops.

532
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,250
Thank you.

533
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,806
Wait, what's happening.
Are Felicity and William all right?

534
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,884
Listen, the urgent thing was
just a line to buy us some time.

535
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,434
Felicity and William are fine.

536
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,475
Okay? It is you I'm worried about.

537
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,477
Have you still got that
Vertigo crap in your system?

538
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,268
Yeah.

539
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:02,231
Okay, listen, we need to retreat,
we need to regroup.

540
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,360
Okay? So I'm gonna go back in there

541
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,908
and I'm gonna tell them you've
got a family emergency.

542
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,285
You might not be wrong.

543
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,118
Okay, listen, you need to
go back to your secret lair,

544
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,116
get yourself well.

545
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,084
We'll figure out the next steps.

546
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,417
Sorry, Oliver.

547
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,047
Bad beat.

548
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,056
For what it's worth, I always thought
you were a halfway decent mayor.

549
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,558
Not a great track record when
it comes to hiring D.A.s, though.

550
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,234
This Vertigo is going to be
out of my system eventually.

551
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,821
Then you'll be gone.

552
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,691
Not possible.

553
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,283
I'm not here, remember?

554
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,123
I'm here.

555
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,122
I'm you.

556
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,625
Which is why
you're gonna listen to me

557
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,298
when I tell you what you have to do.

558
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,464
The only way to prove
that you're the hero

559
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:09,969
that you say you are and keep being
mayor is to take down Diaz, tonight.

560
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,549
No, he's got an army.

561
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,885
You mean all those cops at the SCPD?

562
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,845
I mean that walking
in there is a suicide mission.

563
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,023
That's the risk
a hero takes, isn't it, Oliver?

564
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,982
Diaz is there every night, 10:13 p.m.

565
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:24,820
Question is,

566
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,024
will you be there to meet him?

567
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,629
Thanks for helping me
put my project back together.

568
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,705
No problemo.

569
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,335
Second place too. Pretty good

570
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,214
even if that cheater
Sarah Epstein got the gold

571
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:51,093
for her solar hot dog cooker
that I swear I've seen on Amazon.

572
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,387
You know, when I was your age,
I could hit three science fairs a day

573
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:01,600
and now one...
One knocks me right out.

574
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,142
Where's Dad?

575
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,228
He's buying us expensive gifts
if he knows what's good for him.

576
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,322
Your purse is beeping.

577
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,448
William, go play video games.

578
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,155
I gotta do some work,
buddy, all right? Sorry.

579
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,411
I know what kind of work. Good luck.

580
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,496
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

581
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,669
- Quentin.
- Felicity.

582
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:30,924
<i>Tell me Oliver's with you.</i>

583
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,050
He was.

584
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,381
I just sent him back to the bunker.

585
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,591
No, he's not on his way there.

586
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,266
I have a GPS on his bow
and it's on the move.

587
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,639
<i>All right, slow
down, let me explain.</i>

588
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,936
<i>It has been a hell of an afternoon.</i>

589
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,935
- What happened?
- Oliver was dosed with Vertigo.

590
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,141
<i>Kullens did it.</i>

591
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,817
That would explain
why he lost it on William.

592
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,065
He said you... You kicked him out?

593
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,441
No, I didn't. I would never...

594
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,319
He's on his way to the precinct.

595
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,492
And that's totally my fault. I told
him that Diaz would be there.

596
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,739
<i>Quentin, this is a suicide
mission. You have to stop him.</i>

597
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,071
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

598
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,699
What's happening? Is Dad all right?

599
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,201
No, Dad is on drugs.

600
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,206
I mean, not that kind of drugs.
He's gonna be fine.

601
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,503
I just... I have to
go help him, okay?

602
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,047
I know, I was listening.

603
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,253
You're an angel.

604
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,676
Okay. I love you. You're an angel.

605
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,424
Hey.

606
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,676
Get out of here, Quentin.

607
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,977
What're you doing in that old thing?

608
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,850
Getting back to my original mission.

609
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,181
Okay, listen,
that's just the Vertigo talking.

610
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,265
You cannot go in there.

611
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,566
This ends tonight.

612
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,268
No, even if you weren't high,
this would be a bad idea.

613
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,352
You're outnumbered!

614
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,437
- I can handle it.
- Listen to me...

615
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,738
I said...

616
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,903
I can handle it.

617
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,417
Quentin? Quentin!

618
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,920
Hey, you okay?

619
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,921
Yeah, your husband packs a punch.

620
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,674
Diaz's men cannot find
the Deputy Mayor here.

621
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,220
Okay, you have to
get out of here, all right?

622
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,006
I have to go save my husband.

623
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,087
Don't, don't, don't.

624
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,302
Do not open that door.

625
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,220
On the other side of that door,
there's a bunch of

626
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,847
trigger-happy cops
just waiting for you.

627
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:43,928
It is a trap.

628
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,014
- You're not here.
- Yes, I am. It's me.

629
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,685
Okay? It's the real me.

630
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,064
Do not go through that door.

631
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,361
I have to.

632
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,776
- I have to stop Diaz.
- And you will.

633
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,448
But not like this, not tonight.

634
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,618
He's right on the other side
of that door.

635
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,786
So are a bunch of
angry cops just waiting for you.

636
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,330
You go through that door,
what happens to William?

637
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,406
William has you.

638
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,208
Well, what happens to me?

639
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,082
You left.

640
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,333
No, I didn't.

641
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,504
That was not me, Oliver.

642
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,548
The real me is standing right here.

643
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,425
And I'm not going anywhere.

644
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,847
I'm glue, baby.

645
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,258
Please.

646
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,345
Where are you?

647
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,439
The Vertigo is making its way
through your system, okay?

648
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,392
It's on its last gasp, so just...

649
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,944
Just listen. Listen to my voice.

650
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,486
No, no, no, don't listen to her.

651
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,153
Remember what you told yourself.

652
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,076
You were never
supposed to have partners.

653
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,700
I know it feels like
you've lost everything.

654
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,410
I don't know how to tell
if you're real.

655
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,416
That's the Vertigo, it's just
messing with your head.

656
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,459
Don't trust it.

657
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,791
Okay? Listen to your heart.

658
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,269
Come on.

659
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,400
Screw it.

660
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:19,857
Go after him.

661
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,115
- Come on.
- Just like old times.

662
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,198
Thanks for coming back for me.

663
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,957
- Okay, less thanking, more escaping!
- Right!

664
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,927
What's this?

665
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,433
It's an isotonic concoction
of my own making.

666
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,764
There are oranges
in there for vitamin C,

667
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,019
there's almonds
in there for Vitamin E,

668
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,273
there's avocado in there
for omega-3s, do not smell it.

669
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,353
Just drink it.

670
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,650
It's salty.

671
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,905
Yeah, that'd be
the fermented fish oils.

672
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,741
It's supposed to help
balance your serotonin levels.

673
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,493
I call it "Felicity's Party
Raver Hangover Supreme Cure."

674
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,783
Though that might be
an insensitive choice of words,

675
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,869
considering what you went through,
but trust me, it works like a charm,

676
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,794
not that I've used it much,
I mean, that was all in the past.

677
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,122
Trust me.

678
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,667
Drugs are bad.

679
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,344
Listen, that was gutsy as hell, you
going into the precinct like that.

680
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,762
Yeah, well, my man was in there.

681
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,384
Yeah, but whatever you said there

682
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,966
could have been caught
on security cameras.

683
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,392
No, Diaz had shut them down.

684
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,144
So, our identities are safe.

685
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,226
Irony sold separately.

686
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,683
Excuse me, I gotta take this.
It's the office.

687
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,856
I haven't seen that in a while.

688
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,822
Wanted to take it for a spin down
memory lane or something?

689
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,194
Something like that.

690
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,193
Vertigo gave me some

691
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,528
clarity.

692
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,033
- Sure you're not still high?
- Mmm-hmm.

693
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,949
John had a point.

694
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,826
I've spread myself pretty thin.

695
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,923
I'm not giving up on you,
I'm not giving up on William,

696
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,670
and if by some miracle
I'm not impeached,

697
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,927
I will keep being the mayor.

698
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,970
I believe deeply in the good

699
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,396
that I can do as the Green Arrow.

700
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,313
But I need to bring
the mission back to basics.

701
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,234
I need to bring it back
to where it started.

702
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,739
You mean alone?

703
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:29,278
Alone.

704
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,539
I'm sorry, guys, I hate to interrupt,

705
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,708
but we have to turn the TV on. News.

706
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,874
<i>In a shocking fall from grace,</i>

707
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,331
<i>the Star City Council
has voted to impeach</i>

708
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,008
<i>Mayor Oliver Queen and
remove him from office.</i>

709
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,133
<i>We now go live to Councilman
Kullens' public statement.</i>

710
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,720
<i>Mr. Queen's affect
at today's inquiry</i>

711
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,682
<i>certainly placed his
fitness for office into question,</i>

712
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,481
<i>but fundamentally,
it was the unilateral firing</i>

713
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:03,321
<i>of Captain Hill and D.A. Armand
that ultimately sealed his fate.</i>

714
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,695
Sorry, I just couldn't stand to
listen to him any longer.

715
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,737
Okay, listen,
I'm gonna call Jean Loring.

716
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,196
There's gotta be legal
options we can pursue.

717
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,280
No.

718
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,622
I don't want you wasting any more
time or political capital on me.

719
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,453
I don't give a crap
about political capital.

720
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,537
You should.

721
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,090
'Cause you're the mayor now.

722
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,139
Thank you so much, Raisa,
for coming on such short notice.

723
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,468
- I'm used to it.
- Thank you, Raisa.

724
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,969
Are you okay, Oliver?

725
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,395
I'll be just fine, thank you.

726
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,644
I know this question
might be questionable, but...

727
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,770
From what it sounded like earlier,

728
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,407
it's like you were firing Overwatch.

729
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:49,859
I'm not firing anyone.

730
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,070
It's just...

731
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,950
I need to go back

732
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,703
to doing things
like I did when I started.

733
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,126
And that means

734
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,125
doing it alone.

735
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,585
I need to stop Diaz.

736
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:10,630
And in order to do that, I need
to have a single-minded focus.

737
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,512
I've gotta separate these two worlds.

738
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,518
I just don't think
that's the best possible solution.

739
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,846
I respect your concern,

740
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,227
and I love you very much for it.

741
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,733
We will talk more about this, but

742
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,986
I need to chat with William.

743
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,437
Yeah.

744
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,489
Hey.

745
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,454
I didn't know if you'd be awake.

746
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,620
I can't sleep.

747
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,589
I got a news alert about the impairment.

748
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,041
It's impeachment.

749
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,252
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

750
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,087
I worry about you.

751
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,012
I'm really sorry about before.

752
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,143
I would never

753
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,394
purposefully try to
make you afraid, or...

754
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,315
Felicity said you were
on some sort of drug.

755
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,392
Accidentally.

756
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,943
I was dosed by someone who works
for the man I'm trying to stop.

757
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,277
Ricardo Diaz?

758
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,610
Can you stop him?

759
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,115
I think maybe I found a way.

760
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,326
Most important,

761
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,371
I need to know that
I'm not gonna lose you,

762
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,662
or Felicity ever.

763
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,080
You won't.

764
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,391
Hey.

765
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:48,769
What are you doing here?

766
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,025
I heard about what happened.
I wanted to see how you were.

767
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,107
Clearly, I should have
brought a broom.

768
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,900
He's spiraling.

769
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,074
That Vertigo worked
even better than I was hoping.

770
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,451
I don't understand why you
don't just put a bullet in him.

771
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,531
Or 20.

772
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,162
'Cause it'd be a waste of time.

773
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,543
He's more dangerous as a martyr

774
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,583
than as the Green Arrow.

775
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,630
I'm gonna dismantle him

776
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,551
piece by piece.

777
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,845
Like with the impeachment?

778
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,596
The impeachment was
just the latest step.

779
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,395
And what's the next one?

780
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,015
We spread the word

781
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,900
that with Mayor Queen out,

782
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:34,657
Star City, it's open for business.
