1
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,902
FBI!

2
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,653
FBI!

3
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,363
FBI! Get on the floor!

4
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,908
Get out of the bed!

5
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,121
FBI! Don't move!

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,210
Freeze!

7
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,212
Where are you going?

8
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,505
Off the bed!

9
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,174
Hands up! Show me your hands! Cuff him!

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,928
Hey. Give me your hands.

11
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,639
Take off these cuffs.
I have the right to an attorney.

12
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,727
You have no right here.
Do you understand? You have no right.

13
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,077
You got Mother Teresa.

14
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,954
You actually bagged that asshole.

15
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:05,583
Got his number one and number two also.
And two judges, district police cap...

16
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,085
A freakin' deputy mayor.

17
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,920
This is gonna be
a messy day for City Hall.

18
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,838
Yeah.

19
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,632
The Albanians had to be buying
those guys off with more than tail.

20
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,510
Burgos got their computers,
so we're gonna find their money.

21
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,596
Once we start tracking it,
who knows how far this goes?

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,265
Thank you, Wilson Fisk.

23
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,600
He's a gift that's gonna keep on giving.

24
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,761
Snitch!

25
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,534
No! No, don't!

26
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,244
No! No! No!

27
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,623
No!

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,296
All tier two COs,

29
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,049
we have a 10-49 in progress
in the weight room.

30
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,385
All tier two COs,
we have a fight in the weight room.

31
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,856
Guard! Guard! Guard!

32
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,569
You, up against the wall,
right now! Against the wall!

33
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,855
What did you do, Matthew?

34
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,279
Where did you go last night?

35
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,824
Hey. Don't pull that crap with me.

36
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,992
What happened?

37
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,369
Go away.

38
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,957
I put in way too much work
on you to quit now.

39
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,042
Up.

40
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,752
Move your ass.

41
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,928
So you get beat by a guy
who wasn't even trying to hurt you,

42
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,766
and your brilliant next move
is to go out and pick another fight?

43
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,394
Here.

44
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,479
Take these.

45
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,401
A word of advice, Mr. Daredevil...

46
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,199
give yourself time to heal,
or you're gonna get yourself killed.

47
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,286
You're probably right.

48
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,706
Is that what you wanted?

49
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,294
I have a special gift, too.

50
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,006
I'm impervious to bad attitude.

51
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,677
So you can throw your self-pitying
bullshit at me all day, Murdock,

52
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,805
and I'll still be standing right here.

53
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,973
Pissed off, maybe, but right here.

54
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,103
You're gonna talk to me.

55
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,022
Why did you become a nun?

56
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,442
I heard God's call.

57
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,198
So you feel like being a nun
is what you're meant to be?

58
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,909
Yes.

59
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,619
Very much.

60
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,455
What if you couldn't be one anymore?

61
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,834
If it were taken from you?

62
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,504
Your point being
that if we can't fulfill our calling,

63
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,714
we might be better off as worm food?

64
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
Answer the question.

65
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,885
I'll tell you what I wouldn't do.

66
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,221
I wouldn't lose faith.

67
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,015
I'd find some other purpose.

68
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,561
If you can be anything else,
it was never really your calling.

69
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,148
Just tell me, honestly.

70
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,067
If you could no longer be a nun,

71
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,820
wouldn't you grieve?

72
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,488
Of course I would.

73
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,906
Then please...

74
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,783
go away.

75
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,542
I understand what it's like
to feel lost, Matthew.

76
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,670
It happened to me, too, once.

77
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,425
A long time ago,
when I was still a novitiate...

78
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,053
I left the order for a while.

79
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,971
Why?

80
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,726
I was considering a very different life.

81
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,812
It was wonderful and terrifying.

82
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,525
I struggled to know which life
God wanted me to choose.

83
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,111
I prayed. I looked for signs.

84
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,280
In the end,

85
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,284
I just had to do my best to figure it out.

86
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,330
Well, there you go.

87
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,750
That is the difference between us.

88
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,879
I no longer care what God wants.

89
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,798
Oh, right.

90
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,718
Almost forgot.

91
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,805
You've seen his true face now.

92
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,905
Those are some
fancy moves, Matthew.

93
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,743
Sister Dora turned me in, didn't she?

94
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,203
This has to stop.

95
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,999
My Confirmation is in the spring.
I'm supposed to be learning the catechism,

96
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,126
and Sister D
can't even defend original sin.

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,337
She is not a theologian.

98
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,215
You already know more about it
than she does, I'm sure.

99
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,925
So I can skip catechism?

100
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,009
No.

101
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,679
Come on.

102
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,973
Sit.

103
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,563
How many fights
have you been in this week?

104
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,982
- How many guys complained?
- None.

105
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,777
'Cause no one wants to admit
they got their butt kicked by a blind kid.

106
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,241
- So you can't prove that I did anything.
- I don't want to, and I don't need to.

107
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,411
It's not about proving anything, Matthew.

108
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,414
Argumentation is a skill.

109
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,917
Being argumentative is a sign.

110
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,295
A sign like a prophecy?

111
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,463
A sign like you're angry, Matthew.

112
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,302
That's a perfectly understandable reaction
to your situation.

113
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,096
But it's not sustainable.

114
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,892
Or maybe it's a sign that Sister Dora
should stick to teaching math.

115
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,812
You're good...

116
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,650
at arguing and deflecting
and denying you're angry to other people.

117
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,989
But you're gonna have to deal
with your anger, Matthew.

118
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,619
Find a way to... harness it.

119
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,331
- Or it will destroy you.
- Well, if that's God's plan for me,

120
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,875
then I guess that's how
it's supposed to work out, isn't it?

121
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,047
You know, maybe you don't understand
original sin, after all.

122
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,759
God gave us free will, Matthew.

123
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,846
Adam and Eve were not puppets,
and neither are we.

124
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,098
We make our own choices.

125
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,227
That's one reason we pray,
for help making good ones.

126
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,813
You should try it sometime.

127
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,690
I do pray.

128
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,277
I pray all the time.
I've been praying for years.

129
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,281
God doesn't talk to me.

130
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,284
So that's what this is about?

131
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,080
You feel God is... neglecting you?

132
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:10,378
Matthew, the burning-bush business
doesn't happen very often,

133
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,254
even in the Bible.

134
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,049
He's usually more subtle than that.

135
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,305
You want to hear God, Matthew,
you have to listen more carefully.

136
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,851
Because he speaks in whispers.

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,532
Veggie sub.

138
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,201
- No meat.
- Thanks.

139
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,578
You don't want it.

140
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,205
Why not?

141
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,834
When you see the way Ramsey
and Arinori are kissing Hattley's ass,

142
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,836
you're gonna lose your appetite.

143
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,630
They're in her office right now.

144
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,507
Doing what?

145
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,552
Hattley gave you this raid.

146
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,470
But now that it worked,

147
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,433
well, somebody's got to run
Fisk full time.

148
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,517
Right?

149
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,573
There he is.

150
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,366
Man of the hour.

151
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,786
You see the client list yet? Holy shit.

152
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,955
A moment, ma'am?

153
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,540
Sure, Ray.

154
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,592
Congratulations. Pristine execution.

155
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,094
Glad to hear it, boss. I got a big ask.

156
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,431
You want Fisk detail. I can't.

157
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,767
He's my kill. I get to eat first.

158
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,478
There's a goddamn buffet
in that conference room.

159
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,729
You can't fill up on that?

160
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,940
That's today. Now, what about tomorrow?

161
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,736
Look, we play Fisk right,
there's plenty for everyone for years.

162
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,781
He can give us every criminal organization
on the East Coast.

163
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,115
Hey, Pryor.

164
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,534
Find out how Burgos
is doing on the computers.

165
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:10,664
Dozens of agents had their shot at Fisk.
None of them got shit. But I did.

166
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,167
We got some big collars out of this, Ray.

167
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm gonna make sure D.C. knows about it.

168
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,214
Why do I feel like there's a "but" coming?

169
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,090
Shut the door.

170
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,643
I put you on Fisk detail,
your file is required reading.

171
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,062
You'll be naked. There will be questions.

172
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,188
I've got answers.

173
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,899
I've got a boss, too.

174
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,735
And he's got a hard-on for agents
in financial holes.

175
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,778
I'm sorry.

176
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,240
No. No way.

177
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,241
Easy, Ray.

178
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,827
No. You tell D.C. that none of this
could have happened

179
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,704
without the unexpected connection
between me and Wilson Fisk.

180
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,956
Because that's the truth.

181
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,500
And then none of the other shit
in my file will matter.

182
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,877
Come on, Tammy.

183
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,964
How am I supposed to get out from under?

184
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,555
Okay, he's yours. But you need
to keep him talking, Ray.

185
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:08,639
I got this.

186
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:13,143
He better last years.
Because he goes dry, we're both burned.

187
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,947
- Hey.
- Hey.

188
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,741
"Rostam Kazemi." Mean anything to you?

189
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,494
- Uh, yeah, he's a real estate developer.
- Mmm-hmm.

190
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,413
Actually, his daughter, Neda,

191
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,207
is the mean one
on the Heiresses of Manhattan.

192
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,668
Not that I watch that kind of crap
or anything, but...

193
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,836
No, of course not.

194
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,048
Anyway, he and his daughter were attacked
outside a restaurant last night.

195
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,303
He's in a coma at Riverbank Hospital,
think it might be a kidnapping attempt.

196
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,722
No, you know what?
I think you should give TJ that story.

197
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,265
He watches her show. He'd love it.

198
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,476
Well, that's... That's great.
That's nice. I'm giving it to you.

199
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,437
No, I'm in the middle of something here.

200
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,564
- Excuse me?
- It's not done yet,

201
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,275
but I'd like to stick with it
if that's okay.

202
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,358
What?

203
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,453
Uh, yeah, here.

204
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,455
What am I looking at?

205
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,207
Uh... They're reports
of respiratory illnesses

206
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,251
among residents
of a particular city block.

207
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,087
They've spiked.
They're up, like, 45% from last year.

208
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,799
- And which particular block would that be?
- 44th and 11th.

209
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,718
- Midland Circle adjacent.
- Karen.

210
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,137
Come on. I know we've done
a lot of pieces on this,

211
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,183
but there are still questions about
that night we don't have answers for.

212
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,769
- You think the answers are in here?
- I don't know. Maybe.

213
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,022
Just give me a couple days.
It's not done yet.

214
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,276
What is it about Midland Circle, Karen?
I mean, it's not just a story, is it?

215
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,615
Look. The work you've done on this,

216
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,700
reporting, the writing...
it's excellent.

217
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,037
It's great. It's some of the best
you've ever done. I'm proud of it.

218
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,748
I'm even maybe a little bit jealous.

219
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,958
But it's done.

220
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,210
So that's what we do now?

221
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,088
We just drop stories because
some socialite who photographs well

222
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,171
is down at the hospital?

223
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
That's a story, too.

224
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,428
And I thought that you might be able
to empathize with a young woman

225
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,847
who's been caught up
in the middle of a family crisis.

226
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,978
It's one thing to work a story, Karen.

227
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,313
It's another thing
to let a story work you.

228
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,401
- End of day tomorrow.
- Okay.

229
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,121
How the hell did you let this happen?

230
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,456
Don't try to pin this shit on us.

231
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,166
He's your snitch.

232
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,053
You okay?

233
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,805
They said it was superficial.

234
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,975
I find it quite profound.

235
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,059
Don't start.

236
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,061
We're not playing games here.

237
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,148
It's deadly serious for me.

238
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,066
What? Some guy with a shank?

239
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,862
It's not something I fear a great deal.

240
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,531
But we're not dealing
with one person here.

241
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,284
Word is out.

242
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,828
Everyone knows.

243
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,792
Guards and inmates, it seems
they know I'm cooperating with you.

244
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,879
Which you are going to continue to do,
Mr. Fisk.

245
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,380
This was not a one-off.

246
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,259
You want us to help Vanessa
clear herself of criminal charges,

247
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,137
you need to continue
to deliver actionable information.

248
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,638
Do you understand?

249
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,979
I have suddenly become a target
within these walls here.

250
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,398
Do you understand?

251
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,528
I'm helping you to help Vanessa.

252
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,912
I can't do either of those things
if I'm dead.

253
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,610
- Please, God...
- If you can help, please just...

254
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,028
Help me get this job.

255
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,990
I've got to keep paying them,
or they'll come for Mindy.

256
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,080
Please just call her home.

257
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,291
End her suffering, I beg you.

258
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,627
- Her moans, I...
- Give Derek justice.

259
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,840
Please, God,
you know he didn't do this thing.

260
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,425
That lawyer's no damn good,

261
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,095
but you can touch the jury, God.

262
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,973
Help them to see the truth.

263
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,315
Glad to see you up here, Matthew.

264
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,068
I used to listen to people's prayers.

265
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,904
In here and out on the street.

266
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:22,619
You know, people asking for God's help
or justice or... vengeance sometimes.

267
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,788
See, it's always the same.

268
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,541
"Please, God."

269
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,714
I thought that God
let me hear the prayers...

270
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,216
so that I could answer.

271
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:42,556
So that's what I did. That's what I was
trying to do, was trying to help people.

272
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,350
But I am not what I was.

273
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,480
Can't do what I used to do.

274
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,775
Give it time.

275
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,988
Whatever your new reality is,
you'll adjust.

276
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,367
When I heard all those prayers,
all those...

277
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,122
suffering people,
I thought it was God's voice.

278
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,169
But I was wrong.

279
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,172
All I ever heard was people in pain.

280
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,384
And all he ever gave any of us was...

281
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,263
silence.

282
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:31,063
So now you believe your calling
to do what you do was a mistake?

283
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,315
I was deluding myself.

284
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,903
Maybe that's a good thing
to realize, Matthew.

285
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,863
Maybe...

286
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,741
it's time for you to stop.

287
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,284
Oh...

288
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,995
No, Father, uh...

289
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,251
My delusion was thinking
God had anything to do with it.

290
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,130
I'm not as capable as I was, but...

291
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,968
I don't get to choose who I am.

292
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,096
I'm Daredevil.

293
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,642
Not even God can stop that now.

294
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,166
- Excuse me. I'm looking for a dry cleaner.
- Not doing pickups right now.

295
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,375
But we're on 14th Street.

296
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,210
Address is on the side there.

297
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,422
Here's where it gets awkward.

298
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm actually looking
for a different place.

299
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,135
I got a whiff
of their delivery van last night.

300
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:48,015
It didn't smell like this.
Not like chemicals. It was more... herbal.

301
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,559
Kinda grassy, maybe?

302
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,768
Yeah, sure, like that.

303
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,395
I know the place.

304
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,794
How is he?

305
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,298
You're a journalist, aren't you?

306
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:27,179
- I've seen your picture in the Bulletin.
- Yeah, it's Karen Page.

307
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,182
Not to be a bitch,
but I don't want this in the papers.

308
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,226
No, you're not a bitch. I get it.

309
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,394
Then go.

310
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,652
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
But you don't understand.

311
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,322
You think because you don't want this
in the papers, it won't be?

312
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,239
If I don't say anything...

313
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,163
They'll make up things
that sound good to them.

314
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,038
And that's what will get written and what
people will talk about behind your back.

315
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,249
For the next year. The next five years.
For the rest of your life.

316
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,586
You talk like you know what this is.

317
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,756
Maybe I do.

318
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,135
You grow up with paparazzi
on your ass, following you to school?

319
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,429
- No.
- Yeah, I did.

320
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,224
You know what I learned?

321
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,643
I learned that anything I say,
anything at all,

322
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,146
you people will turn it
into whatever you want to, anyway.

323
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,524
I'm not like that.

324
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,192
Yeah. Sure.

325
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,696
Believe it or not, I really do know
what you're going through.

326
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,989
Your father almost got killed?

327
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,243
Nope. But people said
that I killed my brother.

328
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,749
God, I'm sorry.

329
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,221
You know, when Kevin died...

330
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,183
everyone wanted to know what happened.

331
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,062
And I wasn't like you,
not paparazzi or anything, but...

332
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,898
it's a small town.

333
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,693
Stuff kinda gets around on its own.

334
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,115
But since no one did know the story,
they made one up.

335
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,533
It was all bullshit.

336
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,663
If you thought about it for ten seconds,
it didn't even make sense, but...

337
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,999
why should that matter, right?

338
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,129
The problem was...

339
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,009
...once the story got out there, it stuck.

340
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,888
It grew, and it got darker and, um...

341
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:34,973
meaner.

342
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,395
And the things they said
about my family and about me...

343
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,441
it, um...

344
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,568
sort of tore us apart.

345
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,782
Piece by piece and lie by lie. And, um...

346
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,204
I didn't really know
how to deal with it back then.

347
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,459
Now I guess it's too late.

348
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,628
You're right.

349
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,466
The truth can't be worse, can it?

350
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,594
I don't know.

351
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,306
I don't know if the truth
is any better, but...

352
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,975
Well, at least it's real.

353
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,022
Okay.

354
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,529
Just take your time.

355
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,116
We were at dinner.

356
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,953
We were trying to patch things up,
you know?

357
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,831
We were walking to the car, and...

358
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,418
these two men grabbed my father.

359
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,631
They tried to put him
into this van to kidnap him.

360
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,219
We only got away
because the other guy attacked him.

361
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,889
What other guy?
You said there's another guy?

362
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,724
Yeah. He came out of nowhere.

363
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,270
He had this black mask over his face.

364
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,095
You're out of your mind.

365
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,944
Fisk's imprisonment would continue
at a private location

366
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,862
under the constant supervision of the FBI.

367
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,239
That's house incarceration,

368
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,033
usually reserved
for white-collar criminals awaiting trial.

369
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,327
He was shanked
by another inmate hours ago.

370
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,830
Good. He's a cop killer.

371
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,498
That wasn't proven in court.

372
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,792
- Whose fault was that?
- We put on a good trial.

373
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,669
Five counts under RICO was a giant win.

374
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,254
Which you're about to give away.

375
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,172
You're the district attorney, Mr. Tower.

376
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,341
Think of the long game here.

377
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,636
We can't prosecute everything
Fisk is giving us at the federal level.

378
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,804
It's gonna trickle down.

379
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,890
You're trying to buy the NYPD
with collars and me with convictions.

380
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,019
When Fisk's intel leads
to the biggest crime drop in a decade...

381
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,354
- The guy is a piece of shit.
- You're right.

382
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,110
Wilson Fisk is a piece of shit.

383
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,656
After every time I'm in the room
with the guy, I want a shower.

384
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,244
But let's talk about the Albanians
for a minute, what they have done.

385
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,415
Four dead NYPD officers,
12 more riding desks with disabilities.

386
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,834
One hundred and seven civilian murders.

387
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,170
And even after five task forces
over seven years,

388
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,797
to the tune of $11 million, we got zero.

389
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,009
Those are some shitty numbers.

390
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,511
But here's another one.

391
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,932
With Fisk's intel, we beheaded
the Albanian syndicate in one day.

392
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,268
One single day.

393
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,563
No loss of life, no injuries, no mayhem.

394
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,190
I mean, look at the take.

395
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,818
We got their documents and data,
and we''re gonna get their money.

396
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,030
Best of all, we bagged corrupt officials
whose protection they were selling.

397
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,907
A lot of cases they've been
interfering with

398
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,700
may finally get somewhere.

399
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,206
Look, none of us like it.
It makes me want to throw up to admit it.

400
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,877
But New York is safer tonight
because of Wilson Fisk.

401
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,925
Now I need a shower.

402
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,223
If we keep him talking,
Fisk will give up others.

403
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,851
This deal will save lives.

404
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,944
Tell me you're not going for this.

405
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,584
Uncle Foggy!

406
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,213
Okay, easy, easy.
Left pocket. Left pocket.

407
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,257
You're gonna save them
for after dinner, right?

408
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,801
Don't tell your mother! Or my mother.

409
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,352
Hey! Foggy's here!

410
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,937
- Hey!
- Foggy!

411
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,188
Hey there, Counselor.

412
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,232
"How are your briefs holding up?"

413
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,318
What's up?

414
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,987
Christ, that joke gets old.

415
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,363
Gets old?

416
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,616
Listen, Franklin, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

417
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,951
Hi.

418
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,206
- Try a little. I put cinnamon in it.
- Mmm! Delicious. So good.

419
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
Is he worse?

420
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,633
Your father's arthritis
gets a little worse every day.

421
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,888
He's having trouble holding onto things,
especially when he's tired.

422
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,557
I see him with the saws and slicers.

423
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,102
Ma, I'm sorry.
Isn't there anything they can do for it?

424
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,813
There's no cure for getting old, Franklin.

425
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:38,860
Your father needs to be on a beach,
not slinging meat in Hell's Kitchen.

426
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,322
Forty years is enough already.

427
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,492
I know. You got yourself a life.

428
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,826
A good life.

429
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,204
But maybe it's time you came home.

430
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,539
I'm right here when you need me.

431
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,877
Your brother loves this place,
but Theo can't do it alone.

432
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,879
Come help.

433
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,465
Put those brains to work for your family,

434
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,676
not every uptown shithead
that comes into your office.

435
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,262
They're not all shitheads, Ma.

436
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,307
I'm not telling you what to do.

437
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,478
You're a grown man. Just think about it.
That's all I'm sayin'.

438
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,355
Okay.

439
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,440
I will. I promise.

440
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,025
Good.

441
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,027
I love you, kid.

442
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,865
Hey! I can smell the candy
from here, Ruthie! Come here.

443
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,536
Where'd you get that? Where'd you
get that? Where'd you get that?

444
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,498
- Hey, Pop.
- Hey!

445
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,668
- Do you want a glass?
- Damn sure didn't come to chat.

446
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,589
The suits I understand, Foggy, but...

447
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:46,135
why you drink this expensive
crap is beyond me.

448
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,225
You know how proud of you I am, Foggy?

449
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,227
You're a big deal.

450
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,231
- Which is what you always wanted.
- Did I?

451
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,692
Ever since you could talk,

452
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,528
you went around telling people
that you owned the store.

453
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,489
They'd play along with it, too.

454
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,825
- Remember?
- Yeah.

455
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,413
I got it, Pops. I got it.

456
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,332
Yeah.

457
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,960
Sláinte.

458
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,054
Your lawyer almost screwed up
the whole deal.

459
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,474
Those terms guarantee my safety.

460
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,810
Beyoncé has fewer demands.

461
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,026
This way, convict.

462
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,937
You want service, you gotta get in line.

463
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,648
Oh... Oh.

464
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,276
Come on, come on.
You got a ticket, you just picking up?

465
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,486
- Me?
- Yeah.

466
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,197
Oh, no, I just ran in
'cause your clothes smell so good.

467
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,574
See, I got this real sensitive nose.
I thought...

468
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,494
Yeah, we use a totally organic process,
latest stuff.

469
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,412
Oh, cool. You got a flyer?

470
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,247
Not in Braille.

471
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,875
I... I got seeing friends.

472
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,086
Here, have a coupon.

473
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,966
Thanks, I appreciate it.

474
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,719
- Glad I found you. Really makes my day.
- All right.

475
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,241
God damn it.
We must have blown a fuse.

476
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,160
Hello!

477
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,662
You!

478
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,867
Yeah, I'd like to report an assault.

479
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,786
I didn't see what happened,
but there are a lot of guns here.

480
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,163
Maybe some kind of robbery.

481
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,259
I don't think I ever said it,

482
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,013
but thank you, Theo,
for taking over the shop.

483
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,473
They wanted it to be you.

484
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,558
Yeah.

485
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,644
For a long time,
I kinda wanted it to be you, too.

486
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,107
- You never said anything.
- What was there to say?

487
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,193
You got a head for other things.

488
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,821
You were always getting the prizes
and scholarships and shit.

489
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,825
Anyway, you can't make a sandwich
to save your ass.

490
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,833
Theo, if we need to figure out...

491
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,043
Knock it off.

492
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,503
Go do what you're good at.

493
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,839
You're livin' the dream.

494
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,759
Am I?

495
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,886
You're shittin' me.

496
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,516
I had this idea
of how things were gonna go.

497
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,232
Matt and I talked a lot
about what we'd do.

498
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,319
Open our own firm. Help people. Get rich.

499
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,906
I was the get rich part.
He was the help people part.

500
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,328
When he was around, I knew who I was.

501
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,747
Now...

502
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,249
Matt was a good guy.

503
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,584
Sláinte.

504
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,222
You can always come back here.

505
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,933
Yeah, great. Thanks.

506
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,355
Hi.

507
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,439
Sorry, I...

508
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,565
Perfect timing.

509
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,859
Now everyone can stop worrying
about my career choices

510
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,570
and start worrying about
me cheating on Marci. Much better.

511
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,115
- Can I to talk to you?
- What's wrong?

512
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,284
I think Matt's alive.

513
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,916
So the guy in the mask,
he wasn't in a, you know, devil suit?

514
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,127
No, but he was wearing a black mask.

515
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,713
- So it could be anybody.
- It could also not be anybody.

516
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,757
Hell's Kitchen is ground zero
for vigilantes these days.

517
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,302
Believe me,
I want it to be Matt, too. But he's...

518
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,053
- gone.
- No, no.

519
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,681
- We need to get past that.
- There is no proof of that.

520
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,851
- And until there is...
- You know how I know he's gone?

521
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,352
Because if it was Matt,

522
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,815
if he was really still alive,
he would've reached out to us.

523
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,486
You know how I know that
you don't really believe that?

524
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:45,573
You keep saying "gone" instead of "dead."

525
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,950
Now, don't you want to take a minute

526
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,454
and just be absolutely sure that's
not your best friend out there somewhere?

527
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,415
I wish it was my best friend.

528
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,251
But it's not. He's dead.

529
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,174
Karen, come on. Stay.

530
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,724
What?

531
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,648
You.

532
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,821
Your father...

533
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,282
he's in a coma.

534
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,533
He's alive.

535
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,744
Why did you help us?

536
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,374
The men who did this are in police custody
for another crime.

537
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,336
You head down to the 15th Precinct
right now, you can identify them.

538
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,462
You caught them?

539
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,380
You should go.

540
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,964
Thank God for you.

541
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,342
He didn't help you.

542
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,094
I did.

543
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,107
You will be under
the strict supervision of my team.

544
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,526
You will not remove your ankle monitor.

545
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,070
You will not pass beyond
the boundaries shown to you.

546
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,906
You will continue to have
a strictly regulated schedule.

547
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,367
That means eating, sleeping,
shitting, whenever I say.

548
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,160
Do you understand, Mr. Fisk?

549
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,123
I've spent much of my life alone.

550
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:22,795
And for many years, I pretended
that this was the source of my strength.

551
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,757
I told myself I had free will.

552
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,556
And in that time, I achieved a great deal.

553
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,686
But I was not fulfilled.

554
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:44,108
I was longing for a connection
that I could imagine

555
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,068
but I could not achieve.

556
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,447
Searching and not finding.

557
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,786
Until Vanessa.

558
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,916
Until I discovered love.

559
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,503
I thought I would explode
with the sense of power

560
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,381
and freedom that she brought me.

561
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,927
That the world lay at my feet.

562
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:21,228
But then that passed when I discovered
the great lie at the heart of love.

563
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,943
That what I took for true freedom
was precisely the reverse.

564
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,240
You can build a prison of stone and steel,

565
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,244
but you merely present the prisoner
with a challenge.

566
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,374
Any truly determined man
will find a way out.

567
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,003
But love...

568
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,050
Love is the perfect prison.

569
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,845
Inescapable.

570
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,932
So you see, Agent Nadeem...

571
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,268
I am always in prison,

572
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,978
wherever I go.

573
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,900
And if these things
help me protect Vanessa,

574
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,693
then they are nothing to me.

575
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,698
I will do whatever I must.

576
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,751
Go left! Left!

577
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,910
Nadeem!

578
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,997
Nadeem!

579
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,998
Prepare to fire!

580
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,711
Grenade!

581
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,258
Stay in the car!

582
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,452
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! We surrender!

583
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,497
Convict.

584
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,501
Don't move.

585
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,585
Put him in bay 3.

586
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,798
Excuse me, sir.

587
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:49,848
Sorry.

588
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,918
- Multiple GSWs.
- First one up...

589
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,546
Goddamn Albanians
killed everyone except Fisk.

590
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,756
Somebody said
he's en route to the safe house.

591
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,341
It's a damn shitshow.

592
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,177
The FBI just let Wilson Fisk
out of prison.
