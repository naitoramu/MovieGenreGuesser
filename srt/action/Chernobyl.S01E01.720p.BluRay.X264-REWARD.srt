1
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,921
<i>What is the cost of lies?</i>

2
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:33,001
<i>It's not that we'll
mistake them for the truth.</i>

3
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:35,881
<i>The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies</i>

4
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,721
<i>then we no longer
recognise the truth at all.</i>

5
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:42,601
<i>What can we do then?</i>

6
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:45,641
<i>What else is left but to
abandon even the hope of truth</i>

7
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:49,081
<i>and content ourselves
instead with stories?</i>

8
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,801
<i>In these stories, it doesn't
matter who the heroes are.</i>

9
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:57,121
<i>All we want to know
is "who is to blame?"</i>

10
00:00:57,281 --> 00:01:01,481
<i>In this story it was Anatoly
Dyatlov. He was the best choice.</i>

11
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,801
<i>An arrogant, unpleasant man.
He ran the room that night.</i>

12
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,721
<i>He gave the orders.
And no friends.</i>

13
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,921
<i>At least, not important ones.</i>

14
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:17,201
<i>And now, Dyatlov
will spend the next ten years</i>

15
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,041
<i>in a prison labour camp.</i>

16
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,641
<i>Of course,
that sentence is doubly unfair.</i>

17
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>There were far greater
criminals than him at work.</i>

18
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:33,761
<i>And as for what Dyatlov did do,
the man doesn't deserve prison.</i>

19
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,561
<i>He deserves death.</i>

20
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:54,281
But instead, ten years
for criminal mismanagement.

21
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:57,441
What does that mean?

22
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,081
No one knows. It doesn't matter.

23
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,881
What does matter is,
that to them, justice was done.

24
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,321
Because, you see, to them...

25
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:15,681
..a just world is a sane world.

26
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,841
There was nothing sane
about Chernobyl.

27
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,961
What happened there,
what happened after,

28
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:27,881
even the good we did,
all of it...

29
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,441
..all of it.

30
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,001
Madness.

31
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:41,641
Well, I've given you
everything I know.

32
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:47,161
They'll deny it, of course.
They always do.

33
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:55,801
I know you'll try your best.

34
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:09,561
Lyudmilla?

35
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,401
Comrade Dyatlov?

36
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,841
Comrade Dyatlov?

37
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,961
Comrade Dyatlov?

38
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:49,881
Comrade Dyatlov?
Comrade Dyatlov!

39
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:53,001
- What just happened?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,641
There's a fire
in the turbine hall.

41
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,321
The turbine hall.

42
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,921
The control-system tank.
Hydrogen.

43
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,641
You and Toptunov,
you morons blew the tank.

44
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,321
- No, that's not...
- It's an emergency. Stay calm.

45
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:11,281
- Our first priority...
- It's exploded.

46
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:13,441
We know. Akimov,
are we cooling the reactor core?

47
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,521
We shut it down but
the control rods are still...

48
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,001
They're not all the way in...

49
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:19,721
I'll disconnect the servos
from the standby console.

50
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:21,241
Get the backup pumps running.

51
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,921
Get water moving through the
core. That is all that matters.

52
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:26,081
There is no core!

53
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,001
It exploded. The core exploded.

54
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,401
He's in shock.
Get him out of here.

55
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:35,161
The lid is off.

56
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,761
- The stack's burning. I saw it.
- You're confused.

57
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,081
RBMK reactor cores
don't explode. Akimov.

58
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:42,241
Don't worry.
We did everything right.

59
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:44,001
Something strange
has happened.

60
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:46,241
- Do you taste metal?
- Akimov!

61
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,161
Comrade Perevozchenko, what
you're saying is impossible.

62
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,081
A core can't explode.
It has to be the tank.

63
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,841
We're wasting time. Let's go.

64
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,321
Get hydrogen out the generators,
pump water into the core.

65
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,961
- What about the fire?
- Call the fire brigade.

66
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:36,481
- You're not on call tonight.
- They're bringing in everybody.

67
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:41,001
Military and civil.
Pripyat. Polesskoe. Kiev.

68
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,161
This is a big one.

69
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,881
But it doesn't look right.
The colour.

70
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,001
Pravik thinks they're shining
floodlights or something.

71
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,681
What if there are chemicals?

72
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:56,401
Chemicals?
The problem's the roof.

73
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:57,841
It's covered in tar,

74
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,561
so it's gonna burn all night
and will stink like hell.

75
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:03,121
That's it,
that's the worst of it.

76
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:06,761
Go back to bed.

77
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:43,081
- Is it war?
- Where's the dosimeter?

78
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:45,921
Here. Here.

79
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,081
Are they bombing?

80
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,001
What the fuck is this?

81
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:00,361
- 3.6 roentgen.
- That's as high as it goes.

82
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,401
The good one's locked
in the safe. I don't have a key.

83
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,081
Valera...

84
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:07,601
..your face.

85
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,721
Come on.

86
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:14,801
I'm going to find Khodemchuk
in the pump room. You, here.

87
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:17,721
Get Shashenok. He's in 604.

88
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,321
Go. We need to get everyone out!

89
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,041
- Shit.
- Hey!

90
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,761
We need to get into the reactor
hall. The lift's destroyed.

91
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,681
Up two flights and across.

92
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:41,081
All right.

93
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:43,121
Why are you going there?

94
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:04,241
- Have you seen Khodemchuk?
- No. Where's Viktor?

95
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,801
Still in the pump room.

96
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,961
Stay here. I'll come back.

97
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,201
Viktor!

98
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:34,401
Viktor.

99
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,641
Viktor. Oh, Viktor.

100
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,841
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

101
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,881
Can you stand?

102
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,521
Khodemchuk.

103
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,681
Get Khodemchuk.

104
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,001
I dropped the control rods
from the other panel.

105
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:34,961
- They're still up.
- What?

106
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,601
They're still only a third of
the way in. I don't know why.

107
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:40,042
I sent trainees to the reactor
hall to lower them by hand.

108
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:42,801
- What about the pumps?
- I can't contact Khodemchuk.

109
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,441
Fuck the phones
and fuck Khodemchuk.

110
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,161
- Are the pumps on or not?
- Control panel's not working.

111
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:48,841
I called for the electricians.

112
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:50,481
I don't give a shit
about the panel.

113
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,881
I need water in my reactor core.

114
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,441
Get down there and make
sure those pumps are on.

115
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,961
Now.

116
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:06,361
What does the dosimeter say?

117
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,761
3.6 roentgen. But that's
as high as the meter...

118
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:11,361
3.6. Not great, not terrible.

119
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,841
We did everything right.

120
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,041
Get the pumps going.

121
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,121
- Over here.
- I'm going with you.

122
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,081
Vasily.

123
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:45,121
Hey, Vasily.
What's this?

124
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:47,321
I don't know, Misha.
Don't fuck around with it.

125
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:48,641
Hook these up.

126
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,201
Come on.

127
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:57,201
- You taste metal?
- Yeah, what is that?

128
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,561
I don't know.

129
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,841
The valves, Misha.
The valves.

130
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,361
The valves. Come on.

131
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:35,601
What do you need?

132
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:38,481
We need to get into the reactor
hall to lower the control rods

133
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,161
but the door's jammed.

134
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:44,881
I don't think there are control
rods. Or that there's a core.

135
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,881
No, you're mistaken.

136
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:50,921
Akimov said...

137
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,881
Let's go.

138
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,641
Ignatenko, get on his hose.

139
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,601
It's all right.

140
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,081
All right. All right. Easy.

141
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,721
Are you sure?

142
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,921
Akimov...

143
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,201
OK, move.

144
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,561
Go, go! Go!

145
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,521
Let's go! Let's go!

146
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,841
Hey!

147
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:28,561
Hey!

148
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:50,321
Lyudmilla, do you
want to come with us?

149
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:51,481
Come where?

150
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:54,161
We're going to the railroad
bridge to get a better look.

151
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,601
It's not like anyone can
sleep with all the sirens.

152
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,641
I don't think you should go.
Could be dangerous.

153
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,201
What do you mean, dangerous?
It's a fire. It's over there.

154
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,001
- Mikhail.
- What?

155
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:05,921
Oh. Sorry.

156
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,041
- It's Vasily?
- Yeah.

157
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,041
- Did he say it was bad?
- No, no.

158
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:16,801
He said it was just the roof.

159
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,561
Well, he's never gotten hurt
before. None of the boys have.

160
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:22,121
He'll be fine.

161
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:24,281
Get some rest.

162
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:39,001
The tank, it's big enough,
this kind of explosion.

163
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:41,881
The control tank on 71,
it's 100 cubic metres.

164
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,281
110.

165
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:45,761
110? Could do this, definitely.

166
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:48,361
It's gone.

167
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:53,161
I looked right into it.
Looked into the core.

168
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:56,281
Did you lower
the control rods or not?

169
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:01,281
Take him to the infirmary.

170
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,001
Toptunov, take him.

171
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,681
- Where's Kudryavtsev?
- He fell.

172
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,481
- I need a medic.
- He's delusional.

173
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,801
- His face.
- Ruptured condenser lines.

174
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,881
The feed water is mildly
contaminated. He'll be fine.

175
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,401
Do we still have
a phone line to the outside?

176
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,441
- Akimov?
- Yeah.

177
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,361
Call in the day shift.

178
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,041
But if...

179
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,081
We have to keep water
flowing into the core.

180
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:35,761
We need electricians, mechanics.
We need bodies.

181
00:22:36,601 --> 00:22:38,481
How many times
do I have to say it?

182
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,961
I'm going to
the administration building now

183
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:51,001
to call Bryukhanov and Fomin.

184
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,641
They're gonna want
a full report.

185
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,681
I don't know if I can
make things better for you.

186
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:00,761
But I can certainly
make them worse.

187
00:23:03,121 --> 00:23:05,321
Call in the day shift,
Comrade Akimov.

188
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,841
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

189
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:45,521
You're doing fine.
Raise her up.

190
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:53,241
That one may be an hour,
this one, not until morning.

191
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:57,041
How's it downstairs, Doctor?

192
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:00,081
- Quiet.
- Always is.

193
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:03,081
Nothing at this hour but babies.

194
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:06,921
You know, I once went
two days without sleep.

195
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,881
Ten women went into labour
at the same time.

196
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,161
- Did I tell you that story?
- Yes.

197
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:16,121
Well, I won't need you
in here for a while.

198
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,601
If you want, get some rest
in the break room.

199
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,801
They haven't brought
anyone in from the fire.

200
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,161
- What fire?
- The power plant.

201
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:28,401
Oh. It mustn't be too bad.

202
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,001
Do we stock iodine?

203
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:32,961
- Hm?
- Iodine.

204
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:36,401
- You mean disinfectant?
- No, pills.

205
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,161
Does the hospital
stock iodine pills?

206
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:40,721
Iodine pills?
Why would we have iodine pills?

207
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,361
Hello.

208
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,041
Hello.

209
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:06,401
Who else knows this?

210
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,001
Have you called Fomin?

211
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:14,561
Of course I want you to
call him. If I'm up, he's up.

212
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:55,081
Whatever the cause, it's
important neither you nor...

213
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,361
I take it the safety test
was a failure.

214
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:38,401
We have the situation
under control.

215
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,801
Under control? It doesn't look
like it's under control.

216
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,201
Shut up, Fomin.

217
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:46,161
I have to tell the Central
Committee about this.

218
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:48,201
I have to get on the phone
and tell Maryin

219
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:51,281
or, God forbid, Frolyshev
that my power plant is on fire.

220
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:53,721
No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

221
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,441
Of course
no one can blame me for this.

222
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,641
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

223
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:01,681
Tell me what happened. Quickly.

224
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:06,761
We ran the test exactly as Chief
Engineer Fomin approved.

225
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,401
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

226
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,521
had technical difficulties
leading to an accumulation

227
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:15,241
of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

228
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,721
It regrettably ignited,

229
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:19,401
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

230
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:25,281
The tank is quite large. It's
the only logical explanation.

231
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:28,601
Of course, Deputy Chief
Engineer Dyatlov

232
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:32,681
was directly supervising tests,
so he would know best.

233
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:34,841
The hydrogen tank, fire.

234
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:37,961
Reactor?

235
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:41,361
We're taking measures to ensure
a flow of water to the core.

236
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:42,761
What about radiation?

237
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:45,281
Down here it's nothing,
but in the reactor building

238
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:48,401
I'm being told
3.6 roentgen per hour.

239
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:52,001
- Not great, but not horrifying.
- Not at all.

240
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,081
- From the feedwater, I assume?
- Mm-hm.

241
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:00,041
We'll limit shifts to six hours
at a time but otherwise...

242
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:03,361
The dosimetrists should
be checking regularly.

243
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:06,841
Have them use the good meter
from the safe.

244
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:08,681
Oh, right.

245
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,641
I'll call Maryin.

246
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:14,521
Have them wake up the
local Executive Committee.

247
00:28:14,681 --> 00:28:16,481
There'll be orders coming down.

248
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:24,921
Here. Sure?

249
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:31,201
What do you think
makes the colours?

250
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:33,201
It's the fuel, for sure.

251
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,641
Oh, it's the fuel, for sure.
What do you know about it?

252
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,841
You clean floors
at a train station.

253
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:41,801
My friend, Yuri, works at the
power plant. Says it runs cold.

254
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,721
No gas, no fire, just atoms.

255
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,921
Yuri says you can't
walk right up to the fuel.

256
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:49,801
If you do, a glass of vodka
an hour for four hours.

257
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,321
- Isn't Yuri a plumber?
- At the nuclear power plant.

258
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,921
Well, it is beautiful.

259
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:05,481
Yeah.

260
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,601
Do you have a cigarette?

261
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,841
Do you need help?

262
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,121
It's over.

263
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,441
We've done all we can
from the perimeter.

264
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,121
We need to start
making our way to the roof.

265
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,761
Vasily! You gotta put it out.

266
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:56,761
Come on, boys.

267
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,881
Vasily, it's this path,
straight up.

268
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,081
All the way up, all the way in.

269
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,561
Come on.

270
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:22,801
Yeah. Going in now.

271
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:11,321
- What about the auxiliary?
- The pumps are gone.

272
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:13,761
The electrical's gone.

273
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,321
The core?

274
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,361
I didn't go in there
and I won't.

275
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:20,161
I think it's time we...

276
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:23,281
We have to get water into the
core, or there'll be a meltdown.

277
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:25,921
- We have to work on the valves.
- Sasha.

278
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,241
What do you want, Boris?

279
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,441
If it's true, we're dead,
a million people are dead.

280
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,401
Is that what you need to hear?

281
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:35,321
We have to open the valves
by hand.

282
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,041
By hand?

283
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:41,001
The number of valves, time to
turn them - it's hours in there.

284
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:42,601
- Then help us.
- Help you do what?

285
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,401
Pump water into a ditch?
There's nothing there.

286
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,361
Leonid, I'm begging you.

287
00:35:09,121 --> 00:35:10,841
Watch the panel
while we're gone.

288
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,721
It's not working.

289
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:15,081
Just watch it.

290
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:38,281
I guess we know why
they called us in early.

291
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:40,121
Is anyone saying what happened?

292
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:42,561
They were running
the safety test in the turbines

293
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,601
through the control-system tank.

294
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:47,841
It doesn't make sense
to me either.

295
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,041
What about sabotage?

296
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,281
A bomb?

297
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:54,521
Sitnikov.

298
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:57,881
Bryukhanov said to use the good
dosimeter but it's in the safe.

299
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:02,081
- We can't find the key.
- It's in building two. Has...?

300
00:36:02,241 --> 00:36:03,961
Follow me.

301
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:18,401
Gentlemen, welcome.
Please find a seat.

302
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:19,961
Plenty of room.

303
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:23,121
I apologise for the lateness
of the hour.

304
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:27,001
Rest assured, we are
all very safe down here.

305
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:29,921
We built this shelter to
withstand a nuclear attack

306
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:32,561
by the Americans,
so I think we'll be fine.

307
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:36,921
Erm... as you can see
we have experienced an accident.

308
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:39,441
A large control tank
malfunctioned,

309
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:43,361
damaging reactor building four
and starting a fire.

310
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:46,801
Now, I have spoken directly
to Deputy Secretary Maryin.

311
00:36:46,961 --> 00:36:49,241
Maryin spoke to
Deputy Chief Frolyshev,

312
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:52,121
Frolyshev to Central Committee
member Dolghikh,

313
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:55,401
and Dolghikh to
General Secretary Gorbachev.

314
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:56,841
Now...

315
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:02,641
..because the Central Committee
has the greatest respect

316
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:06,281
for the work of the
Pripyat Executive Committee,

317
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:08,881
they've asked me to brief
you on matters as they stand.

318
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:10,121
So...

319
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:15,441
first, the accident
is well under control.

320
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:20,161
Second, because the efforts
of the Soviet nuclear industry

321
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,081
are considered key state
secrets, it is important

322
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,921
that we ensure
that this incident

323
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:29,481
has no adverse consequences.

324
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:33,961
Now, to prevent a panic, the
Central Committee have ordered

325
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,281
a detachment of
military police to Pripyat.

326
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,121
How large of a detachment?

327
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:41,481
Between 2,000 and 4,000 men.

328
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,521
What's really going on here?
How dangerous is this?

329
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:51,281
There's mild radiation but it's
limited to the plant itself.

330
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:53,441
- No, it isn't.
- Excuse me?

331
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:56,801
You saw men outside vomiting.

332
00:37:57,961 --> 00:37:59,841
You saw men with burns.

333
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:03,161
There's more radiation
than they're saying.

334
00:38:03,321 --> 00:38:05,401
We have wives here,
we have children.

335
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:08,081
I say we evacuate the town.

336
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:13,041
Gentlemen, please.
Please, my wife is here.

337
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:17,401
Do you think I would keep her
in Pripyat if it wasn't safe?

338
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,601
Bryukhanov, the air is glowing.

339
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:24,081
The Cherenkov effect.
Completely normal phenomenon.

340
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:25,921
Can happen
with minimal radiation.

341
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:39,281
I wonder how many of you know
the name of this place.

342
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:44,281
We all call it Chernobyl,
of course.

343
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,161
What is its real name?

344
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:52,241
The Vladimir I Lenin
Nuclear Power Station.

345
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:54,761
Exactly.

346
00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:59,081
Vladimir I Lenin.

347
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:09,841
And how proud he would be
of you all tonight.

348
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:13,521
Especially you, young man.

349
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,161
And the passion
you have for the people.

350
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:21,721
For is that not the sole purpose
of the apparatus of the state?

351
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:25,961
Sometimes we forget.

352
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:28,921
Sometimes we fall prey to fear.

353
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:33,961
But our faith
in Soviet socialism...

354
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,601
..will always be rewarded.

355
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:44,041
Now, the state tells us the
situation here is not dangerous.

356
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:46,761
Have faith, comrades.

357
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:51,161
The state tells us
it wants to prevent a panic.

358
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,121
Listen well.

359
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:59,521
It's true when the people see
the police they will be afraid.

360
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:03,121
But it is my experience...

361
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:06,321
..that when the people
ask questions

362
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,761
that are not
in their own best interest,

363
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,681
they should simply be told

364
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,961
to keep their minds
on their labour

365
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,561
and leave matters of
the state to the state.

366
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,921
We seal off the city.

367
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,001
No one leaves.

368
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:30,681
And cut the phone lines. Contain
the spread of misinformation.

369
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:36,521
That is how
we keep the people

370
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,561
from undermining
the fruits of their own labour.

371
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,041
Yes, comrades.

372
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:49,001
We will all be rewarded for
what we do here tonight.

373
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,481
This is our moment to shine.

374
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:08,521
Thank you.

375
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,561
Comrade Sitnikov,
the chief engineer.

376
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:36,761
Well?

377
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,161
I sent my dosimetrists
into the reactor building.

378
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:48,801
The large dosimeter
from the safe,

379
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:50,961
the one with the thousand
roentgen capacity...

380
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:53,081
What was the number?

381
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:56,401
There was none.

382
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,281
The meter burned out
the second it was turned on.

383
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:02,001
- It's typical.
- This is what Moscow does:

384
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:03,841
sends us shit equipment,

385
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:07,161
- wonders why things go wrong.
- We found another dosimeter.

386
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:09,401
From the military fire
department.

387
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:12,361
It only goes to 200 roentgen,
but it's better than small ones.

388
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:13,921
And?

389
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:17,441
It maxed out. 200 roentgen.

390
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,601
- What game are you playing?
- No, I-I...

391
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:25,641
I asked and he took
multiple measurements.

392
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:28,401
- He's my best man.
- It's another faulty meter.

393
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:29,881
You're wasting our time.

394
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,681
I checked the meter
against the control.

395
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,881
What's wrong with you?
How did you get that number

396
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,921
from feedwater leaking
from a blown tank?

397
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:39,961
You don't.

398
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:42,721
Then what the fuck
are you talking about?

399
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:48,561
I...

400
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,961
I walked around the exterior
of building four.

401
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:57,841
I think there's graphite
on the ground in the rubble.

402
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:00,841
You didn't see graphite.

403
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:03,241
- I did.
- You didn't.

404
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,201
You didn't!
Because it's not there.

405
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:12,241
What?
Are you suggesting the core...

406
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:14,801
What? Exploded?

407
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:19,121
Yes.

408
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:31,081
Sitnikov, you're a nuclear
engineer, so am I.

409
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:36,681
Now, please tell me how
an RBMK reactor core explodes.

410
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,641
Not a meltdown, an explosion.

411
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:44,561
- I'd love to know.
- I can't.

412
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:47,841
Are you stupid?

413
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:50,001
No.

414
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,961
Then why can't you?

415
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,201
I...

416
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:58,801
I don't see
how it could explode.

417
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,641
- But it did.
- Enough.

418
00:44:02,801 --> 00:44:04,481
I'll go up
to the vent-block roof.

419
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:07,801
From there, you can look right
down into reactor building four.

420
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,281
I'll see it with my own...

421
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:12,281
my own eyes.

422
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,721
I apologise.

423
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,601
Guards! Guards!

424
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:25,881
Get him to a medic or
a hospital. Whatever he needs.

425
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,961
It's the feedwater.
Been around it all night.

426
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:48,121
You go, then.

427
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:52,401
What?

428
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:55,441
Go to the vent-block roof
and report back what you see.

429
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:56,681
No.

430
00:45:00,321 --> 00:45:01,961
No, I won't do that.

431
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:04,121
Of course you will.

432
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:10,481
You'll be fine.

433
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,801
You'll see. Come on.

434
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:56,241
OK.

435
00:45:57,241 --> 00:45:59,241
Let's begin.

436
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:08,001
Leonid.

437
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,801
Leonid.

438
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:14,961
Oh.

439
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:23,641
All the way, OK?
All the way open.

440
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:36,721
I'm sorry.

441
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:40,281
There's nothing to be sorry for.

442
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,961
I told you,
we did nothing wrong.

443
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:47,721
But we did.

444
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,241
- Hello.
<i>- Valery Legasov?</i>

445
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,001
- Yes.
<i>- You're the Legasov</i>

446
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,561
<i>who's the First Deputy Director</i>

447
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:33,761
<i>of the Kurchatov Institute
of Atomic Energy?</i>

448
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:34,961
I am. Who am I...

449
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:36,681
<i>This is Boris Shcherbina,</i>

450
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,921
<i>Deputy Chairman
of the Council of Ministers</i>

451
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,321
<i>and Head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.</i>

452
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:45,721
<i>There's been an accident at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</i>

453
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:47,881
- How bad is it?
<i>- No, no need to panic.</i>

454
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:50,161
<i>There was a fire.
It's mostly put out.</i>

455
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:52,601
<i>The system-control tank
exploded.</i>

456
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,521
Control-system tank.
And the core?

457
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:58,641
<i>We've ordered them to
continuously pump water.</i>

458
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:02,081
- Yes, I see. Any contamination?
<i>- It's mild.</i>

459
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:05,361
<i>The plant manager, Bryukhanov,
reports 3. 6 roentgen per hour.</i>

460
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:07,961
That's significant. You should
evacuate surrounding...

461
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:11,001
<i>You're an expert
on RBMK reactors, correct?</i>

462
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:13,761
Yes, I've studied...

463
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:15,361
<i>General Secretary Gorbachev</i>

464
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:17,641
<i>has appointed a committee
to manage the accident.</i>

465
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:21,401
<i>You're on it. We'll convene
at two this afternoon.</i>

466
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,681
That late? Forgive me,

467
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,401
don't you think, given the
amount of radiation, it'd be...

468
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,161
<i>Legasov,
you are on this committee</i>

469
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:29,921
<i>to answer direct questions</i>

470
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:32,041
<i>about the function
of an RBMK reactor,</i>

471
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:34,041
<i>if they should
happen to arise.</i>

472
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:36,601
<i>Nothing else.
Certainly not policy.</i>

473
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,001
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- Yes, of course.

474
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:41,161
I didn't mean...
