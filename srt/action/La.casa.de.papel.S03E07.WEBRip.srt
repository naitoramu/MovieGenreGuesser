00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,833
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,625
- Good morning, daddy.
- Good morning, queen.

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:25,000
- Wanna fuck?
- Yes. You do, too. Come look at this.

4
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,458
Look out there.

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,250
They're Brazilians. We haven't seen
a Brazilian boat in a long time.

6
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,083
The last ones that came
were Puerto Ricans or Guyanese people.

7
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,500
No idea.

8
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,291
They look friendly.

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,208
The CIA, FBI,

10
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,041
and Interpol also have agents
that look friendly.

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,083
Come on, man. They're tourists.
You can see it in their faces.

12
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,458
My love.

13
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,333
We need to socialize.

14
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,583
I'm serious. Couples need a social life.

15
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,416
They go to parties, they go
to the movies, they dine out.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,291
They don't hang out with Kuna Indians
or play beach tennis every day.

17
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,375
- No.
- No, what?

18
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,458
No.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,125
- Please, come on.
- No. No way.

20
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,833
Tokyo, it's a safety measure.

21
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,000
Hey!

22
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,583
Hey!

23
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,708
Hello, my friends!

24
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:55,458
Rio! Rio! Rio!

25
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,000
Rio! Rio! Rio!

26
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,250
Rio! Rio! Rio!

27
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,500
Rio! Rio! Rio!

28
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,791
Rio! Rio! Rio!

29
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,500
<i>Aníbal Cortés is walking</i>

30
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,208
<i>towards the Bank of Spain.</i>

31
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:37,125
<i>The Spanish police are handing over one
of the most wanted fugitives in the world.</i>

32
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,000
<i>It's been 44 hours
since the beginning of the robbery</i>

33
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,875
<i>and the police yield, handing over Cortés.</i>

34
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>He's the presumably tortured man.</i>

35
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,375
<i>The Professor's gang is together again.</i>

36
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,958
<i>Rio is at the bank's door.</i>

37
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,375
<i>It's your turn.</i>

38
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,416
Doors.

39
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,916
Helsinki,

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,708
<i>- green light.</i>
- Move forward!

41
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,375
HOSTAGE EXCHANGE AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

42
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,291
You're so handsome!

43
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,541
So handsome, with a tie and all!

44
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,083
It's the only nice thing
the police did for me.

45
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,500
I can imagine.

46
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,333
<i>You're so beautiful in the red jumper.</i>

47
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,583
<i>How are you?</i>

48
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,916
<i>- Better.
- Yes.</i>

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,583
What the fuck are you doing
in the Bank of Spain?

50
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,791
We came to get you.

51
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,958
Everything is over.
You're going back home, friends!

52
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,708
All of Spain is with you!

53
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,833
Brave! You're so brave!

54
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,708
Don't worry. You're with me now.

55
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,166
Let's see what Suárez can tell us now.
There he is.

56
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,541
Suárez, easy!

57
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,750
- I want to go back in!
- Calm down.

58
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,875
Give me more men! Explosives!
We were so close! I'm going to kill them!

59
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,666
- Calm down, please!
- Tamayo!

60
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,708
What's that idiot doing?

61
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,958
It's Arturo Román.
The Royal Mint's former director.

62
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,333
Close the doors!

63
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,291
That fucker!

64
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,375
Don't shoot, don't shoot! I'm unarmed.

65
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,291
I'm Arturo Román.

66
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,125
Arturito?

67
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,666
A big applause! Come on!

68
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,583
You're Arturo Román, aren't you?

69
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,375
Of course.

70
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,291
I read your book.

71
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,125
You're fucking crazy!

72
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,541
You could be out there,
living the good life,

73
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,958
but you're here,
in the fucking lion's den.

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,291
Do you know what a ruckus
you've raised out there?

75
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,875
Give Helsi a big hug!

76
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,916
You may be a war nutjob, Helsinki,

77
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,083
but you're a sweetheart!

78
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,583
- Hi!
- Hi!

79
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,208
What should I call you? Mónica?

80
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
No, Stockholm.

81
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,375
Okay. Brother!

82
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,125
What did you smoke to come back here?

83
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,416
The life of a millionaire is very boring.

84
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,541
Thanks, man.

85
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,291
That you're here,

86
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,333
after everything you've lost,
means a lot to me.

87
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,166
Little one!

88
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,791
- Little one! Let me give you a kiss.
- How are you, beautiful?

89
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,250
I couldn't be happier
even if I had given birth to you.

90
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,666
You're all fucking great.

91
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,583
Yes, we're great, but the one who pushed
us forward was your ugly girlfriend.

92
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,142
- If it wasn't for her...
- Stop that.

93
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,291
You'll have to excuse me,
but... it's my turn.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,208
<i>I will be back shortly.</i>

95
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,250
How are you doing?

96
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,500
Positive for halothane.

97
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,750
But there is no trace
of any other substances. We're fine.

98
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,333
I'm glad. They won a battle, not the war,
so cheer up, for fuck's sake!

99
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,041
Everyone, hear me!

100
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,125
This operation never happened.

101
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,000
- Understood?
- Really?

102
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,125
Not even a Burkina Faso commando
would do what we have done.

103
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,166
Show a little bit of respect.

104
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,250
This isn't going to escalate.

105
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,916
There are no victims,
we've gotten 40 hostages out,

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,708
so let's think about it positively
and let's move forward. Please.

107
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,833
Yes, yes, I'm positive. Look.
Very positive.

108
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,791
The problem is we never learn the lesson.

109
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:27,083
That guy is like Einstein, and our four
GEOs broke into the Bank through a toilet.

110
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,291
We did what was necessary.

111
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,791
What did the Navy Seals do
during the search for Bin Laden's?

112
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,958
What did the Russians do
in the Dubrovka Theater?

113
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,291
Exactly what the handbook says.

114
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,541
How long did it take for us
to make this decision?

115
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,916
Twenty minutes?

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Because that guy had years
to decide how to respond.

117
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,625
Every move we make,
he knows how to counteract it.

118
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,041
These operations are always risky. Always.

119
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,666
Unless you want to enlighten us
with a riskless proposition.

120
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,541
Not one,

121
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,083
at least three.

122
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,583
Antoñanzas, give me a donut.

123
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,458
Mónica.

124
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,416
- You look beautiful.
- I'm Stockholm.

125
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,750
Stand here.

126
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,291
Lift your shirt.

127
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,291
Raise your arms.

128
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,545
Why did you come, Arturo?
They could've shot you.

129
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,625
I don't care.

130
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,125
I stopped caring about my life when...

131
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,833
when I lost everything.

132
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,500
Laura left me and took the kids with her.

133
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,833
I live in an apartment that has
a kitchen in a closet.

134
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,375
I eat canned tuna.

135
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,500
And the boxes from the move
are still in the hall, but...

136
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,625
Well, I'm getting over it.

137
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,750
Little by little, Arturo.

138
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,000
Listen. I know I was horrible
to you and my wife.

139
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,166
I admit it.

140
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,291
I think about Laura constantly, but...

141
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,125
Not as I much as I think about you.

142
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,916
I always think about you.

143
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,791
About you and about our son.

144
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,583
Because he's a boy, isn't he?

145
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,166
Yes, he's a boy. Put the jumper on.

146
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,458
I know I've lost you, Mónica.

147
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,833
But I don't want to lose my son.

148
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,708
You lost him the moment you said
you weren't his father.

149
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,916
Put the jumper on, please!

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,458
But what did you expect?

151
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:37,375
Do you know how hard it is
for a married man with three kids to hear:

152
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,750
"Look at the test.
My son is yours." I was scared!

153
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,791
Yes, I was scared shitless.

154
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,125
Who doesn't get scared
with something like that?

155
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,916
But it was only three minutes.

156
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,041
Three minutes. The time it took
for those terrorists to come

157
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,833
and start shooting at everyone.

158
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,958
I'm asking you, please,
don't judge me on those three minutes.

159
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,500
I know I don't have any right
to appear out of thin air

160
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,333
and ask you to let me be
the father of my son.

161
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,083
I know.

162
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,875
But I want to see him, that's all.

163
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,708
I don't know.
To touch him and know how he is.

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,541
And I swear I don't care where he is.
I can go to Brazil,

165
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,041
Romania, Burma, Thailand... wherever.

166
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,416
He's my son and I want to meet him.

167
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,791
Please.

168
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:39,041
You may have the right to meet him,
but I don't know if I'll be able to do it.

169
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,208
I will try, okay?

170
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,791
Thank you.

171
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,833
Thank you.

172
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,833
Some things never change.

173
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,666
What?

174
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,875
Look at what you do to me.

175
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,291
- Really, Arturo?
- Look how hard you make me.

176
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,500
This is the effect you have on me.

177
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,500
Remember when we did it on my desk?
You can't have changed that much.

178
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,583
Touch me again and you're dead.

179
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,500
You disgust me, Arturo!

180
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,583
You disgust me.

181
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,333
Disgust? I disgust you?

182
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,125
Shoot!

183
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:30,000
Shoot me here, because if you don't,
this is the only face your son will see.

184
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,166
You and Denver will go to jail
for a long time.

185
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,875
Arturito Junior will never know
who his mother was.

186
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,625
But he's going to call me Dad! Me!

187
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,166
His legitimate father!
That's why I came, do you get it?

188
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,041
My son's name is Cincinnati.

189
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,250
And you won't see him
in your fucking life!

190
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,666
Helsinki, can you finish here?

191
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,125
Arturito.

192
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,375
Calm down.

193
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,916
You know, a man takes care of a man.

194
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,541
Come on. Take your clothes off.

195
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,458
<i>This was the happiest moment
of the robbery.</i>

196
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,541
<i>It may even be
the happiest moment of my life.</i>

197
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,250
<i>But happiness is a lightning bolt.</i>

198
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,708
<i>An exhalation, and then,</i>

199
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,375
<i>you fall.</i>

200
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,166
<i>When you've touched the sky,
the fall is colossal.</i>

201
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,500
<i>We were all plunging into an abyss,</i>

202
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,708
<i>even the Professor.</i>

203
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,000
First thing, we're making
the same mistake we did

204
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,041
in the previous robbery,
which is trying to catch the Professor.

205
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,833
He's a professional deceiver.
We have to change strategies.

206
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,333
We need to focus on
what we know is inside there.

207
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,625
The gold.

208
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,750
If we figure out how
they plan to get it out,

209
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,250
then they will only be able
to negotiate their surrender.

210
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,375
And to do that,
we will interrogate every hostage!

211
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,916
Not even God gets to go home.

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,708
I want to know if they're working.

213
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,625
How are they working? For how long?

214
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,000
When? And especially...

215
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,416
Who are these two?

216
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,666
Because the new members are

217
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,791
the key to the plan.

218
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,458
And most importantly, the reward.

219
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,833
Because they are giving out bills.
We're the state, don't we offer anything?

220
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,791
I want the biggest reward
in the history of the Western world.

221
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,583
Tamayo, what's the cost of a tip
that'd solve this?

222
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know. Three million euros?

223
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,250
Is there a better offer?

224
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,333
- Three million and half.
- The bidding is open!

225
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,125
Martínez.

226
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,916
- Four million?
- Four million?

227
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,125
- Five million!
- Fuck, yes! Antoñanzas?

228
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,208
Six million.

229
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,875
Suárez, can you offer more?

230
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,916
Six million going once, going twice...

231
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Eight!

232
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,541
Eight. They will eat our pussies.

233
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,875
If we round that amount up,
we're talking about ten million euros.

234
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,625
And that amount of money

235
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,958
would convince any Spaniard
to sell their mother.

236
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,875
Ángel? Tell me some good news.

237
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,333
<i>- We have something. They were seen.</i>
- Yes!

238
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,096
A local Civil Guard sounded
a warning bell.

239
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,017
We've narrowed down the area
as much as possible.

240
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,833
The radio signal indicated
they were moving. They're around here.

241
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,958
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Aracena, Huelva.

242
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,625
In a warehouse or something.

243
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,291
There's a van. They've been here, Colonel.

244
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,833
It looks like
they abandoned it in a rush.

245
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,875
Do you think it could be a trap?

246
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,000
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

247
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:15,916
I'm going inside.

248
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,916
There's nobody here. Wait, wait.

249
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,166
Fuck.

250
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,541
Fuck, Colonel. This is like
a telecommunications headquarters.

251
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,041
There are screens
and radio devices everywhere.

252
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,333
I need the forensic team and a UIT unit.

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,958
They had an accident yesterday
and some farmers helped them.

254
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,458
They've confirmed their identity, Colonel.

255
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:59,083
Good, Ángel. You can count on the army,
the police, and fucking everyone.

256
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,291
The hunt begins.

257
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,208
I have you, asshole. I have you.

258
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,291
Colonel.

259
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,916
Give me a helicopter.
I will lead this hunt.

260
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
Let's do it.

261
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,916
Inspector,
they're talking to the Professor.

262
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,625
<i>Rio, I need you to answer me
as precisely as you can.</i>

263
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,958
<i>Where were you held hostage?</i>

264
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,375
In a cell.

265
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,041
A very small one.

266
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,875
As small as a coffin. I couldn't even sit.

267
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,541
<i>I was always on my feet.</i>

268
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,541
- How many days?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

269
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,916
I lost count after four or five days.

270
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,458
There was no natural light there.

271
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,208
Rio, can you keep answering?

272
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,208
Yes.

273
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,583
<i>What did they give you to eat?</i>

274
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,958
<i>Some kind of lumpy paste.</i>

275
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,833
<i>Likely made with flour. And coffee.</i>

276
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,666
<i>A lot of coffee.</i>

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,416
Thirty, forty, fifty coffees a day.

278
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,375
I was all hyper.

279
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,416
Sleep deprivation.

280
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,166
Do you think the coffee had
any other substance?

281
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Maybe.

282
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
It tasted horrible.

283
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,375
But I was drugged up.

284
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,142
<i>While interrogating me,
they forced me to inhale some gas.</i>

285
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,750
<i>I don't know what the fuck it was.</i>

286
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,375
But then at least,
I could get out of the cell.

287
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,083
And sometimes I could even sit.

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,750
Did they allow you
to get out of the cell...

289
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,333
<i>- to do anything else?</i>
- Not even to shit.

290
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,458
They left me there

291
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,250
<i>for hours after I'd pissed
and shit in my pants.</i>

292
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,791
<i>Days.</i>

293
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,375
<i>I don't know.</i>

294
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,125
<i>Did they allow you to wash yourself?</i>

295
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,750
The closest thing was
when they hosed me down.

296
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,041
How was that, Rio?

297
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,500
First, they hang you naked from chains.

298
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,458
Then, they use a pressure hose on you.

299
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,375
"If you want this to be over,

300
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,583
just tell us where the Professor is."

301
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,291
<i>That's what Alicia said constantly.</i>

302
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,333
I swear to you, Professor...

303
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,833
<i>that If I'd known where you were...</i>

304
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,000
I would've talked.

305
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,833
Anyone would have, Rio.

306
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,541
Anyone would have.

307
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,541
<i>You were scared for your life,
weren't you?</i>

308
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,916
I knew we weren't in Spain.

309
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,875
When the wind's direction changed,

310
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,166
<i>I could hear the call to prayer
from a mosque.</i>

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,958
I was completely sure...

312
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,291
that they were going to shoot me
and bury me in the desert.

313
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,458
Every day.

314
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,666
I woke up wondering
if that day was my last day.

315
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,375
All that is over, Rio.

316
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:35,166
Listen. I need you to tell me exactly what
happened when they took you out of there.

317
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,916
They put me on a plane.

318
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,833
And when we landed, they put me in a car.

319
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,583
And they took me to a military hospital.

320
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,125
And how did you sleep there?

321
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,083
I have never slept so well in my life.

322
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,265
They gave me a shot of something amazing.

323
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,385
And I didn't open my eyes
until this morning.

324
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,375
Alicia woke me up.

325
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Well, what?

326
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,541
Where is my red jumper?

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,958
If they hand Rio over to us,
they will probably implant a mic on him.

328
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,791
So if we suspect anything, the key words
will be "quick vacation".

329
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,958
<i>Rest a little bit more.</i>

330
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:21,000
Take a hot bath.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,666
You deserve a quick vacation.

332
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,166
A GPS beacon in a tooth implant.

333
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,458
A mic hidden in the fat tissue,
in the skull, anywhere.

334
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,250
It doesn't matter the cavity,

335
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,666
we will teach you how to extract it.

336
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,166
Any volunteers?

337
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,125
Not me. I can't.

338
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,375
Dopey, you're scared of the scalpel.

339
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,916
No. I have principles.

340
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,541
I'm against animal cruelty.

341
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,458
But you're a soldier. You kill people.
What's the problem? I don't get it.

342
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,083
People are one thing, animals are another.

343
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,375
I love animals.

344
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,791
The animal activist killer.

345
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,583
Can I believe in whatever I want
or are you going to tell me?

346
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,750
About loving animals?

347
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,041
- Yes.
- Well, yes.

348
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,916
I'm going to tell you.

349
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,583
If you really love this pig,
slit it open and take the chip out.

350
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,416
And with all your love, you eat it.

351
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,958
I won't open a pig up.

352
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,892
- I will do the same thing with a doll.
- No, Marseille.

353
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,208
A doll won't work.
We have to open real tissue.

354
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,333
This is the closest thing
there is to a human.

355
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,458
I was in a war.

356
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,125
With a dog at my side.

357
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,916
He was always with me.

358
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,875
People ran away. The dog stayed with me.

359
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,291
Since then, I promised myself...

360
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,208
- I won't open the pig up.
- Open the fucking pig! You're a hitman.

361
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,041
Stay away from me!

362
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:18,958
Push me again and I will slit
your tissue open from top to bottom.

363
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,583
Marseille.

364
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,666
The scalpel.

365
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,083
- You both, out of the room.
- Me?

366
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,785
It was his fault.
He doesn't want to slit the pig open.

367
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:28,666
Get out.

368
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,416
- If I go out, I will beat...
- Now!

369
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,875
Very well.

370
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,791
- The fucking pig.
- These guys...

371
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,541
Let's continue. I don't care

372
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:41,458
who does it, but we have 15 minutes
to locate the chip and start the surgery.

373
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:47,416
Tokyo, until we do surgery on Rio,
you all need to lead a normal life.

374
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,833
Lead a normal life
while robbing the Bank of Spain?

375
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,208
<i>They can't suspect we know.</i>

376
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:57,166
You have to talk to Rio about whatever
you need to talk about, unaffectedly.

377
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,166
Talk about how much you have missed
each other and do what feels natural.

378
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,708
Are you suggesting
I should sleep with him?

379
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,541
Because what Rio needs is a hug.

380
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,583
Not a good fuck.

381
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,125
The police know you're a couple
and you haven't seen each other in months.

382
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,516
<i>It's crucial they think they have access</i>

383
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,583
<i>to your privacy,
so they won't suspect anything.</i>

384
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,041
<i>Tokyo.</i>

385
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,458
Tokyo.

386
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,500
They will do what they have to do.

387
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:02,375
Really? Was that really necessary?

388
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,916
They held that poor boy for two months
without any sleep in a hole,

389
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,666
shitting and pissing on himself.

390
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:11,000
He thought he was on death row
and now you use him like this?

391
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,458
It's the perfect time to get
a fundamental advantage, Raquel.

392
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,166
Fundamental in this whole war!

393
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,541
To control the mics and beacons
they may have implanted in him.

394
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,750
If they need to fuck, even if they aren't
in the mood for it, they must.

395
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,041
You didn't even realize
Tokyo didn't answer.

396
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,916
You're complaining more than she is.

397
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,375
<i>The problem is that I am here. Isn't it?</i>

398
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,416
And you would rather do this alone.
Like a lone wolf.

399
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,833
So let's be clear for once.

400
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:44,416
What's happening?

401
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,083
Sergio, look at me. What's happening?

402
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,208
- What's up?
- I feel like I am betraying the gang.

403
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,583
What?

404
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,875
I'm disrespecting...

405
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,083
the robbery.

406
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,291
My brother could mix
a relationship with all this, I can't.

407
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:05,416
I find it impossible. I can't, Raquel.
I'm a chess player.

408
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,250
Bobby Fischer would've never faced Spassky
with his girlfriend at his side.

409
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,916
I am nobody's girlfriend.

410
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,375
I'm here because I know the police
a lot better than you

411
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,625
and a lot better
than anybody in this gang.

412
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,583
You know about protocols
and negotiations, just like I do.

413
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,625
I beat you at this game, Raquel.

414
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,833
You beat me at this game?

415
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,583
I must be stupid.

416
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,916
I thought we were in love.

417
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,666
Look. My mother and my daughter
are in the Philippines.

418
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,666
The police are looking for them.

419
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,500
I didn't ask you to come.

420
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,583
This is just revenge, isn't it?

421
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,625
Since the Philippines.

422
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,166
Since those nights you woke up
dreaming about your brother.

423
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:19,708
And Rio is just the perfect excuse
to avenge Berlin. Isn't it?

424
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,458
<i>But do you know what?</i>

425
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,791
You've already fucked up my life.

426
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,083
DON'T SAY ANYTHING

427
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:21,000
THEY'VE IMPLANTED YOU WITH A MIC

428
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:28,458
FOLLOW MY LEAD

429
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,125
What color do you think my underwear is?

430
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,625
Burgundy.

431
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,708
<i>Black.</i>

432
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,375
And you don't always wear them.

433
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,708
What?

434
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,166
Bingo.

435
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:48,583
Antoñanzas, is something going on?

436
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,333
No, sir.

437
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,791
WE'RE GOING TO DO SURGERY ON YOU

438
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:17,083
<i>Rio and I were always
honest while fucking.</i>

439
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,291
<i>But you don't always want
to hear the truth.</i>

440
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,791
Tokyo...

441
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,125
I can't be with you.

442
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,625
I thought a lot about it...

443
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,125
and I realized I've always followed you

444
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,583
like a lapdog.

445
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,875
<i>In that cell, I learned that I'm strong.</i>

446
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,000
<i>I was afraid before.</i>

447
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,625
<i>I was afraid of a life without you.</i>

448
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,750
On the island, after three days...

449
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,833
<i>I was out of my mind.
It's a shitty feeling.</i>

450
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,083
I don't want to be like that again.

451
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,375
Rio.

452
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,125
Tokyo, you need this.

453
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,875
- No.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

454
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,041
I really am, but I don't want to live
on your roller coaster.

455
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,625
<i>That's how my fall started.</i>

456
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,125
<i>Suddenly, I felt like an oil tanker</i>

457
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,601
<i>that reaches the end of the world
and plunges into the abyss.</i>

458
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,291
<i>And while you fall,</i>

459
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,458
<i>you can only look up</i>

460
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,500
<i>and see how what you loved the most
becomes smaller and smaller.</i>

461
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,708
<i>If I had known</i>

462
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,791
<i>that was going to be our last fuck,</i>

463
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,833
<i>I wouldn't have allowed it
to reach its end.</i>

464
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,083
<i>I haven't loved anyone
like I've loved you.</i>

465
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,791
And that's not much, I'm 22 years old.

466
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,708
<i>But it will still be true when I'm 70.</i>

467
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,750
Rio, don't leave me, please.

468
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,250
Please, don't leave me.

469
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,375
Do you hear me? Don't leave me.

470
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,791
Don't leave me.

471
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,291
You will move on to
someone better than me.

472
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,500
You're very hot.

473
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:15,916
- And you're rich.
- No.

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,708
And in some years, we will meet again.

475
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:20,666
And I will be with two or three kids
and grocery bags.

476
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,166
And you will be...

477
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,833
in a stunning convertible

478
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,125
with a hot black guy, a Brazilian. Yeah.

479
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,166
And we will drink wine
and laugh about this.

480
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,375
I want to go back to the island with you.

481
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,666
Please, no.

482
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,500
Colonel,
a drone has located the Professor.

483
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,017
- Does it have a signal?
- Yes.

484
00:32:58,041 --> 00:32:59,166
Put it on the screen.

485
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,041
Colonel Tamayo speaking. Do you copy?
Get closer.

486
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,333
EMERGENCY

487
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,083
Yes. Get closer.

488
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:47,708
Get closer. Closer!

489
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,250
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

490
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,625
No, no.

491
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,916
Shit. Go up, fuck, go up!
I want to see what exit he takes.

492
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,666
Locate the end of that road.

493
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,625
I have to talk to you about
the escape protocol.

494
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,958
Take those stupid pajamas off.

495
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,333
- Yes. I think the protocol can wait.
- No, tell me about it.

496
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,833
Take it as...

497
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:05,875
some kind of job training under pressure.

498
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,166
Very well.

499
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,708
Point one.

500
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,708
Dispersion.

501
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,541
If we're located,

502
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,625
we'll have twice the opportunities

503
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:21,625
if we separate, and we have to do that...

504
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,333
very fast.

505
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,833
Raquel.

506
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:29,916
Be careful.

507
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,875
If they catch you, I'll kill you.

508
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,125
<i>A very good point one.</i>

509
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,750
And point two.

510
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:15,416
Point two?

511
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,958
I am not hearing point two, Professor.

512
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,541
Point two. In the emergency bags,

513
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:28,625
we have to bring money,

514
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,041
a camouflage net,

515
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,333
a thermal blanket,

516
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,666
- a gun.
- A gun.

517
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,750
And water to survive at least 72...

518
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,916
Seventy-two hours.

519
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,541
What's the name of point two?

520
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:49,125
You give everything a name.

521
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,041
Epicenter.

522
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,416
<i>In everyone's mind,</i>

523
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:03,333
<i>there's a fixed idea,
which is the fugitive runs away.</i>

524
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,541
But we won't run away.

525
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,375
We'll stay there.

526
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,041
We will stay still, whatever happens,

527
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,583
<i>within a 500-meter radius</i>

528
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,875
<i>of wherever we are detected.</i>

529
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:20,041
- The epicenter.
- The epicenter. Very good.

530
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,208
<i>We will be a few meters away from them,
but they won't see us,</i>

531
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:27,791
<i>provided that we hide during
the first four minutes.</i>

532
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,541
How are we going to hide?

533
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,708
Seven or eight meters off the ground.

534
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,958
At the top of a tree.

535
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,708
<i>We will use the same hiding technique
as snipers.</i>

536
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,666
A perfect camouflage.

537
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,791
The class is over.

538
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,416
Raquel, you should be in position already.

539
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,125
I know, but I have a problem.

540
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:09,958
What's wrong?

541
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,250
There are soldiers.
I won't have enough time.

542
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,833
No. Stick to the plan.

543
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,250
<i>Raquel!</i>

544
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:23,291
There they are!

545
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,375
Get closer.

546
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,083
Shit!

547
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,166
I want the forensic team there!

548
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,083
We've caught them in their undies,
gentlemen.

549
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:53,041
I'm sure that ambulance
is full of evidence. Come on!

550
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,666
Raquel, I'm two kilometers
to the west of the epicenter.

551
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,250
There are military officers everywhere.
Did you get to the top of the tree?

552
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,041
<i>- No, I had to improvise.</i>
- What?

553
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,625
There's a farm 400 meters south
from your position.

554
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,541
No. That's the first place they'll check.

555
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,666
- I don't have any other option.
- Raquel?

556
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:09,000
<i>The Ministry of the Interior
has just announced</i>

557
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,958
<i>the biggest reward in history.</i>

558
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:15,375
<i>Ten million euros for any information
that helps capture the Professor</i>

559
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,125
<i>or dismantle the robbery.</i>

560
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,625
<i>Public support is one
of the police's biggest worries...</i>

561
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,083
Every hostage says...

562
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,500
this guy took some hostages to help him.

563
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,250
He said they were going to work in
more than 65 degrees.

564
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,416
They're melting the gold.

565
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,250
Melting the gold? How?

566
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,250
Fuck, Sierra. What have they set up
in there? A fucking forge?

567
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:45,416
An industrial oven is smaller
than a dishwasher.

568
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,416
They went into the Bank with army trucks.

569
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,625
Fuck me!

570
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,708
They're melting the national reserve! Why?

571
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:55,791
To get it out,
it makes the extraction easier.

572
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:58,166
They can shape it any way they want.

573
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,708
They can pass it through a drain

574
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,750
or get it out in their zeppelins
in the form of gold grains.

575
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,583
I don't know.

576
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,666
Let's go forward with your plan.
We're going after the gold.

577
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,833
They won't even get a grain out!

578
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,291
Gentlemen, they must be around here.

579
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,166
Make the dogs smell the samples
we found in the van.

580
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,583
Look around the whole forest!
Leave no stone unturned!

581
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,291
Every building you find,
search it thoroughly! Okay?

582
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,625
Let's go!

583
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,083
