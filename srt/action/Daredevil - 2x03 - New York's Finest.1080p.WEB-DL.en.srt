1
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,360
Stay down, Matty.
Don't get up.

2
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,980
You need rest.

3
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
No, no!

4
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,150
Morning, sunshine.

5
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,320
Someone better be getting my car.

6
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,330
Bundy's five minutes out.

7
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,000
Keep the press out of here.

8
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,090
No statements or photos
until we get this place spotless.

9
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,800
- We control the narrative.
- Of course.

10
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,720
And before you leave, Mr. Nelson
and Miss Page wanted a word.

11
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,680
Ugh. Just one?
Can I get that in writing?

12
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,050
Oh, because written agreements
suddenly mean something to you?

13
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,310
You wanted your client
in witness protection, right?

14
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,850
My offer's still valid for 23 minutes.

15
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,440
- Grotto's gone.
- Too bad.

16
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,650
You used our client for bait!

17
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,480
That's a pretty big allegation...

18
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,860
Allegation?

19
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,780
Look around! This was a shit show!
He could have died.

20
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,200
Let's be real honest here.

21
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,030
No bullshit.

22
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,530
Your firm is small-time.

23
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,160
Your 15 minutes were up
after Union Allied.

24
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,080
Right now, you are
way out of your league.

25
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Won't take much to sell

26
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,000
that you're the ones
that compromised this operation.

27
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,380
- What?
- Say that story goes public.

28
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,670
The story that your incompetence
endangered the life of your client,

29
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,800
neighborhood civilians,
and the brave officers of the NYPD.

30
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,680
You are saying that you would
blame us for this?

31
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,260
I never said that.
Did I say that?

32
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,640
I didn't hear it.

33
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
Stay away from this case.

34
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,140
Nothing? Hmm?
Not even a little support?

35
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,940
All the legal kung fu in the world
wouldn't have won that fight.

36
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,110
Her office could bury us.

37
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,310
We shouldn't have pushed it.

38
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,450
Yeah, well, you didn't push anything.

39
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,660
I know how these assholes operate.

40
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,620
We have to play it their way.
Just for now.

41
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,830
But then what next?

42
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,870
All right, Matt promised Grotto
we would protect him, so did I!

43
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm gonna call Matt now.

44
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,630
Let's see if he's...
recuperated enough to help us out.

45
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,300
All right,
I'm gonna go back to the office.

46
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,130
I'm gonna see if I can find a way
that Reyes doesn't skin us alive.

47
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,980
They say you don't hear
the bullet that gets you.

48
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,490
Always thought that sounded like
a bunch of bullshit to me.

49
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,410
How about you, Red?

50
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,580
When I cracked off your forehead
the other night...

51
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,500
did you hear that?

52
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,970
Ahh!

53
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,480
You can bash
against your chains all night.

54
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,110
Only way you get out of here,

55
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,530
only way you walk free,
is if I want you to.

56
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,070
Know that.

57
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,530
Why didn't you take my mask off?

58
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
Don't give a shit
about who you are.

59
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,210
You killed everyone else.

60
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,590
Why am I still alive?

61
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,010
Huh?

62
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,640
I got in your way twice now...

63
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,270
and you don't strike me as someone
who just lets that happen.

64
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,540
Military grade hardware.

65
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,170
You seem to know your way around it.

66
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,510
And you sure carry yourself
like a soldier.

67
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,390
What are you gonna do with all this?

68
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,190
I'll do what's required.

69
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,730
Yeah.

70
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,190
We've been waiting six hours!

71
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,240
- Come on, lady.
- Come on!

72
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,820
Claire, damn it, pick up.

73
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,490
If you get this, I'm in the ER.

74
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,160
We need to talk.

75
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,290
Holy shit.

76
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,200
Why don't you stop hasslin' me

77
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,210
and go after the psycho
who blew away my crew!

78
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,210
That's him!
That's the guy!

79
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,050
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a nurse named Claire?

80
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,770
- I believe she works the night shift.
- If she's here, she's busy.

81
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,930
Could you just point me
in the right direction?

82
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,100
- Are you injured?
- No.

83
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,600
Do you wanna be?

84
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,770
Mr. Carver? We can see you now.

85
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,980
Why you telling me to wait?

86
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,980
You've been telling me this
for like an hour already.

87
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,860
Hey, get your hands off me!
I didn't say nothin'. Come on!

88
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,950
Oh, man, that's our boy.
He got jumped.

89
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,250
I know your cousin.
I know where you live.

90
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,450
No, he's no good.

91
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,670
I'm sittin', man, all right?
I'm not startin' nothin'.

92
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,540
Just relax, all right?

93
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,710
- That's what you tell me?
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

94
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,300
- Quiet! Sit down!
- Yeah? We're not startin' nothin', man!

95
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,260
- He's the one that started it, all right?
- You keep it up, you're out of here.

96
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,010
You're a dead man, you understand?
As soon as you get out.

97
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,930
Hey, listen up.

98
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,140
Police are waiting
to take you into custody.

99
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,270
The last thing I need is for you
to come back here in two weeks,

100
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,390
asking what happened,

101
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,440
and blaming one of our people
for your mistakes.

102
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,270
Hey, so let me put this simply.

103
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,070
Yesterday, you had five fingers.

104
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,450
But tonight, you got loaded and decided
to hit up a rival clubhouse.

105
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,860
So now you have two.

106
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,570
We're at war, lady.

107
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,120
Listen to me.

108
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,410
Had five.
Now two.

109
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,870
Your fault.
That clear?

110
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,420
Good.

111
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,420
The meds should kick in soon.

112
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Claire.

113
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,800
Foggy Nelson.
We have a mutual friend.

114
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,010
Remember me?

115
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,180
Shit.

116
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,950
<i>- Nelson and Murdock, may I help you?
- What the hell was that?</i>

117
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,990
Grotto?

118
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Grotto, where are you?

119
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,290
<i>Like I'd tell you shit
after what went down.</i>

120
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,420
<i>- Are you hurt?
- Forget all that.</i>

121
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,710
<i>You gonna help me out or not?</i>

122
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,340
<i>- Uh, yeah, uh, we'll try...
- Try?</i>

123
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,010
Look, you have to believe me,
we had no idea what Reyes was planning...

124
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,430
<i>Shut up! Shut up!
Goddamn lawyers, you're all alike.</i>

125
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,390
<i>Runnin' your mouths,
all that fancy talk...</i>

126
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,350
<i>All the time you're just stickin' it
to guys like me.</i>

127
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,060
<i>- Grotto...
- You made promises, lady!</i>

128
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,560
<i>You broke every one of 'em.</i>

129
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,730
I know.

130
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,230
Listen, Grotto,
the police are coming after you.

132
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
You have to come in.

133
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,700
<i>All that shootin', it was...
it was 'cause of him, wasn't it?</i>

134
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,200
<i>The psycho from the hospital?</i>

135
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,320
<i>- Yeah.
- Shit.</i>

136
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,030
<i>Shit. He's never gonna stop.</i>

137
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,910
Look, the DA knows she screwed up.

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,670
We can go back to her.
We can lock in witness protection...

139
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,110
<i>I'm done makin' deals, sweetheart.</i>

140
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,080
<i>I've got my own plan now,</i>

141
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,840
<i>gettin' outta this hellhole
while I'm still breathin'.</i>

142
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,470
<i>You tell that donut of a lawyer
and the blind man,</i>

143
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,840
<i>they can kiss my ass.</i>

144
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,090
Grotto, please...

145
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,890
<i>You can go to hell.</i>

146
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,960
This another one
of your missions?

147
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,090
That's why we're here, isn't it?

148
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
How many will this make?

149
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,770
I'm guessing you've done this, what...

150
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,020
ten, maybe 20 times?

151
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,610
How long's it been?

152
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,080
Six months, a year...

153
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,830
or your whole life?

154
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,630
Something tells me you don't take breaks.

155
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,340
You know, no one else has to die.

156
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,760
You could stop now.

157
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,970
Walk away.

158
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,180
Walk away?

159
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,810
Could you do that?

160
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,980
Could you walk away?

161
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,240
Yeah.

162
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,960
What is that, midnight?

163
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,750
St. Matthew's.

164
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,710
You a Catholic?

165
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,880
Once.

166
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,260
From New York?

167
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,220
Once.

168
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,140
You still go to Mass?

169
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,770
Stop now, Red.

170
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,230
- Stop?
- Stop digging.

171
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,530
Ah.

172
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,330
You know, a funny thing about New York...

173
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,710
few people are actually from here.

174
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,460
The ones who are...

175
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,250
they don't leave.
They can't, they, uh...

176
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,510
They feel like the city's a part of them.

177
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,550
You know?

178
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,390
Until one day, something changes.
Maybe they get older.

179
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,020
And then they have to leave,
they have to get out.

180
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,890
See the world, maybe.

181
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,900
Maybe they enlist?

182
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,650
Where'd they send you?

183
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,700
You a shrink, Red?

184
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,540
Now, come on, you must be something when
you're not wearing the long johns, right?

185
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,750
- I'm just a guy.
- Yeah?

186
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,960
You ever been to war?

187
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,590
No.

188
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,340
Yeah... then don't talk about it.

189
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,930
I've seen some fights.

190
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,350
Sure you have.

191
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,890
Well, I almost had you beat.

192
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,230
You talk about trading hands
on a rooftop, Red.

193
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,980
I'm talking about shit, okay?

194
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,690
Shit that you ain't been in.

195
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,530
- I know one thing.
- What's that?

196
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,240
War changes people.

197
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,490
Sometimes they see things
they can't unsee.

198
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,660
Come home to find home's
not there anymore.

199
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,750
It changed.

200
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,920
Or maybe they did.

201
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Yeah, fair enough.

202
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,690
I'm just saying,
I know it can be hard.

203
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,510
Do you?

204
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,300
You know it can be hard?

205
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,470
You run around this city

206
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,890
in a pair of little boy's pajamas
and a mask.

207
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,310
You go home at night, right?
Take that mask off, maybe you think...

208
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,690
it wasn't you who did those things,
maybe it was somebody else.

209
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,440
Well, see, soldiers...

210
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,570
we don't wear masks, yeah?

211
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,400
We don't get that privilege.

212
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,910
- You know what I think?
- What's that?

213
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,830
- You're still at war.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

214
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,910
So, you charge by the hour,
doc, or what?

215
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,170
Why am I here?

216
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,300
Everything you do out there
in the streets, Red, it doesn't work.

217
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,930
- Did you know that?
- Oh, and what you're doing is better?

218
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,600
What I do, I just do.
It's out of necessity.

219
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,560
Come on.

220
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,430
You know you're not the only one, right?

221
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,560
Who did you lose? Huh?

222
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,350
Was it someone you loved?

223
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,230
Well, boo-hoo.
Let me tell you something, buddy.

224
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,440
Everybody's lost someone.
Doesn't mean you have to do this.

225
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,820
Well, loss doesn't work the same
for everybody, Red.

226
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,980
Yeah, that's right.
It's clearly not working for you.

227
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,450
Maybe not.

228
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,240
We don't get to pick
the things that fix us, Red.

229
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,040
Make us whole.

230
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,500
Make us feel purpose.

231
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,330
My moment of clarity?
It came from the strangest of places.

232
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
What kind of name is
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen, anyway?

233
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,340
I mean, really?

234
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,300
I didn't ask for that name.

235
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,070
I'm sorry,
I don't see you running from it.

236
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,380
I don't do this to hurt people.

237
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,910
- Yeah, so what is that, just a job perk?
- I don't kill anyone.

238
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,730
Is that why you think
you're better than me?

239
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,190
- No.
- Is that why you think you're a big hero?

240
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,860
It doesn't matter what I think
or what I am.

241
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,150
People don't have to die.

242
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,610
Come on, Red.
You believe that?

243
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,810
I believe it's not my call,
and it ain't yours either.

244
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,700
Somebody ask you to put on that costume
or you take it upon yourself?

245
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,870
You know what I think of you, hero?

246
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,040
I think you're a half-measure.

247
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,540
I think you're a man
who can't finish the job.

248
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,250
I think that you're a coward.

249
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,510
You know the one thing
that you just can't see?

250
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,470
You know you're one bad day away
from being me.

251
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,890
Yeah.

252
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,020
Someone's coming.

253
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,100
Shit.

254
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,690
- Guess I'd better make a run for it.
- Hey, don't hurt him.

255
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,940
Yeah? Let's hope he doesn't
give me a reason to.

256
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,520
What's all that noise?

257
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,280
If it's you damned kids again,
I swear I'm callin' the cops!

258
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,200
I'll say this once, Red.

259
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,360
You make one sound,

260
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,660
and I'll open his head up
all over this roof.

261
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,910
Hello?

262
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,170
This is really not a good time.

263
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,920
- What's going on in here?
- You tell me.

264
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,550
- I have patients stacked up in four halls.
- Look, I get it.

265
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,130
You're up to your eyeballs.

266
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,260
But I got a problem too,

267
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,800
and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
good and goddamn urgent.

268
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,010
I'm looking for a certain
mutual friend of ours.

269
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,640
Ouch! Careful, bitch.

270
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,100
I haven't seen him.
I've been on ER duty all month.

271
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,650
No breaks. I haven't been able
to walk outside of these walls lately.

272
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,360
Sounds like
you pissed somebody off.

273
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,400
Yeah, I'm getting really good at that.

274
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,280
You rip that, you're gonna have
to re-stitch it yourself.

275
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,700
So he hasn't been here?

276
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,660
He have a reason to be?

277
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, you know,
our friend is fond of extreme sports.

278
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,870
You can cut the shit.
I know who you're talking about.

279
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,500
I thought maybe he came
to you for help again.

280
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,070
The last time he came to me for help,

281
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,880
I wound up elbow deep
in our mutual friend's blood.

282
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,090
I'm never doing that again.

283
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,760
Well, maybe you can help me check records.

284
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,930
See if he's come in anywhere else.

285
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,260
Look...

286
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,770
I know why you're worried.

287
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,400
He's been building himself
quite the rep lately.

288
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,150
Is this something I want to hear?

289
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,320
Yo, lady, where the hell
am I supposed to go now?

290
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,320
You want the ER perspective?

291
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,820
Victims love him.

292
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,660
Victimizers?

293
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,530
Want him more dead than ever.

294
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,870
Look, if you're gonna follow me around...

295
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,250
at least make yourself useful.

296
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,920
Here...

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
look around the other side of the table.

298
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,170
I'm not sure I'm qualified for this.

299
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,550
You're breathing, you're not in cuffs,
you're on the team.

300
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,010
Spray when I say.

301
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,340
Look, I care about our friend.

302
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,140
I believe in what he's doing,
I believe the city needs him.

303
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,100
But the truth is, I can't help anymore.

304
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,440
I've got this shift from hell

305
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,100
'cause I helped another friend
trying to do good.

306
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,110
Big guy.

307
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,730
Stronger than our friend.

308
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,110
And yet I'm the one
who got the shaft.

309
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,490
I'm just trying to keep my head down,
do my job...

310
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,200
stay sane.
Spray.

311
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,460
Trust me, I don't like being
a part of this any more than you do.

312
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,750
But I need to find him.

313
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,540
I'd do it myself, but I'm out of ideas.

314
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,460
Listen, as close as he gets, Matt's...

315
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,050
pretty good at not getting himself killed.

316
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

317
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,300
Easy, dumb-ass.
My leg is killing me.

318
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,680
So, you've probably been
pulling in lots of DOAs lately.

319
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,850
Criminal types?

320
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,980
There's been a serious uptick
in gunshot wounds,

321
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,940
now that you mention it.

322
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,900
Something's really
got the gangs riled.

323
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,940
It's a "someone."

324
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,990
And the freak responsible
is the one Matt's up against.

325
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,990
I'll be out of your hair
before you know it, but, please...

326
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,410
he's my best friend.

327
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,030
I just need to make sure he's okay.

328
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:56,210
- You son of a bitch!
- See what you got, punk! Come on!

329
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,122
Come on, get over here!

330
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:00,758
- I'll crack your stupid head open!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

331
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:02,968
- Somebody call security.
- Calm down!

332
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,305
Who the hell are you?

333
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,189
Frank.

334
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,721
What are you doing up here, Frank?

335
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,486
Well, the truth is, um,
I'm pretty sure that this here roof,

336
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,230
right here, this is the, uh...

337
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,820
this is the last patch of real estate
in the entire goddamn United States

338
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,490
where a man can just have a little peace,
be by himself, and...

339
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,490
have a smoke.

340
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,780
Never seen you around.

341
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,200
Yeah, no. I'm, uh, in town
just visiting my crazy sister.

342
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,790
Betty in 2B?

343
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,080
I see you've had the pleasure.

344
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,290
- Can't say I blame you.
- Nah.

345
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:45,593
My wife's the same.
Made me quit a long time ago.

346
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,015
You know what they say.

347
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:48,303
It's for our health.

348
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,931
What about the enjoyment of life?

349
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:53,016
Guess they'll worry
about that when they're dead.

350
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:59,147
What was that?

351
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,235
Uh, it's just... just a rat.

352
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,326
We exterminated.

353
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,240
Lot of guys...
they half-ass it.

354
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,200
Remember my uncle used to tell me
that all the time. He fumigated.

355
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Hard work.

356
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,830
Yeah, well.
It's all he could get after the war.

357
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,330
You know, curse of a soldier.

358
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,580
Ain't that the truth.

359
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,790
Yeah. You serve?

360
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,880
'Nam, 3rd Marine Division.

361
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,670
Fighting 3rd, huh?

362
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,750
Goddamn right. You?

363
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,760
Yeah, yeah.
Iraq, Afghanistan.

364
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,760
Welcome home.

365
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,180
Thank you, sir.

366
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,020
I gotta go down right now, but, you...

367
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,770
you smoke as much as you like, son.

368
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,690
- Thank you, sir. All right.
- All right, son.

369
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,990
- Hey, Marine!
- Yeah?

370
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,320
<i>Semper Fi.</i>

371
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,300
Frank.

372
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,180
That's your real name?

373
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,270
- You get off threatening innocent people?
- He was only in danger

374
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,850
because you squealed,
because you can't follow orders...

375
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,690
You had a gun on him.
You thumbed back the hammer.

376
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,610
Yeah, well, that was for you.
Part of the show.

377
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,440
What does that mean?

378
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,360
I really have to spell it out
for you, Red? Huh?

379
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,450
I'm disappointed.
Listen carefully, okay?

380
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,160
You listening? Yeah? How 'bout now?

381
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,910
You listening?
Feel it?

382
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,580
I'm not a bad guy, Red.

383
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,380
You wanna explain that to the orphans and
the widows of the men you killed?

384
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,300
For Christ's sake, that's what you think?

385
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,420
I'm just some crazy asshole going around
unloading on whoever I want to?

386
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,970
Yeah,
that's exactly what I think.

387
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,510
- That it?
- You think you're anything else?

388
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,260
I think that the people I kill
need killing, that's what I think.

389
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,560
You left men hanging
from meat hooks!

390
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,100
They got off easy,
in my opinion.

391
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,730
You shot up a hospital.

392
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,520
Yeah, and nobody got hurt
who didn't deserve it.

393
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,560
Oh, yeah.
What about you, Frank?

394
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,230
What happens the day
someone decides you deserve it?

395
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
I'll tell you what, they better not miss.

396
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,780
Come on, you run around this city
like it's your damn shooting gallery.

397
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,370
- You think you do...
- Yeah, what do you do? What do you do?

398
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,120
You act like it's a playground.
You beat up the bullies with your fists.

399
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,210
You throw 'em in jail,
everybody calls you a hero, right?

400
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,000
And then a month, a week, a day later,

401
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,210
they're back on the streets
doing the same goddamn thing...

402
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah, so you just
put 'em in the morgue.

403
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,050
You're goddamn right, I do.

404
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,330
- You ever doubt yourself, Frank?
- Not even for a second.

405
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,090
Really? Really?
You never think for one second,

406
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,640
"Shit, I just killed a human being."

407
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,880
That's being pretty generous.

408
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,980
A human being who did
a lot of stupid shit, maybe even evil,

409
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,230
but had one small piece
of goodness in him.

410
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,100
Maybe just a scrap, Frank, but something.

411
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,980
And then you come along,
and that one tiny flicker of light

412
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,110
gets snuffed out forever.

413
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,990
I think you're wrong.

414
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,700
- Which part?
- All of it.

415
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,330
I think there's no good in the filth
that I put down, that's what I think.

416
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,500
- And how do you know?
- I just know.

417
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,120
Look around, Red.
This city, it stinks. It's a sewer.

418
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,290
It stinks and it smells like shit
and I can't get the stink out of my nose.

419
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,920
I think that this world, it needs men
that are willing to make the hard call.

420
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,800
- I think you and me are the same!
- That's bullshit, Frank, and you know it!

421
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,590
Only I do the one thing that you can't.

422
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,930
You hit 'em, and they get back up.
I hit 'em, and they stay down.

423
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,100
It's permanent. I make sure that they
don't make it out on the street again.

424
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
I take pride in that.

425
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,310
- Let me ask you this.
- What's that?

426
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,550
- What about hope?
- Oh, fuck.

427
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,940
- Come on, Frank...
- You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

428
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

429
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,560
I live in the real world too,
and I've seen it.

430
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,230
- Yeah? What have you seen?
- Redemption, Frank.

431
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,900
- Ah, Jesus Christ.
- It's real. And it's possible.

432
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,780
The people you murder
deserve another chance.

433
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,530
What, to kill again? Rape again?
Is that what you want?

434
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,990
No, Frank.
To try again, Frank.

435
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,700
To try.

436
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,870
And if you don't get that,

437
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,750
there's something broken in you
you can't fix,

438
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,080
and you really are a nutjob.

439
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,620
What did you say?

440
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,630
You're...

441
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,340
You're unhinged... Frank.

442
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,010
You are.

443
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,130
You think God made you
a one-man firing squad.

444
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,300
But you're wrong.

445
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,310
There is goodness in people,
even in you.

446
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,430
And you're gonna have to kill me,

447
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,970
'cause I'm never gonna stop
coming for you,

448
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,890
until I take you down.

449
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,340
- You wanna know why?
- Why's that?

450
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,610
- Because you're insane.
- Hmm.

451
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,210
Late night?

452
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,290
What are you doing here?

453
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,290
Protecting our client,
who is still out there, alone.

454
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,840
You're talking about him
like he's a... a lost puppy.

455
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Mr. Grote is a convicted criminal
and lucky we gave him the time of day.

456
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,510
I'd forget about him if I were you.

457
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,760
We promised to protect him.

458
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,470
Maybe you shouldn't have.

459
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,060
Your boss said she could take down
a firm like ours pretty quickly.

460
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,150
She wasn't lying.

461
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,440
Huh...

462
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,900
So, she could also take down
someone like you?

463
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,320
ADA Elliot James.

464
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,570
Took the fall after Reyes
mishandled informants

465
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,990
in the, uh, Teller case about a year ago.

466
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,410
Nicole Kent got booted

467
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,460
from your office after she failed
to quiet the EnSynth scandal.

468
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,580
Chris Davidson...

469
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,670
did you ever meet him?

470
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,300
Fired after the State Supreme Court
disqualified your entire office

471
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,220
from the Pell case due to
"widespread misconduct."

472
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,720
"Widespread."

473
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,930
But not everyone got fired.

474
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,310
See, Reyes walked out in one piece.

475
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,980
She's good at throwing
people to the wolves.

476
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,780
So, sure, she can take down
Nelson and Murdock this month,

477
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,110
but how long

478
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,320
before you are getting
pulled into the shit with the rest of us?

479
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,870
You trying to scare me?

480
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,830
I am here to show you
that you and Reyes

481
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,500
are not on the same team.

482
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,610
Where would you even find this shit?

483
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,170
I want protection for Nelson and Murdock.

484
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,590
We're small.

485
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,300
We can't survive getting
thrown to the wolves.

486
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,010
Not without your help.

487
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,630
After what happened today,
someone's gonna crash and burn

488
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,350
and I need to know that
that won't be us.

489
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,020
What makes you think I can help you,
even if I wanted to?

490
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,610
- You have information on the Punisher.
- That's classified.

491
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,700
Do I look like I'm gonna post it
on YouTube?

492
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,950
Your boss is threatening
to disbar my friends

493
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,660
and dismantle our law firm.

494
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,540
Yeah, my boss is a piece of work.

495
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,880
Look, how will the Punisher files,
assuming they even exist,

496
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,460
help you stop that from happening?

497
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,380
I'll let you know.

498
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,840
Unbelievable.

499
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,060
So, you expect me to implicate
the DA on purpose?

500
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,890
Listen very carefully.

501
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,190
You cannot come into my office,
asking me to betray my boss,

502
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,440
throwing around allegations about
this department you cannot substantiate.

503
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,910
So I'm going downstairs to get security.

504
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,330
And you will not contact me again.

505
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,960
No emails. No phone calls. Nothing.

506
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,550
Good night, Miss Page.

507
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,100
- You're dead!
- Go to hell!

508
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,810
They found Freddie Bones
with ten slugs to his chest!

509
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,150
That wasn't us, prick.

510
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,360
- This happen often?
- It's been a bad week.

511
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,160
Shit.

512
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,910
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Back off!

513
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,200
There's innocent people here!

514
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,500
This ain't got nothin' to do with you.

515
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,290
You're gonna hurt somebody.

516
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,460
I'm not gonna tell
you again. Put it down, now!

517
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,380
Hey, asshole.
How many priors you got?

518
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,550
What'd you say to me?

519
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,170
I asked you about your priors.

520
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,930
Yeah, keep talking shit.
I'll check you into ICU myself.

521
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,800
You got face tattoos, friend.

522
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,850
That's like telegraphing,
"I know what prison meatloaf tastes like."

523
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,560
You just better step back, now.

524
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,350
I'm not gonna ask if you know what happens
when you get charged with assault.

525
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,690
I got a hunch you got more mug shots
than baby pictures back home.

526
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,980
Man, who are you?

527
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,070
I'm the pro-bono suit you'll try to retain
after you go down for this.

528
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,910
Only not even my soft-hearted partner
will take your case,

529
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,450
or any other self-respecting
attorney in Hell's Kitchen.

530
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,660
Not because you're so badass,

531
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,000
but because you're just that stupid.

532
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,000
You got a big mouth, asshole.

533
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,460
You forget, I do this for a living.

534
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,250
I could ask you to look at the faces
of the other patients.

535
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,260
Every last one of 'em
scared to death,

536
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,930
because the two of you
can't keep it in your pants.

537
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:54,771
But I'm guessing that neither one of you
could give a collective shit.

538
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:00,430
So I'm gonna do what attorneys do best
and appeal to your selfish natures.

539
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,400
Simply put,
if you carve each other up now,

540
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,020
in front of these witnesses,
with cops right outside,

541
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,820
you're screwed!

542
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,240
I can't just walk away, man.

543
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,110
I'm not asking you to lose
the oh-so-serious stink-eye.

544
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,950
Just don't fight!

545
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,620
Put 'em down.

546
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,790
Let these people do their jobs.

547
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,090
Come on.

548
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,440
You all right?

549
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,310
Son of a bitch.

550
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,080
.357, one round in the chamber.

551
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,330
Some things, they just...

552
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,250
They feel right in your hand, huh?

553
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,800
I know what you're thinking, Red.

554
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,590
You could put a round in my arm,
in my leg,

555
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,970
but it's not gonna work,
'cause I'm all geared up.

556
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,430
Only way you stop me is with a head shot.

557
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,890
- I'm not gonna shoot you.
- Nope.

558
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,810
Not yet, you're not.

559
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,110
Time to put a face to all your fancy talk
about redemption.

560
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,070
Elliot Grote, a.k.a. Grotto.

561
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,490
I don't wanna die.

562
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,910
What did you do to him?

563
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,510
I caught this piece of shit
stealing a car, trying to skip town.

564
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,410
I was scared.
I'm sorry, I was running for my life.

565
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,750
- Shut up.
- Stop it, Frank.

566
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,540
He doesn't deserve to die,
just 'cause you caught him stealing cars.

567
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,750
Is that what you think?

568
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,210
It's up to the law, not me and not you!

569
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,170
Why don't you tell him a little bit
about yourself?

570
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,220
- You have no right to do this!
- I'm nothing.

571
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,680
- I'm just nobody.
- Oh, yeah? That all?

572
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,470
I pour their drinks.
I drive their cars.

573
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,750
You were doing a little more than that
a few months ago.

574
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,140
What are you trying
to prove, Frank?

575
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,430
- You're trying to step up.
- No.

576
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,810
- No?
- Who are you?

577
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,980
Lafayette Street, 2nd floor.
Why don't you tell him what happened?

578
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,980
Please, I'm sorry.

579
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,110
- Please, please, I'm sorry.
- You tell him now.

580
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,360
Frank, I'm not gonna shoot you, Frank.

581
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,660
Nothing happened, I'm sorry.

582
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,870
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

583
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,240
Ahh!

584
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,830
I didn't know!
It was an address!

585
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,870
This guy,
I didn't even know his name.

586
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,080
He... he got wobbly with the wrong people,

587
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,210
owed something to somebody,
'cause the order came from on high.

588
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,550
Yeah?

589
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,050
What orders?

590
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,090
- The sort you can't say no to.
- Say the words!

591
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,840
You say it.
Do you hear me?

592
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,010
You don't understand
these animals.

593
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,600
You can't back out.
You can't...

594
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,270
Just shut up!
Stop talking, Grotto.

595
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,350
You say it.

596
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,520
I won't ask again.

597
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,610
Say the words, asshole!

598
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,730
I did it, I killed him!
I killed him.

599
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,030
- I put two in his head.
- No!

600
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,150
- But, I swear to God...
- Oh, God damn it.

601
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,120
I didn't know... I didn't know
the old lady was in the house.

602
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
What old lady?

603
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,750
What did you do?

604
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,340
I didn't know she was in the house.
She wasn't supposed to be in the house.

605
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,340
She started screaming.
I begged her to stop.

606
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,130
What did you do?

607
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,470
She saw my face.
I had no choice.

608
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,480
Old lady left a husband.
Dead man, wife and kids.

609
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,770
You gotta understand me.

610
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,270
I had to do it.

611
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,860
You still think this piece of shit
is worth saving?

612
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,950
I'm not gonna shoot him.

613
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,450
Yeah, okay.

614
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,830
I will...

615
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,120
...if you don't kill me first.

616
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,600
Not here.
And he's not uptown, either.

617
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,640
Nothing in the morgues.

618
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,430
Wherever our friend's spending the night,
it ain't in a hospital.

619
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,690
Guess that's as good a news
as I'm gonna get.

620
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,980
Hey, man, with friends like these...

621
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,400
He's gonna be fine.

622
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,240
I've seen him in action.

623
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,450
I'm gonna go.

624
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,950
Thanks.

625
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,620
You know, you're good with people.

626
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,500
- Yeah, I'm a real charmer.
- I'm serious.

627
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,710
The only thing I ever saw stop
a thug mid-fight...

628
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,500
was a bigger thug.

629
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,380
Yeah, I like to keep it thuggish.

630
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,640
And our mutual friend?

631
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,850
I wish things could've been
different between us.

632
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,690
He's a very complicated man...

633
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,900
and that, I don't need.

634
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,690
But maybe this city needs him.

635
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,700
And I know he needs you.

636
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,660
Matt made a mistake when he let you go.

637
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,210
What makes you think he did?

638
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,170
- I'm losing patience, Red.
- Don't you dare shoot him.

639
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,090
That's a bad idea.
You see, he'll kill again.

640
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,630
Can't live with that, Red.
Can you?

641
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,130
I'll leave the city.
I won't come back.

642
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,970
Shut up. Shut up.
Take the shot.

643
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,260
- Go to hell.
- Too late.

644
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,470
Why are you doing this?

645
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,470
'Cause you need to understand that pieces
of shit like this ruin people's lives.

646
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,240
Killing him's not gonna
bring anybody back.

647
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,560
No, but it will keep him
from hurting anybody else.

648
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,730
No, I won't do it again, I swear.

649
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,820
I'm gonna count down.

650
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,480
- Five...
- Look, shoot him. Shoot him!

651
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,610
- Four...
- Look, shoot.

652
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,740
Hey, I'm gonna hand him over
to the police myself.

653
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,070
I'm gonna make sure he pays
for what he's done, Frank.

654
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,490
- Three...
- Shoot him! Do it!

655
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,120
Take the shot, Red, take the shot.

656
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,290
- No.
- You don't do it, his death's on you.

657
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,620
Either way, you're a killer.

658
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,330
- Two...
- What kind of choice is that?

659
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,330
The kind I make every time
I pull the trigger.

660
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,340
The kind I'm gonna make right now.

661
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,030
Help me.

662
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,240
Oh, God. I'm dying.

663
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,620
- God, I'm dying.
- Stay still. Stay still.

664
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,900
I'm gonna get you out of here.

665
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,290
I'm gonna get you out of here.

666
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,710
I'm gonna get you out of here.

667
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,040
No, put me down.

668
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,890
Why didn't you stop him?

669
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,600
I'm sorry.

670
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,160
What the hell was that?

671
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,330
Come on, let's go!

672
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,330
Everybody on me.
Come on!

673
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,650
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

674
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,890
One batch, two batch.

675
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,810
Penny and dime.

676
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,190
- There he is.
- Come on!

677
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,160
You're done, now, Red.

678
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,790
They're coming for you.

679
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,580
Only way you get out of this,
is if you grow wings.

680
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,930
Open the goddamn door! Now!

681
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,270
Come on!

682
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,650
- There he is!
- What the hell's going on?

683
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,940
Shut up, old man.

684
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,200
Drop the gun. Drop it!

685
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,780
- You okay, sir?
- Yes.

686
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,330
Get in your apartment.
Lock the door.

687
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,910
What about you?

688
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,660
I'm good.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
