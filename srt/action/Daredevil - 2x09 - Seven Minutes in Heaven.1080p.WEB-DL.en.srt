1
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:17,407
All right, watch your head.

2
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,872
Inmate
5-5-4-6-7. Fisk, Wilson.

3
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:31,838
Everything off. Clothing and
personal items in the bin.

4
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:25,141
Newbies wear white.

5
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:27,685
That's yours.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,841
I deeply regret
that it's come to this, Mr. Fisk.

7
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:02,470
I assure you my firm did
everything we could...

8
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:06,099
but the case against you was,
quite simply, bulletproof.

9
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:11,354
How is the progress regarding
my appeal, Mr. Donovan?

10
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:15,066
We're making progress,
but I have to be honest.

11
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,943
Given the magnitude of charges,

12
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,747
we were lucky
we could plead you out at all.

13
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,281
Vanessa, huh?

14
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,618
I've secured a percentage
of your holdings offshore, as requested.

15
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:28,997
- She wants to come see you.
- She can't.

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,749
She must stay where she's
safe for the time being.

17
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:35,295
Of course. She'll have
everything she needs.

18
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:38,298
But with that said,
you need to understand

19
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,007
that a good number of your assets

20
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,992
were seized by the government, Mr. Fisk.

21
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,345
Your remaining capital is... limited.

22
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,184
- How long will she be safe for?
- Long enough.

23
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:53,646
Mr. Fisk, I'm doing everything
I can to get you out,

24
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:57,357
but we're talking about a process
that could take months, maybe years.

25
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,987
In the interim, we need
you to keep your head down

26
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,239
and avoid trouble while you're in here.

27
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:07,017
The state will jump on any infraction
to shoot down an early release...

28
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,077
to keep you inside.

29
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,664
It's the best move, Mr. Fisk.

30
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:14,375
In fact, it's the only move.

31
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:26,846
Those you cannot teach to fly,
teach to fall faster.

32
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,645
Wilson Fisk.

33
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,065
The boogeyman of crime.

34
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,818
The man who cast a shadow in the dark.

35
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,907
You'll stop reading those eventually.

36
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:50,285
It's best to accept that real life
is what happens on the inside.

37
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,830
Maybe your life, Mr. Dutton, not mine.

38
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,610
We never met before, have we?

39
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,150
No, but your reputation precedes you.

40
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,324
A life of running drugs

41
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,738
buys you that much in New York City.

42
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:06,701
You may have made a name
for yourself on the outside...

43
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,170
but I run the big box.

44
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,806
I just wanna make that clear...

45
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,184
in case you get any
ideas about stepping up.

46
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,105
- I have no intentions of doing that.
- Cut the shit, fat man.

47
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,564
I've known guys like you my whole life.

48
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,009
I killed most of 'em.

49
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,362
You ain't never seen a
throne you didn't wanna sit in.

50
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,448
So I'm here to make
myself crystal clear.

51
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:29,373
There's only room for
one of us in this prison,

52
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,786
and it ain't gonna be you. Not ever.

53
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,746
Because I'm the kingpin of this bitch.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,584
Catch you later.

55
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:08,823
Mind if I sit?

56
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:11,617
Fine.

57
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:15,746
I won't bother you.
Just wanted to meet.

58
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,250
You know, in here, guys like
us need to stick together.

59
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:22,211
Guys like us?

60
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,423
I was a mortgage analyst on the outside.

61
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:28,884
Seven figure salary,
summer house in the Hamptons.

62
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,849
Just made the wrong deal,
crossed the wrong guy.

63
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:35,164
It turned out that his brother was
some bigwig in the Justice Department.

64
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,311
Some luck, huh?
Look, what I mean is...

65
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,231
we're not like these
savages in here. That's all.

66
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:49,947
Smart to steer clear of that asshole.

67
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,033
It's not just the guys at his table
that are on his side.

68
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:56,287
He runs about 80% of the
contraband in this place.

69
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,691
Most of the guards are in his pocket,
from what I can tell.

70
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,253
The two men you were speaking to.

71
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,797
- Valdez brothers.
- They your friends?

72
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,466
Slim pickings in here, but, yeah.

73
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,093
Yeah, they don't talk much.

74
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:15,097
Let's just say what they did
to get in here was ghastly.

75
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,850
Do they have family?

76
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:22,438
A mother. She'll be alone for a while.

77
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:29,528
I wish I had better news,
Mr. Fisk, but the appeal...

78
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:32,365
- I didn't ask you here for that.
- Oh.

79
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:35,743
I need you to write down the following.

80
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:40,456
The office of Caplan and Dayhill...

81
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,418
they have a client,
his name is Stewart Finney.

82
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:46,671
- He needs his legal retainer bolstered.
- What?

83
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,130
Andrea Valdez.

84
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:52,051
She's 62. She lives in Spanish Harlem.

85
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:54,804
Needs her rent paid indefinitely.

86
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:59,434
- What is this?
- Untraceable, if you handle it correctly.

87
00:06:59,517 --> 00:07:02,019
Mr. Fisk, I warned you about
getting involved in the...

88
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,521
Get it done!

89
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:26,752
- Fisk.
- Anything on Dutton?

90
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,797
He and his men haven't
emerged from block A today.

91
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,131
No way to get in.
That wing's impenetrable.

92
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,801
For now.

93
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:37,180
The paper's interesting, though.
Check out the front page.

94
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,143
The Punisher.

95
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:44,979
Apparently, he gunned down
the Irish in a big way.

96
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:47,857
Mmm, Nesbitt was a problematic leader.

97
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,399
He took out
the Dogs of Hell, too.

98
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:52,124
Blew up their clubhouse.
They charged him with 37 counts of murder.

99
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:55,698
Wow, perhaps his name suits him.

100
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:59,619
I'd say. Rumor is some of the Cartel
got meat hooks through their faces.

101
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:05,040
- The Cartel?
- The Mexicans.

102
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,669
If I'm correct...

103
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,632
Dutton didn't do
business with the Cartel.

104
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:22,892
On the 22nd, Dutton's
lieutenant mentioned...

105
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:27,628
a deal with the Aryans
to move product in the Dogs' territory.

106
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:28,939
A hostile takeover.

107
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:34,111
Does Dutton have
connections with the Irish?

108
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:37,975
Some heroin deal gone south.
That was a while back, though.

109
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,870
I know what I'm
asking for will be difficult.

110
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:44,501
I'm not worried about difficult.

111
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,315
I'm not even worried about illegal.

112
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:48,751
Your funds have almost been depleted.

113
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,379
Building up your little
protection crew wasn't cheap.

114
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:53,213
Nor should it be.

115
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:56,884
Your cash is almost gone.
If I do this, that's it.

116
00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:00,638
After that, anything you
need for the rest of your stay,

117
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:02,650
you'll be dipping into the reserves,

118
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,082
into Vanessa's protection.

119
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,644
I won't need anything after this.

120
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,860
This guard you've spoken to,

121
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:18,948
do I want to know what
you'll be asking him to do?

122
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:50,396
I see you got my message.

123
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,342
Shh, I've got you, Matthew.

124
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,006
Who's... who's there?

125
00:11:58,733 --> 00:11:59,900
Elektra?

126
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:07,157
Oh, slowly.

127
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:11,286
You okay?

128
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:15,875
Where is he?

129
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,129
- Stick? He left. Remember?
- No, not Stick.

130
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:21,589
The boy.

131
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:24,967
The one you killed.

132
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:29,429
- It's been taken care of.
- Not "it."

133
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,682
He.

134
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,810
Well, he tried to kill you.

135
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:38,438
He was scared. He was just a kid.

136
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:43,944
If you'd spared him, he would've
sent his big brothers after us.

137
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:46,321
I killed him in self-defense.

138
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,805
Even your precious court of law
would say that's legitimate...

139
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:50,075
It doesn't work that way.

140
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:54,204
Well... it's a good thing
I'm not on trial.

141
00:12:56,541 --> 00:13:00,002
- We need to tell the police.
- Tell them what?

142
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:03,756
I killed a member of
an ancient organization of ninjas

143
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,467
that are digging a giant
hole in midtown Manhattan?

144
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,387
Perhaps we should.
Maybe they need a laugh.

145
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,725
But you and I, we've seen it.

146
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,812
The Hand is very real.

147
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,956
And they know we're onto them.

148
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,132
The battle has begun, Matthew.

149
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:25,652
There's nothing we can
do about it now but fight.

150
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,280
Look...

151
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,951
I wish I could tell you that I'm
not going to pull my sword...

152
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:34,954
- but I will if I have to.
- You said you wanted to be good.

153
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:39,959
- I do.
- But you don't.

154
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,087
I saw it ten years ago
with Roscoe Sweeney...

155
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,006
and I saw it again last night.

156
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:49,343
Your adrenaline spiked, Elektra.

157
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,553
You enjoy killing.

158
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,855
And you may say you
wanna be good for me,

159
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:00,211
but that's not
who you really are, is it?

160
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,990
The first time I took a life...

161
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,034
I was 12 years old.

162
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,665
I did it of my own volition.

163
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,460
I wasn't saving another.

164
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,921
I wasn't even protecting myself.

165
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,885
I did it...

166
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:33,887
because I needed to know that I could.

167
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,557
Not that I could get away with it.

168
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:42,104
Not that I could get used to it.

169
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:46,483
And you enjoyed it.

170
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:56,535
You know, Stick taught us to
never let anyone get close.

171
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:05,044
- I fell in love with you.
- I loved you, too.

172
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,550
That wasn't a lie.

173
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,400
I fell in love with you, so I don't want
to keep judging you for who you are.

174
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:17,056
And this... this is who I am.

175
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:21,686
We have to stop corrupting each other.

176
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,404
We can't do this anymore.

177
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,035
Say something.

178
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,581
The Hand will decimate your city.

179
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,046
Not if I stop them.

180
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,758
- You'll die.
- Yeah, maybe.

181
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,594
But this is a war I need to fight alone.

182
00:16:00,725 --> 00:16:02,893
Goodbye, Elektra.

183
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:24,052
The circumstances are unfortunate,

184
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,315
but each loss brings opportunity.

185
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,879
- I'm glad we have this chance to meet.
- Hmm.

186
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,423
You have something
you wanna say to me?

187
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,261
I've been following your case...

188
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,182
as much as one could in this cage.

189
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:47,146
I want you to know...

190
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,588
what happened to your family that day...

191
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,732
Don't you do that.

192
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:53,027
You don't talk about
my family. You got that?

193
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,612
Just don't do it.

194
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,657
- I consider it a tragedy.
- That right?

195
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:02,202
You can save your bullshit sympathy,
'cause I don't buy it.

196
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:04,246
I understand why you'd think that.

197
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:08,500
Look, you got
something to say to me or not?

198
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:13,463
Yes. I've crossed paths with
your attorneys... before.

199
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:17,717
Needless to say, I'm
not a... a huge fan.

200
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,913
Pushing you towards a sentence
in a mental health facility,

201
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,040
after everything you've been through,
that would have been a travesty.

202
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,646
- As opposed to what?
- Closure.

203
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,566
Since I've been incarcerated,

204
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:35,029
I've developed an empathy towards those

205
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,135
who suffer by the hand of the law.

206
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:39,699
I think I've heard
enough of your bullshit, okay?

207
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:42,993
You said closure. What'd you mean?

208
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:50,250
There's a man, here, in the big box.

209
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:56,924
He's a prisoner.

210
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:00,177
He's been overheard...

211
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,598
boasting about his involvement
with several criminal factions.

212
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,635
This man...
he most definitely had a hand

213
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,754
in the massacre in the park.

214
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,360
I want a name.

215
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:19,279
- He's in another cell block...
- I didn't ask you that.

216
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:21,824
Which he essentially owns,

217
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:24,743
heavily guarded by
guards and inmates alike.

218
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,746
- I don't give a shit. I want a name.
- Dutton.

219
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:33,460
He's not Irish. He's not Cartel.

220
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,170
He's not a biker.

221
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:39,424
He's something else entirely.

222
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,720
I believe that he
facilitated the deal...

223
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,516
between the three groups that
you've been targeting.

224
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,808
What's in it for you?

225
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:52,062
He controls much of this prison...

226
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:57,067
which has... made my life here...

227
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,695
difficult.

228
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,115
So why haven't you done it yourself?

229
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,118
'Cause, Mr. Castle,

230
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,934
unlike most of the population here,

231
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,787
my plan is to keep my head down,

232
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,165
so I can get out...
in the foreseeable future.

233
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:20,224
- They with you?
- Yeah, something like that.

234
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:21,300
That right?

235
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:34,479
Well, I don't help shitbag,
has-been mob bosses.

236
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,481
- "Has-been"?
- You heard what I said.

237
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:50,387
I'm simply proposing an arrangement.

238
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:51,895
I don't do arrangements.

239
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,874
You should rethink that...

240
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:57,628
considering the amount
of enemies you have in here.

241
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,588
I'm not gonna be your
goddamn trigger man.

242
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:02,091
- I'm not doing it.
- I'm offering you the opportunity

243
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:06,803
to confront the man implicated
in the deaths of your family.

244
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:09,681
Yes, I benefit from your actions.

245
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:14,937
But the tide raises
all ships, Mr. Castle.

246
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,192
If, for some reason, my involvement

247
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,885
diminishes your passion for answers...

248
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,446
for revenge...

249
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,781
well, that's your choice.

250
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:31,245
But the war you waged
on New York City...

251
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:34,039
it got you nowhere.

252
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:41,838
I'm offering you something...
no one else could.

253
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:47,636
If you don't want my help, fine.

254
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,889
By all means...

255
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,058
enjoy prison.

256
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,980
How would it work?

257
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,322
My resources here are limited,

258
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:11,243
but I can assure you safe
passage to cell block A...

259
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:15,289
which is run by Dutton and his men.

260
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,877
Guards have a shift
change at 1500 hours.

261
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,504
Dutton's men will be in their cells.
We can get you to him.

262
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:24,314
We have one guard on our side,
but you'll only have

263
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,202
a seven-minute window to reach Dutton,
get your answers and get out.

264
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,386
I assume that
gives you enough time.

265
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:31,680
- When?
- Does that mean you'll do it?

266
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:33,640
- When?
- Today.

267
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,397
After this, you and me, we're done.

268
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,232
Yes, we're done.

269
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:52,076
The shiv is the best I can offer.

270
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:55,412
Something tells me you'll make do.

271
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,963
Hey.

272
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:09,759
- You're hurt?
- What makes you say that?

273
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,472
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

274
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,016
We need to talk.

275
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,229
It's not a great time, Foggy.

276
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:24,233
Never is. Not lately. And that's
the point, so I'll be brief.

277
00:22:24,316 --> 00:22:26,818
I think we should shutter
the office for a few weeks.

278
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,654
It may be drastic, but after
everything that just happened,

279
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:31,823
we need to think about our priorities.

280
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:34,409
To decide how to proceed
with Nelson and Murdock.

281
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,006
Are you talking about our firm...

282
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:40,356
or you talking about our friendship?

283
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:43,043
For a while,
they went hand-in-hand.

284
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:47,381
I think you're right.

285
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:50,759
I think putting some
distance between us is smart.

286
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,430
What? Isn't that what you wanted?

287
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:01,395
What I wanted... was time
for us to rethink things...

288
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,438
Time isn't gonna change
who I am, or what I do.

289
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:05,149
- I don't want to talk about that...
- Yes, you do.

290
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,401
- That's why you came.
- I came to talk to my friend,

291
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:09,153
not the vigilante.

292
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,196
They're the same person, Foggy.

293
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,116
They weren't always.

294
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:20,622
Either way... I have to do this.

295
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:23,686
As we speak, there are horrible things

296
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:24,775
happening in this city.

297
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:26,169
Of course.

298
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,130
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you, so...

299
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,857
You don't get to create danger,

300
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,950
and then protect us from that danger.

301
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,636
That's not heroic.

302
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,180
That's insane.

303
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:37,514
We were really close

304
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:39,076
to winning the Frank Castle case

305
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,041
and getting that guy the help he needed.

306
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,477
I don't know what tanked
it, but I know we had a shot,

307
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:47,232
mostly because I worked
my ass off to cover for you.

308
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:50,777
- I deserve better than that.
- I know.

309
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:54,823
Every time I walk up those stairs...

310
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,307
I wonder if today is the day
you're dead in your living room.

311
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,369
I'm not gonna stop, Foggy.

312
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,080
Not anytime soon.

313
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:06,000
And to be honest, I'm done
apologizing to you for who I am.

314
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,800
If I'm holding you back, then you should
consider closing the office for good.

315
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,509
You can start over without
the stuff that gets in your way.

316
00:24:16,052 --> 00:24:17,679
Without me.

317
00:24:19,055 --> 00:24:22,642
- That's not what I came to say.
- But it's what I'm saying.

318
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,521
What am I supposed to tell Karen?

319
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:32,527
I don't know.
Same thing I'm telling you.

320
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:35,697
You're better off without me.

321
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,455
See you around, Matt.

322
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,750
Take care of yourself.

323
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:01,765
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I... I never set an alarm.

324
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,433
I never need to, but, uh...

325
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:07,896
let's be honest, it's been,
uh... quite the week.

326
00:25:11,983 --> 00:25:13,402
What's going on?

327
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,656
- Packing up.
- The Castle files?

328
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:19,491
Are you hungry?
Let's get some food.

329
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,720
Thanks to Frank Castle,

330
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,180
anyone that was gonna walk through
those doors is now gonna go elsewhere.

331
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,190
Actually, can I show you something?

332
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:33,547
We should take a long lunch.
We need to talk.

333
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,592
Yeah, yeah, we should. Um...
do you remember John Doe?

334
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:39,428
The report the... the
medical examiner falsified?

335
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:41,262
Nope. Totally blocked it.

336
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:44,934
Um... well, I think I...
I found something pretty big here.

337
00:25:45,016 --> 00:25:46,372
Whose house did you
break into this time?

338
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:47,751
No need.

339
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:50,897
It's just press passes
and NYPD files and, um...

340
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:55,193
So these pictures are all from
the day Frank's family was killed.

341
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:57,737
I've seen enough bloody
bodies to last me a lifetime.

342
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,073
- Can we please just...
- Just a sec.

343
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:03,910
Okay, um... look.

344
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:09,082
- All right, you see him?
- Sure do.

345
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,251
Now look.

346
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,088
Maybe he was bagged and tagged already?

347
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,298
Right, well, that's what I thought,
but... I checked

348
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:19,062
and I couldn't find
any death certificate.

349
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:21,219
Whoever he was,
it's like he was never there.

350
00:26:21,302 --> 00:26:23,763
Foggy, look. He was.

351
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:26,891
He was there.
What if he is our John Doe?

352
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:29,268
Karen... let it go.

353
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,480
The trial is over.

354
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:36,443
Wait.

355
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:38,903
No, no, nothing has changed.

356
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,321
There is still a conspiracy.
I mean, this...

357
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:42,699
this guy could be the key
to exposing the cover-up.

358
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:45,869
Maybe. Somebody else's problem now.

359
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,329
What... But just like that? I don't...

360
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:51,708
We're lawyers. I got bigger
things to worry about.

361
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:52,924
Like what? Like... like

362
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,607
getting Nelson and Murdock
back on top?

363
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:58,423
- This would do that.
- There is no Nelson and Murdock.

364
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,758
Look around.

365
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:05,430
Okay. You and Matt,
you fought at the courthouse.

366
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:07,932
You weren't your best selves, but
none of us have been for a long time...

367
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:09,976
I was my best self that day...

368
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,604
at the courthouse, covering
for him. And so were you.

369
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:15,565
You're eerily good at this stuff.

370
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:16,941
But Matt has...

371
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:18,568
He's...

372
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,446
He's got other things to take care of.

373
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:30,228
All right, when I went over
to his apartment the other day...

374
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,875
to get him to come
to the trial, there...

375
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,088
there was a woman there,
in his bed.

376
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,010
Okay, no. You know, whatever...

377
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:46,930
Whatever is going on with Matt, he's...

378
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:49,599
he's either not capable
or... or not willing

379
00:27:49,683 --> 00:27:53,437
to make room for anything else
in his life... right now.

380
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:56,731
I should've warned you.

381
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:02,654
No. No, you shouldn't have.

382
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:04,823
Look...

383
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:08,892
if Matt doesn't wanna share his life
with me, that is between me and him.

384
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:12,020
The same way that your friendship
with Matt is between you and him.

385
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,999
I don't need to be warned,
Foggy, I just...

386
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,210
I cannot be lied to anymore.

387
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,464
All I want is the truth about something.

388
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:23,675
I get it.

389
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:28,221
I'll give you a call
if something changes...

390
00:28:29,222 --> 00:28:31,891
but for now I suggest that...

391
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:36,480
both of us start thinking
about a life outside this office.

392
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:19,438
Oh, God.

393
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:22,316
Come on. Shit, shit, shit.
Come on, come on.

394
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,318
You don't want to do that, Stan.

395
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:26,404
Don't... don't move.

396
00:29:27,656 --> 00:29:29,073
You're an accountant.

397
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,576
A greedy one, yes...

398
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,395
but something tells me, even if you
take that shot, you're gonna miss.

399
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:38,583
And trust me... you don't wanna miss.

400
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,168
I'm not like them.

401
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:44,548
- Who?
- I don't do what they do.

402
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:48,342
- Are you talking about the Hand?
- Yes.

403
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:51,220
Put the gun down.

404
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,330
How do I know you're
not working with them...

405
00:29:55,183 --> 00:29:57,476
I didn't say anything.
Please, I didn't say anything.

406
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:00,730
That's the problem, Stan. What
do you know about the Hand?

407
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:03,274
I don't. Please, I'd rather die.

408
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,151
Well, that's not gonna help anyone.

409
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:08,279
They destroy everything
that gets in their way.

410
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:10,865
The Roxxon Corporation...

411
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:16,495
the secret room, the ledger,
the dirt, the hole.

412
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,964
I know about it all, Stan.

413
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:20,065
I need to know what they're planning.

414
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:22,544
Planning? It's already been done.

415
00:30:22,627 --> 00:30:24,462
- What's been done?
- Nothing!

416
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:26,422
I'll protect you.

417
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,051
They have my son.

418
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:32,511
They took Daniel!

419
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:35,514
I don't know what they're doing to him.

420
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,799
These bodyguards weren't protecting me.

421
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:42,254
They were holding me hostage.

422
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:47,777
If I tell you anything...
they will kill my son.

423
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:59,122
- Where are they holding him?
- Some kind of drug operation.

424
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:03,042
I don't know what they're doing there.
They call it the Farm.

425
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:06,295
- Take me there.
- I've thought about it...

426
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:07,672
but it's a fortress.

427
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:12,301
- It's impossible to get inside.
- Take me there.

428
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:25,439
Karen Page.

429
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,818
Well, you guys had a
hell of a day in court.

430
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:31,320
Front row seats
to the trial of the decade.

431
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:33,045
Did you bring me a T-shirt?

432
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:35,283
No. Uh...

433
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,577
I might have something better.

434
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,300
These are from the NYPD files from
Castle's family's autopsy report.

435
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:44,275
Um... so, here... you can see here...

436
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,901
The... the body and here...

437
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,171
the body's gone.
Is this some sort of test?

438
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:52,133
Well, I... I think this is the John Doe
the medical examiner said he covered up.

439
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:55,679
- Said when?
- During the Frank Castle trial.

440
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:58,097
Tepper's testimony wasn't public.

441
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:01,685
Oh, my God. Sorry, they...
they cleared the courtroom.

442
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,436
I was one of a handful
of people who heard it.

443
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,397
Okay, so we... we identify John Doe,

444
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,150
and then we find out why he
was important enough to hide.

445
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,820
Uh... you know what?
Actually, I think that, um...

446
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:14,072
I think you should do this.

447
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,866
- Trial's over.
- So?

448
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,493
So, Frank is in prison,

449
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,217
and everyone's
retreated to their corners,

450
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,480
including my bosses,

451
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:25,291
one of whom has repeatedly
told me to let it go and move on.

452
00:32:25,374 --> 00:32:28,002
And do you... do you wanna move on?

453
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:30,546
Case is closed.

454
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,631
Castle tanked his own case.
He got put away.

455
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:34,175
I just think you should
carry the torch on this.

456
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:36,678
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

457
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,806
Okay, so...

458
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,872
I just wanna rewind
this informal meeting

459
00:32:39,931 --> 00:32:41,683
- we're having by about 30 seconds.
- What?

460
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:45,186
You come to me with a lead,
with a really good lead, right?

461
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:47,105
And now you just wanna take off? Right?

462
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:49,523
I mean, it's... it's sort of like
a pitcher going to the 8th inning

463
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:51,150
with a no-hit shutout,
and just walking away.

464
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:54,112
Look, this was supposed to be
about saving my law firm, and I didn't...

465
00:32:54,195 --> 00:32:56,530
I get that. At first, yeah.

466
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:59,283
But I have to tell you, in the last week,
I've gotten about ten phone calls

467
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,767
from people wanting to know where
I'm getting my information.

468
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,706
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

469
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:07,375
What'd you tell 'em?

470
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:08,835
What do you think I told 'em?
I took all the credit.

471
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,158
But the point is...

472
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:11,629
that when my phone starts
ringing like that,

473
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:13,553
that means that you're
shaking the right trees.

474
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:16,259
So, yeah, uh, sure.
I mean, the case is closed.

475
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:19,470
Frank Castle's in prison.
But this thing ain't over.

476
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:21,597
Not yet. Not by a long shot.

477
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,267
You know it. 'Cause you know
you're on to something.

478
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:31,190
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Okay. All right, so, um...

479
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:33,109
I pull some strings, we, um...

480
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:36,320
find out the last known address
of medical examiner Tepper,

481
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:39,389
and maybe he'll be more willing to have
a conversation outside of the courtroom,

482
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:41,325
away from the icy death gaze
of Frank Castle.

483
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:42,576
No, but wait. Talk to who?

484
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,700
- Whom.
- Wait, talk to me?

485
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,454
- I...
- No, no, no. To us.

486
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:47,081
Karen, to us.

487
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:49,125
And don't get cocky.
You're not that good yet.

488
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,501
Got a long time to go.

489
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:08,727
Cell 305. Room with a view.

490
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,856
Seven minutes, and that's it.

491
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,434
...makes the grab,
so a wasted single by Young

492
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:49,643
somehow sends it into...

493
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:50,895
Twelve.

494
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:55,066
Prick's 200 light.
Rat-faced son of a bitch.

495
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,827
You and me, we gotta talk.

496
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:13,334
This is it. The Farm.

497
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:17,171
- Stay here.
- I'm coming with you.

498
00:35:17,255 --> 00:35:19,090
He's my son.

499
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:22,343
You wanna be alive
to see him? Stay here.

500
00:35:24,387 --> 00:35:27,515
Doctor? Doctor,
my name's Karen Page, I...

501
00:35:30,268 --> 00:35:34,754
Sir, I know your testimony in the case
against Frank Castle hurt your career.

502
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:38,567
I think I can help you.

503
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:41,737
But I also think there
are other people involved

504
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,739
who could really use your help.

505
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:51,998
I remember you.

506
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,500
You were with the defense.

507
00:35:55,168 --> 00:35:58,337
- I'm not with them now.
- We're with the New York Bulletin.

508
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:00,589
Please.

509
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:08,722
After what happened
at the courthouse,

510
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:12,143
the mayor asked me to step down.

511
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:15,229
I know I sound paranoid, but...

512
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:18,191
there have been people following me.

513
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:20,859
You're a target because
of what you know.

514
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,179
'Cause whatever that is,

515
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,262
they... they want to keep in the dark.

516
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:28,451
Karen has found something
that will bring the truth to light.

517
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:29,827
Here, uh...

518
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:33,164
This... is this the body they
asked you to make disappear?

519
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:36,042
- I shouldn't be talking to you.
- I understand you're afraid.

520
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,252
You can either continue to
be trapped by what you've done

521
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:40,213
or you can tell us what you know

522
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:42,173
so that we can go out
and expose the real bad guys.

523
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,300
And then you can get back to
living your life, because...

524
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:47,470
this place is not where your story ends.

525
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:55,103
That's him.

526
00:36:55,186 --> 00:36:58,106
- That's the John Doe.
- Okay, um...

527
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:00,108
Uh, did he have a wallet?

528
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:02,068
Uh, what about any...
any identifying marks?

529
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:05,613
- Scars? Tattoos? Any...
- I tell you this...

530
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:11,035
you have to substantiate it
before you print a word of it.

531
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,453
Of course.

532
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:16,540
All right, he didn't have a name,

533
00:37:16,624 --> 00:37:19,418
but tucked inside his left shoe,
he did have something.

534
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:22,130
- What?
- A police call sign.

535
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,923
A special code.

536
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:26,968
Look, John Doe wasn't a criminal,

537
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:30,846
and he wasn't some innocent
bystander in the park, either.

538
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,723
He was an undercover cop.

539
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,145
Jesus.

540
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:39,395
Now, you make any noise,
anything at all,

541
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,173
I'm gonna open you up like a bag.

542
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:43,609
I'll watch you bleed
out all over this floor.

543
00:37:43,692 --> 00:37:46,112
Now, you nod if you understand me.

544
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:48,822
Okay.

545
00:37:48,906 --> 00:37:50,783
Shh.

546
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,910
Stanton massacre.

547
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:56,414
The carousel hit.
I hear you were there.

548
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:57,956
What if I was?

549
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,295
You're a goddamn lunatic.

550
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:04,047
What the hell were you doing there?

551
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,134
Drug deal.

552
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,386
I was brokering between
three groups of assholes

553
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:11,869
who barely spoke the same language.

554
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:13,931
- What happened?
- What do you think happened?

555
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:15,849
- Tell me who started the shooting.
- What?

556
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:18,811
You tell me who pulled the trigger.
Who made the order?

557
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:20,688
- It went south.
- What do you mean, "It went south"?

558
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:21,199
It happens.

559
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:22,506
What does that mean, "It went south"?

560
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:23,566
What do you mean?

561
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:26,735
It means we're not as
dumb as they thought we were.

562
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:29,988
- We realized what it was.
- What was it?

563
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:33,326
It wasn't a massacre, asshole.
It was a sting.

564
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:37,330
- A what?
- My source warned me.

565
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,873
The feds infiltrated one of
the gangs. I'm not sure which.

566
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:44,002
They found out how big the
deal was. Massive exchange.

567
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,506
A real game changer.
But they weren't after any of us.

568
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,966
They were after the man in charge,

569
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,009
the man who
organized the whole damn thing.

570
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:52,678
Who's that? Who is that?
I want a name.

571
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:53,846
I never met him.

572
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:56,474
He never showed his face.

573
00:38:56,557 --> 00:38:59,060
All I know is he had
a line on pure heroin.

574
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:01,729
Shit shipped from the Middle East.

575
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,232
They called him the Blacksmith.

576
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:08,343
The whole thing should've went
by the numbers, but he got wise.

577
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:09,987
He stayed away.

578
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:12,198
And when they
realized he wasn't gonna show,

579
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,533
someone started shooting.
That's all I know.

580
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,786
I swear... to God.

581
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:24,502
I heard about you.

582
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:26,920
News travels fast around here.

583
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:30,924
But there were
almost 100 bangers that day,

584
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:32,885
and every finger found a trigger.

585
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:36,514
You know, this crusade of yours...

586
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:39,183
it's never gonna end, right?

587
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,310
Right?

588
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:48,984
Yeah...
yeah, you're right.

589
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,945
You're right.

590
00:40:19,223 --> 00:40:20,224
Open the door.

591
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:22,685
Open the door.

592
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,484
What are you doing?

593
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:32,695
Open the goddamn door.

594
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:35,781
Hey. Hey.

595
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:38,409
Mr. Castle...

596
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:40,369
thank you.

597
00:40:40,453 --> 00:40:41,912
I couldn't have done it without you.

598
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:44,276
- They got Dutton!
- Holy shit, man!

599
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,501
There he is.
There he is. You're a dead man.

600
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:50,087
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

601
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:53,382
Come on. You're dead!

602
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,863
Inmate! Fall on your knees!

603
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,254
Open up!

604
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:06,724
Not strong enough.

605
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:08,517
Hai.

606
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:16,149
Mmm.

607
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,150
We found two guards unconscious
in the Roxxon garage.

608
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,810
What were they protecting?

609
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,500
Stan Gibson, sir.

610
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,900
Find him. The process
is almost complete.

611
00:43:39,423 --> 00:43:41,592
Tell your man to stand down.

612
00:43:41,675 --> 00:43:43,969
Don't shoot.
Lower the gun.

613
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:46,389
Lower the gun!

614
00:43:58,526 --> 00:44:01,194
There are more men outside.

615
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:04,281
Not conscious ones.

616
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:06,909
Tell me about the Farm.

617
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:10,245
What are you growing here?

618
00:44:15,125 --> 00:44:17,420
I am not afraid to hurt you.

619
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:19,004
I know you're not.

620
00:44:19,505 --> 00:44:23,926
But you are not the only devil
who will walk these streets.

621
00:44:28,138 --> 00:44:32,100
- What's in the basement?
- The rising is coming.

622
00:44:32,601 --> 00:44:34,937
You are but one man, akuma-san.

623
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,065
You cannot stop what we have started.

624
00:44:42,235 --> 00:44:43,862
What is that?

625
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:51,328
That's blood.

626
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:54,915
It wasn't just a random
gang shootout. It was a sting.

627
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:56,150
Who knows who's involved?

628
00:44:56,175 --> 00:44:58,109
Cops, DA's office, obviously.

629
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:01,539
- The mayor? How high does this go?
- I don't know.

630
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:03,591
But I can tell by that look in your eye

631
00:45:03,674 --> 00:45:06,301
that you're not gonna get any
rest till you figure it out.

632
00:45:06,384 --> 00:45:09,304
So if you wanna camp out in here...

633
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:12,140
it's all yours.

634
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:15,519
Start digging.

635
00:45:18,564 --> 00:45:21,233
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

636
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:00,022
Ben was the best
researcher I've ever known.

637
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:01,899
I remember.

638
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:14,411
- Did you...
- Read that? Yes. Yeah, I... I read it.

639
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:17,455
Look, Ben didn't care,
and I don't, either.

640
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:26,381
Get to work, okay?

641
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:18,350
Go.

642
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:19,768
Are you sure that's
a good idea, Mr. Fisk?

643
00:47:19,852 --> 00:47:21,186
Go now!

644
00:47:31,154 --> 00:47:33,918
How quickly we turn into savages.

645
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,989
As if the moment we walk
through these prison doors...

646
00:47:37,995 --> 00:47:39,997
You tried to have me killed.

647
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,291
Yes, it would've been cleaner that way,
but you got what you wanted!

648
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,002
Given the condition that he was in,

649
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:50,340
I assume that Dutton admitted to
some involvement in your tragedy.

650
00:47:57,765 --> 00:48:01,434
What do you want?
Why am I still alive?

651
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:04,855
Because plans change.

652
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,482
Because if you want
to survive, you adapt.

653
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:10,131
Yes! The plan was to kill you.

654
00:48:10,156 --> 00:48:12,721
I needed to close that loop.

655
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,199
I'd already made a deal
with the rest of the guards.

656
00:48:16,283 --> 00:48:18,952
I doubled the cut that
Dutton was paying them.

657
00:48:19,036 --> 00:48:22,706
But that didn't work out,
did it? No, I was wrong.

658
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:26,626
That's difficult to admit, but...

659
00:48:29,421 --> 00:48:32,090
you have a gift, Mr. Castle.

660
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:36,261
I assumed that the
stories that I read in the paper

661
00:48:36,344 --> 00:48:39,882
about your attacks on the criminal world

662
00:48:39,907 --> 00:48:41,373
were apocryphal.

663
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:44,102
How could one man be capable of such...

664
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:46,855
violence?

665
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:49,399
But then I saw it...

666
00:48:51,484 --> 00:48:53,486
with my own two eyes.

667
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:00,142
And when one comes across
someone with such talent...

668
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:02,962
with such a gift... well...

669
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:06,666
you don't let that go to waste.

670
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,419
No.

671
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:12,130
No, you don't.

672
00:49:16,676 --> 00:49:17,928
How's that?

673
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:47,791
Release him.

674
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:49,877
- Mr. Fisk, I...
- Do it now!

675
00:50:05,517 --> 00:50:08,061
What the hell is this?

676
00:50:09,146 --> 00:50:11,398
I'm in control now.

677
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:14,192
- And I've set you free.
- What does that mean, "free"?

678
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:16,361
I'll show you.

679
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,865
Stay back.

680
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:23,410
'Cause everyone warned me

681
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:27,205
that prison would be an
inhumane environment.

682
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:32,669
It is. But I... I find it refreshing.

683
00:50:32,752 --> 00:50:35,755
The perfect microcosm
of the animal world.

684
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,017
When an animal wants something,

685
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:40,993
when it needs something, other things...

686
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:42,637
need to be stepped on.

687
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:46,975
You want me on the outside so
I step on every piece of shit I see.

688
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:49,024
That way, nobody gets strong, and we...

689
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,669
The city's yours for the taking.

690
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:53,273
Something like that. Yeah.

691
00:50:53,356 --> 00:50:55,025
So if you can do that,
if you can get me out,

692
00:50:55,108 --> 00:50:56,526
why not just do it yourself?

693
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:59,404
Because I play the
long game, Mr. Castle.

694
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:03,200
You see, when I'm
finally let out of this cage...

695
00:51:04,117 --> 00:51:07,787
it won't be to wage war.
It will be to win one.

696
00:51:09,706 --> 00:51:13,543
You, sir...
you need to focus on now.

697
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,340
I've given you a chance to walk free.

698
00:51:18,966 --> 00:51:22,094
To put that gift of yours
to work, to find...

699
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:24,221
What does Dutton call him?

700
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,723
The Blacksmith.

701
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:30,643
If I were in your shoes...

702
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:34,147
I would use this opportunity
to find your justice,

703
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:37,109
to kill your way to justice!

704
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:41,571
And not for me. Of course not.
Not for yourself.

705
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:45,783
For your family.

706
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,287
For them.

707
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:54,877
Fisk.

708
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:57,587
Yes?

709
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:02,926
You know...

710
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:05,720
next time I see you...

711
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:08,806
only one of us walks away.

712
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:11,601
Yes, of course.

713
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,271
I'm counting on it.

714
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:47,179
- Is someone there?
- Someone...

715
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:13,997
These people...

716
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:20,545
Jesus.

717
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:34,934
What are they doing to you?

718
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:44,444
Daniel. Daniel!

719
00:53:44,527 --> 00:53:46,488
Daniel. Oh, Daniel!

720
00:53:46,571 --> 00:53:48,781
We're gonna get them out. Stan,
we're gonna get them all out.

721
00:53:48,865 --> 00:53:49,866
Daniel, my boy.

722
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:54,662
Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy.

723
00:53:57,665 --> 00:53:58,708
Keys.

724
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:02,879
Just hold on, my son.

725
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,061
Come here. Thank God.

726
00:54:18,145 --> 00:54:21,731
Thank God. God.

727
00:54:24,526 --> 00:54:25,610
Get down!

728
00:54:29,322 --> 00:54:31,699
They weren't finished.

729
00:54:42,169 --> 00:54:44,837
The physician says
that your condition is...

730
00:54:45,755 --> 00:54:47,132
is grave.

731
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:51,761
That your lungs are filling with liquid.

732
00:54:53,721 --> 00:54:59,061
In a few hours, you're likely
to suffocate in your own blood.

733
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,277
But you won't suffer alone.
I'll be here.

734
00:55:08,278 --> 00:55:10,197
Because you were right.

735
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:16,953
In prison, there's only
room for one kingpin.

736
00:56:49,254 --> 00:56:52,882
You still have scars to
remember me by, I hope.

737
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:35,633
Wait...

738
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,054
You're dead.

739
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:45,101
There is no such thing.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
