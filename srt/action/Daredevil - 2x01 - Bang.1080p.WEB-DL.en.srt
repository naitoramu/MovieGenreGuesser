1
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:12,092
<i>Record temperatures
in the New York area</i>

2
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:17,222
<i>as 100-degree weather hits its fifth
consecutive day with no end in sight.</i>

3
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,808
I'll tell you who I want!

4
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,855
I told you I'll call you later.

5
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,358
Yeah, you'll get what you want.

6
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:32,863
...lowlife pulls a piece on me.

7
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,031
It never worked!

8
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:36,283
What's wrong with you?
I tell you not to touch...

9
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,498
You want to move your car? Huh?

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,473
Get out of the way!

11
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:04,562
Oh, my God!

12
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:06,063
Move, move!

13
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:14,154
They opened fire.

14
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:17,365
Move the hell out of the way!

15
00:01:23,288 --> 00:01:24,414
Drop the gun!

16
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,542
Drop the gun and get on the ground...

17
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,822
Out of my way!

18
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,574
Move!

19
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:21,513
Move, move, move!

20
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:22,973
You get out of the car!

21
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,142
- Get out of the way, now!
- Get out of the car, now!

22
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,561
Call 911.

23
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,028
- And then he went to...
- You! You!

24
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,698
Stay calm!

25
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,366
Call the cops.

26
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,576
Let me go!
Please put me down.

27
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:52,252
- Help! Anybody, please help!
- Shut up! Shut up!

28
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:44,596
Stand back, everybody.
Okay, please, please.

29
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,525
You ever wake up
in the morning...

30
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,820
from the second you get out of bed,
it's like...

31
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,654
every molecule in your body hurts?

32
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,115
- No, never.
- I'm in agony, dude.

33
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,325
What, did you go back to the gym?

34
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:31,786
Hell, no. Do I look capable
of making healthy life choices?

35
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,039
I went out, Matthew.
Went out dancing.

36
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:36,624
- I'm choosing not to believe that.
- And yet, it's true.

37
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,501
- Mind if I ask you a personal question?
- Go ahead.

38
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,879
- Are you insane?
- Yes.

39
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:44,091
- Tell me it was the barista.
- Hey, Foggy. Looking good!

40
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,301
Her name is Bethany

41
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:47,928
- and she is very limber.
- Oh!

42
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,054
You're my hero.

43
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:53,558
- Watch it, asshole.
- So, uh, when's the next date?

44
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:55,727
- Well, therein lies the true pain.
- No!

45
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,188
Yes. One and done.

46
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,191
End of the night, she hugged me
like a cousin and said, "I'll call you."

47
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,318
Oh, that's brutal.

48
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:06,238
- You know what my problem is?
- Well, it ain't the moves.

49
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,865
You know I got the moves.

50
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:10,117
That's the tragedy of you being blind,
you've never seen me dance.

51
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,202
Yeah, but I can cite the legends
I heard in law school.

52
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,965
So come on, what is it?
What's the problem?

53
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:17,415
No wingman.
You never come out with me anymore.

54
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,085
Could you imagine
Nelson and Murdock on the dance floor?

55
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:23,713
I can't deny
that does sound epic.

56
00:06:23,796 --> 00:06:25,090
- Then come out with me, Matt.
- All right.

57
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,092
Come on, just one time, me and you.

58
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,053
What is it?

59
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:32,180
You're bleeding.

60
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,893
- Huh. Where?
- Base of the skull.

61
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,812
Did you get it?

62
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,191
No one's gonna notice,
if that's what you mean.

63
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:44,359
Thank you.

64
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:47,237
- I hate this.
- We don't need to talk about it.

65
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,989
Good thinking.

66
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:52,117
You know, Karen's been asking questions.
The cuts, the scrapes, the bruises.

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,577
- What do you tell her?
- You have a drinking problem.

68
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:56,663
That's horrible.

69
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,165
Well, it's more plausible than

70
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:00,792
you put on a devil suit
and beat the shit out of strangers.

71
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,755
You know, this whole thing
isn't just your problem anymore.

72
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:08,633
And I'm past worrying
about the broken bones,

73
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:10,886
and finding you beaten into a coma.

74
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:16,016
- What about us?
- Nelson and Murdock?

75
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:18,219
You ever stop to think
what happens if you get caught?

76
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:19,428
At best, you'll be disbarred.

77
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,939
Then you'll continue to do
the good work we started together.

78
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:23,565
Do you even hear yourself?

79
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:27,110
You're my partner.
I don't wanna continue alone.

80
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,361
Foggy...

81
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,242
last week, a client came to our office,
Zuly Almeida.

82
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,661
Claimed her life was in danger.
We had no legal recourse to offer.

83
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,371
I remember.

84
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:40,748
You recommended an excellent shelter
for battered women.

85
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:43,085
- And she went.
- Yeah, she tried.

86
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:47,255
That night, her husband found out
she wanted to leave him,

87
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,465
and he followed her to the bus stop

88
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:51,093
with a gut full of beer
and a butcher knife in his hand.

89
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,214
- You never told me that.
- Well, I'm telling you now.

90
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,015
Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment

91
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,561
with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida
into many bloody pieces...

92
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,646
starting by taking off her head.

93
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,483
Guess what?

94
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:07,734
Never happened.

95
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,947
Instead, he woke up in a hospital
with two broken arms

96
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,992
and a restraining order
safety-pinned to his chest.

97
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:17,327
Jesus, Matt.

98
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,787
If I take a night off,
people get hurt.

99
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:22,124
I don't wanna lose you.

100
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:24,960
- You won't.
- Promise me.

101
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:28,546
You want me to cross my heart?

102
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,258
Do not make fun of me.

103
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,801
I swear.

104
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,680
Come on. Let's get to work.

105
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,682
Yeah, I gotta get out of this heat.

106
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,442
Idiots.

107
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:54,114
Good morning, guys.
You take the scenic route this morning?

108
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,449
- Morning to you, too.
- Morning, Karen.

109
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:57,993
- What have we got?
- All right.

110
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:02,164
Well, uh, Mr. Marino's dog
was viciously beaten

111
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,167
by his neighbor
after the dog, um...

112
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,378
defiled the neighbor's statue
of Saint Francis.

113
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,796
- "Defiled"?
- Um...

114
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,090
humped repeatedly until completion.

115
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:16,219
- That's a dog I want to defend.
- Oh, he's... he's all yours, cowboy.

116
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:19,556
And, uh, Mr. Maxwell here
was attacked in a bar fight last night.

117
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,682
He started it.

118
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:23,976
Oh, I... I called Metro-General
and the other guy will recover,

119
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,187
but if you are looking at trial,

120
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,023
you probably wanna wait
until his jaw is unwired.

121
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,899
Your girl's a badass.

122
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:33,236
You've no idea.

123
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,823
Um, and, uh,
Miss Jacinto's working papers

124
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:39,076
have been denied
for the third time.

125
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,536
Her father's gone
and she says that factory work is

126
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,121
the only way she can support her family.

127
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,956
- Well, tell her not to worry.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,749
I've already pulled her applications
from the DOE.

129
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,044
Good, because we're gonna find her
something better.

130
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:51,171
And that's just the appointments
for the first hour.

131
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,173
You wanna talk about our 10:00 a.m.'s?

132
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,259
Uh, what's that?

133
00:09:56,343 --> 00:09:58,761
Oh, uh, the bananas are from Mr. Tate.

134
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,473
Payment for that fender bender thing.
And for you...

135
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,558
Strawberry rhubarb.

136
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,268
You will be mine.

137
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,812
Uh, so, um...

138
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:12,192
I installed this free trial
of accounting software on my computer.

139
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:15,153
And the good news is that
I can re-up it every 30 days

140
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,989
with a fake email address. But, um...

141
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:23,035
the bad news is that...
we're broke.

142
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:27,957
As in, literally no money.
And our income can't cover our bills.

143
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,668
We'll manage.

144
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,214
I don't know how,
but I know we will.

145
00:10:36,758 --> 00:10:38,260
All right.

146
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:40,595
Well, in the meantime,
I guess we have, um...

147
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:44,557
lots of pastries and...
and fruit.

148
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:46,058
Yeah, and fans.

149
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,769
- Portable, electric fans.
- Yes.

150
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:51,439
And, uh...
and each other.

151
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:54,859
Miss Jacinto,
will you come in, please?

152
00:10:56,903 --> 00:11:00,072
Let's see if we can find you a better way
to live in Hell's Kitchen.

153
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:01,574
Please, sit down.

154
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:47,412
Apologies, Mr. Nesbitt.
Blood's still up.

155
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:50,373
Best you mind him, Thomas.

156
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,834
You miserable mutt!

157
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,169
Where was all that fight 10 minutes ago?

158
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,772
Place smells like dog shit!

159
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:16,566
There's a pot calling the kettle.

160
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,655
Someone get this poor man a drink.

161
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:29,203
Grotto, you mangy shite.
How's the view up Nesbitt's ass?

162
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,255
Gentlemen, if you'll permit me...

163
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,007
a word before we begin.

164
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,470
This is a night for celebration.

165
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:51,183
A night to discuss
the future of our family...

166
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,605
the gratitude we feel
for the support of his father.

167
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,609
But perhaps as important...

168
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:05,197
it is also...
a moment for sober reflection.

169
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,825
Sober, my ass.

170
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:17,794
Two hundred years ago, our people
were little more than dirt farmers,

171
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,087
struggling just to survive.

172
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:23,633
They had nothing
but their hopes and their fists,

173
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,469
and they brought both of them along
when they came to America,

174
00:13:26,553 --> 00:13:28,179
many to this very city.

175
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:29,847
Think you've had enough, George.

176
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:35,978
Now some of you are young...

177
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,940
so there's no reason you'd remember,

178
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:45,405
but there was a time
when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.

179
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:49,867
Wasn't a mother's son could
make a move without giving us our due,

180
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,997
and any sorry shite dull enough
to cross us paid a heavy price.

181
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:58,335
We had the cops, judges, councilmen.

182
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:01,629
We had the whole bloody city
at our beck and call.

183
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:05,842
But we got complacent.

184
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,886
Lost our edge.

185
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,681
Just enough for a piece of garbage
like Wilson Fisk

186
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:14,141
to steal what was rightfully ours.

187
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:31,909
That's right.

188
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:33,370
Some of us feared Fisk.

189
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:36,414
Some, in fact, ran.

190
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,375
A few...

191
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:41,669
maybe even deigned to work for him.

192
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,756
Siding against their own kind.

193
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,180
But now the Devil's taken him down,

194
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:56,976
and that, gentlemen, has provided us
with a singular opportunity.

195
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,561
The Russians are dead.

196
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,689
The Chinese, they turned tail and ran,

197
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:05,067
leaving the drug trade
ripe for the taking.

198
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:06,903
The yakuza have gone silent.

199
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:09,531
- Piss on 'em!
- Piss on 'em all!

200
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:12,324
- Piss on 'em all.
- 'Cause this is our time!

201
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,370
Anyone crosses us,

202
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,497
we'll paint the streets red
with their blood.

203
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,999
And when they're gone,
we'll make your father proud,

204
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:24,504
and purge ourselves of the filthy traitors
who betrayed their own kind

205
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:27,549
and make Hell's Kitchen ours again!

206
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:34,258
See, I don't know, that definitely
sounded like cheating to me, Miss Page.

207
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,385
Foggy, you sure
we're not being hustled here?

208
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:38,680
As sure as Josie's AC is busted.

209
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:40,264
What AC?

210
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:41,808
At least she brought water.

211
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,291
- Oh!
- No, you don't wanna do that.

212
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,937
- You can't drink the water here.
- Josie's pipes have issues.

213
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,647
Rust, mold.

214
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,399
I think I can actually see the bacteria

215
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,802
- floating in there.
- Oh, ew, ew.

216
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,154
See, that... that's why we, uh,
keep our cocktails neat.

217
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:56,906
Pretend you're abroad,

218
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:59,033
on vacation someplace exotic,
but no mojitos.

219
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:00,159
Josie just throws mint in the beer.

220
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:01,536
- Right.
- Take over, buddy.

221
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:02,620
I gotta hit the head.

222
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:05,122
And don't let her out of
your four working senses.

223
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:07,166
- She's as quick as she is beautiful.
- Right.

224
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,543
She reminds me of myself.

225
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:16,508
Ah, this place brings out something...
special in Foggy

226
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:18,970
Are you sure
it's not the alcohol?

227
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:21,723
No, it's the company.

228
00:18:21,806 --> 00:18:23,349
He likes it when it's the three of us.

229
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:28,605
If it were up to him, we'd be doing this
the rest of our lives.

230
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,486
God damn it.

231
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,947
- What happened?
- There goes my shutout.

232
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,491
Um, you're going for a shutout
against a blind man?

233
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,369
How do you sleep at night, Miss Page?

234
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,747
You don't get any sympathy
from me, Murdock.

235
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,165
I'm still not sure
who's hustling who here.

236
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,376
All right.

237
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:51,502
Here's your cue.

238
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,964
All right,
you're lined up with the cue ball.

239
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,009
Six is at your two,
pocket straightaway.

240
00:18:58,092 --> 00:18:59,802
Six and pocket two.

241
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:02,429
Mmm-hmm.

242
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,098
Fire away.

243
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,897
- How'd I do?
- Well, you've got potential.

244
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,982
- All right.
- Here, go again.

245
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,204
Six ball.

246
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,748
Straight ahead. Just...

247
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,710
real soft.

248
00:19:39,175 --> 00:19:42,011
Come on, you've done this before.
Just go for it.

249
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:46,307
No!

250
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,934
That good, huh?

251
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:51,228
- Sunk the eight ball.
- Well, something went in.

252
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,565
I'll tell you what.
You boys re-rack, I will, uh,

253
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:56,150
buy rounds for the rematch.

254
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,616
- I leave you two alone for one minute...
- She wanted to teach me.

255
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,203
What?

256
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,459
Show off.

257
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:30,935
Hey, Foggy.

258
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:34,856
The guy at the bar looking this way,
you know him?

259
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,899
No.
Why? What's his deal?

260
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,278
Adrenaline's high.

261
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,699
His heart rate's out of control.

262
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,076
Well, he is sitting next to Karen.

263
00:20:48,077 --> 00:20:49,370
There's something in his coat.

264
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,289
Coat? Hot room.

265
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:54,917
I don't need fancy senses
to know he's probably packing.

266
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:58,004
What? Matt, don't make a thing.
Half the people in here are carrying guns.

267
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:00,923
Yeah, but none of them
have their finger tapping the trigger.

268
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,425
Thanks, Jos.

269
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,562
You, uh, new here, friend?

270
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:19,441
- No, actually.
- Hey, it's all right.

271
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,986
Look, I'm just... I'm just
letting you know, this is a good place

272
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,570
with good people.

273
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,365
A lot of places
a guy like you could drink.

274
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:28,868
Just saying.

275
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:31,913
It's not what you think.
I got business here.

276
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,497
With Nelson and Murdock.

277
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,626
You must be the blind one.

278
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:44,633
Fifteen men, tough Irish.
Armed.

279
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,136
All of them blown away.

280
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:48,637
It was a massacre.

281
00:21:50,722 --> 00:21:53,976
We weren't hit by any rival family there.
I'm telling you, we were...

282
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,269
hit by an army.

283
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,273
- That's quite the story.
- It's a fact.

284
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:01,108
And believe me,
you can go see for yourself.

285
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:03,277
Burren Club, 47th and 10th.
Can't miss it.

286
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,198
It's the... part of New York
that looks like a goddamn war zone.

287
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:11,160
What's your involvement
in their organization?

288
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,206
- Who's she?
- Answer the question.

289
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,085
Brannigan.

290
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,628
I've run with them for a long time.
I don't deny it.

291
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:25,174
Pick-ups, drop-offs,
sometimes doing things I...

292
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,009
shouldn't be.

293
00:22:27,093 --> 00:22:29,636
No question, I'm...
I'm no choir boy.

294
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,389
I'm tellin' ya, I just skirt the surface.

295
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,977
Unlike the men I work for,

296
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,187
and the guys that did this.

297
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,232
I'm telling ya, I had nothing
to do with that massacre.

298
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,413
Assuming you're correct
and the Irish were hit

299
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:51,575
by a powerful crime syndicate tonight...

300
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:54,996
if you're the only one who survived,

301
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,789
your good fortune's gonna rub
some dangerous people the wrong way.

302
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,083
No shit!

303
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:02,003
I got a pack of killers
gunning for my men.

304
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,963
My people think I'm a traitor or a rat.

305
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,924
So, what can Nelson and Murdock
do for you, Mister...

306
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,094
- I'm Grotto.
- Grotto what?

307
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:12,471
Just Grotto.

308
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:15,641
Witness protection.

309
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,184
You guys need to get me
the hell out of here

310
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,979
before I end up in the only place
hotter than this...

311
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,356
- permanent.
- We're a private law firm.

312
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,733
Yeah, a trustworthy one.

313
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,528
Quite a reputation
after you took out Wilson Fisk.

314
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:29,989
The DA's office is the only place
that can make a deal.

315
00:23:30,072 --> 00:23:32,232
Yeah, I'm not walking to the DA
without representation.

316
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:33,617
I know a lot.
I seen a lot.

317
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:38,998
I'll give the cops anything
to get me out of Hell's Kitchen.

318
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:41,875
Well, we have a reputation
for representing

319
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,295
the good people of Hell's Kitchen,

320
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:46,547
not for negotiating
on behalf of career criminals.

321
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,882
What if a criminal wants to...
change his career?

322
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,969
A second chance,
that's all I want.

323
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:53,595
I know I'm only coming here with my word.

324
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,307
I got nobody to vouch for me,
but I can...

325
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:59,226
barely cover your fee.
But word is...

326
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,437
that Nelson and Murdock
put their faith in people.

327
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,189
And I need a little of that right now.

328
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,109
Please.

329
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:14,325
Lie low.
We'll look into it.

330
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:15,993
You have somewhere you can stay?

331
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:18,870
Jesus.

332
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,457
Hey.

333
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:28,130
Guys?

334
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:29,881
Guys, he's bleeding.

335
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,675
Aw, sheesh.

336
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:34,345
Every time I think we've seen it all...

337
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:40,892
Hell's Kitchen manages to sneak up
and kick me right in the balls.

338
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:50,277
It's gonna take weeks
to process this shit.

339
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,530
And where's this asshole's hand?

340
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,039
- Guys, we gotta post stuff now.
- We got two.

341
00:25:02,123 --> 00:25:03,415
- You got two?
- Yeah.

342
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:05,542
- All right, you might need additional...
- Right, right, right.

343
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:07,378
We also got forensics on the scene.

344
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:10,672
Hey, I just need to know
if my brother's in there.

345
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,342
Step back, please. I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't answer that right now.

346
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,511
Hey, Brett!
Over here, Matt.

347
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:22,184
I would say it's good to see you,
but under the circumstances...

348
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:25,521
- Would you please step aside, sir?
- We got a couple of questions, Brett.

349
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:29,150
If you're here to chase ambulances,
you might notice there are none.

350
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:31,833
- Any leads on what happened?
- Oh, you wanna know what went down?

351
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,113
Read about it in the papers
like everybody else.

352
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:36,448
We're not everybody else, my man.

353
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:40,286
Did you just say "my man"?

354
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,496
Uh, label this one six.

355
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:47,043
All right, now.
Let's get body bags over here.

356
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:48,210
Look at this, will you?

357
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:49,503
Now, what kind of bullet
can punch through

358
00:25:49,586 --> 00:25:53,090
polyethylene fiber vest
thicker than my dick...

359
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,968
then punch straight through
the same shit on his back?

360
00:25:58,387 --> 00:25:59,721
All right, we get it.

361
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,682
You can't talk about
an active crime scene.

362
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:04,017
However...

363
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:05,186
what if...

364
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:07,896
hypothetically speaking...

365
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,691
we may have recently acquired
a new client that could help...

366
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:14,820
shed some light
on this investigation?

367
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:17,156
- How recent?
- Farm fresh.

368
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:20,826
- Was he here?
- Client privilege.

369
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:24,955
Well, uh, Mr. Nelson,
if that was true...

370
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:26,123
Hypothetically speaking.

371
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:29,335
...I'd tell you that withholding
your client from the NYPD

372
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:31,753
would be obstructing
governmental administration,

373
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:34,756
and I'd probably just
arrest your ass myself.

374
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,924
In theory.

375
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,219
I guess we really
can't help each other after all.

376
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:40,554
It's over 100 degrees
out here tonight, Sergeant.

377
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:42,473
Why would an Irish mobster

378
00:26:42,556 --> 00:26:45,309
wear body armor to a private meeting
inside his own club?

379
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:47,728
Hey!

380
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:50,606
Tell 'em keep it down in there
or somebody's getting written up.

381
00:26:57,654 --> 00:26:59,156
I help you...

382
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,074
you help me?

383
00:27:01,992 --> 00:27:03,285
That's all we want.

384
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,580
There's a total clampdown
on any of this getting out to the press.

385
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:08,499
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Brett...

386
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:11,168
you can trust us.

387
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,378
We're lawyers.

388
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:16,882
Come with me over here.

389
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:18,884
Come on.

390
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:29,353
DA's going bat shit
trying to figure it out.

391
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:34,024
This isn't the first hit
that matches this MO.

392
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:37,278
Call it massive gang-on-gang overkill.

393
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:39,721
Downtown office thinks we got
new players in Hell's Kitchen,

394
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,160
and whoever they are, we're talking some
kind of paramilitary-type organization

395
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:47,496
with the training, knowledge and hardware
to take out half the city.

396
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,831
- What do they want?
- That's what's driving the DA nuts.

397
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:52,209
We don't know who they are.

398
00:27:52,293 --> 00:27:53,627
We just know who they're not.

399
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,712
I'd say they're definitely
not fond of the Irish.

400
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:57,631
You think?

401
00:27:57,714 --> 00:28:00,926
Where exactly
am I gonna put this asshole?

402
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:02,428
The morgue's completely full.

403
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:05,222
This is worse than what happened
to the Dogs of Hell.

404
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:08,600
Now, we got history,

405
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:11,353
so I'll tell you as a friend,
you stay out of this shit.

406
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:14,815
If you got a witness, the smart move
is to turn him over and walk away.

407
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:17,401
Hell's Kitchen is about to explode.

408
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,199
You hear that?
He called me friend.

409
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:28,787
What'd you pick up?
Your hearing's better than mine.

410
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,457
Whatever happened here happened
to the Dogs of Hell last week.

411
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,917
- The biker gang?
- Yeah.

412
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,127
- What are we stepping into?
- I don't know.

413
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:39,756
I think I can rattle some cages,
see who talks but, uh...

414
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:42,426
Did you even listen to Brett?

415
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:45,512
We're talking about a squad
of trained killers loose on the streets.

416
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:48,390
Not the kind of guys you challenge
to a fist fight in your underwear.

417
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:51,142
Hey!
It's not underwear, Foggy.

418
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,144
Underwear is comfortable.

419
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,813
You're a lot of things.

420
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:56,732
Bulletproof is not one of them.

421
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,568
- I'll see you in the morning.
- You're an asshole.

422
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:01,862
But if I can't stop you,
least I can do is help.

423
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,324
I have a guy I can talk to.
Maybe come back with a few puzzle pieces.

424
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:07,409
Cool. Just be careful.

425
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:09,245
You don't get to say that!

426
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:23,717
Okay, okay, okay.
You've got multiple lacerations, Steve.

427
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,093
All right? The doctor said...

428
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:27,429
- No! No doctor.
- The cut is deep, all right?

429
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:28,889
Into the muscle,
but there's no vessel damage.

430
00:29:28,972 --> 00:29:30,724
Nothing that a few weeks
of physical therapy can't cure.

431
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,017
You need to stay here.

432
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,644
- That ain't happening.
- No, I'm here to help you.

433
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:36,938
By hog-tying me to a hospital
with a target on my ass?

434
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,274
You wanna wait for a bullet
through the window

435
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:40,359
- or pull the trigger myself?
- You need to listen to me, Steve.

436
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:42,762
- No, you listen to me, you daft woman!
- You can trust me!

437
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:45,531
- Who, in Christ's name, is Steve?
- You are.

438
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:48,742
Your name is Steve Schaffer,
and I am your wife, Isabelle.

439
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,952
You got into a bar fight
defending my honor.

440
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,746
And other than the beer
that was wasted

441
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,415
when that bottle
sliced through your flesh,

442
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:57,418
I have got no regrets, because I have
loved you since I was 16,

443
00:29:57,501 --> 00:30:00,170
hot Irish temper and all.

444
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:08,554
Nurse actually cried
when I told her that part, by the way.

445
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:12,808
It's a nice story, doll.

446
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,894
You gotta run home now.

447
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:18,772
You ain't got the balls for what's coming.

448
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,653
Slide into bed, sweetheart,
and settle in.

449
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:27,906
Because I am the best chance
you've got in the world right now.

450
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,961
You got your break-action singles,

451
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:43,922
your side-by-side,
your over-unders,

452
00:30:44,005 --> 00:30:46,383
and the classic pump-action.

453
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:50,554
All guaranteed to supersede
every other on the market.

454
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:52,055
None of these is semis.

455
00:30:52,138 --> 00:30:55,225
Aw, what do you need semis for,
couple bad-asses like you?

456
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:57,978
Whatever this army is,
they're planting men by the dozen, Turk.

457
00:30:58,061 --> 00:30:59,563
No semis, no deal.

458
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,648
Man, I seen you shoot.

459
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:03,817
No semi's gonna
magically make you have good aim.

460
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,945
Saw these off,
spread your blast,

461
00:31:07,028 --> 00:31:09,656
and thank me later,
'cause you ain't no deadeye.

462
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,991
What'd you just say?

463
00:31:14,578 --> 00:31:15,829
Oh, shit.

464
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:40,479
Nice duds.

465
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,902
The Irish had a whole squad
massacred tonight.

466
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:50,071
That's a damn shame,
'cause I'm fresh out of sympathy cards.

467
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:53,074
There's talk about an army in town.

468
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:56,953
Military grade firepower,
high volume.

469
00:31:57,037 --> 00:32:00,624
- Who's the supplier, Turk?
- You think I know?

470
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:02,959
Shit like that's so high above
my pay grade...

471
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:05,421
I'm telling you the truth, man.

472
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:07,224
That tin in my trunk
couldn't kill a rabbit.

473
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,009
Okay, okay!
Okay, listen.

474
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:14,680
I did hear somethin'
from a guy in Rikers.

475
00:32:14,763 --> 00:32:16,014
It's got to do with Fisk.

476
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:19,976
- Fisk is gone.
- Yeah,

477
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,188
but once you took care of him,
what'd you think was gonna happen?

478
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:26,983
Every gang worth shit's trying
to grab up everything fat boy left behind.

479
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,194
I even heard
the cartel's getting into it.

480
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:31,780
They're bringing up
some heavy munitions from Juárez.

481
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:34,282
Military grade.

482
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,076
- Where?
- Warehouse.

483
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,788
Meatpacking District,
13th Street and something,

484
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:41,832
I swear I'm telling you all I know.

485
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,342
Listen, man.

486
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:54,385
I gave you what you wanted.

487
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,721
My hand's busted,

488
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:58,139
I got all this glass
I gotta replace now.

489
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:02,268
Maybe, just let a brother go, huh?

490
00:33:04,145 --> 00:33:06,064
Come on, D.

491
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:08,233
I'm out on parole, man.

492
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:10,861
I can't go back to jail.
Please.

493
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:12,278
I missed Hell's Kitchen.

494
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:13,572
Yeah.

495
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,949
It didn't miss you.

496
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,161
Fine.

497
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,498
Know what?
Be like that.

498
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:26,752
'Cause we both know I'll be back out
by the end of the month...

499
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:32,591
I'll see you then.

500
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:44,561
Members only, pork chop.

501
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:46,813
It's okay, I'm meeting a friend.

502
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,691
Get lost or get hurt.

503
00:33:50,692 --> 00:33:54,362
He's a full-patch member
of the Dogs of Hell.

504
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:56,072
I swear, I just need to talk to him.

505
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:57,699
What's this big shot's name?

506
00:33:57,783 --> 00:33:59,117
Smitty.

507
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:02,287
Don't move.

508
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,343
Does it look like I'm packing?

509
00:34:17,427 --> 00:34:19,220
Gonna wish you were.

510
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,435
Come with me.

511
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:51,502
Look at this asshole.

512
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,640
Says he's here to see Smitty.

513
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:09,229
Old friend.

514
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:12,398
- Old friend?
- Yeah.

515
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:15,235
Third grade.
Sister Haney's class?

516
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:17,195
She really had it in for us.

517
00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:20,824
Is he around or should I just...
Ow! No, no, no, no!

518
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:22,743
Holy shit!

519
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,998
- What's your name?
- Foggy! Franklin Nelson!

520
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,291
Never heard of you.

521
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,503
I've known Smitty
for a long time.

522
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:35,839
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

523
00:35:35,922 --> 00:35:37,883
Obviously, we went on different
career paths along the way...

524
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:39,801
- Is this funny to you?
- No.

525
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:41,970
- No, sir.
- 'Cause I'm two seconds away

526
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,723
- from slitting your throat.
- I'm not a cop, okay?

527
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:48,434
You a fed?

528
00:35:48,518 --> 00:35:49,853
I'm a lawyer.

529
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:53,940
Look, I just...
I just need five minutes

530
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:57,110
with Smitty and then I swear, I'm gone.

531
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:58,319
Yeah, you're gone now.

532
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:02,032
Ever walk back in here again,
and you'll leave in pieces.

533
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:03,992
Nod if you understand me.

534
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,875
Take him out back,
show him how we feel about lawyers.

535
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,198
No, please, no, no, no, no, no.

536
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,347
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you down.

537
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,475
I'm gonna get you down.
I'm gonna get you down.

538
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,485
It was a mistake coming here,
I realize that.

539
00:39:25,568 --> 00:39:27,195
- Shut up!
- I just wanted to help people, I swear.

540
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:29,655
- Smitty would understand!
- Smitty's dead, asshole.

541
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:30,949
What?

542
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:35,370
You have to believe me,
I... I didn't know that.

543
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,746
Oh, I believe
there's a lot you don't know.

544
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,039
Whoa, okay, look.

545
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:40,959
Smitty was a long time ago.

546
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,211
Couple years ago,
I helped a guy named Foster.

547
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,963
- He was a biker!
- Not one of ours.

548
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,506
- Ricky Wex?
- Shut up!

549
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:48,049
I helped a guy named Pope!

550
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:52,929
Yeah, the VA said that his injuries
weren't sustained during battle,

551
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:54,639
but they were!

552
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:57,517
They just didn't manifest themselves
for 20 years.

553
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,520
Uh, we got his operation sorted and then,

554
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:02,772
a couple of months later,
he was back on his Harley,

555
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:05,942
doing whatever it is you guys do.
Which is none of my business!

556
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:08,904
You helped Pope?

557
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:14,325
Get the hell out of here.

558
00:40:16,202 --> 00:40:17,745
- Really?
- Now!

559
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:24,127
What happened to Smitty?

560
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:28,673
- You serious?
- I came here for a reason.

561
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,175
I just need answers!

562
00:40:30,258 --> 00:40:33,844
Look, if I don't get answers,
a lot of innocent blood could be shed.

563
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:37,348
People who both you and I care about
are gonna get hurt.

564
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:39,600
And you don't seem like
the most sentimental guy,

565
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:42,020
but you're still listening.

566
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:47,233
And that knife isn't in my neck,
so I have to believe that right now...

567
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:51,112
maybe you and I are on the same side.

568
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:56,159
You got guts, Harvard.
I'll give you that.

569
00:40:57,577 --> 00:41:01,414
Columbia, actually, but it's not courage.

570
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:03,208
It's more like sheer adrenaline.

571
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,544
Hey, look, I wouldn't be asking,

572
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:11,216
I wouldn't be here doing this
if it wasn't important.

573
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,811
Smitty was on a run,

574
00:41:23,894 --> 00:41:27,023
I-90 with four brothers,
transporting a big score.

575
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:31,319
They were hit by a goddamn army.
Their whole crew was cut to pieces.

576
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:32,988
Left there like roadkill.

577
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:35,198
- Any idea who did it?
- Nah.

578
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:38,409
New crew, doesn't matter.
Whoever they are, we're gonna find 'em.

579
00:41:38,493 --> 00:41:41,829
And when we do, you wanna be
very far away from the action.

580
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,833
You didn't hear none of this from me.
Now go.

581
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,836
And don't come back.

582
00:42:02,225 --> 00:42:04,978
I always knew
the devil would come for me.

583
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:08,231
But I thought I would be dead first.

584
00:42:08,314 --> 00:42:10,275
- I'm gonna get some help.
- No!

585
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:12,777
No... no...

586
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:21,119
Who did this?

587
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:23,579
No one escapes this.

588
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,625
No one can get away.

589
00:42:29,044 --> 00:42:30,461
Tell me.

590
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:40,138
Tell me who they are.

591
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:45,893
No "they."

592
00:42:45,976 --> 00:42:47,478
Him.

593
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:50,398
It's one man.

594
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:20,261
Hold it right there.

595
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:27,017
Oh, my God!

596
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:30,438
Oh, God.

597
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:32,022
What was that?

598
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:34,359
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

599
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:35,943
Shit.

600
00:43:36,026 --> 00:43:37,612
Someone's come to finish the job.

601
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:39,364
Shh! Don't move.

602
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:41,574
No, to hell with that.

603
00:43:47,997 --> 00:43:49,874
He's got a gun!

604
00:43:49,957 --> 00:43:52,460
Shit.

605
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,754
Come on, come on, come on!

606
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:56,547
Come on!

607
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,958
Dear God.

608
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:34,419
Shit.

609
00:44:34,502 --> 00:44:36,462
What? You...
You don't have the right keys?

610
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:38,798
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Is this even your car?

611
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:41,008
- Belonged to a friend.
- Where's he?

612
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:43,344
He's dead.

613
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:46,096
Get in!

614
00:46:42,547 --> 00:46:43,881
Bang.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
