1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,600
Why the hell is girl
not wearing any clothes?

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,280
I apologize for that.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,840
Glad to see you again, Miss Tokyo.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,880
This time we'll be pragmatic.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,520
I ask and you answer.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Who is the Professor?

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,320
Are you the one who hits cops?

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,480
MONDAY 7:30 PM

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,440
I'll read you the penal code.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,160
Section 550.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,360
Assault on a police officer.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,760
HOUR 81 OF THE HEIST

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,960
Punishable with one to four years
in prison.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,120
And we'll try hard
to give you all four years.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,440
Could I please speak to my lawyer?

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,600
Sure. Speak all you want.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,000
You'll need to.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,320
But I need my phone.
That's where I have his number.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,720
They confiscated it with
the rest of my belongings.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
Wait there. Don't move.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,160
I feel sorry for the girl.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Because between the asshole cops

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,200
and these guys, I prefer the kidnappers.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
They've really done a number.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,800
We'll see how it ends.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
I know how it ends.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,280
With all the kidnappers gunned down.

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,640
Okay, that's it for today's class.

29
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm starving.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,760
Rio.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,120
Remember I told you that we had
some things to set up?

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Yes.

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,600
Well, the time has come.

34
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,480
Damn.

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,600
Some bachelor's pad you've got here,
Professor.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,920
Is this where you bring the chicks?

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Let's get to work. We have a lot to do.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Shit, Professor. Who made this mess?

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Well...

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,040
a company.

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,880
Bullshit.

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
This looks very amateur.

43
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Okay, I did it myself
with tutorials from the internet.

44
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Some crappy tutorials, am I right?

45
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,120
That's why you're here, right?

46
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Well, that's it.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
The voice modifying software is installed.

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,160
To talk to the police you simply...

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,680
press MS.

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,240
To contact the museum,

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,560
zero. And that's it.

52
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,520
The program changes your voice
when you contact someone.

53
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
-Can I test it?
-Yes.

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
<i>You're speaking with the heist man.</i>

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
Can you select a male one?

56
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Okay, sorry.

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,680
<i>Son of a bitch. Bastard. Faggot.</i>

58
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay, shit, fine.

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,880
That's it.

60
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
Try it now.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
<i>You're speaking with</i>
<i>the leader of the heist.</i>

62
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
Good, that will do.

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,160
Now we have to go on the black market web.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,360
-To buy some illegal goods.
-On the deep web.

65
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,960
The deep internet.

66
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,920
What it is that we're doing now?

67
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,680
I disabled the firewalls and the Wi-Fi
and we're entering via Ethernet.

68
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,680
I'm also diverting all data traffic
with a VPN via the TOR browser.

69
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,520
Okay, well...

70
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
continue.

71
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Done.

72
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,520
They've got it all.
Rifles, grenades, rocket launchers.

73
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,920
It's like an outlet store
for USSR weapons.

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,720
Look, a tank.
We could enter with a tank.

75
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,640
Like the A-team. With C-4...

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,120
-Do you know what a Browning is?
-Yes, of course.

77
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,720
We're going to buy a Browning machine gun.

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,480
Assault rifles, handguns and ammo.

79
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,720
Oh man, a V750 SAM missile!
That's a beast!

80
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,720
Imagine entering the factory with that.

81
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,280
You open the doors and boom!

82
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,800
A V750 SAM missile pointed
straight at the cops.

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
Boom! You blow them to bits.

84
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,000
How cool would that be?

85
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,960
Besides, it's cheap.
60 Bitcoins.

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,480
That's like 150,000 euros, give or take.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,920
Cheap.

88
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,480
Why did you take Rio off the plan?

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,640
Tell me.

90
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,280
I don't owe you any explanations, but...

91
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,640
I don't think he is ready.

92
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,120
You're wrong.

93
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Are you sure?
You've been months working with him.

94
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,000
You know him and you know
how deeply immature he is.

95
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
He doesn't realize what we'll do.

96
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,400
Out there the bullets are real,
no extra lives

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,840
-like in video games.
-Rio knows what he's doing.

98
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
It's my responsibility

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,080
and I will not involve a child.

100
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,480
I'll pay him for his time, but he's out.

101
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,080
He's the best at what he does,
you know it!

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
That's why you chose him.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
He's a fucking wiz!

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
So what if he's a weird genius!

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
Are you an example of maturity?

106
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,280
Are you?

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Are you normal?

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,880
Is it normal
to arrange your shirts by color?

109
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,720
Look at you, who buys your clothes?

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Your great-aunt Gertrude?

111
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,200
And this?

112
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,080
-What's this?
-Origami.

113
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,680
It's an ancient art, don't...

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
What's the matter?

115
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you afraid I'll break
your paper dolls?

116
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,240
Welcome to Jurassic park!
Help, the dinosaur is eating me!

117
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
What's the difference

118
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
between this and playing video games?

119
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,600
It's not your decision to make.

120
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,840
Yes, it is.

121
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,720
If Rio is out, I'm out.

122
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Because I'm not mature enough either.

123
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
Well...

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,520
Maybe we are all
immature to some extent...

125
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,720
-and that makes us all a little...
-Special.

126
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,360
Different.

127
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Maybe that isn't an obstacle.

128
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,520
Maybe it's a virtue.

129
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,800
Maybe.

130
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm sure it is.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
But don't tell me.

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Tell him. He's behind the door.

133
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
Thanks, Professor.
I promise you won't regret it.

134
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,200
Thank you.

135
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,720
RECENT CALLS

136
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,640
-Hello?
-I need to speak with Inspector

137
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,200
Raquel Murillo. It's urgent.

138
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,360
Who's calling?

139
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,520
<i>It's a private matter.</i>

140
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,160
Inspector Murillo. Emergency call.

141
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,320
Take it.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,920
I won't move.

143
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,400
Private matter.

144
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,560
-Who is it?
-Raquel. Thank God. It's...

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,840
It's Salva,

146
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,560
<i>I'm calling from the police station.</i>
<i>I'm arrested.</i>

147
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,440
<i>I'm accused of assaulting</i>

148
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,800
an on-duty agent.
Your ex-husband, specifically.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,880
What?

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,360
<i>I'm handcuffed</i>
<i>and they're talking about</i>

151
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,160
a four-year sentence.

152
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
Wait...
What police station are you at?

153
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,880
I'm in Canillas.

154
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,520
Don't worry.
I'll be there as soon as I can, okay?

155
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,520
Thank you.

156
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
Let's continue.

157
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,640
You were about to tell me
about the Professor.

158
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
You'd look prettier with short hair.

159
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,600
Your cut makes you look like a mom.

160
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,600
I feel like chopping it all right off.

161
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Perfect.

162
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,120
Because I'm here,
just waiting for you to do it.

163
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,120
Look on the bright side.

164
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,640
You don't have to live on the run anymore.

165
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,240
Now, you get a fresh start.

166
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,320
You want to know how it all started?

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,320
The Professor picked me up...

168
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
in a red SEAT Ibiza.

169
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,840
While the police were
setting me an ambush.

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No.

171
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,360
No, it was before.

172
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,840
A boy.

173
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,280
His name was Miguel.

174
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,280
He pulled my panties down
in front of the class.

175
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,040
Can you believe they kicked me out
instead of that six-year-old prick?

176
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
That's when it all started going wrong.

177
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,520
Is it true, what they said?

178
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,200
That you beat up a cop?

179
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,920
You have to say it was a fight.

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
If it was just you who hit him...

181
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
consider yourself fucked.

182
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,480
Because you look fine, honestly.

183
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
Excuse me, can I use the bathroom?

184
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,840
Watch him.

185
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
I didn't sign up to be anyone's nurse.

186
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,840
Nor to put up with speeches
or fucking therapy sessions.

187
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,520
I didn't say anything earlier

188
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,040
to avoid fucking up the group even more.

189
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,960
How nice of you,

190
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,400
to worry about the group.

191
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,480
You know what I'm worried about?
The Professor, Berlin.

192
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,800
He's not around.

193
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,480
Just you.

194
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,520
And he's the head of all this.

195
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,680
And that's why
he mapped out a perfect plan.

196
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
The plan we'll follow.

197
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
Step by step, without straying from it!

198
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,040
You already have strayed from it!

199
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,360
You turned Tokyo in.

200
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,840
Tokyo will get her share if she behaves
and stays quiet.

201
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
Bullshit!

202
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,240
If she was arrested,

203
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,960
not rolled down the stairs
to the lions, like a dog!

204
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,320
And because she's pissed off,
she's probably talking.

205
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
And the GEO are probably in the hangar,

206
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
digging another tunnel to get in here.

207
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,080
I'll add it to the suggestions box.

208
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,200
But, unfortunately, as you saw with Rio,

209
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,520
it will be useless.
Because this is a patriarchy!

210
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,720
-What does that mean?
-That I'm in charge!

211
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,840
And if you don't want to end up
like Rio and Tokyo,

212
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,880
I suggest you take a chill pill.

213
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
What's the matter, Nairobi?

214
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,960
Did you and Tokyo sync your periods?

215
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,640
You and I are alike.

216
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,160
I don't think my life
is as exciting as yours.

217
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
No, I don't either.

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,600
It must be difficult being a woman
in the police force.

219
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,320
It is also difficult among heist men.

220
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
We're very few.

221
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,960
That's why we have to fight
and speak up all the time.

222
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,720
Right?

223
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
Isn't it exhausting?

224
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,400
Silene.

225
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,520
You're trying to waste my time.

226
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,520
And you're ruining your chances
of a reduced sentence.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,400
Every minute you waste costs you a year.

228
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,880
Look, now you're young and pretty.

229
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
You have a good body.

230
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,200
In 12 years you'll still look good.

231
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
With some interesting little wrinkles.

232
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,680
But if you get out of jail in 24 years...

233
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,440
You will have gone into menopause.

234
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,680
And that...

235
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,480
must be pretty shitty.
Right, Prieto?

236
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,280
I know from his mother.

237
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,680
And I'm not talking about the hot flashes.

238
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm talking about feeling

239
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,960
like you lost something important.

240
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,720
Something deeply yours,

241
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,200
vanished forever.

242
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,720
Your life.

243
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,400
Inspector.

244
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,200
Do you really picture me in a garden
raising a family?

245
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,320
Changing diapers?

246
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,760
Please!

247
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,520
Look.

248
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,040
I'm giving you one last chance
before I call the pre-trial judge.

249
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,960
If you don't talk, it's goodbye.

250
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,000
You go to pre-trial detention.

251
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,000
Losing all extenuating circumstances.

252
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,640
In other words,
ten to twelve years of your life.

253
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,640
So think about it before you
throw it all away.

254
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,120
Do you want some advice?

255
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,800
Sure.

256
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
Think of a nice place.

257
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,800
Of a time in your life
when you were really happy.

258
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,880
Take a deep breath.

259
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Reflect.

260
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
<i>Tokyo!</i>

261
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
I can't.

262
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,520
Of course you can't.
You're all drugged up.

263
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
It's a hypnotic sedative.

264
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,200
Relax and enjoy.

265
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Water.

266
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,960
Please.

267
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,520
Go back to sleep.

268
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,240
How am I supposed to sleep?

269
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I can't stop dreaming about Tokyo.

270
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,560
Tokyo is a fucking bitch.

271
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,400
What?

272
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,520
Do you know what she did
with my only hope?

273
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,120
When did you last see him?

274
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,480
How old was he? Three?

275
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,240
She chewed it up, and spat it in my face.

276
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,240
-He won't remember you.
-Shut the fuck up.

277
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,560
-He won't remember, or recognize you.
-Shut up.

278
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,320
You know what's the worst part?

279
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,400
That she's right.

280
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
She's right.

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,760
I was going to kidnap a child

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
who doesn't even know who I am.

283
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,360
I was going to kidnap a child

284
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,520
who doesn't know who I am.

285
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,720
Now I don't even know
what to do with the money.

286
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,200
I mean,

287
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,720
maybe not now.

288
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,320
But in a few years, you go find him and...

289
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,040
and you explain it to him.

290
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,520
You say, "Shit. Look, I'm your mother.

291
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,680
I live in Jamaica and I'm loaded.

292
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,560
and if you want to hear the rest
I'll buy you a plane to come see me".

293
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,800
Besides, you're young.

294
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,200
You have ovaries don't you?

295
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,320
You can have another one.

296
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,480
You're right.

297
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,920
Five minutes, not one more.

298
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,080
It sounds so easy.

299
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,200
Hey.

300
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,960
Would you give me a child?
Would you do that for me?

301
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Of course.

302
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,960
How do you want it, blond or brunette?

303
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm not joking.

304
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,000
If I get out of here,
I'm going to need a reason to live.

305
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,400
Look, Nairobi, what can I say?

306
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,960
Having a baby to have a reason to live

307
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,200
doesn't sound like a good plan.

308
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,360
No?

309
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,320
Besides, I'm with Tokyo, you know...

310
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,520
Hey, I'm not asking you to marry me.

311
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,160
I'm just asking for a little sperm.

312
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,240
Two thrusts and that's it, pregnant.

313
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,280
You're so handsome. And you're smart.

314
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,240
And that cute little smile.

315
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,040
This is how easy it is. Don't move!

316
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,720
It's that easy!

317
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Trading one child for another,
what's the difference?

318
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,520
In the end

319
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,560
all that matters is having
a reason to live!

320
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,600
Fuck!

321
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,400
And you say Tokyo is crazy.

322
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,360
You're worse.

323
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,000
-Where are you going?
-To hell!

324
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,960
No. Don't move!

325
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,960
No.

326
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,400
We have to fuck over Berlin
without turning ourselves in.

327
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,120
Salva.

328
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm really sorry, honestly.

329
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,040
I screwed up, I'm sorry.

330
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
-What did that animal do?
-No.

331
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,960
It wasn't entirely his fault, I...

332
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,600
I talked about what he did to you.

333
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,960
The abuse,
the thing with your sister and...

334
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,920
-Shit.
-I'm really sorry. It's not like me,

335
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,880
I don't know what came over me.

336
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,560
I got so angry.

337
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,360
I swear, I'm not violent.
I have never hit anyone.

338
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
Ever.

339
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,480
I prefer to calmly talk things through...

340
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,640
Self defense?

341
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,560
Well, I'm no Mohammad Ali, but...

342
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,560
I have my pride.

343
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,880
And I gave him his share.

344
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,840
But my body feels like a punching bag.

345
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
-I think he won.
-Let me see.

346
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,320
Wait.

347
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,160
Jesus!

348
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,200
I'm calling a doctor right now.
Don't worry.

349
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,720
-I'll take care of it.
-Thank you.

350
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,880
I tell you I have a boyfriend and you
find the time to beat him up?

351
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,960
He hit me! I didn't even touch him!

352
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,880
Withdraw the complaint now.

353
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,640
Remove the one you filed against me.

354
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,320
This will help you a lot
in the trial we have pending.

355
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,640
I mean the fact that you
also beat him up.

356
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,480
He left me unconscious!
He's Chuck Norris with glasses!

357
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,480
Save the nonsense for your lawyer!

358
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,320
-This won't help you with custody!
-Raquel...

359
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,600
I didn't do anything.

360
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,400
-I didn't touch him.
-Really?

361
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,680
Come with me.

362
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,480
I'm Inspector Raquel Murillo
from headquarters.

363
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,640
I want to know who took
this man's statement.

364
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
And why you haven't called a doctor,

365
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,800
since he's been beaten by this agent.

366
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,360
Salva.

367
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Open your shirt.

368
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,360
He would like to file a complaint
for abuse of authority.

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,960
File a report of the injuries.

370
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,720
You're all witnesses in court.

371
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,600
I don't know how he got those bruises,

372
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,120
I swear I didn't touch him.

373
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,920
The victim has bruises
on his chest, ribs and abdomen.

374
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,680
Clear signs of a beating.

375
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,160
Is someone writing down
the statement?

376
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,240
Raquel!

377
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Okay.

378
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,880
Drop it. I'll withdraw the complaint.

379
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,200
Very well. Then he'll withdraw his.

380
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Remove his handcuffs!

381
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,800
Where are his belongings?

382
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,040
I am not one of these
conspiracy theorists,

383
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,160
but having my prints and
personal information out there is...

384
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,880
Yeah.

385
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,320
Where's the report you filed
on his arrest?

386
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Let's go, Salva.

387
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
<i>I had never felt so lost.</i>

388
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,320
<i>I had nothing left.</i>

389
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,880
<i>I had to decide</i>
<i>whether to rat out my team...</i>

390
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,520
<i>and try for a plea bargain with the judge.</i>

391
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,720
Want to say something?

392
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,240
Could someone please make me
some fried eggs?

393
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
Fuck.
I've been eating garbage for four days.

394
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,560
<i>Tokyo, I won't fail you.</i>

395
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,200
<i>I have it all figured out.</i>

396
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,080
<i>Besides, I'm a lucky man.</i>

397
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,360
<i>Always remember that.</i>

398
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,920
<i>Tokyo, I won't fail you.</i>

399
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,560
I can't do this anymore.

400
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,320
I've done 30 boxes like this one.

401
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,800
They don't care
that I have a gunshot wound.

402
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,800
Not to mention the scars
we'll have after this,

403
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
especially the psychological ones.

404
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,560
Having to come to work every day

405
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,200
and reliving it all.

406
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,480
It's going to be hard on all of us.

407
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,600
Some of us might even suffer
from post-traumatic stress.

408
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,480
I'll be the lucky winner.

409
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,880
I don't know what could be worse

410
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,320
than losing everything.

411
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,840
I've lost everything.
And money won't make up for it.

412
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,560
Not by far.

413
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,720
Regarding the one million euros...

414
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,000
How funny.

415
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,280
Trusting them
while they locked us up like livestock.

416
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,600
Will you shut up?

417
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,800
-Excuse me?
-Shut the fuck up.

418
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
Alison, please.

419
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,440
I'm tired

420
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
of listening to him whining.

421
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,840
If it's so bad, do something.

422
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
I also used to complain.

423
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
About my parents,

424
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,240
or the school where I was bullied.

425
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,720
I kept putting up with it.

426
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,120
-Enough is enough.
-Well, honey,

427
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,240
it's normal to feel hopeless.

428
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,480
Quite the opposite.

429
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,640
It may have fucked up your lives.

430
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,360
But it has opened my eyes.

431
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,920
I realized that we are what we eat.

432
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
And I'm not eating anymore crap.

433
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,040
So I'm leaving.

434
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,840
Alison, don't be foolish.

435
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm your guardian and
I'm responsible for your safety.

436
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,280
-So, while I'm here...
-You're here for the money.

437
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,240
You might be okay
picking crumbs off the table

438
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,520
and being accomplices to these scumbags,
but I'm not.

439
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,080
Besides,
it's not that hard to get out of here.

440
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,760
Get out of here?

441
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,080
How?

442
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,040
I'll hurt myself.

443
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,560
They'll take me somewhere else.

444
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,680
And I'll escape.

445
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,320
No, no and no.
Don't you dare do that nonsense.

446
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,040
Mercedes...

447
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,600
Let her explain.

448
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,600
I've seen it more than ten times
since we've been here.

449
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,040
They press the button and the door
takes only four seconds to open.

450
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,120
Four seconds and you run.

451
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,960
That's all it takes.

452
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,320
That's more than enough time
for them to gun you down.

453
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,800
We'll see about that.

454
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,200
What's up, hostages?

455
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,120
Do you sleep well thinking
about your million?

456
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
Well, keep dreaming.

457
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,160
Nobody's going to give it to you!

458
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,040
It's a lie!

459
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Just like no one has released
your colleagues,

460
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,160
the ones who chose to leave
instead of the million! No!

461
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,560
They're locked up two stories below you!

462
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,880
That stupid idiot.

463
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,640
Chained to a pipe!

464
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,080
It was a ploy!

465
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,920
To keep you calm, like sheep!
Working for us but

466
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,520
wearing a smile. Because here
you always have to wear a smile!

467
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,520
Am I right, Mr. Andres de Fonollosa?

468
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,800
We don't want any long faces, do we?

469
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,680
Are you done?

470
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,280
We're not going 
through the hole you're digging, no!

471
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,680
We're going through one
that leads into the vault!

472
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,440
That's high treason.

473
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,120
Unforgivable.

474
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,280
Let's go.

475
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,520
Any news?

476
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
She hasn't said a thing.

477
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,520
Miss Tokyo has no interest in cooperating.

478
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,360
Coronel.

479
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,320
Let me ask you.

480
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,040
Did agent Rubio mention anything
about a teaspoon?

481
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,400
A teaspoon?

482
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,680
No. Why?

483
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,440
Angel sent it to the lab
before the accident.

484
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,000
The fingerprints match those of the guy

485
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,760
who broke into the patrol vehicle
to threaten the Russian.

486
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,600
It's the person helping them
from the outside.

487
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,760
-And who the hell is it?
-I don't know.

488
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,960
Seems to be the same one
who tampered with Angel's car

489
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,680
to cause the accident.
But only Angel knows that.

490
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,240
And her.

491
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,160
Tell me one thing.

492
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,960
Are you keeping quiet for all of them

493
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,520
or only for Anibal Cortes?

494
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,760
You seem

495
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,960
very much in love in these pictures.

496
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
How about I offer you
a two-for-one special?

497
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Like a happy hour.

498
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,760
I'll offer him
the same deal I offered you.

499
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,880
Mitigation, remorse and cooperation.

500
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,680
As long as the information
you give helps us to put an end

501
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,920
to this nightmare.

502
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,080
We're talking about a third
of the sentence.

503
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
That's impossible.

504
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,960
We have enough crimes
to do several lifetimes in prison.

505
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,640
No judge can promise that.

506
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Let alone you.

507
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,480
I don't know what you've heard.
But if you show remorse,

508
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,920
cooperate and help save 50 lives...

509
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
I assure you that any judge
will be benevolent.

510
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,160
Anibal Cortes has no record
of violent crimes.

511
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,960
-He would be out in five years.
-24 years old.

512
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,880
Like he's just graduated.

513
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,800
I think it's a better plan than ending up
like your last boyfriend.

514
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,520
Don't you think?

515
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,760
It was a bad idea
to talk to the hostages, Rio.

516
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,600
You better turn me in like Tokyo,

517
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,360
tied up nice and good.
Because I'm not staying quiet.

518
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,480
I trust Tokyo.

519
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,680
But you're a snotty little child.

520
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,840
It's a shame.

521
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,600
What a paradox, Helsinki.

522
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,680
Tokyo

523
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,480
will stay quiet to protect him.

524
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,160
And yet you're going to disappear
without her knowing.

525
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,520
What are you going to do?

526
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,320
What you've been screaming for.

527
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,600
I'll execute you.

528
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,880
You have, indeed, lost your mind.

529
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,840
I can't let you leave,

530
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,560
nor can I let you stay.

531
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,160
What you told the hostages
has sentenced you,

532
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,840
so I won't flinch.

533
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,840
Okay, maybe a little.

534
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,880
That's it.

535
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,560
It's important to face death with humor.

536
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,000
<i>It's not that those of us who do</i>
<i>reckless things</i>

537
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
<i>don't care about the consequences.</i>

538
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,560
<i>No.</i>

539
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
<i>We care as much as anyone else.</i>

540
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,720
<i>Butwe can't see them</i>
<i>until it's too late.</i>

541
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,160
<i>We only see them when they're</i>
<i>right in front of us.</i>

542
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,120
Last words?

543
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,960
You can still learn from your mistakes

544
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,360
and stop being an ass.

545
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,360
Look at this, Helsinki!

546
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,920
This boy has just wizened up!

547
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,520
If you had lived longer you
could have been Paulo Coelho's successor.

548
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Too bad.

549
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
The world is going to miss out.

550
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,440
Berlin!

551
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,920
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Put the gun down!

552
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
The time for allegations is over!

553
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,680
Democracy has only brought trouble.

554
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,280
And I've just sentenced him.

555
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,600
Enough crap, we're all on edge!

556
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,560
Berlin, let's not screw it up more.

557
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,800
Berlin, we can't screw each other over.

558
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
Go down there.

559
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,480
Berlin.

560
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,600
You had better lower the gun,

561
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,800
because if you don't you'll be in pain.

562
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,000
I found your painkillers.

563
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,960
What will you do, Nairobi?

564
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,000
Break them one by one, like Tokyo did?

565
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,640
Well, since I'm on my period,
maybe I will.

566
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,240
Us women are so nosy, right?

567
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,960
And we have such a bad temper
when rubbed the wrong way.

568
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Son of a bitch!

569
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,240
Berlin, you have a missed call, dear.

570
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,840
It's okay, man, it's okay.

571
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,680
All right. You've chosen.

572
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,880
Poorly, but you've chosen.

573
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,080
Take her away.

574
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,760
<i>And with that clarity I saw myself,</i>

575
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,960
<i>at the trial,</i>

576
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,160
<i>in prison,</i>

577
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,360
<i>and I knew the inspector was right.</i>

578
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,360
<i>It wasn't worth sacrificing myself</i>
<i>for a plan that had already failed.</i>

579
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,360
<i>The Professor's plan.</i>

580
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,120
<i>And even more so since I thought</i>
<i>he had deceived me.</i>

581
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,080
Sergio!

582
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,040
His name is Sergio.

583
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,160
Wait!

584
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,320
Let her talk.

585
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,520
The Professor is Sergio Marquina.

586
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,480
And the heist was his father's idea.

587
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,960
And who is the person on the outside?

588
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,840
Inspector.

589
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,520
They're calling from inside the factory.

590
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,640
Inspector, how are you?
How's your day going?

591
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,160
<i>I think it's going well.</i>

592
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,360
I was a little worried about you.

593
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
<i>I thought we weren't going to speak again</i>

594
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,120
<i>That something terrible</i>
<i>had happened to you.</i>

595
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
<i>Sergio.</i>

596
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,680
<i>I thank you for the concern, inspector.</i>

597
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>But...</i>

598
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,680
I'm a lucky man. Never forget that.

599
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,400
<i>I just called to say hello.</i>

600
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,240
<i>Continue interrogating Tokyo</i>
<i>She has a lot to tell you.</i>

601
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,800
When you finish

602
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,560
give me a call.

603
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,720
I'll be right here.

604
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,960
What do you have to tell me?

605
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,600
They kicked me out to give you
a message.

606
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,440
We have a hydrogen bomb in there.

607
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,720
Seventeen megatons

608
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,680
We're setting it off tomorrow,
at 12:00 PM.

609
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,640
I'd like to speak to a priest.

610
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,240
I need to confess.

611
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,280
Very well.

612
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,160
We'll request
unconditional isolated detention.

613
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,160
Gomez.

614
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,520
Write the report

615
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,520
and emphasize on her lack
of cooperation and remorse.

616
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,480
Send her to the nearest prison.
Lobo, take her.

617
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,720
Check-up call.

618
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,440
-Everything is running smoothly over here.
-S<i>moothly?</i>

619
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,400
Smoothly as in Tokyo being interrogated?

620
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,200
As in you're about to execute Rio?

621
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,160
<i>Berlin, what are you doing?</i>

622
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,320
Professor, it's Nairobi.

623
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,120
<i>Berlin is indisposed.</i>
<i>So from now on, I'm in charge.</i>

624
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,760
Let the matriarchy begin.

625
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,320
