explain to her

162
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,812
that I left our mother alone and
bleeding on the pavement

163
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:49,666
because I'm fast enough to
almost run down the attacker.

is protect my family.

who this guy is,

that Oliver came home.

It was Dr. Lamb

that the Oliver we'd lost

that you weren't going to be

[Car door closes]

320
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:35,965
Thank you for coming.

321
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,850
Anything for a friend.

322
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:42,254
[Speaking Chinese]

323
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:47,226
We're not responsible
for the attacks on your people.

324
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:48,878
These attacks
on my business

325
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,481
are my family's
life blood.

326
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,283
They stop now,

327
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,785
or I'm coming for you.

328
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,079
What does the Triad
have to gain by provoking you now?

329
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:11,784
Well, no one ever credited
the Triad with rational thinking?

330
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,788
If not them, then who?

331
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,123
Whoever it is, when I
find out who's behind this,

332
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,560
there will be blood.

333
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,061
Sounds like Bertinelli's
ready to put the screws

334
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,096
to everyone who pays him
protection money.

335
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,716
Yeah, well, 3 of his best
earners have been murdered.

336
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,935
He's gotta make up the cash
somewhere.

337
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:31,521
Whoever is pruning
the family tree

338
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,523
is using bullets
instead of arrows.

339
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,358
So you do think
it's one of the other families.

340
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,325
No.

341
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:37,610
Then who?

342
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,278
Well, according to
the coroner's reports,

343
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,730
none of the vics
took a clean shot.

344
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:41,914
Half the bullets missed.

345
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,583
Our killer's not a pro.

346
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,701
That's not stopping him
from pulling that trigger.

347
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:48,037
That's up to us.

348
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:52,108
Or this is gonna blow up
into an all-out mob war.

349
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,224
You are an angel,
Helena.

350
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,226
So beautiful.

351
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:10,629
Well, we are gonna take good
care of both of you tonight.

352
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:13,932
You'll tell your father
hello from us?

353
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,350
Of course, Mr. Russo.

354
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:16,819
I'll give you a minute.

355
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,187
Thank you.

356
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,292
I heard about
your mother's accident.

357
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:24,809
Is he gonna be okay?

358
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,361
She's gonna be fine.

359
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:27,696
Thanks.

360
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,249
I'm glad.

361
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:37,122
So, why would you want to go
into business with my father?

362
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,875
You know who he is
and how he made his money.

363
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,494
You don't approve of your
family's enterprises?

364
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,815
We share a name,
and that name defines us

365
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,716
whether we want it to or not.

366
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,051
You've already made judgments
about me,

367
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,520
just like I've already
made judgments about you.

368
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:54,489
Right. I'm the rich man's
Lindsay Lohan.

369

[Sighs] Sorry.

00:17:57,278 --> 00:18:00,078
That's okay.

371
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,349
Hey, can I ask you something?

372
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,184
Yeah.

373
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,004
I know it must have been
hell for you,

374
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,691
alone on that island
for 5 years, but I'm...

375
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,544
But what?

376
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:20,332
But was there ever a day
when you were just...

377
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,551
Happy to be away
from everything?

378

No pressure from your family,

379
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:27,556
no need to be the person
everyone else expects you to be.

when I didn't feel lost
and I felt...free?

382
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,784
More than one.

383
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,687
And, uh...

384
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:44,740
Those are the days
that I miss.

385

for you, Merlyn?

No. No, not really.
I'm just, um,

389
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,294
I'm just crying because

390
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,206
I was thinking of
a Hallmark commercial

391
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,258
I saw earlier today,
featuring a sick kitty.

392
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,593
It was very emotional.

[Both laugh]

394
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,246

No. Thank you.

take you to dinner.

Well, thank you for
letting me choose Indian.

399
00:19:18,392 --> 00:19:22,927
You know, I read this article
by a film critic once,

400
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,598
who said if he could have
one wish,

401
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,986
it would be to watch his favorite
movie again for the first time.

402
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:34,489
I kind of wish
that was us.

403
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,125
So you want dinner
and a movie.

404

No.

405
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:42,297
I wish we had just met

406
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,800
and that all this
was just beginning

407
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:49,137
and there wasn't so much
of me I wish you'd forget.

408
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:51,456
Well, keep saying
nice things like that

409
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,710
and maybe next time
I'll let you choose the restaurant.

I'm sorry, I'm afraid
you credit card has been declined.

413
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,318
Did you swipe it
a few times?

414
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,153
You know, sometimes
those things can be a little glitchy.

415
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:08,573
I did, and, um,
I'm afraid the credit card company

416
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,542
wants me to confiscate it.

417
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,845

Mm.
Right.

But those are the answers
that I give people

426
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,364
because those are the answers
they're expecting.

427

Why can't you
just be truthful?

I don't know how truthful
I can be.
