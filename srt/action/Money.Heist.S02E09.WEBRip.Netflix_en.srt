1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Stop the machines and erase the logs.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,120
Remove the hard drives, we're taking them.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,280
There's little left
to reach one billion.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,280
We just need to print and cut some sheets.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,120
How much time do we need, Mr. Torres?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,480
Eleven minutes.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,440
You're rounding off the numbers, Nairobi.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,840
What do you think this is?

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,320
A TV game show?

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,600
Go pack your bags,
I'll take care of the money.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,280
I say I'm leaving with a billion,

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,080
-so I'm leaving with a billion!
-I say "stop", so you stop!

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,760
Do you know why I'm in charge?

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,960
Because you've got shit for brains.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
You want to stay in this mousetrap
to reach the billion?

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,440
You know
who that reminds me of?

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,920
Of a mother

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,000
who leaves her child,

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,440
a baby, to go sell pills.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,320
Of course, she gets caught
and loses the child.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,240
Under my command
those things don't happen, Nairobi!

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
No, of course not.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Under your command
we plan weddings with hostages.

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Will you get married
on the beach dressed in white?

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,360
Since you know everything,

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,520
do you know what she feels for you?

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,600
You make her sick!

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,240
I heard her in the bathroom.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
The only consolation she has left

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,520
is that she'll keep your money.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,640
To put up with you until you drop.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,760
And when you're dying,

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,080
say to your face

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,120
how every time you raped her,

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,680
because you're raping her,

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
she would go to the bathroom to throw up.

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
That's all she has left.

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,120
To spit on you upon your deathbed.

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,840
That's what you have turned her into.

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,400
Torres,

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,920
shut down the machines.

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,560
Miss Nairobi?

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,400
Shut down the machines, Torres.

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,440
Alright.

45
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,760
Colonel,

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
We have the phone call made to Raquel.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
It was made from Angel's phone.

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,680
-What?
-Deputy Inspector Rubio.

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,840
Call the hospital and find out
if he woke up.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,400
If so, send three men quick.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,360
That bitch could show up there any minute.

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,760
Done.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,840
Timers and cells set.

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
This will keep the police
busy for a while.

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,960
They'll have to deactivate them
one by one.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
What's your plan tomorrow?

57
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,440
Tomorrow?

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,280
Tomorrow I'm going to be sailing
on a cargo ship.

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,480
Sunbathing with my titties out.

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
With your titties out?

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
To avoid tan lines.

62
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,960
So you'll be there with your titties out

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
with all those lonely sailors

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
who haven't seen a woman in three months?

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
You think I can't defend myself?

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,760
Or do you want
to defend me from the peeping Toms?

67
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
It's not that.

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,920
That journey will be our last one.

69
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,000
And I don't know what
you're going to do at the end.

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I don't know if you'll take off
on a jet ski with guns blazing

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
or what you're going to do.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,520
So I want you to stay put.

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,160
With me.

74
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,840
In my cabin.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Hey.

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,680
We just hit a brick wall.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
Hold this.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
Make an opening in that wall.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
It leads to the sewer.

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,840
That's where we'll exit through.

81
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,920
Move.

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Here.

83
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,960
Did you see all those bombs?

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,840
Fuck.

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
Twenty years of my life.

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,080
Twenty years.

87
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Jesus,

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
give me the sledgehammer.

89
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,720
<i>We're 200 meters from the outlet.</i>
<i>Estimated time, six minutes.</i>

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>Let's go.</i>

91
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,560
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>We'll report any seismic movement.</i>

92
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,960
Berlin,

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,880
stop the chain right now.

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,800
Nairobi, we're leaving.

95
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,120
-There's still money left to pack.
-We've got excess baggage. People,

96
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
it's been a pleasure robbing you,

97
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,720
but it is time to enjoy
a well-deserved vacation.

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>Doctor Sanchez requested in room seven.</i>

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,240
Raquel.

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,440
-How are you doing?
-Well, here I am.

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm glad you pulled through.

102
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,960
I think I owe you an apology.

103
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
You don't need to apologize.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,200
Although you did call me a schmuck
and a clown.

105
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,480
It's the most humiliating thing
I've been called in my damn life.

106
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,040
I haven't been able
to rest peacefully in the coma.

107
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I'm really sorry.

108
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,960
Why did they discharge you from the case?

109
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,480
Because they think I'm with the heist men.

110
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,360
And are you?

111
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,440
No.

112
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,840
But you had a relationship
with that guy.

113
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,200
Yes.

114
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,080
And are you in love with him?

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll give you the hangar's location.

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,160
It's where he controls the operation from.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In case you want to clear your reputation,

118
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,680
solve the case and beat them.

119
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
I know where the hangar is.

120
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,400
But I won't tell them.

121
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,720
Why not?

122
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,760
Because I don't know who are the good guys

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,400
or the bad guys are anymore.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
-Don't move!
-Hands up!

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,400
Put your hands up.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
Lopez.

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,040
Arenas.

128
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,680
Gomez.

129
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,920
Fuck.

130
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,680
There will be laws on our island,
you know?

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,120
We'll have to be nudist.

132
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Except me, I can wear a loincloth.

133
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,720
Go set explosives in the warehouse,
will you?

134
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,040
Tokyo!

135
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
Move!

136
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,840
Move!

137
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,680
My gun!

138
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,280
Take this one, dammit!

139
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
What the fuck do we do?

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
Fucking riot shields!

141
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
We must hoot at their feet!

142
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
Cover me!

143
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,760
Sons of bitches!

144
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
Lobo, damage report!

145
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,040
They've hit several agents, sir!

146
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,400
I'll cover you!

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Evacuate the wounded!

148
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
Evacuate the wounded and go on!

149
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,160
If we get out
I'll put down my weapon.

150
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,080
I swear.

151
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,240
You mean it?

152
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
Not even an air rifle at the fair.

153
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,680
Come on, get them!

154
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
Besides,

155
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,960
we have to get things for our island,
right?

156
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Curtains,

157
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,160
couches...

158
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,120
Our island?

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Sons of bitches!

160
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,520
Go, go, go, give them hell!

161
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,320
-Fuck!
-Lobo, now!

162
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,760
They're coming! Let's go!

163
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,280
-Fuck!
-Let's go!

164
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,360
Let's go!

165
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,560
Go!

166
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,560
Go, go, go.

167
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,440
Fuck!

168
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
-Move!
-Let's go.

169
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,800
-Hold your ground.
-We have to reach that door!

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,720
Hold your fire! Don't shoot!

171
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,880
-Anibal.
-What?

172
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,200
Stay covered.

173
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,240
Give me your badge.

174
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
The engagement badge?

175
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
Now!

176
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Hold your ground!

177
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,000
Hold your ground!

178
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,760
-I love you!
-I love you!

179
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,760
Here I go!

180
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,920
Now!

181
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Tokyo!

182
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,280
Tokyo!

183
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,280
Tokyo!

184
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,400
-Tokyo.
-You're under arrest!

185
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't move!

186
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,800
-Rio!
-Don't move!

187
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,840
-Rio.
-No, don't shoot!

188
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,080
Move away from her!

189
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
-Hands up!
-Rio, get down!

190
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,200
Shit!

191
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,160
Shit!

192
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
Run, run!

193
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,080
Lobo, Ruiz! Are you holding up?

194
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
Ruiz, fuck!

195
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Evacuate Ruiz!

196
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,680
Rio!

197
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,240
-Denver!
-What?

198
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,440
Go get the Browning.
Meet us in the vault!

199
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,360
Okay.

200
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,240
-Go!
-Let's move!

201
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,640
We're under attack!

202
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,400
Get in formation and move!
Let's get them!

203
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
Yes, sir.

204
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
I'll put him on.

205
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
The CNI has taken over.

206
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
It's Colonel Prieto.

207
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,120
Angel, how are you?

208
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,880
Well, I've seen better days, to be honest.

209
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,800
<i>Hey, I'm curious,</i>

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,840
why did you call Inspector Murillo first?

211
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,160
Because we're friends.

212
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,960
Don't screw with me.

213
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,960
<i>Why did she come to see you?</i>

214
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,320
She came because we're friends.

215
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,000
She humiliated you
in front of the team,

216
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,960
almost ended your career
and your life.

217
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,760
So drop this fucking friendship bullshit.

218
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
<i>I'll repeat the question, Angel.</i>

219
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
Why did you call Inspector Murillo?

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
Because she's my friend.

221
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,840
You were at the hideout
of the Professor.

222
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,880
<i>I know you took a teaspoon</i>

223
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,360
<i>and turned it over</i>
<i>to forensics for analysis.</i>

224
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
Give us the address.

225
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,800
I don't remember anything.

226
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,600
-I don't remember a fucking thing.
-Right.

227
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,000
You know that hiding information
is an offense of concealment.

228
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,960
<i>You may end up sharing a cell</i>
<i>with the heist men,</i>

229
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,520
or with your friend.

230
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,320
<i>Give us the address.</i>

231
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,920
<i>Prieto...</i>

232
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,960
you sure know how to treat a guy
who just came out of a coma.

233
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
Let's go! Nobody stays behind!

234
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
Let's go!

235
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,840
Everyone put your masks on!

236
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,920
-They're inside.
-Take the Browning to vault three!

237
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,360
Denver's on it.

238
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,880
What about the hostages?

239
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
-We hand them over.
-Everyone mix!

240
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Mix, scramble and on your knees!

241
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,480
Let's go!

242
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,440
Well, not everyone.

243
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,360
Ariadna is coming with me.

244
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go, Helsinki!

245
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,600
They're in the museum.

246
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,840
Hands up where I can see them.
All of you, hands up!

247
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
-Don't shoot.
-Don't shoot, we're hostages!

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
Everyone, masks off!

249
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
They're hostages.

250
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
They're hostages, get them out. Now!

251
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,520
Prepared for rescue protocol.

252
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
-We're freeing hostages.
-<i> Suarez,</i>

253
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,800
we're sticking to the plan.

254
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
Go to the basement.

255
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,640
We must get them out
through the tunnel.

256
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
You, with them. The rest with me,
to the basement. Let's go!

257
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,640
We've got Parker.

258
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,960
Get me the ambassador.

259
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,600
Do a headcount
and identity check of the hostages.

260
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
<i>Colonel, we're making</i>
<i>our way down the sewer.</i>

261
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,840
Move.

262
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
What the hell is that?

263
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,360
<i>Move in the TEDAX unit.</i>

264
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
The basement is full of explosives.

265
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Motherfuckers.

266
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,080
Can you defuse it?

267
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Yes, but I'll need time, sir.

268
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
<i>The detonator could be</i>
<i>close to the RDX.</i>

269
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,120
<i>There may be tripwires.</i>

270
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,720
We are detecting
movement in the tunnel, sir.

271
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,680
<i>Closing in on the target.</i>

272
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,680
<i>-They're on the other side of the wall.</i>
-Five of the robbers.

273
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,320
Wait.

274
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
There are six of them.

275
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,840
It's them.

276
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,960
They're about to exit the hole
into the sewer.

277
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
Underground agents ready.

278
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,640
-They're closing in on you.
-<i> Copy that.</i>

279
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,480
We've got you, motherfuckers.

280
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,040
In six seconds,

281
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,760
five,

282
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
four,

283
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
three,

284
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
two,

285
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,760
one.

286
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
Don't move.

287
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,080
Hold your ground.

288
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,480
Hold it.

289
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Hands up!

290
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,440
-Down!
-Don't shoot!

291
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,680
-Don't shoot!
-Turn off the light!

292
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,560
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

293
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,880
<i>I'm Arturo Roman!</i>

294
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
<i>They're hostages, hold your fire!</i>

295
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,000
<i>Confirmed, they're hostages.</i>

296
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,600
No!

297
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,680
I may not have always
been able to read women.

298
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Maybe because of my ego.
But with you it's different.

299
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,960
I know exactly what you feel.

300
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,840
I know that even without money,

301
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,120
you'd come with me anywhere
because you're madly in love.

302
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
-Isn't that right?
-Yes, of course.

303
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,960
That's why I want you to know
that I love you too.

304
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,040
Berlin, hurry!

305
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,720
And the little time we have left

306
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,920
is going to be like fireworks.

307
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
A wonderful toy.

308
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,200
Wonderful toy, Helsinki!

309
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,640
Nairobi, how's that going?

310
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,560
The trench is in place,
just the last batch of money left.

311
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,520
Helsinki!

312
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,920
Let's go!

313
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Let's go, hurry.

314
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
Colonel,

315
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,800
they have another tunnel.

316
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,680
What?

317
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
They're taking the money to the vault.

318
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,320
We saw them.

319
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
They made a hole in the ground
and they'll take it out through it.

320
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Come here.

321
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,160
There are four vaults,
two on each side of the corridor.

322
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,320
Can you tell me which one it is,
or point it out on the map?

323
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,920
Vault number three.

324
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,840
Are you sure, Alison?

325
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,120
Yes.

326
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,280
Suarez.

327
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,320
Do you copy?

328
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,960
<i>-Copy, sir.</i>
-Change of plans.

329
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,960
Vault 3. Top priority.

330
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,360
<i>Repeat, top priority.</i>
<i>That's where their tunnel is.</i>

331
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,560
Roger that, Colonel.

332
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,040
To vault 3! Go, go, go!

333
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,480
Do you know
where that tunnel leads?

334
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,920
They don't know, but I do.

335
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,560
To the hangar
where the fucking Professor works.

336
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
That's their escape route.

337
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,520
Bring in Inspector Murillo, now!

338
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,040
Gomez, get Inspector Murillo here,
immediately!

339
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,360
Will you get your son when you get out?

340
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
No.

341
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Not for now.

342
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,760
I'm out of a plan.

343
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,240
We can share a flat.

344
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Helsinki.

345
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Let's get out of here. Now!

346
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,400
-They're in the basement.
-Let's go!

347
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,360
Get out now.

348
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,080
-What about Denver?
-On his way to the hangar. Get out!

349
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,200
That's an order.

350
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,120
Berlin!

351
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,320
Let's go!

352
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,720
They're coming down the stairs.
They're almost there.

353
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,080
Okay, copy that.

354
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,480
They know where we are.

355
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,600
Get out of here.

356
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,640
-It's now or never.
-Helsinki, take Nairobi.

357
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
-I'll hold the fort.
-What do you mean?

358
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,960
I said go!

359
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,000
If they enter the tunnel, we're all dead!

360
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,080
What are you doing?

361
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,320
Someone has to stay in the trench.

362
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,840
-No.
-Yes, they're hot on our heels!

363
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,680
-Well, we're all leaving together!
-Nairobi,

364
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,560
You said I was sexist, right?

365
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,840
Well then, women and queers first.

366
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,560
-Let's go.
-I hate you!

367
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,560
Come on!

368
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,120
-I hate you!
-Come on!

369
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,680
Come on.
Everyone at their stations.

370
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,640
Wait!

371
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,200
Hey.

372
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
Where are you going, honey?

373
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,040
We had agreed that we
would stay together to the end.

374
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
No!

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Berlin, please.

376
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
No! Let me out!

377
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
Let me out, damn it!

378
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,800
-Stay still!
-Fuck you, bastard!

379
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,040
Bastard!

380
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
You son of a bitch!

381
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
You and I are the resistance.

382
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
You're a sorry sight.

383
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,440
Where's the hangar?

384
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,200
I don't know.

385
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,880
Not only do you know,

386
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,040
but you know
that I know you know,

387
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,840
so let's spare ourselves this part.

388
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,480
Heavy fire, take cover!

389
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,440
We must go back.

390
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,920
No, Nairobi. No.

391
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,040
There's no time. Let's go.

392
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,840
Ariadna, load it!

393
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,240
Load it!

394
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,280
Now!

395
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
Load it, come on!

396
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,280
This is a lawsuit for legal custody.

397
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,040
And it was presented
by the hero of the case,

398
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,400
the officer who identified
the leader of the operation.

399
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,200
Your ex-husband.

400
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,800
Hang in there!

401
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,280
-Load!
-Now!

402
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,960
We're Romeo and Juliet!

403
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,600
We're Bonnie and Clyde!

404
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,760
We are

405
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,480
the Lovers of Teruel!

406
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,480
He's requests full custody
of your daughter.

407
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,400
And if a judge finds you guilty
of the charges held against you,

408
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,240
it will be automatically granted.

409
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,880
And if he is indeed
the abuser you say he is,

410
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,000
your daughter will be in trouble.

411
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,600
Load!

412
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,600
Now!

413
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
You son of a bitch, motherfucker,

414
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,240
fucking bastard.

415
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,840
Intelligence can drop all charges.

416
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,680
I'm Intelligence. But don't ask
for more guarantees than my word

417
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,320
because the offer will be gone
if the kidnappers get away.

418
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,080
And that could happen in a few minutes.

419
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,440
Let's go.

420
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,920
So choose,

421
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,520
your daughter

422
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,680
or a guy you didn't know just last week.

423
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,160
Lobo, we can't contain that machine gun!

424
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,720
We have to take it out!

425
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
Hand grenade!

426
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,960
Load!

427
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,880
Now!

428
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,080
Take cover!

429
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,760
Look out, let's go!

430
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,360
Come on, take cover! Go!

431
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,560
Take cover!

432
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,480
You're here.

433
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,960
You're finally here.

434
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
Where's Berlin?

435
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,560
He stayed inside.

436
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,080
-What do you mean?
-The GEO's were on us

437
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,480
and he was determined to cover the tunnel.

438
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,520
He saved our lives.

439
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
Clear. Formation!

440
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,960
Surprise!

441
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,480
It's him, get down!

442
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,680
You don't have much time left.

443
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
Not only will you lose your daughter,

444
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,360
you'll be throwing your life away.

445
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,640
Give me that address.

446
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,640
Give me that address!

447
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,960
33 Alcantara.

448
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
33 Alcantara, everyone over there!

449
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,640
Andres!

450
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,040
<i>Andres!</i>

451
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,440
Professor?

452
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,760
Fire!

453
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,440
I'm a little busy now!

454
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
Enter the tunnel.

455
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Negative!

456
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,880
Andres,

457
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,840
we're going to blow the tunnel.
Get out.

458
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
They're closing in, it's too late.

459
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,320
Move forward!

460
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,800
Leave now!

461
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,760
I'm not leaving without you,
you know that.

462
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Clip!

463
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,600
Move forward!

464
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,520
Old age isn't for me.

465
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,600
Imagine me drooling
or losing sphincter control?

466
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,600
No.

467
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
That takes courage. I prefer this.

468
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,920
Get out, please.

469
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,960
Sergio!

470
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,400
<i>Don't give me that.</i>

471
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,080
You promised to not stick around
if things got ugly, and they did.

472
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,000
Helsinki,

473
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,520
blow the tunnel.

474
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,200
No, no.

475
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,720
Get down!

476
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
Helsinki, it's an order.
Soldier, blow it!

477
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,000
No. Don't do it!

478
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,160
Helsinki, it's an order.
Soldier, blow the tunnel!

479
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,680
-Professor...
-No, Helsinki!

480
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,640
I love you, little brother.
Don't forget it.

481
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,160
Professor!

482
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,160
Helsinki!

483
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,080
Andres!

484
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,440
Andres, please!

485
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,400
I've spent my life being
a bit of an asshole, but today...

486
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,080
I think I feel like dying with dignity.

487
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
No!

488
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,280
Let's go, give him hell!

489
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,920
Professor.

490
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,120
Open!

491
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,640
Fonollosa is down.

492
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,800
I repeat, Fonollosa is down.

493
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,480
Professor,

494
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
listen.

495
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,920
We must keep going.

496
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,640
We must keep going.

497
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
We must keep going.

498
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,040
<i>Colonel, units headed to 33 Alcantara.</i>

499
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,960
<i>300 meters from the target.</i>

500
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,960
Change your clothes.

501
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,560
<i>Turning onto Alcantara street.</i>

502
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,160
<i>We've reached the target.</i>

503
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,880
<i>We're inside the hangar.</i>

504
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,560
<i>Search the area.</i>
<i>Melero, Sanz to the left. Ribero, with me.</i>

505
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,920
<i>Melero?</i>

506
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,960
<i>It's clear.</i>

507
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,760
<i>-Sanz?</i>
<i>-It's clear.</i>

508
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,960
<i>-Ribero?</i>
<i>-Clear!</i>

509
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,440
<i>Confirmed, Colonel.</i>

510
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,640
<i>There's no one here.</i>

511
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,960
<i>The hangar is empty.</i>

512
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
WEDNESDAY 06:28 PM

513
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,760
128 HOURS

514
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,320
END OF THE HEIST

515
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,880
1 MINUTE EARLIER

516
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,520
2 MINUTES EARLIER

517
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,000
5 MINUTES EARLIER

518
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,960
7 MINUTES EARLIER

519
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,440
Professor!

520
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,120
Professor!

521
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,520
365 DAYS SINCE THE HEIST

522
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,680
<i>It's been one year since the heist</i>
<i>at the Royal Mint of Spain.</i>

523
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,480
<i>Considered the greatest robbery</i>
<i>of all times</i>

524
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,120
<i>remains unsolved.</i>

525
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,120
<i>Just like the unknown</i>
<i>whereabouts of the heist men,</i>

526
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,560
<i>who got away with over one billion euros.</i>

527
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,000
<i>Although the authorities</i>
<i>condemned the heist,</i>

528
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,080
<i>the public still thinks</i>
<i>their actions were legitimate</i>

529
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,320
<i>a protest against</i>
<i>the established order,</i>

530
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,240
<i>which generated polemic</i>
<i>on social media.</i>

531
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,880
<i>The most well-known case</i>

532
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,000
<i>was that of Chief Police Inspector then,</i>

533
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,840
<i>Raquel Murillo, who left the force after</i>
<i>controversial statements to the media,</i>

534
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,080
<i>in which she disapproved</i>

535
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,760
<i>of the way the National Intelligence Corp</i>
<i>handled the crisis.</i>

536
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,440
<i>Let's leave.</i>

537
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,640
<i>Let's take off to some country</i>
<i>in the Caribbean.</i>

538
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,640
<i>It's just that,</i>

539
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,160
<i>it's so crazy that...</i>

540
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,280
<i>I can't see myself</i>
<i>doing anything else.</i>

541
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
<i>Pick one.</i>

542
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,120
<i>Palawan.</i>

543
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,320
If it's important,

544
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,480
you can use mine.
