1
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,960
Nadeem!

2
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,180
Stay in the car!

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,930
Don't shoot! We surrender!

4
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,640
Convict. Don't move.

5
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,150
- Move! Move!
- Get back! Back it up!

6
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,110
I need to make a call.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,320
Lobby's secure.

8
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,030
Straight to the nest! Move!

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,700
SAC's inbound.
What the hell happened?

10
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,830
Ambush.

11
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,310
- They were everywhere.
- Do you have status on anyone?

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,000
Two agents in surgery now.
We lost five for this shitbag.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,010
- Donovan!
- Stay back.

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,890
- We're his attorneys.
- Congratulations. Stay back.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,890
Locate Vanessa.

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,310
The Albanians, they tried to get me.
They'll go for her, too.

17
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,940
My client is not implying that
he knows how to reach a wanted fugitive.

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,650
And make sure she's safe!

19
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,840
We're good. Get the medic.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,300
- He's fine.
- For me, not him.

21
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,970
Copy that. Shitbag's all yours.

22
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,590
Dex... Hold on.

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,970
Check in with the SAC.

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,020
We're down too many agents.
The debrief can wait.

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,600
You know the deal.

26
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,060
Follow the protocol
and get back here ASAP.

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,370
You will be confined
to these quarters.

28
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,620
You'll be monitored at all times.

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,710
You are allowed no outside contact
other than your lawyers.

30
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,130
Armed guards will be
stationed outside 24/7.

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,600
You'll be safe here.

32
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,060
"Safe." You nearly had me killed.

33
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,190
Good men died tonight.

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,900
You will make their sacrifice
worth something.

35
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Or you can shove our deal up your ass.

36
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,110
Hey, convict...

37
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,280
your lawyers are here.

38
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,170
Get dry.

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,510
Get dressed.

40
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,300
Did you reach her?

41
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,010
I need these cameras shut off
and a moment with my client.

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,180
- Forget about the cameras.
- Kill the cameras till they leave.

43
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,400
Is Vanessa safe?

44
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,860
We don't know.

45
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,070
She's missing.

46
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,850
Oh, God. I don't know, it's been...
uh, three months since I had one.

47
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,650
- See, now, that's bad.
- Yeah.

48
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,940
Yeah, it's been about a month for me.

49
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,110
I've been elbows deep in, uh, research,

50
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,740
but it feels like 100 years
since I had a home-cooked meal.

51
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
- This is all Uncle Mitchell.
- Please, stop.

52
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,450
Left to my own devices,
we'd be ordering Wo Hop every night.

53
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,540
- Nothing wrong with that.
- This woman does it all.

54
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,460
Not only does she run Proxy Magazine,
she is an expert orderer.

55
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,250
- Stop it.
- No, it's true.

56
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,130
You're amazing. It's like a skill.

57
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,300
Right? You know all the best dishes
on every menu.

58
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,820
You always order the right amount.
Never too much, too little.

59
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,040
It's perfect.

60
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,760
- He'd be lost without me.
- I would.

61
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,350
- Disgusting.
- Are they always like this?

62
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,180
When I was eight,
they renewed their vows on Long Beach

63
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,850
- in front of the whole family.
- No.

64
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,150
Aunt Lily hired one of those planes
that write in the sky.

65
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,480
- Oh, my God. Did you really?
- I did.

66
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,110
- So, how did you two meet?
- Kind of like you guys, actually.

67
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,200
We were set up
by our college newspaper editor.

68
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,450
Oh. Mitchell, did you not tell them?

69
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,330
- Uncle Mitchell...
- I am so sorry. I had no idea.

70
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,710
I had no... I was...
I had nothing to do with it.

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,670
You know what?
Uh, we need... We need more wine.

72
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,640
- Really?
- I get it. I'm sorry.

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,590
You know...

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,810
I knew that if I had actually asked you,
you'd have said no.

75
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,310
Right. See, that's the part
where it gets to be my choice.

76
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,810
I know you meant well, but this...

77
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,230
- You could use some happy.
- I am happy.

78
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,690
Look, I'm not, um... I'm not ready.

79
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,120
All right, well, if you want to leave,
I'll understand.

80
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,750
I'm sure Jason will, too.

81
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,970
So, wait. You're telling me
that you named your cat Ralph?

82
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,760
- Ellison.
- Oh.

83
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,560
Hey! I have a PhD in Am Lit.
He's my favorite author.

84
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,150
"Life is to be lived, not controlled.
Humanity is won by..."

85
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,110
I know this one, actually...

86
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,360
"Humanity is won by continuing to play
in the face of certain defeat."

87
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Is that right?

88
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,360
How do you know the quote?

89
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,320
I was going to be an English major.

90
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,280
Invisible Man would have been
a big part of my curriculum,

91
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,040
but that was another lifetime.

92
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,540
You made out okay.

93
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,210
A revered journalist
with an acclaimed publication.

94
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,170
- Okay.
- Too much, honey.

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,960
So, tell me, you ever worry
little Ralph's plotting your demise?

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,920
- I take it you're a dog person.
- Absolutely.

97
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,720
I don't know, I like the company.
Shared a room with my brother growing up.

98
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,350
The apartment felt empty till I got Ralph.

99
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,770
How about you? Any, uh, siblings?

100
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,690
- Uh. More wine?
- Um...

101
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,820
Yeah. No, I had a brother, too, but, um...

102
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,440
but he died.

103
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,780
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

104
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,700
- Who wants dessert?
- That'd be great. Thank you.

105
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,790
Sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Ellison.

106
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,620
Uh, sorry.

107
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
Karen Page.

108
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,840
- Who in the hell would let out Fisk?
- Don't say his name.

109
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,180
What? Why?

110
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,930
After Ben died, Lily was
inconsolable. They were really close.

111
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,180
And, you know, it turned out that somebody
at my office had been working for him.

112
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,850
We'd gotten to the point where
an hour could go by,

113
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,230
and I didn't have to call
to reassure that I'm alive.

114
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,520
- I understand.
- Good.

115
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,690
Then you won't push back when I tell you,
you are staying away from this story.

116
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,070
I can't do that.

117
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,030
Yes, you can. And you will.

118
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,370
Look, I get it.
I have a history with... that man.

119
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,130
- Makes it a conflict of interest.
- Exactly.

120
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,410
But I also know him better
than anyone else on our staff.

121
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
- Doesn't that give me a unique angle?
- It gives you a bias.

122
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,590
Look, it's not up for discussion.
Enjoy the pie.

123
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,720
And, darling, that is not
a dress, that is a disaster.

124
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,600
I worked on it with all
the materials available to me,

125
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
and I did the best with the time...

126
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,150
Baby...

127
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,280
What was it this time? Laughing Matt?

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,240
Body Matt.

129
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,870
Foggy Bear, whatever happened to Matt,
it's not your fault.

130
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,370
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

131
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,040
Because I have this great life?

132
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,460
Beautiful girlfriend, high-paying job,
expensive suits...

133
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,430
I always wanted a good suit.

134
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,390
I have it all, but Matt's just...

135
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,270
gone.

136
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,900
Maybe you should talk to someone.

137
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,070
It won't bring him back.

138
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,360
But it might help you.

139
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,000
I can't.

140
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,540
Why not?

141
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,130
Sorry. Go back to your brief.

142
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,510
Take a pill.
There's some in the medicine cabinet.

143
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,480
No. No. No.

144
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,610
Lock Fisk up!
Lock Fisk up!

145
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,280
Lock Fisk up! Lock Fisk up!

146
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,310
Doesn't make any sense.

147
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,480
Of course it does. God is angry with you.

148
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,690
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,320
You don't think God knows
you tried to kill yourself?

150
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,450
No.

151
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,450
That has nothing to do with this.

152
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,540
God restored your hearing...

153
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,710
just in time to hear my name
chanted by the crowds.

154
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,630
Just in time to learn, in the long run,
I won, you lost.

155
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,760
Does that sound like God's forgiveness?

156
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,270
No.

157
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,020
It sounds like... hell.

158
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,070
Lock Fisk up!
Lock Fisk up!

159
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,070
You'll never keep Karen safe.

160
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,990
- In the end, you'll kill her, too.
- Stop it.

161
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,710
Just like your father.

162
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,670
- And Stick.
- I said stop.

163
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,960
And Elektra.

164
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,880
They all died because of you, Matthew.

165
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
I can't believe this.
This is insane.

166
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,020
You're that reporter.

167
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,940
Sorry. Karen Page, Bulletin.

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,280
Uh... Sorry, who's in charge here?

169
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,320
That's the genius who got him out.
Agent Nadeem.

170
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,410
Thanks.

171
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,080
Agent Nadeem.

172
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,120
Soon as I'm done here.
There's a vigil at the hospital.

173
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,340
Just give Sami a hug for me. You, too.

174
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,510
Hi. Karen Page of the New York Bulletin.

175
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,140
I'm not authorized to speak to the press.

176
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,470
You need to find
Special Agent In Charge Hattley.

177
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,680
But it is N-A-D-E-E-M, right?

178
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,770
And you're the agent
who released Wilson Fisk?

179
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,190
Fisk has not been released.
That's fake news.

180
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,070
He's a cooperating witness,

181
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,230
but he's very much a convicted prisoner
and being treated as such.

182
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,860
Being held in a $20 million penthouse?

183
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,160
Seized by the US Government from some
Wall Street prick convicted of fraud.

184
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,700
Oh. Oh, I get it. Okay,
so what's he having for dinner?

185
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,870
Is it the filet mignon
or the line-caught halibut?

186
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,210
Press area is over there.

187
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,920
One RICO count carries
a 20-year sentence.

188
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,670
Fisk was convicted on five.
Want to explain to me how this is justice?

189
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,640
Jennings, Garcia, Foster,
Leighton, Torres.

190
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,470
They lost their lives,
and they were good agents, good people.

191
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,350
Write about that, Ms. Page.

192
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
All right...

193
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,870
get it up there.

194
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,870
- All right?
- Yeah. Okay.

195
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,080
Excuse us. Watch yourself.

196
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,670
Nine-one-seven-four.

197
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,870
Thanks.

198
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,550
Oh. Hey, man, hand me one of those BNCs,
would ya?

199
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,560
Thanks. Dude, I said a BNC...

200
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,820
Yes, I've checked three times.
I have the tickets.

201
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,120
Okay, okay.
I just wanted to be sure.

202
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
With this mess outside,
we don't wanna have to come back.

203
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,670
- Do you think we're safe?
- We should check out.

204
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,510
We booked this months ago.
Now we have to deal with this?

205
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,910
We're checking out early.

206
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,930
We are very sorry
for the disruption.

207
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,050
Can we assist you in making
reservations elsewhere?

208
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,510
Do you know who I am?
You know who he is, right?

209
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,020
Just one moment, sir.

210
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,360
Watch rotation.
Sound off.

211
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,030
North entrance is green.

212
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,570
West entrance is green.

213
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,370
Service area is green.

214
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,740
Lobby is green.

215
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,090
So, you're inside. Now what?

216
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,550
Why would they let you out?

217
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,670
Does it matter?

218
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,720
The real question is, when you find me,
what are you prepared to do?

219
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,220
See, if the FBI are protecting you,
that means you cut a deal.

220
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,730
With everything I know
about crime in this city...

221
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,310
the FBI will be eating out of my hand.

222
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,940
- You'll manipulate them.
- You don't know that.

223
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,860
I know you.

224
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,240
Maybe prison has changed me.

225
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,530
Maybe right this moment

226
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,910
I'm giving the FBI information
that will save lives.

227
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,410
While you're here doing what?
Whatever this is.

228
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,000
Wouldn't that be something?

229
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,590
If I became more valuable
to this city than you ever were.

230
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,710
Garcia was the best man
at my wedding.

231
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,470
Word is Andrews will pull through.

232
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,760
If you call probably never going
to walk again pulling through.

233
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,890
That's hard. That's really hard.

234
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,310
And he gets a penthouse.

235
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,490
Shut the cameras off, please.
We need time with our client.

236
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,000
And?

237
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,470
We reached Felix Manning.
Vanessa's safe.

238
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,140
Her bodyguards
relocate her every 72 hours,

239
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,220
and they take precautions
to avoid being tracked.

240
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,100
No cell phones.
It's why they were unreachable.

241
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,270
Where is she now?

242
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,850
A safe house outside Barcelona.

243
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,820
Felix hid her in Spain?

244
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,400
It was her decision.

245
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,160
We strongly advised against Europe,
given the extradition risk,

246
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,160
but Ms. Marianna enjoys the art
and she can be very insistent.

247
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,420
Yes, she can.

248
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,380
But it's too easy for the Albanians
to get at her there.

249
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,550
Call Felix.

250
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,020
Tell him to put Vanessa some place safer.

251
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,350
Some place closer.

252
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,670
"Homicides are down,
burglaries down, assaults down.

253
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
I have not accomplished this alone.

254
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,930
The good people of Hell's Kitchen
have said no more.

255
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,140
Together with the NYPD,

256
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,600
we have begun to take
our neighborhoods back.

257
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,230
Reelect me for district attorney,
and let's continue to take our city back.

258
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,940
Together."

259
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,230
How was that?

260
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,530
Too many "togethers."
Sounds like a Beatles' song.

261
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,450
Okay, but is that good?

262
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,530
No.

263
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,370
- Wow. I'm inspired.
- Mr. Nelson.

264
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,750
Mr. Tower, you need to get ready.

265
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,130
I believe a $1,500 contribution
buys me ten minutes.

266
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,960
It doesn't buy you anything,
but I'll give you five.

267
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,470
- Arlene, I said the blue one.
- It had a stain.

268
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,800
The charcoal's the ticket. Trust me.

269
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,470
You have five minutes.

270
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,180
So, what can I do for you?

271
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,810
It's what I can do for you.

272
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,480
The Wilson Fisk case.

273
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,820
I want to provide my complete,
unmitigated, fully caffeinated support.

274
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,150
I'm sorry, the Fisk case?

275
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
I know you're doing
everything in your power

276
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,660
to reverse the terms
of that crap deal he finagled.

277
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,450
But you're under-resourced
and I'm over-resourced.

278
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,620
Like, obscenely over-resourced.

279
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,870
All this to say, I'm drafting myself
onto your team for this.

280
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
So tag me the hell in.

281
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,880
Maybe just a nod?

282
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
- Mr. Nelson...
- Foggy.

283
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,590
I already fought this tooth and nail.

284
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,050
I objected to Mr. Fisk's
house incarceration

285
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,930
on every ground imaginable.

286
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,430
I assumed as much.

287
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,730
So I did some digging,
and if we can open a state case,

288
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,560
we can at least put him back behind bars.

289
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,650
At least for a while,
which will buy us time to build...

290
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,980
It's just not feasible.

291
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,780
I'll do research. Late-night strategizing.
All pro bono, of course. Soup to nuts.

292
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,410
Nelson reporting for duty, sir.

293
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,990
Fisk is cooperating
with the federal government.

294
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,370
There's nothing I can do.

295
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,330
I know you know the difference
between a good fight and a losing battle.

296
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,040
I know that sometimes
they're the same thing.

297
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,010
And you don't know which battle
you're fighting until you're fighting it.

298
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,260
Well, I'm moving on.

299
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,050
You should, too.

300
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,510
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go change for an interview.

301
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,180
So that's it? You're just gonna roll over?

302
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,480
No, I'm just gonna do my job.
And your five minutes are up.

303
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,100
Would you care more
if you weren't trying to get reelected?

304
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,400
Watch it, Counselor.

305
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,270
Fisk had Ms. Cardenas killed.

306
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,570
Maybe you don't give a damn,
because she's dead and can't vote for you,

307
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,910
but she was a good person.

308
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,700
She cared about her community,
was braver than both of us put together.

309
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,330
Fisk will hurt more people like her.

310
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,090
She didn't have a voice,
because the people in power didn't care.

311
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,750
You're supposed to be
Ms. Cardenas's voice.

312
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,430
Leave... or I'm calling security.

313
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,600
I'm going.

314
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,430
But I'm canceling my check.

315
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,270
Prison, not a penthouse!
Prison, not a penthouse!

316
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,700
Chow is on the way, guys.

317
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,960
Mickey D's?

318
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,760
You think DOJ is going to cover
$40 tuna melts for us?

319
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,340
Just a coffee, please.

320
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:32,390
Save me something. I'm up in ten.

321
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,970
Penthouse, please.

322
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,430
It's got the best view.

323
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,850
You should be rotting in a cell.

324
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,310
So you're gonna bring me back to prison?

325
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,280
But you know that won't work.

326
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,490
There's only one way to stop me,
but you're not gonna do it.

327
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,990
Are you sure about that?

328
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,250
In a way, you're my accomplice.

329
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,960
Everything that's happened
since you refused to kill me is on you.

330
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,550
The bodies that I've stacked up.

331
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,260
The ones to come.

332
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,470
- I wonder who's next?
- You have the routing number.

333
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,010
Two million. In euros.

334
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,270
No, today. My client is not a patient man.

335
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,270
You can follow him right to me.
You know you want to.

336
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,320
- May I see your room key, sir?
- Yeah, I got it.

337
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,780
No, I need to see it.

338
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,790
Oh, sure. Yeah.

339
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,700
You can take him. Grab his gun.

340
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,630
Come for me. I'm caged up. Unarmed.

341
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,590
- Sir.
- They gave me, like, three of them.

342
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,840
But you won't.

343
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,380
You can't kill me.
You can't even kill yourself.

344
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,930
You know what?
I must have left it in my car.

345
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,640
Then I can't let you through.

346
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,100
Sure, I...

347
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,360
I'll be right back.

348
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,990
Pharmacy service,
please call station four.

349
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,830
Pharmacy service,
please call station four.

350
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,510
Doctor Brenner, 241.

351
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,050
I'm so sorry.

352
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,020
Hey, boss.

353
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,990
Andrews is back under the knife.
They think they can save his liver.

354
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,780
Good. Good. That's good.

355
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,870
I wanted to give blood, but...

356
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,750
I wasn't sure if I should show my face.

357
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,790
Nobody blames you.

358
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,300
I blame me.

359
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,010
Moving Fisk was my call.

360
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,010
Because I pushed for it.

361
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,430
Because it was the smart thing to do.

362
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,010
Because we signed up to protect people.

363
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,140
And this is what it looks like sometimes.

364
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,690
Think of all the times this won't happen
because of what we're doing.

365
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,110
Not to civilians. Not to us.

366
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,320
Hold on to all the lives we're saving.

367
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,950
They matter...
just as much as the one's we've lost.

368
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,710
Yeah.

369
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,370
Bon appétit, asshole.

370
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,720
It's Special Agent Poindexter, isn't it?

371
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,350
You saved my life last night.

372
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,560
Yeah, we all make mistakes.

373
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,310
I'm sorry for the loss
of your fellow agents.

374
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,820
Losing them to protect someone like me...

375
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:07,280
must be particularly difficult
for the families and the loved ones.

376
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,160
I'd offer my condolences...

377
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,710
but I imagine it brings them
greater comfort to hate me.

378
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,680
Unless you feel otherwise.

379
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,970
That my words might bring
any positive effect.

380
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,140
If so, please share that,
from what I witnessed,

381
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
they were incredibly brave.

382
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,480
Might wanna eat faster, convict.
The meal's over in five.

383
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,910
I owe those fallen agents a debt...

384
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,990
that I can never repay.

385
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,080
But...

386
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,340
I also owe you.

387
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,340
I've known extraordinary people.

388
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,640
But I've never seen a talent like yours.

389
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,850
May I ask you where you acquired
such a skill?

390
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,190
Okay. You're done.

391
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,210
I saved him 'cause it was my job.

392
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,870
What more do you want me to say, Doc?

393
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,040
Forget Fisk. Talk to me about the ambush.

394
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,840
What about it?

395
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,760
Come on, Poindexter,
we both know how this works.

396
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,220
We have to talk
so I can clear you for duty.

397
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
It is what it is.

398
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,310
I lost friends today.

399
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,060
And you used lethal force
against multiple suspects.

400
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,430
- Yeah.
- And you're on duty

401
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,480
even though you should be
on administrative leave.

402
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,310
I understand you're trying to do your job,

403
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,480
but if I were wearing a mask,
the press would be calling me a hero.

404
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,690
Instead, I'm sitting here
trying to justify protecting myself.

405
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,990
I'm not the enemy. I'm just trying to...

406
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,200
Look, forget the psych bullshit
for a minute.

407
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,290
Just tell me for real, how are you?

408
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,590
It's hard.

409
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,090
It's really hard.

410
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,340
This isn't the first time
you've used lethal force.

411
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,220
I'm FBI SWAT, Doc.
What do you think a sniper does?

412
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,890
Well, the thing is, Dex...
Can I call you Dex?

413
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,190
The thing is,
events like this exact a toll.

414
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,820
Repeating traumatic experiences
compounds that toll, creating a pressure.

415
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,240
Until one day I go postal? Yeah, I get it.

416
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,240
The point is,
you have to process this stuff.

417
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,570
I process it.

418
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,530
Do you have a support system?

419
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,410
Well, I think
she'd rather be called Julie.

420
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,710
Oh. Well, tell me, how does that work?

421
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,170
She's a bartender.

422
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,800
Professional listener, like you.

423
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,050
She probably gets paid more.

424
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,180
Tell me about her.

425
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,100
We get dinner most nights.

426
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,220
Today's Tuesday?

427
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,020
It's pizza night.

428
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,020
Julie gets broccoli with sausage,
extra cheese.

429
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,730
I tell her about my day.

430
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,070
The good, the bad.

431
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,320
I know it's not healthy
to hold this stuff in, so...

432
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,780
I talk to her.

433
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,990
I tell her everything.

434
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
And...

435
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,710
And she doesn't judge me or blame me.

436
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,290
She's just... there for me.

437
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,550
She sounds like a good one.

438
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,210
Yeah, she is.

439
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,970
All right. You are clear for duty.

440
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:00,520
But I want you checking in with me daily
for a while. Okay?

441
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,850
Yes, sir.

442
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:07,320
You, uh... You go see your girl.
It'll do you good.

443
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,170
Why did Fisk flip on the Albanians?

444
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,220
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've got the wrong person.

445
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,020
Fisk hated prison. The FBI got him out.

446
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,190
No, no. He could have turned on anyone.
Why the Albanians?

447
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,650
I'm just a lawyer.

448
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,940
What is Fisk really getting out of this?
Is it the Albanians' territory?

449
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,740
- No.
- Is it money?

450
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
No.

451
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,530
Why don't you let me know
when you wanna breathe?

452
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,870
Fisk's woman.

453
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,290
The feds will drop
all charges against her.

454
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:07,920
- No.
- I swear! He's doing it all for her.

455
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,260
And where is Vanessa?

456
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,050
- Where you wanna eat?
- How about the Chinese place?

457
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,930
- Help! Help!
- Over there! Go! Let's go!

458
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,020
Help!

459
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,230
He's an Albanian.

460
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,980
There's an unidentified
assailant in the parking deck,

461
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,770
considered armed and dangerous.

462
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,750
Anyone got a visual on him?

463
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,460
Nothing yet.
Moving to the south side of the garage.

464
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,910
We're in stairwell H,
heading down to parking level three.

465
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,040
We need backup
on parking level three.

466
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,050
Repeat, we need backup
on parking level three.

467
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,130
Stop! FBI!

468
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,350
They have families, asshole.

469
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,390
Listen. I'm not here to...

470
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,980
- There he is! Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

471
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,740
Come out with your hands up. Now.

472
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,510
Stay down, man.

473
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:31,980
Oh, God.

474
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,020
That's it. Let the Devil out.

475
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,710
Felt good, didn't it?
Too bad you still can't get at me.

476
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,960
Not with the FBI protecting me.

477
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,670
I'm going to kill everyone you love,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

478
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,830
Paper goes to bed in 20 minutes.

479
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,080
- You got 15 seconds.
- Okay. It's big.

480
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,620
- Shit. Fisk.
- No, look...

481
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,330
God damn it.
I explicitly told you not to do that.

482
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,130
- I didn't set out to.
- Stop.

483
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,380
Mason saw you at the hotel.

484
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,470
I mean, I know Fisk is important to you.
I know. I don't care. Okay?

485
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,760
I assign the stories,
and I gave this one to Mason.

486
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,310
I wasn't there on that story.
I was there on my story. Kazemis?

487
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,640
Look, I think there's a connection.

488
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,400
What do you mean?

489
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Do you know who used to own
the Presidential Hotel?

490
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,150
- No.
- The Kazemis.

491
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,990
I don't have proof yet,
but you know who I think owns it now?

492
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,150
Wilson Fisk.

493
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,540
- Tell me.
- Okay.

494
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,170
Look, I got a lead.

495
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,170
So the Presidential Hotel is owned
by these nested shell companies.

496
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,630
It's just one company
who owns another and another...

497
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,340
Anyway, I tracked them from here
to the Caymans to Luxembourg.

498
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,760
And this connects to Fisk how?

499
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,220
Because all of those companies,

500
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,640
they're all represented here
in the United States by one law firm.

501
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,230
Donovan and Partners.

502
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,520
Fisk's lawyers.

503
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,570
Okay, keep going.

504
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,370
All right,
here's what I've pieced together.

505
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,150
Six months ago,

506
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,410
one of these shell companies buys
the Presidential Hotel from Kazemi.

507
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,700
A week ago, he tells his family
that he regrets the sale

508
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,450
and announces his intention
to buy the hotel back.

509
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,000
And two days later, Kazemi gets attacked.

510
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,540
Yes. Yes, exactly. Now,
I don't think that timing is coincidental.

511
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,710
I just...

512
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,760
I can feel Fisk is behind this.
Right? I feel it in my bones.

513
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,300
I need two days to get everything vetted,
then I'll have a story that you can run.

514
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,430
- It's excellent. Outstanding work, Karen.
- Thank you.

515
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Really.

516
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,020
Yeah.

517
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,610
- I'm giving it to Mason. I told you.
- What? No, I know, I'm biased.

518
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,980
Of course! Of course I'm biased.
Fisk tried to have me killed.

519
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,740
He also killed Ben,
which makes you as biased as me.

520
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,370
If people see your name
and know your connection to Fisk,

521
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,950
it compromises this paper!

522
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,830
Fine. Give the byline to Mason.
I don't give a shit about credit.

523
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,170
What I give a shit about
is Fisk getting out of prison.

524
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,340
We have to do something...
I have to do something about this.

525
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,380
So don't tell me to back off,
'cause I won't.

526
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,930
You know, it took Ben decades
to become this much of a pain in my ass.

527
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,120
Well, at least you're upright.

528
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,930
Do I even wanna know?

529
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,140
Do you believe people can change?

530
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,810
I'm still holding out hope.

531
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,150
I don’t think we can.

532
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,730
Not really.

533
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,860
I think we come into this world
who we are.

534
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,160
And maybe we get a little nicer.

535
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,990
Or a little angrier.

536
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,870
But we can't change
our fundamental nature.

537
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,130
Well, you'd actually
have to try to know.

538
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,090
I was talking about Wilson Fisk.

539
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,140
So your hearing's really back, then?

540
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,020
Well, what do you know?
Maybe the boss did hear my prayers.

541
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,600
Yeah, or my curses.

542
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,730
Please don't start with Job again.

543
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,280
You gotta admit it's interesting,
though, isn't it?

544
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,700
I finally get my full hearing back,

545
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,120
and the first thing I hear
is that Wilson Fisk is out of prison.

546
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,290
So you're suggesting that God set a
dangerous mobster free just to spite you?

547
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,210
Nah.

548
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,210
Probably just a coincidence.

549
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,880
Because that would be
incredibly narcissistic.

550
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,180
Fisk claims to be helping the FBI.

551
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
But they don't know him like I do.

552
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,770
Right. And according to you,
people can't change.

553
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,780
'Cause he's claiming
to have changed over a woman.

554
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,570
I see.

555
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,040
Well, if there's anything
that can redeem a lost soul,

556
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,630
love would have to top the list.

557
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,790
Oh, come on. Even a monster like Fisk?

558
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,010
You're talking to a nun, kiddo.

559
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,130
Love and redemption
are pretty much our sales pitch.

560
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,640
Yeah. Well, I'm not buying.

561
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,260
So, what are you gonna do?

562
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,190
I don't know.

563
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,440
Maybe I'll stop him.

564
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,860
For good this time.

565
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,120
Well, just be careful
that you don't become the monster.

566
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,670
Foggy.

567
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,460
This isn't real.

568
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,050
It's real.

569
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:28,560
Hey, Foggy.

570
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,230
How? Where have...
We all thought you were dead.

571
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,310
I'm sorry.

572
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,440
- Does Karen know you're back yet?
- Take a seat.

573
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
I'm...

574
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,360
I'm not back.

575
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:49,790
- Well, I'm 75% sure I'm not hallucinating.
- I'm, uh... not back.

576
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,870
Matt Murdock isn't gonna be
a part of me anymore. Um...

577
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,460
- I'm leaving him behind.
- What?

578
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,970
The only reason I came here
was to warn you and Karen...

579
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,340
that Fisk is out
and you're both in danger.

580
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,930
- Dude...
- I've had a rough couple of months, Foggy.

581
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,520
Questioning a lot of...

582
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,060
The point of it all.

583
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,360
And last night, everything became clear.

584
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,450
I'm going after him, Foggy.
I'm gonna find a way to bring Fisk down.

585
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,070
But I can only do that
if I know you and Karen are safe.

586
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,870
Dude, slow down.

587
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,830
I'm still processing that you're,
like, even sitting here.

588
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,830
I know you're gonna want to get involved.

589
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,000
You and Karen will try and fight Fisk
in some way.

590
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,170
I'm telling you,

591
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,760
I need you to stay out of it
and leave it to me.

592
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,930
No.

593
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,140
- "No"?
- No.

594
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,600
You don't get to show up like this
and say something like that

595
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,640
and expect me to be cool with it.

596
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,480
- You're my best friend, asshole.
- I see I was wrong to become your friend.

597
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,900
I... I put you in danger,
and it was selfish of me.

598
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,370
I can't change the past,
but I can stop making the same mistake.

599
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,370
We're done, buddy. It's, uh... It's over.

600
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,250
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

601
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,790
Yeah, I know.

602
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,550
Stay clear of Fisk.
Tell Karen to do the same.

603
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,300
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell her you saw me.

604
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,470
- Do you even hear yourself right now?
- Goodbye, Foggy.

605
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,220
Matt! Matt!

606
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,180
[door closes

607
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,000
Was it him?

608
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,880
He took out six feds.

609
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,380
He wasn't in a red suit,
but, yeah, it was him.

610
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,930
So the Devil is back.
