1
00:00:00,437 --> 00:00:02,271
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,541 --> 00:00:04,308
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,276
I have returned home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,825
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,904
But my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:12,306
I had to become
someone else.

7
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:14,842
I had to become
something else.

8
00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:18,212
I had to become
the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:20,114
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:21,916
The media has
been calling them Ghosts.

11
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:23,351
They're like nothing
we'd ever seen before.

12
00:00:23,353 --> 00:00:24,852
Every time we get too
close to one of them,

13
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:26,387
they off themselves
with cyanide.

14
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,322
Darhk's Ghosts,
they're HIVE.

15
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:30,558
An organization called HIVE
killed my brother.

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,360
Taking Lyla, that was
your idea, Oliver.

17
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:33,528
In front of our daughter!

18
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,830
You didn't just
lose my friendship--

19
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,465
you lost my respect.

20
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:39,367
Thea, whatever's
going on with you,

21
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,868
the League,
they'll know what to do.

22
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,270
We're going
to Nanda Parbat.

23
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:44,806
Why are we not
telling my brother?

24
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:48,743
Because you're not the only reason
for us going to Nanda Parbat.

25
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:58,886
Need a hand, John?
I'm good.

26
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:01,722
Varsity track,
all state, 100 meters.

27
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:27,633
Dig?

28
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:28,250
Felicity!

29
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:30,818
You know where this
son of a bitch went?

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,920
He vanished.
We call them Ghosts for a reason.

31
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:34,989
But I got air support
coming in on number two.

32
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:39,260
I got 'em.

33
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:53,241
Oliver?

34
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,109
Oliver?

35
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,344
He's all right,
Felicity.

36
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:58,312
We need eyes back
on our target.

37
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:00,581
I'll give you one
better than that.

38
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:21,536
20 feet ahead. I got one
gift-wrapped for you.

39
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,804
Feels like old times,
the three of us.

40
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,006
The OGs.

41
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:27,108
The Original Gangstas.

42
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:39,253
You're not checking out without
answering a few questions first.

43
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:42,356
Where can I find HIVE?
Who's behind the Ghosts?

44
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:44,225
Answer me!

45
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,130
Ohh.

46
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:50,498
Dig!

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,334
I'm good. I'm good.

48
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,338
Now he's gone.

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,539
Damn it!

50
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,742
We need more boots
on the ground, Oliver.

51
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,945
Thea and Laurel picked
a fine day for a spa treatment.

52
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:05,179
I don't think Thea
would be very much help

53
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:06,447
in the state
of mind she's in.

54
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,149
Where the hell
are they, anyway?

55
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:21,462
I really enjoy
sparring with you, Nyssa.

56
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,534
I'm not sparring.

57
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:30,004
I know. That's what
makes it so much fun.

58
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:44,252
You know I would show you no mercy
if given the opportunity.

59
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:46,187
That's why
I take great care

60
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,689
not to give you
the opportunity.

61
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:54,528
Next time I'll take
your head off.

62
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:03,104
My liege,
two foreigners are here.

63
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:05,539
One of them claims
to be the daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

64
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,442
No, I am his daughter.

65
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:10,378
What a pleasant
surprise.

66
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,512
Sister-in-law.

67
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:14,482
What brings you
to Nanda Parbat?

68
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,450
They have a coffin
with them, my liege.

69
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,219
A coffin?

70
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:21,822
I want you to bring
my sister back to life.

71
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,257
No.

72
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,192
You took her life
away from her.

73
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,894
It is your obligation
to bring her back.

74
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,896
I have no obligations
in this house.

75
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:31,465
You don't get to waltz in here
and demand a cup of tea,

76
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,200
let alone this.

77
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:34,869
Thea wasn't dead.

78
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:36,437
Sara is.

79
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,453
Thanks to you.

80
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,840
What you are asking for

81
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:41,075
hasn't been done
in ages' past.

82
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:43,077
Even then,
only in legend.

83
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,245
Which is why
I did not ask my father

84
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,846
to use the Pit
to save Sara

85
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:47,281
after she fell.

86
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,016
Even if Sara
went into the Pit,

87
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:50,151
even if it worked...

88
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:53,454
Who...What came
out of the Pit

89
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,022
would not be Sara.

90
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,224
Laurel,

91
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,794
I am sorry,
truly sorry,

92
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:02,963
but of course
my answer is no.

93
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:09,303
Ok, I know that was
kind of a bust,

94
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:12,406
but wasn't it fun having
the original Team Arrow back together?

95
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,744
You shouldn't have.

96
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,746
Got that off one
of the Ghosts.

97
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:20,114
It's where they hide
their cyanide capsules.

98
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,083
It looks like
an upper left bicuspid.

99
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:24,985
There was a very brief time
where I envisioned a future for myself

100
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,321
as a dental hygienist.

101
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,323
The best lead we've
got in the last three months.

102
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,426
It'll take the DNA sequencer
a little bit of time,

103
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:35,730
so I was thinking
margaritas while we wait.

104
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:37,965
You remember that place
we went after we took down the Dodger?

105
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,368
Ohh.
What do you say?

106
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,237
It's--it's been a while since it was
just the three of us.

107
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,607
I've got a family
to get back to.

108
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,846
I guess he just needs
more time.

109
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,081
Time hasn't been
doing anything.

110
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,282
Apologies haven't.

111
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,484
What are you saying?

112
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:59,420
I'm saying
that I'm done

113
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,622
waiting for him
to come around.

114
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:14,502
Like a fish
to water.

115
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,973
What did you say?

116
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,907
People gossip.

117
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,809
They say that
you're a rich kid

118
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:23,377
who got
shipwrecked here.

119
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,981
Bossing people around,
giving orders.

120
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:29,583
Must feel just
like home to you.

121
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:34,255
We got a runner!

122
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,190
All right,
watch the field.

123
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:45,366
Hey! Come on, man,
let's do this the easy way.

124
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:49,170
Yeah! That's the way.

125
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:52,473
Well, what you going to do,
talk him into surrendering?

126
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,178
That's how you do it.

127
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:15,196
Who are you?

128
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,167
Definitely not someone
who deserves to be shot.

129
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,869
Your wife and kid
are out, by the way.

130
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:23,270
Who are you?

131
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,840
Relax.

132
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:28,776
I'm a friendly.

133
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,444
You're A.R.G.U.S.?

134
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:32,980
You can read.
Lyla sent me.

135
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:34,281
My wife left the Agency
seven months ago.

136
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,916
She couldn't have
sent you anywhere.

137
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,885
She asked back when she was
 still with the Agency.

138
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,955
Took me a while, because, well,
favors aren't exactly

139
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:44,024
at the top of my to-do list.

140
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:46,894
Here. ID on whoever
hired Floyd Lawton

141
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,362
to do a hit back in '09.

142
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,167
Mina Fayad?

143
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,135
We're going
to find her.

144
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,871
Well, that's the best part.

145
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,906
TSA flagged her
coming in last night.

146
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:02,910
Flew in from Markovia.

147
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:05,246
I'll contact you
with her location.

148
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,521
Ahh.

149
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,055
Ms. Fayad.

150
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,191
You brought a guest.

151
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:19,393
As instructed.

152
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,395
Not by me.

153
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:24,098
The vigilante problem in this city
is greater than anticipated.

154
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,901
Your partners in HIVE
asked me to take steps.

155
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:30,371
He doesn't exactly
look like a problem solver.

156
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,239
What do you do?

157
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,910
I play cards. Mostly.

158
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:37,878
Perhaps
a demonstration.

159
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,146
Funny you should mention.

160
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:41,181
I happen to have
just the problem.

161
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:46,820
My operatives are under orders
to choose death before capture.

162
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:49,990
This gentleman
chose wrongly.

163
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:51,825
They got to me before I could take
the counter measure.

164
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:54,161
He's also prone
to excuses,

165
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:56,530
which I find tiresome.

166
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,552
Good.

167
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:19,058
That one was free.

168
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:23,403
Taking out the Green
Arrow and his friends...

169
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,273
That'll cost.

170
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,132
Deal.

171
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:34,156

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm not giving up.

174
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:50,156
I'm never giving up.

175
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:53,059
Because you're thinking
only of yourself.

176
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,994
I expected
your support.

177
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:56,729
I was counting on it.

178
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:58,698
Then you never really
knew me at all.

179
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,934
The Pit gave my father
a long life,

180
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:05,638
longer than what was natural, and much
longer than he deserved.

181
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,907
But he paid
a dark price for it.

182
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:10,209
A price Thea
is no doubt paying now.

183
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:13,813
I wouldn't wish it
on my most bitter enemy,

184
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:15,615
let alone my beloved.

185
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:19,785
I don't know if the Pit can
bring her back.

186
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:22,088
And Malcolm's right--
I don't know

187
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,257
what Sara will be
like if it does.

188
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,326
But what I do
know is that I have to try.

189
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:28,761
To what end?

190
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:33,699
To have your sister
return to you a monster?

191
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,701
Her spirit--

192
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,904
the part that
we both love--

193
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:41,374
that's the part that
I have to believe will come back.

194
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:43,676
You're not doing
this out of love;

195
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:45,378
you're doing this
out of grief.

196
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,813
I miss Sara, too.

197
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,149
But she is gone, Laurel.

198
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,485
Forever.

199
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:54,320
I have accepted it.

200
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,555
I think it's time
you did, too.

201
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,803
Still wishing you were
a dental hygienist?

202
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:14,106
More like
a molecular biologist.

203
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,976
You see this?

204
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,377
No.

205
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,846
In my defense,
I flunked biology.

206
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,749
Well, I got an A+,
and I still have no idea

207
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,351
what the hell
is going on here.

208
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:27,687
This DNA has half of the genetic markers
that it should have.

209
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:28,955
Half.

210
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:29,876
How is that possible?

211
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,158
It's not.

212
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,826
This guy should be
nothing more than a pile of goo.

213
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,628
What now?

214
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,864
Robbery, auto parts store,
Litchfield Ave.

215
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,299
Call Dig, tell him
we'll meet him there.

216
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,935
Ahh, hold-ups are a little below
your pay grade.

217
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:45,671
You sure you don't
want the SCPD to handle this one?

218
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,006
How effective have
the police been

219
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,041
at solving the city's
problems recently?

220
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:51,210
That's a good point.

221
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:16,702
John's still not
answering his phone.

222
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,070
I'll be fine.

223
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,405
Still, I don't like
you going out there

224
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,083
without back-up.

225
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,193
I'm not. I have you.

226
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,415
That restraint
showed back there?

227
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,950
Bury it.

228
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:34,053
Violence is the only thing
these losers understand.

229
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:35,988
Guys out here
can't handle that,

230
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,825
and they either wash out
or end up doing the product.

231
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,628
Both of which are fast-tracks
to a bullet in the head.

232
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,375
The product--

233
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,399
Reiter hasn't told
me a lot about it.

234
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,199
He calls it "Slam."

235
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,001
A genetically modified hybrid.

236
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,771
One part heroin poppy,
one part Coca leaf.

237
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:53,139
Gets you higher
than the Empire State.

238
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,875
Conklin! We got a problem.

239
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:58,077
Some slam's missing.
A whole cake.

240
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,913
The runner was just
a distraction.

241
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,983
Any idea who did it?

242
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,251
All right, then.

243
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,619
Round 'em up.

244
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:08,721
What are you
going to do?

245
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:11,090
I told you-- there's only one thing
these losers respond to.

246
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:26,172
Get on the ground.

247
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:28,641
Thanks for coming,
by the way.

248
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:29,942
Ms. Fayad wasn't
sure it would work,

249
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,644
but I knew you
couldn't turn down

250
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:33,612
a good old-fashioned
robbery.

251
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,493
You ready
to call this yet?

252
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,409
Now you can call it.

253
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,211
The game's
not over yet.

254
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,966
Are you all right?

255
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,902
Aside from the fact that
you won't help my friends?

256
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:26,271
I wouldn't be helping Sara.

257
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,507
As you know more than anyone.

258
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,876
What gave me away?

259
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:33,845
When I was cautioning Laurel
about the effects of the pit,

260
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,547
I saw the look on your face.

261
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:37,883
You're feeling it,
aren't you?

262
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:39,885
The blood lust.

263
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:42,387
What's
happening to me?

264
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:44,890
The Pit contains traces
of the souls of all the men

265
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:46,525
and women who have
bathed in its waters.

266
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,594
And what those waters restore,
they can also take.

267
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,263
Life for live.

268
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,198
So what
are you saying?

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,500
That you need
to feed this impulse.

270
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:57,402
Give into it.

271
00:15:57,404 --> 00:16:00,238
Once you do it,
it will subside for a time.

272
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,540
Ok.

273
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:04,776
I'll just go on
a killing spree.

274
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:07,779
Thank you
for the fatherly advice.

275
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,781
Can you just,
for a--a second,

276
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:11,483
pretend to be
a normal father?

277
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:14,019
Can you do that, Dad?

278
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:17,389
Do you have anything
remotely normal to offer me?

279
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,259
All right.

280
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:24,162
There is something
high in the mountains.

281
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:26,097
A man.

282
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:28,166
Some
call him a Sage.

283
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:31,470
He has a way with the ancient
arts of healing.

284
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:33,505
He may be able
to help you with this,

285
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:36,475
though I am not sure.

286
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:39,311
Does that qualify
as being normal?

287
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:42,113
Normal enough.

288
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:44,516
Get some rest.

289
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:46,518
We'll start at first light.

290
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,373
This hurt?

291
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:56,615
Yes, it stings.

292
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,964
Good.

293
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,165
That's what you get for trying
to take on a Meta all by yourself.

294
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:00,975
A Meta?

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,802
Yeah.

296
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,536
It turns out Central City
is missing one.

297
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,137
Jeremy Tell.

298
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,473
Cisco says we should
call him Double Down,

299
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:10,208
which doesn't
exactly make sense,

300
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,511
since he was getting a tattoo
when the dark matter wave hit.

301
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:14,079
You missed quite
a show tonight.

302
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:16,042
Sorry I couldn't help out.
It's a long story.

303
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,115
Oh, my God,

304
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:18,583
it is not a long story.

305
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,252
It is the shortest
story in history.

306
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:22,187
Two guys go
take on criminals

307
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:23,421
without asking
for back-up

308
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:25,357
and nearly get killed
in the process.

309
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,425
You know, I haven't said
anything up till now,

310
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:29,361
because I was hoping
that the two of you

311
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,963
would remove your heads
from your own asses without assistance.

312
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:32,674
Turns out I was wrong.

313
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,090
Hey!

314
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:34,901
No, no! This is the part

315
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,368
where I talk
and you two listen.

316
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,336
The both of you nearly got killed
out there tonight

317
00:17:38,338 --> 00:17:40,405
because you didn't have
each other's backs.

318
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,607
That was a one-time deal, Felicity,
it won't happen again.

319
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,309
I absolutely agree.

320
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:46,811
Because the two of you
are going to sit down here

321
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,146
until you have
resolved your issues.

322
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,948
Do we have an understanding?

323
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,316
I--

324
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,184
Do we have
an understanding?!

325
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,887
Yeah.

326
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:57,889
I'm going to take this
to a guy at Palmer Tech

327
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,491
to find out how
some lunatic Meta

328
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:01,927
turns tattoos
into lethal weapons.

329
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:04,162
If you two haven't
figured out your issues

330
00:18:04,164 --> 00:18:05,560
by the time I get back,

331
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,333
I'm going to find a bunch
of Mirakuru soldiers

332
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:09,534
to knock some sense
into you.

333
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,151
It's been
months, man.

334
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:29,988
And...I--I don't
know how many apologies.

335
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,357
John, you're
a forgiving person--

336
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,193
Oliver, this isn't
about forgiveness, man.

337
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:38,363
I don't know how to move
forward with this--

338
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:40,265
us doing what we do.

339
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,067
We've worked fine
since I got back.

340
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:43,868
We got lucky.

341
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,804
Oliver, there was a time

342
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:47,839
I would have taken
a bullet for you.

343
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,541
And I don't know
if I would do that now.

344
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,509
Which means that even
when we're out there,

345
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:53,445
we are not
out there together.

346
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,080
You crossed a line, man.

347
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:56,548
And the fact that
you could do that again

348
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,383
sits in the back
of my head somewhere.

349
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,185
I get it! I get it.

350
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:03,121
I understand that
I crossed a line.

351
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:05,123
I understand that
I lost your trust.

352
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,158
What I do not
understand

353
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,427
is why you won't
give me a chance

354
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,963
to earn it back.

355
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:22,207
You think this Meta tonight
is connected to Darhk?

356
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,342
I don't know.

357
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:27,545
Uh...He mentioned
a new player,

358
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:31,983
a woman. Uh, Fayad.

359
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,987
We need to go.

360
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:38,189
Where?

361
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:42,227
Some place where I'm going
to try to trust you again.

362
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:51,102
I like to think
of all of us as a team.

363
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:53,772
Teammates need
to trust each other.

364
00:19:53,774 --> 00:19:56,975
Right now, I'm having a little
difficulty doing that.

365
00:19:56,977 --> 00:20:00,378
Why don't one of y'all tell me
who stole the product,

366
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,614
or else this man right here
is going to eat a bullet.

367
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:06,184
Nobody?

368
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:08,887
Hmm.

369
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,089
Let's try this again.

370
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:14,559
Hey! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

371
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,462
You said the violence is the only thing
these people respond to.

372
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:20,031
Well, it doesn't
seem to be working.

373
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,534
Well, what do you have in mind?
Harsh language?

374
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:24,302
I've been on this island
three years,

375
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:25,449
learned some things.

376
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,572
About what?

377
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:29,541
Pain.

378
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:36,081
Ahem.

379
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,049
Uh-oh.

380
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,285
Um...
Uh-oh?

381
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:43,288
Those aren't the words you want to say
 when your CEO walks into a room.

382
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,024
Well, technically "uh" and "oh"
aren't words, they're interjections--

383
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,859
Please tell me these
are the prototypes

384
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,594
for our new world-changing
technology.

385
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,296
Well, since I'm inventing them,
wouldn't that make them my--

386
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,497
What is this?

387
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,999
Contact lenses
with built-in HD displays.

388
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,334
Whoo, that's impressive,
and fast.

389
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,502
How much would they
sell for?

390
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,304
Hundred thousand.

391
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,538
Hundred thousand dollars?

392
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,141
Per lens.

393
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:04,909
Hmm.

394
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,444
Everything ok?

395
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,179
Yeah, my phone
just keeps acting up.

396
00:21:08,181 --> 00:21:09,581
I'm going to restart it.

397
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,283
Ooh, what's this?

398
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:14,986
Ahh! Uh, this is
an autonomous

399
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:17,222
communications
device. Uh...

400
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:21,960
Which is great, uh,
except for the fact

401
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:24,195
that it spontaneous
explodes.

402
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:26,030
Ok, maybe
you need something

403
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:27,232
to get your mind
off all this.

404
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:28,600
I got a little
side project,

405
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:29,934
clear your head.

406
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,336
Like gambling?

407
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:33,171
I need
a full work-up.

408
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:34,405
It's possible
it's made out of some

409
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:35,940
sort of bio-organic
material.

410
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:37,142
I need to know
everything

411
00:21:37,144 --> 00:21:38,576
that you can find
out about it.

412
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:39,460
Hmm, strange.

413
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:40,009
Hmm?

414
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:41,579
These edges.

415
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:43,014
Doesn't look mass-manufactured.
Where'd you find it?

416
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:44,482
Casino.

417
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:45,950
You gamble?

418
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,452
Oh, yeah, all the time.
Poker's my jam.

419
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:48,620
It ruined an outside
flush for me.

420
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:50,922
I think my opponent
was cheating.

421
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:52,957
So you want me
to check it for evidence

422
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,392
of marking or something?

423
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:56,127
Yeah, anything strange,
out of the ordinary.

424
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,729
Like...you playing poker?

425
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,065
I will check back in
on you later.

426
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,801
Oh, and, uh, Miss Smoak,

427
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:05,069
there's no such thing
as an outside flush

428
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:06,437
in poker.

429
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:10,241
That's probably why I lost.

430
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,817
Remember in Russia,

431
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,919
two years ago when we got Lyla
out of that prison?

432
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,320
Of course.

433
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:24,823
That night, Lawton
told me that my brother

434
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,591
was not collateral
damage in a hit gone bad;

435
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:28,393
that he was the target.

436
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:31,963
And that Lawton was hired
by an organization called HIVE.

437
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:34,365
The other week,
you reacted when I said

438
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,302
that Ra's called Darhk's men
a "hive" of operatives.

439
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,337
Mm-hmm.

440
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:41,306
Could be
a coincidence.

441
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:43,675
I don't think so.

442
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:52,450
Last page.

443
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:55,887
That woman hired Lawton

444
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,622
to kill my brother,
and I'm betting

445
00:22:57,624 --> 00:22:59,958
she hired that Meta that
tried to take you out.

446
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,159
Based on what?

447
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:03,461
Her name is Mina Fayad.

448
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:07,532
Two years and you
didn't tell me.

449
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:10,268
We have more in common
than you think.

450
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,305
Oliver, that's
my first legitimate lead.

451
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:18,877
I have to find her.

452
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:21,479
Ms. Fayad hired you
for one job.

453
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,349
One. Against
my objections,

454
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:26,384
and only because
my associates are anxious

455
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:27,852
to progress
to phase three.

456
00:23:27,854 --> 00:23:29,854
We shouldn't
talk about Genesis--

457
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:32,056
Don't lecture me
about secrecy.

458
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:36,227
Particularly on the same
night that you were just compromised.

459
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:37,595
I--
In the same night

460
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:38,963
that I lost good men

461
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,398
in the name
of protecting you.

462
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,287
Damian--

463
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,144
Mr. Darhk!

464
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:48,773
I think I require
another demonstration.

465
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:54,479
What, you want me
to kill her now?

466
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:57,382
Show me.

467
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,551
Try to kill me.

468
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,221
I kill you,

469
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,522
I still get paid?

470
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:07,392
Do it.

471
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:17,149
What are you?

472
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:20,118
Ms. Fayad, many
members of HIVE,

473
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,654
they consider me to be
a charlatan.

474
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:26,325
But this,

475
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:27,759
is a parlor trick.

476
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:29,628
Sleight of hand.

477
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,304
This demonstration

478
00:24:39,306 --> 00:24:40,672
was for you, Mr. Tell.

479
00:24:40,674 --> 00:24:43,442
Just in case you have
any doubt as to how

480
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:44,910
I process disappointment.

481
00:25:18,445 --> 00:25:19,911
How do you feel?

482
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:22,581
How do I--

483
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,217
how do I feel?

484
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:29,621
Oh, my God.

485
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:32,324
There's no Sage.

486
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:34,359
There is no cure.

487
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:35,661
There never was.

488
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:37,896
I'm sorry.
You will be compelled to kill

489
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:40,899
until you've slain
the one who hurt you.

490
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,467
But I can't.

491
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,770
Ok, Ra's is already dead!

492
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:46,338
And the only way
to cope

493
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,807
is to indulge
the blood lust on others.

494
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:50,842
So you--

495
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:54,179
you just set your men up
to be slaughtered?

496
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:57,616
You will not feel
the hunger to kill again for weeks.

497
00:25:57,618 --> 00:25:59,885
No need to thank me.

498
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:03,221
There is nothing
I wouldn't do

499
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:06,391
to help my daughter.

500
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,765
I hope we learned
a lesson of the benefits

501
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:17,640
of trusting our friends
with our problems.

502
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,152
You mean like your boyfriend?

503
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,238
You're supposed to be

504
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,822
more evolved than him.

505
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:22,406
Hmm?

506
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:24,174
Sorry, but he is.

507
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:25,876
Can we find her?!

508
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,512
Nope. She's not coming up
on any of our traffic

509
00:26:28,514 --> 00:26:31,214
or security cams, but I think I have
the next best thing.

510
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,683
Her cell phone, or at least the one
that followed her through airport security

511
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:34,818
on the way to Star City.

512
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Where's her phone now?

513
00:26:36,822 --> 00:26:39,823
Redmond and Eighth.

514
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:49,633
What fancy private school
did you pick this up in?

515
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:51,568
I learned it here.

516
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,304
Three years on this island,

517
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:56,373
and I have been hurt
every way you can imagine.

518
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,776
I know what kills,
I know what cripples,

519
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,444
and what just hurts.

520
00:27:02,548 --> 00:27:04,581
Stop!

521
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:07,284
Stop! He didn't
take the drugs.

522
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:08,618
I did.

523
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,755
You're working us
too hard.

524
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,357
And some of the other
prisoners are hurt.

525
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:18,128
I wanted to give them
something for the pain.

526
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,863
And where's
the slam now?

527
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:22,666
It's all used up.
And I'm not going

528
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:24,668
to tell you by who.
So if you're going to kill me,

529
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,403
just get on with it.

530
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:28,371
Suit yourself.

531
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:31,141
Wait, wait, wait.

532
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:35,145
You've already
executed one prisoner today.

533
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,646
How's Reiter going
to feel about you

534
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,281
exterminating
his work force?

535
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,551
I think he'd make
an exception for a thief.

536
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:44,721
Well, I'd just
make her disappear.

537
00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:47,691
Take her some place.

538
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:50,093
They'll never
find the body.

539
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
All right. Take her.

540
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,702
Keep him company.

541
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,380
Wake up.

542
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:11,645
Wake up, we need to go.

543
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:12,213
What?

544
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:14,320
It was a mistake to come here.

545
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:14,852
Thea.

546
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:16,920
Stay the hell
away from me.

547
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:18,288
Thea, what's wrong?

548
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,823
He's not going to help Sara

549
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,224
and he's not going to help me!

550
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:22,034
Thea!

551
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:23,661
Don't talk to me!

552
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:24,828
I was only trying
to help you.

553
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,363
Help me?

554
00:28:26,365 --> 00:28:27,464
Yeah, that's funny

555
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:28,565
on more than
a few levels.

556
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,767
My favorite
is you are the reason

557
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:33,072
why I am like this
in the first place.

558
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:34,096
I know.

559
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:37,440
I will not kill people.

560
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:39,308
I won't!

561
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,911
Stay out of my life

562
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:44,680
and the hell away
from me!

563
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,749
We are bound
together forever.

564
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,752
You and me,
father and daughter.

565
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:52,455
Let me prove it
to you.

566
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:53,890
How?

567
00:28:53,892 --> 00:28:56,092
I am responsible
for Sara's death,

568
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:58,694
yet I have the means
to make it right,

569
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,762
or at least try to.

570
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:01,964
Do you think after

571
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,066
knowing what that Pit
has done to me,

572
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:07,103
that I would let that
happen to Sara?!

573
00:29:07,105 --> 00:29:09,338
I think if you are truly
sincere in fighting your blood lust,

574
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,074
you would offer
the same to Sara.

575
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:14,243
What are you saying?

576
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:15,845
That I am
willing to heal

577
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:16,979
my daughter's
conscience

578
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:21,384
by restoring
your sister's life.

579
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,886
That we should prepare

580
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,988
Sara's body
for the ceremony.

581
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,867
I'm still getting a ping
off Ms. Fayad's cell phone,

582
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:39,402
ten feet ahead.

583
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:47,109
John...

584
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:59,455
It was my first chance
for answers.

585
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:01,657
My last chance.

586
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:02,617
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,641
Don't be, Oliver.

588
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:07,396
This isn't your fault.
It's mine.

589
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,799
I should have trusted you.

590
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:14,637
Told you about this
forever ago.

591
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,773
If I had, she wouldn't
have gotten away from me earlier.

592
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,342
Would be alive,

593
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,143
enough now,
for some answers.

594
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:23,012
We're going
to get answers.

595
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:24,413
Oliver, I haven't been able

596
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:26,015
to get answers for more
than two years now!

597
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,918
For more than
two years...

598
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,554
You've been
doing this alone.

599
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:41,430
Frack.

600
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:43,332
You want me to take a look at
your phone for you, Miss Smoak?

601
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:45,301
I think we've reached
the point in our working relationship

602
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,036
where you can
call me Felicity.

603
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,072
Have you ever considered
how ironic your name is?

604
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:54,343
"Felicity" refers to the ability to find
appropriate expression

605
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,712
for one's thoughts,
which is not exactly

606
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:58,281
something you're
particularly good at.

607
00:30:58,283 --> 00:30:59,315
Yeah, you're right,
let's stick with Miss Smoak.

608
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,083
Any luck on our playing card?

609
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:03,419
Yeah, it's actually
right there, Felic--

610
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:04,636
uh, Miss Smoak.

611
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:05,319
Mm-hmm.

612
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,290
Uh, except it's not
a playing card at all,

613
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,791
now, in my experience,

614
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:10,660
playing cards don't
contain motor proteins,

615
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,995
proprioreceptors
and a neural net.

616
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,430
The responsible thing
to do would be able

617
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,798
to get this back
to its rightful owner.

618
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,801
Is there any way
to track him down?

619
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:20,937
Well, if you tell me the truth
about where you got it from,

620
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:22,672
that could speed
along the process.

621
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,707
I did tell you
the truth.

622
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:26,943
I did. Now,
tracking the owner?

623
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:28,945
You see this ink here,
for lack of a better word?

624
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:31,781
It's magnetite, which is the key
component to tattoo ink.

625
00:31:31,783 --> 00:31:32,685
You don't say.

626
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,084
I do. I also say

627
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,719
that magnetite happens
to guide the internal compass of birds,

628
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:38,254
specifically
homing pigeons.

629
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:40,423
So is it possible
to use the magnetite in the card

630
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:42,058
to get a location
on our, um,

631
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,192
poker player?

632
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,194
Theoretically.
Though, if your

633
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,930
hypothetical poker opponent has a deck
full of these cards,

634
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:50,399
he'll probably be able
to find you faster.

635
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:53,135
Curtis, we have to--

636
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,706
I'm going to make
you two a deal.

637
00:31:56,708 --> 00:32:00,376
First one to tell me
where you can find the Green Arrow...

638
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:01,978
Gets to live.

639
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,813
Green Arrow?
I have a better idea--

640
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,281
Run!

641
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,820
Miss Smoak, I really
need to know what's going on here!

642
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:12,722
Here!

643
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:15,124
Does the board of directors

644
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:17,860
know there's a secret
elevator in the building?

645
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:21,764
Since when are you
such a bad ass?

646
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:22,414
Since always.

647
00:32:22,438 --> 00:32:23,667
Ok, I have multiple questions.

648
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:26,102
Ok, obviously there's a very long
explanation to this.

649
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:28,137
The short version is that I work
with the Green Arrow,

650
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:31,140
this man is trying to kill me--
well, us, sorry--

651
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:33,109
and I'm taking us down to the only place
that we're going to be safe.

652
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:34,710
The lobby?

653
00:32:34,712 --> 00:32:35,845
Not exactly.

654
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:42,084
You have a hidden floor.

655
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,988
We should be safe here,
but just in case...

656
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,759
Aaah!

657
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,694
I think I know where I can find
the Green Arrow.

658
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:54,697
Which means that offer
about not killing you is off the table.

659
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,365
Stay here.
Do not move.

660
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,100
Do you even know
how to use that thing?

661
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:00,136
No.

662
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:29,265
Curtis, Curtis!

663
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,512
Felicity!

664
00:33:40,514 --> 00:33:42,214
I'm here, I'm here, ok?

665
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,682
What happened?

666
00:33:43,684 --> 00:33:46,752
Your Meta came back
to retrieve his Ace of Spades.

667
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:49,088
And you--
you fended him off?

668
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,456
Don't sound so surprised.

669
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,591
Ok, I had a little bit
of help from a co-worker,

670
00:33:52,593 --> 00:33:54,627
but to be honest, he was more freaked
out than I was.

671
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:55,995
Is he all right?
Yes, he's fine.

672
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:57,229
I sent him
to Starling General.

673
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,265
And he only knows
about my secret, not yours.

674
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,666
If he can trace
the cards back here,

675
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,034
can we use the cards
to trace back to him?

676
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:03,068
That is exactly
what Curtis,

677
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,270
my freaked-out co-coworker,

678
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:06,171
was doing when...

679
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:09,375
I got something. He's headed
for the Star City expressway,

680
00:34:09,377 --> 00:34:11,277
probably high-tailing his
way back to Central City.

681
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:13,545
Too bad he's not
going to make it.

682
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,100
I will see you all dead
before I let you do this!

683
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:36,669
Laurel, please!

684
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,337
Don't!

685
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,739
Are you sure
you want to do this?

686
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:43,275
Just keep going.

687
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:11,403
What's wrong?

688
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:13,005
I told you--

689
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:14,640
the Pit has never
been used for--

690
00:35:14,642 --> 00:35:16,241
No, wait.

691
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:18,243
Look.

692
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:33,625
Sara?

693
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:46,472
Hold her!

694
00:35:48,576 --> 00:35:51,443
Sara! Sara!

695
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:55,080
Sara, it's ok.

696
00:35:56,183 --> 00:35:58,016
You're going
to be ok.

697
00:35:58,018 --> 00:35:59,451
It's ok.

698
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,253
It's ok.

699
00:36:24,712 --> 00:36:26,779
Ahh.

700
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:31,683
Well, you guys are a special
kind of stupid.

701
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:35,187
I was going to blow town,
call it a draw.

702
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:37,389
Not until you tell us
about your employer.

703
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:46,765
Where's HIVE?
Who's behind the Ghosts?

704
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:48,167
Tell me!

705
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,935
You know what
your problem is?

706
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:54,006
You don't scare me half
as much as he does.

707
00:36:54,008 --> 00:36:55,741
Look out!

708
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:09,521
You ok?

709
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:11,223
Yeah. Kevlar held.

710
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:18,163
You took
a bullet for me.

711
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:19,531
They were...

712
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:24,069
Meta-human tattoo
playing cards.

713
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,737
Still counts,
Oliver.

714
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,240
Still counts.

715
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:39,305
To OTA.

716
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:42,554
Original Team Arrow.

717
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:45,157
Sorry, I know you hate it
when I call us that.

718
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,526
It's growing on me.

719
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:49,862
Cisco has our Meta in
lock-up at Iron Heights.

720
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:53,098
Yeah, we still can't get any Intel.
He's too afraid of Damian Darhk.

721
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,501
Well, so am I. I mean,
what are the odds that Double Down

722
00:37:55,503 --> 00:37:56,969
told Darhk about Lair 2.0?

723
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:59,939
Enough that we should
start thinking about Lair 3.0.

724
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:01,573
I've been working
on something.

725
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:02,383
Really?

726
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:03,777
Yeah.

727
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:06,979
I thought you would learn your lesson
about keeping secrets from friends.

728
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:09,048
It's not a secret.

729
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,685
It's a surprise.

730
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,853
You enjoyed that,
didn't you?

731
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:16,522
Torturing that man.

732
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,090
You don't even know
what his name is.

733
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:19,525
Walk faster.

734
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:22,161
Elias. That was
his name, Elias.

735
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,562
Faster.

736
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:25,531
I am in no rush
to get to my death.

737
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:28,167
I'm trying to put
some distance between us.

738
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:32,504
Between us and Richards?

739
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:33,939
No, between us--

740
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:36,208
Ohh!

741
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:42,548
Between us
and the landmine.

742
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,783
Listen to me--

743
00:38:44,785 --> 00:38:45,918
I am not going
to kill you,

744
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,820
but you need
to trust me,

745
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:50,222
or we're both dead.
Do you understand?

746
00:38:50,224 --> 00:38:52,224
Yes.

747
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:53,859
Ok.

748
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,034
Hey.

749
00:39:02,036 --> 00:39:03,836
You ok?

750
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,407
Oh, well, the only thing wounded
is my work space.

751
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,576
Oh, and if Mr. Dennis asks,

752
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:12,077
please just tell him
that all this happened

753
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,046
because an experiment
I was running

754
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:17,883
had an
unforeseen outcome.

755
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:19,985
Thank you for not
letting him know

756
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:21,954
that there is a secret lair
in the basement.

757
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:24,123
I'm a full service employee.

758
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:26,025
Well, you seem
pretty calm for a guy

759
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:28,494
who nearly got killed
by a meta-human.

760
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,629
Miss Smoak,

761
00:39:30,631 --> 00:39:34,666
I came to Palmer Tech so I can help
make this city a better place.

762
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:37,503
Can you even imagine
how excited I am

763
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:40,139
to know that my boss
is doing exactly that?

764
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:42,875
Well, you really
helped out, Curtis.

765
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:47,046
The Green Arrow--
we couldn't have done it without you.

766
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,888
Miss Smoak, is--
is everything ok?

767
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,023
I don't know.

768
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:04,830
It's ok.

769
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:08,000
Everything's
going to be ok.

770
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:10,903
Dad's not going
to believe it.

771
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:13,138
He's going to be so happy
when he sees you.

772
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:17,676
Laurel?

773
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,445
It's fine.

774
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,146
The same thing
happened to you

775
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:23,482
when you first came
out of the Pit.

776
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:25,017
She's just taking longer.

777
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:26,785
It's probably
because she was--

778
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:29,455
Laurel, we are
in uncharted waters here.

779
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:32,658
I suggest you prepare
yourself for the worst.

780
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,898
My liege,
something has happened.

781
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:55,214
What have you done?!

782
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:58,684
My father was not
a trusting man.

783
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:02,855
He devised a means
to destroy the Pit

784
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:04,890
should its powers fall into
the wrong hands--

785
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:07,459
like yours.

786
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:08,994
Nyssa, why would you
do something like this?

787
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:11,997
How can you even
look at your sister and ask me that?

788
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:15,901
One day, I will
have my moment,

789
00:41:15,903 --> 00:41:17,970
and I will kill you.

790
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:20,439
And now when I do,

791
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:24,243
there will be
no coming back.

792
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:26,178
Take her.

793
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,582
I warned you, Laurel.
I begged you.

794
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:33,018
What happened to Sara last year was
on Malcolm's hands,

795
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,888
but what's happening
to her now

796
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,956
is on yours.

797
00:41:54,982 --> 00:42:01,482
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

798
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,867
Greg!
Move your head.
