1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,754
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,047
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:08,639
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,145
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

5
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,601
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

6
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,732
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

7
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,939
<i>I am something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,320
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

9
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,073
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,075
Susan Williams.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

11
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,158
<i>Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue</i>

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,118
<i>of what's going on
within his own administration.</i>

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,658
You give me one month with no attacks.

14
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,952
- Let me show you what I can do.
- One month.

15
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,415
- What's this?
- My personal cell.

16
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,252
- Why would I need that?
- I think you can figure it out.

17
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,797
- What are you doing in Russia?
- I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,837
Tell me if you can get me close to him.

19
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,131
All right. But the only way will kill you.

20
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,766
<i>I have no family. I have no home.</i>

21
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,472
<i>I have no name.</i>

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,474
You got much worse coming.
He calls himself Prometheus,

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,608
and he's gonna end you.

24
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,821
You want the Green Arrow.
I can give you his name.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,402
It's Oliver Queen.

26
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,053
What's the status on Church's cell phone?

27
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,971
<i>It's holding still
at Aparo and Puckett.</i>

28
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,607
This is one well-traveled phone
considering its owner was killed

29
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,187
on the other side of town last week.

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,023
Prometheus is trying to bait me.

31
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,983
<i>Yeah. That's the general point
I was trying to convey.</i>

32
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,281
<i>And also that this is probably a trap.</i>

33
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,991
You should've let me
call in the rest of the team.

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,618
- No.
<i>- Why?</i>

35
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,366
Because it's probably a trap.

36
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,501
We've got this, Overwatch.

37
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,162
Who is this?

38
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,088
It's a lot of trouble to go to
for a prank.

39
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,934
"And so it begins"?

40
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,604
Who knew Prometheus was
a Babylon <i>5</i> fan-boy?

41
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,613
Don't judge until you've seen it.

42
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,774
- So what begins, that's the question?
- That's a good point.

43
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,820
It would seem like he's already started,
considering he's dropped two bodies.

44
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,122
I get killing Conahan, he led the ACU team

45
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,871
to help the Green Arrow
rescue the city councilmen.

46
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,291
- But why take out Church?
- According to Detective Malone

47
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,956
it's because Church got in between
Prometheus and his real target.

48
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,420
- The Green Arrow.
- Yes.

49
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,961
So Church goes after you,
Prometheus goes after Church, and shunk!

50
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,673
What? That was my
throwing star sound effect.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,093
- Why? What does yours sound like?
<i>- I just don</i> 't understand,

52
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,394
a person that leaves a trail of dead cops

53
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,147
just to kill a guy who's after you
because he wants to kill you himself.

54
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,477
<i>Well, I'll say it again.</i>

55
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,768
It's serious enough to warrant telling
the rest of the recruits.

56
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,777
Who? Curtis and three people
we barely know?

57
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,779
One of which gave up your identity
to Church,

58
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,236
who we can only pray didn't share
that information with Prometheus.

59
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,323
Well, for the record,
Rene didn't "give up" Oliver's identity.

60
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,653
Okay? He was tortured.

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,496
That's exactly
why we have to keep them out of this.

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,498
I don't wanna put the recruits
in harm's way

63
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,830
until we know exactly what it is
we're dealing with.

64
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,009
Okay, once your wire is attached... Good.

65
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,507
Now take the other one
and attach to battery

66
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,513
and the other one to the igniter.

67
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,183
I failed chemistry in high school.

68
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,516
- Twice.
- Then learn like I did, in,

69
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,522
- how you say, school of hard knock?
- I don't see the point of this.

70
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,436
I'm here in Russia
to take out Konstantin Kovar.

71
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,354
Not to learn how to make a bomb.

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,194
You must be like sponge, Oliver.

73
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,951
Making bomb, working with electronics,
welding metal.

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,454
Bratva spend off hours
learning many trade.

75
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,614
Fine.

76
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,500
Attach one into igniter,
other one to battery terminal.

77
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,660
Careful, do not touch circuit board.

78
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,374
Oops.

79
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,842
Get back!

80
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,428
<i>It's okay, Oliver.</i>

81
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,562
First time I try, I nearly lose finger.

82
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,995
What the hell was that?

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,536
Declaration of war against Bratva.

84
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>- By who?
- Your friend.</i>

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
Kovar.

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,256
I'm proud of our new zoning ordinance.

87
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,047
Along with the work
that's being done by the ACU.

88
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,931
Our citizens need to feel safe,

89
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,179
but they also need homes and jobs.

90
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,429
Thank you for joining us.

91
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,347
I, uh, overslept.

92
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,434
- What're you gonna do? Dock my pay?
- No, no, it's just...

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,728
It's not the first time
it's happened this week.

94
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,946
Is there something you wanna tell me?

95
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,778
If that's code for
"are you still drinking"

96
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,115
then my answer hasn't changed
since the last 50 times you asked me.

97
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,746
What the hell's he doing talking with her?

98
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,622
It was his idea.

99
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,118
She rakes him over the coals
about making me deputy mayor,

100
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,957
- and now he gives her an interview?
- I think we're done.

101
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,292
For all accounts, she's actually
going pretty easy on him.

102
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,793
Great.

103
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,418
- Thanks for taking the time.
- Thank you for giving me a chance

104
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,053
to explain my side of the issues.

105
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,135
Well, I said I'd give you a month
without any negative headlines.

106
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,470
Clock's ticking.

107
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,009
And it's ticking on the other thing, too.

108
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,597
Right, um, the...

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,478
Tick-tock, Mr. Mayor.

110
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,888
<i>Ready?</i>

111
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,316
You were not actually flirting
with that woman.

112
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,572
She can <i>literally</i> ruin your career.

113
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,280
I haven't done anything yet.

114
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,153
- Wow.
- I hate that he just said "yet."

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,573
Okay, come on.
There's something I wanna show you.

116
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,502
- What is this?
- This is a music and arts festival.

117
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,208
Seattle's been hosting one for decades.

118
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,171
I mean, they are great for publicity,
and tourism, tax revenue...

119
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,089
Except, revenue is what you're gonna need
to pull that off and we don't have revenue

120
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,219
- to pull that off.
- Yes, we do, because

121
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,929
the mayor's chief of staff
is a former nightclub owner.

122
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,720
And all the right people
still owe me the right favors, so...

123
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,060
I mean, I may not be able to get
all of these bands there,

124
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,269
but enough to draw a crowd.

125
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,685
Well, Speedy, this is, this is good work.

126
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,688
Well, I... I still need a venue.

127
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,357
Let's put together a list, I'll make
whatever calls you need me to make.

128
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,524
Okay.

129
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,444
Actually, I might have an "in"
at the Rockets Arena.

130
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,866
Deputy Mayor Lance.

131
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,908
Hold off on giving me keys to the city.
I just know a guy.

132
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,664
I'm just trying to do
whatever I can to help.

133
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,369
Thank you.

134
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,357
Please... Please...

135
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,776
Take whatever you want! Just don't...

136
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,489
I have two children.

137
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,191
Could we get the room for a minute?

138
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,452
Neat trick. Must come in handy when
you lock yourself out of your place.

139
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,908
I'm Adrian Chase. I'm the new D.A.

140
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,870
I thought crime scenes
were below a D.A.'s pay grade.

141
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm not that kind of D.A.

142
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,162
What's your excuse for being here?

143
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,547
Radio call mentioned the murder weapon.

144
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,338
Like Church and Lieutenant Conahan.

145
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,256
What do you have on the victim?

146
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,587
Gay Eked.

147
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,802
Divorced mother of two.
And before you ask,

148
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,683
her ex has an airtight alibi
and Mrs. Eked's criminality

149
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,970
is limited to three parking tickets.

150
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,142
What do you know that I don't?

151
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,985
The killer calls himself Prometheus.

152
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,690
And why would this Prometheus
target an average housewife?

153
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,033
Another body just dropped.

154
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,448
<i>Another throwing star murder.</i>

155
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,919
<i>Peter Meld, 38, cab driver.</i>

156
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,625
He was killed
while filling his taxi up with gas.

157
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,381
Oliver's headed to the crime scene now.

158
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,213
Okay. Any connection
between Meld and Gay Eked?

159
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,094
Just the same M.O.,
killed by a throwing star.

160
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,680
Hmm.

161
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,431
You know, Felicity, it sure would be nice
to get our hands on one.

162
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,685
Yeah.

163
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,013
What?

164
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,478
- Why're you looking at me like that?
- I'm not the one dating

165
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,735
- a detective.
- Oh. No. Well, Billy doesn't know

166
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,894
that I work with the Green Arrow.

167
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,280
I'm not crazy about overlapping
my work and personal lives.

168
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,782
And even if I was, what am I
supposed to do, steal it off his desk?

169
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,534
Felicity, you're one of the
smartest people I know.

170
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,114
I'm sure you'll think of something.

171
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,121
Four bodies so far. Let's do
whatever we can to make sure

172
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,282
- it doesn't become number five.
- Ah, that sounds like an argument

173
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,042
in favor of looping in the recruits.

174
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,454
When there's a reason to, we will.

175
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,502
This is the reason, we should do it now.

176
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,378
- What'd you find?
- Nothing but the victim's blood.

177
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,468
No fibers, no shards, no prints.

178
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,257
So how the hell
are we supposed to find this guy?

179
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,891
Apparently, we're not.

180
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,057
Oh. You do not look happy.

181
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,476
Is it because I'm not bearing Americanos?

182
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,392
- No, it's not the coffee, it's a case.
- The throwing star killings?

183
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,732
Kind of hard to miss.
Although apparently this guy didn't.

184
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,568
Oh. That was unexpectedly morbid. Coffee?

185
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,529
Which actually brings me to why I'm here,

186
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,234
not the coffee, the morbidness.

187
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,078
I was friends with one of the victims
in your case.

188
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,454
Well, more like, acquaintances.

189
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,366
You know. Friend of a friend of a friend.

190
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,037
Is this the, uh, same "friend"
whose housekeeper got their towel stolen?

191
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,331
It wasn't a towel, it was a rag, and no.

192
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,632
- Totally different friend.
- Wow.

193
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,216
Another friend involved
in a random crime in the city.

194
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,379
Ooh.

195
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,306
You must run in
a pretty rough crowd.

196
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,592
You have no idea.

197
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,102
I'd have a better one
if you'd just cut the crap

198
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,854
and tell me whatever it is
you're not telling me.

199
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,356
What? There's no deception here.

200
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,608
I actually was, kind of, sort of,
friends with a victim,

201
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,143
- Gay Eked.
- "Kind of, sort of"?

202
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,233
Pike wants us in his office.

203
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,273
- We'll talk later.
- Uh...

204
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay. So, we've got
a problem with your girlfriend.

205
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,590
- Who?
- Susan Williams.

206
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,464
<i>Detective William Malone, who is believed
to be in charge of the investigation,</i>

207
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,053
<i>- could not be reached for comment.</i>
- This is a <i>disaster.</i>

208
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,560
<i>Nor has SCPD issued a statement
on the matter.</i>

209
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,767
<i>But it is believed that this
"Throwing Star Killer" is responsible</i>

210
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,400
<i>for a total of four deaths so far,
including that of reputed crime lord</i>

211
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,936
- Tobias Church.
- "Throwing Star Killer"?

212
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,649
You have to admit it has a certain flair.

213
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,189
<i>I don't need
to be the one to tell you</i>

214
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,984
that having a city-wide panic
is, like, the worst thing

215
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,868
- that can happen before this festival.
- No, Thea.

216
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,787
You don't have to tell me that.

217
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,995
Anatoly? Why didn't you tell me

218
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,459
that Kovar was making a move
against the Bratva?

219
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:30,296
You know he's the reason
that I'm here in the first place.

220
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,428
I told you, Kovar has army.
Who did you think his enemy was?

221
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,931
You told me I could get at Kovar
by joining the Bratva.

222
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,842
It looks like
you are going to get your chance.

223
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,103
Well, <i>Pakhan</i> is going to be here
any moment. He'll explain everything.

224
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,064
Tidy yourself up, show him your respect.

225
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,221
Ah. The puppy speaks.

226
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,470
<i>The infamous Oliver Queen. What?</i>

227
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,226
Did you think that we would
not learn of your past?

228
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,556
That we would allow rich American
into this organization

229
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,231
without special circumstances?

230
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,730
- I've earned my place here.
- So I hear.

231
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,520
So why don't you tell me
what the hell is going on!

232
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,813
Oliver, respect.

233
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,608
It's okay, Anatoly. Hmm.

234
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,743
I appreciate his eagerness.

235
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,542
Kovar decided to expand his territory.

236
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,079
A casino. What happened here tonight

237
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,293
is warning for us to stay away.

238
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,877
- But we're not going to do that.
- So what are we gonna do?

239
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,091
Kovar needs money to expand.

240
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,599
Investors. Like, say a rich American.

241
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,676
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.

242
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,100
You can get meeting with his people.
When you do, you're gonna get inside

243
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,607
and you're going to blow
his new casino up.

244
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,269
And you thought making bomb
was waste of time.

245
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,233
What do you say, Oliver?

246
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,114
Ready to play
a rich American playboy again?

247
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,155
Your new girlfriend certainly knows
how to whip a city into a frenzy.

248
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,790
- Excuse me.
- Thea might've mentioned something about

249
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,043
- you dating Susan Williams.
- I'm not dating Susan Williams.

250
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,671
Did the person that you're dating
actually give you that?

251
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,081
No.

252
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,918
- I might've stolen it off his desk.
- Are you kidding...

253
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,009
I generally don't kid about something that
could get me 10 years at Iron Heights.

254
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,221
- Well, I hope it was worth it.
- Yeah, so far, not so much.

255
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,558
And here I was just so happy Curtis got
our gas chromatograph working again.

256
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,313
I'm hoping to have better luck with this.

257
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,316
I've plugged the four victims
into an algorithm that ViCAP uses

258
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,479
to track serial killers. The computer can
tease out connections between the victims

259
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,898
- that the FBI generally doesn't make.
- Well, that's smart.

260
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,817
And I cross-referenced in our own database
along with SCPD's to hopefully

261
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,701
get better results.

262
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,408
- What is that?
- News alert.

263
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,709
<i>Reports are just coming in that someone
spotted the Throwing Star Killer</i>

264
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,837
<i>at an outdoor shopping mall,
inciting widespread panic</i>

265
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,498
<i>that is threatening to spill into nearby
streets and homes.</i>

266
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,838
Well, I hope your new girlfriend
is happy with herself.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,422
Let's call the team
and have them meet me there.

268
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,258
- All of them?
- All of them.

269
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,015
They deserve to know
that this has escalated.

270
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,180
And stop calling Susan Williams
my girlfriend.

271
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,852
Yes, sir.

272
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,292
Who the hell are those guys?

273
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,953
They're just shooting into the dark.

274
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,291
<i>GREEN ARROW". It's because they're scared.</i>

275
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,377
<i>Prometheus probably
isn't even here.</i>

276
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,382
Our job here is to keep the peace.

277
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,339
Me, Spartan and Ragman
will handle the shooters.

278
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,923
Everyone else get people to safety.

279
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,054
Why's Ragman get to have all the fun?

280
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,390
Because I said so.

281
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,643
I'll never get tired of this part.

282
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,574
Oh, no! Make it stop. Please.

283
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,624
You're safe with us, okay? Come with me.

284
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,921
You saved us. Thank you.

285
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,665
It's okay.

286
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,794
That's it. Come on.

287
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,591
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

288
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,977
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Hey, man, you all right?

289
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,768
I got you. Let's get out of here.
You're safe. Come on.

290
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,564
There's no threat here. Go home.

291
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,234
He's up there! Get behind me!

292
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,410
The killer isn't here. You're safe. Go.
Move. Move. Now. Now! Go. Go!

293
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,708
Put your weapon down!

294
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,965
I've got a right to protect myself.

295
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,261
- Hey, that's my property!
- Not anymore.

296
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,223
The Throwing Star Killer isn't here.
All you are doing is causing panic.

297
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,393
Go home. Now.

298
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,017
<i>This is the SCPD.</i>

299
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,315
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

300
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,824
Well, if Prometheus wanted to
push the public into a frenzy,

301
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,117
mission accomplished.

302
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,254
Well, I'm guessing
we're not gonna like his encore either.

303
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,167
I will stop helping.

304
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,378
We need to canvass the city.
Felicity can coordinate.

305
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,669
We need to help the SCPD maintain order.

306
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,964
- Hold up a sec.
- More, like, back up. Way up.

307
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,930
Yeah, tonight's the first we're hearing
of a serial killer operating in the city.

308
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,517
He calls himself Prometheus.
He's the one who killed Tobias Church.

309
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,182
Did you know about this?

310
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,771
He knew about this.
Why didn't we know about this?

311
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,525
You know about him now.
So let's get to work.

312
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,362
These throwing star killings
are some kind of message

313
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,825
that Prometheus is sending to Oliver.
He's calling him out.

314
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,409
Sounds like, and I'm guessing,

315
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,199
you and blondie have known
about this a while.

316
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,084
- Yeah, that's not insulting at all.
- Evelyn, this isn't about feelings

317
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,456
or ego. We had to vet the situation.

318
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,047
He means the A-Team had to make
sure the B-Team was worthy enough

319
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
of being kept in the loop.

320
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,549
<i>All right,
the only team here is Team Arrow.</i>

321
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,635
I actually agree with you guys.
But the whole city is going

322
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,591
- nutso crazy right now so...
- She's right.

323
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,556
- There's plenty of time for this later.
- Except for Curtis.

324
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,187
I need your brain
on this victimology algorithm.

325
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,563
- Sir.
- Victimology algorithm.

326
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,320
This is just like Zodiac.
And I'm Jake Gyllenhaal.

327
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,073
- Wait, wouldn't you be...
- Don't take this from me.

328
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,620
Ollie, where are you?

329
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,033
This place is going through
five kinds of hell right now.

330
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,749
What do we have?

331
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,422
You guys, uh, think you wanna
clear the room for us?

332
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,585
Seriously, bro?

333
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,301
Felicity and Curtis found
something, we wanna know what it is.

334
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,886
Yeah, we're a team. Or at least we were.

335
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,178
- Fine. What do we have?
- At first, not much of anything.

336
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,474
No links between home addresses,
personal histories, favorite colors, nada.

337
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,146
So the victimology algorithm moved on
to crazy Zodiac Killer kind of stuff.

338
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,234
Such as looking for anagrams.

339
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,616
In case Prometheus was sending a message

340
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,152
in the names of the victims
he's been choosing.

341
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,821
- Is he?
- Kind of.

342
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:44,915
The first four victims, Tobias Church,
Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, Gay Eked.

343
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,045
Victims three and four
were not random.

344
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,004
We think Prometheus is using those names
as anagrams to spell out other names.

345
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,171
Adam Hunt. Ted Gaynor.
Palmer Cokes. Sachi Beech.

346
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,179
Those names supposed to
mean anything to us?

347
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,885
They do to him.

348
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,264
Care to enlighten?

349
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,225
Those names are on the list.

350
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,224
What the hell is the list?

351
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,074
Let me get this straight,
you got a "to kill" list?

352
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,039
- And I'm the out of control one?
- I haven't used that list,

353
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,292
I haven't looked at it in four years.

354
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,044
Wait. Four years, I thought
there was some other guy in the hood?

355
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,674
No, that was Oliver. "The Hood,"
"The Arrow," "Green Arrow," all him.

356
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,052
That notebook belonged to my father.
And when I was first starting out,

357
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,464
I thought that it was my way
to save the city.

358
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,804
Well, I think we now know the message
Prometheus is trying to send.

359
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,310
You do? 'Cause, I don't. Do you guys?

360
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,187
He's saying you're the serial killer.

361
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,222
Harsh.

362
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,063
- But feeling pretty accurate.
- I was trying to help this city.

363
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,899
<i>Prometheus isn't.</i>

364
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,654
You convinced me to not get revenge
on Ruvé Darhk

365
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,992
for my parents because killing would
tarnish the Black Canary's legacy.

366
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,037
How are you anything
other than a hypocrite?

367
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,792
First, it would've tarnished her legacy.

368
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,579
Second, you knew that I was a killer
when you came on board.

369
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,757
Not a serial killer.
I know some of these names.

370
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,385
You've got bankers in here.
Lawyers. A city councilman.

371
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,010
You need to anagram the names on the list
against Star City's population.

372
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,096
Because that should point us
towards Prometheus' next targets.

373
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,809
I know it's not much to look at now,
but with your investment,

374
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,444
we can make it a premier
destination in the area.

375
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:38,779
No, look, as long as you have craps
in here. Right? I am awesome at craps.

376
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,493
You gotta fill this place with girls.

377
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,701
- Tons of girls.
- I'm sure you will be very pleased.

378
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,413
All of your requests will be accommodated.

379
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,419
I'm convinced, but my associate

380
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,543
Would like to see the blueprints just
to make sure you're all buttoned up, yeah?

381
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,962
Here you are.

382
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,798
I can have copies sent to your hotel.
But first...

383
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,597
Yes.

384
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,519
- You want to see the money.
- Not to be rude, but, yes.

385
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,150
That's fine. That's fine.
Show the man the money.

386
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:24,321
This will do just fine, Mr. Queen.

387
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,580
If you don't mind my asking,

388
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,868
why you have not returned home?
Supposedly you're a big deal.

389
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:39,837
All right. We wanna set the charges
there and there.

390
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,721
For maximum damage. What?

391
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,892
You play, what's American term,
"douche" very well.

392
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,769
Let's get this over with.

393
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,732
What?

394
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,988
Quentin?

395
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,952
Are you home?

396
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,923
Quentin?

397
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,753
- What're you doing...
- God!

398
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,920
What're you doing? What are you...

399
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,213
What, are you trying
to kill me or something?

400
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,975
Where the hell have you been?
The whole city is in crisis.

401
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,682
Well, yeah, my stomach's been
on a tear since lunch. l...

402
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,724
It must have been some fish.
It was the fish. It was the damn fish.

403
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,894
Yeah. Probably didn't wash down
well with all the whiskey.

404
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,400
When did you relapse?

405
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,527
You didn't... You...

406
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,238
You've been drinking the whole time.

407
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:51,581
You lied to me.

408
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,742
Well, I'm a drunk, Thea.
That's what we do.

409
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,628
- Yeah, okay. I'm taking you to a meeting.
- Hmm.

410
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,295
You can't help a man
who doesn't wanna be helped.

411
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,796
Watch me.

412
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,932
Lam not giving up on you.

413
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,598
And I'm not letting you give up
on yourself.

414
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,305
I don't think that

415
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,065
his deputy mayor
being seen at an A.A. meeting

416
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,443
is exactly what your brother needs
right now.

417
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,317
The second "A"
stands for "anonymous," right?

418
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,361
What the hell is this thing?

419
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,121
Oh, um, thanks. What is this?

420
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,162
Regan family schnapps recipe.
It's strong and a little sweet.

421
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,291
Just like you. I thought we could use some
considering the circumstances.

422
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:45,462
- Would you care for some?
- Um, Rory, she's 17.

423
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,005
So? My dad was giving me this stuff
when I was 11.

424
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,971
And what a fine weirdo
you turned out to be. Mmm.

425
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,635
Mmm.

426
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,479
Look, if this little meeting is
because we learned Oliver's a killer,

427
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,560
I've got news for you, it's not news.

428
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,526
Look, killing Damien Darhk,
and Church's guys is one thing.

429
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,062
But having a secret kill list...

430
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,402
Yeah, that he never even told us about.
It's something completely different.

431
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,068
Well, what's not different
is him not telling us stuff.

432
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,861
Haven't you noticed when it comes to
information sharing,

433
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,488
there seems to be two different teams?

434
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,494
It's only gotten worse
since Diggle's been back.

435
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,330
Make up your mind, guys, are you pissed
because Oliver killed people

436
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,120
or that he doesn't tell us everything?

437
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,125
How about both?

438
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,041
How about I'm pissed that the guy
who only shares the important information

439
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,176
with his inner circle
used to be a serial killer?

440
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,758
Which again, he didn't tell us about.

441
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,555
Look,

442
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,099
we all want to believe
in Oliver's crusade.

443
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,643
But how are we
supposed to follow him into a battle

444
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,563
when his first instinct
is to hide the truth from us?

445
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,604
First it's "I used to be a serial killer."

446
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,523
What's tomorrow's revelation going to be?

447
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,949
I don't know how to operate
with that in the back of my mind.

448
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,040
Wow, haven't seen you do that
in quite some time.

449
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,748
I wanted
to take my mind off things.

450
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah. I don't think they make
enough tennis balls for that.

451
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,386
Where's Felicity
with the list of potential targets?

452
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,722
She's working on it. It's a big city.

453
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,885
Yeah.

454
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,475
Something tells me,
that's not the only thing weighing on you.

455
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,227
- How are the recruits?
- Taking a little time out.

456
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,814
I expected them to be upset
with me and that's fine. But...

457
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,699
John, they seemed horrified.

458
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,031
No, I wouldn't call it that.
Just a bit surprised.

459
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,491
<i>Look on the bright side,
it does show how far you've come.</i>

460
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,622
I haven't seen that guy in a long time.

461
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,663
And the way the kids reacted...

462
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,710
I think it proves how much you've changed.

463
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,292
Except I haven't.

464
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,133
I killed Damien Darhk,
and I haven't stopped since.

465
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,095
Yeah, well, don't forget
who you're talking to, man.

466
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,101
I know, first hand,
what it's like to be a murderer.

467
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,515
I know the difference
between a good kill

468
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,021
and one made out of pure rage.

469
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,564
You killed Damien Darhk, Oliver,
because you had to.

470
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,405
You took down Church's men,
because you had to.

471
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,868
The list was something different.
You were targeting lawyers, stockbrokers.

472
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,282
You were killing as a first resort,
not a last.

473
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,201
And now Prometheus is just

474
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,958
dredging all that up again.

475
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:31,343
I wanna move forward.
I'm trying to move forward. But I...

476
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,759
- I feel stuck.
- I think you're being hard on yourself.

477
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,225
Which is a bit annoying because
that's usually mine and Felicity's job.

478
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,310
But, Oliver, in that official capacity,

479
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,481
I think you are moving forward.

480
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,363
I think you're evolving.
I think you're growing.

481
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,365
What makes you so sure?

482
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,570
Because that guy with the list

483
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,823
wouldn't have even thought
to ask the question.

484
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,663
I need</i> a <i>cleanup on Aisle 12.

485
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,700
<i>And, also,
I got a list of potential victims.</i>

486
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,170
I know you're all upset with me.
So, thank you for showing up despite that.

487
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:14,212
Well, we were afraid you would kill us
if we didn't.

488
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,801
- Too soon? Okay.
- I was able to cross-reference the list

489
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:21,060
with the city census,
nailing it down to six potential targets.

490
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,515
How do we know who he'll hit?

491
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,180
We don't. In order to cover
that much ground,

492
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,644
we have to split up
and each take one potential target.

493
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,401
We run surveillance. Whoever spots
Prometheus first, call it in.

494
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,027
Then we all converge.

495
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,479
Cool.

496
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,278
- Is everything okay?
- No. It's not.

497
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,115
For a long time, I blamed you
for my parents dying.

498
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,876
That you were responsible
for leaving them to suffocate

499
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,749
in one of Damien Darhk's
testing chambers.

500
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,838
- I know.
- It took a lot

501
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,465
for me to come work with you.

502
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,375
Knowing all this,

503
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,383
it doesn't make it any easier.

504
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,556
Evelyn, are you sure
you should be out there tonight?

505
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,178
Yes, lam.

506
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,016
Because I'm doing this,
protecting people, for me.

507
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,143
Not for you.

508
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,383
- I've got eyes on Target Number Four.
<i>- Copy</i> that.

509
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,510
You know, it seems we have a minute alone,

510
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,339
- is there anything you want to talk about?
- No.

511
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,383
Are you sure? 'Cause I'm kind of an expert

512
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:45,185
when it comes to finding out
ugly things about Oliver's past.

513
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,683
Actually, I'm the...
I'm the leading expert.

514
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,063
<i>- Overwatch?</i>
- Yeah?

515
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,024
I really don't want to talk about it.

516
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,566
Oh, my God.

517
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,491
Get back!

518
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,288
- The hell?
- Get out of here! Go call 911!

519
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,873
Stay away from him!

520
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,600
- Go.
- We've got a problem.

521
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,432
Artemis seems to have
disconnected her coms.

522
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,686
<i>She in trouble?</i>

523
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,893
I don't know, but I'm worried
she wouldn't tell us if she was.

524
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,182
Do you have her 20?

525
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,317
<i>When Wild Dog was kidnapped,
I put trackers in all their suits.</i>

526
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,069
I'm sending you the information now.

527
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,149
- She's moving.
- She's on a subway that's moving.

528
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,488
Train's a few blocks from here.
I'll go check on her.

529
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,153
You tell everyone else to hold
their position.

530
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,016
Hey... Hey... Come on, man.
Come on, please!

531
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,775
- You okay?
- Yeah. What the hell was that?

532
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,531
Stop the train.

533
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,404
<i>He'!-</i>

534
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,196
- You all right?
- I wasn't going to be.

535
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,161
Prometheus?
- Gone.

536
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,746
Whatever he's planning,
it wasn't to engage me tonight.

537
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,536
Hey, we got a problem.

538
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,831
- We got a big problem.
- What?

539
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,297
I don't have time to disarm that.

540
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,557
We're getting off the train. Come on.

541
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,890
You're joking, right? 'Cause now's a
really bad time to be trying out jokes.

542
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,224
Trust me.

543
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,795
Good as new.

544
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,140
What's gonna happen to the train guy?

545
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:32,303
This morning, Mayor Queen is gonna
put him and Prometheus' five other targets

546
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,263
into witness protection
until this is over.

547
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,852
Won't Prometheus just
find another way to go after you?

548
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,016
Probably.

549
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,060
But when he does, we will deal with it.

550
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,106
And, I promise, you will find out
right when I do.

551
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,111
I was a jerk.

552
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,916
And I'm sorry.

553
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,328
No, Evelyn, I'm...

554
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,288
I'm sorry.

555
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,882
I'm sorry for your parents.

556
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,296
I'm sorry that I'm not the man
you thought I was.

557
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,800
But John reminded me, as he does,

558
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,354
that I'm trying to be that man.

559
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,476
And I might actually be getting there.

560
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,648
Slowly.

561
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,148
In the meantime,

562
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,533
I would really appreciate your patience.

563
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,360
Sounds reasonable to me.

564
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,375
When I was a boy

565
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,415
my mother told me
a story about her grandfather.

566
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,171
She said he grew a turnip so large
that he could not pull it up by himself.

567
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,055
So he asked his wife to help,
but together they could not do it.

568
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:57,016
So they asked my uncle,

569
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,022
my aunts, everybody to pitch in, but...

570
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,060
Yet they could not pull the turnip
out of the ground.

571
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,112
And so I said,

572
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,069
"Mama, Mama,

573
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,820
"did he ever pull the turnip
out of the ground?"

574
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,531
And she said, "Yes.

575
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,453
"But only...

576
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,044
"Only after they called everybody
in the village."

577
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,963
Every man, woman and child.

578
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,714
Every farmer, every Vagabond.

579
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,383
Every animal even.

580
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,513
The dogs and the cats.

581
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,014
And finally, together,

582
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,099
they wrestled it free.

583
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,398
Does your story have a point?

584
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,480
Yes.

585
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,066
That without unity

586
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,240
one cannot accomplish anything in life.

587
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,622
As I got older, I realized it also meant
something else.

588
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,992
That scum

589
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,915
will never amount to anything
without help.

590
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:09,134
That the Solntsevskaya Bratva
can pull at the turnip all they want.

591
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,136
But they will never, ever,

592
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,089
ever

593
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,967
set it free.

594
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:18,931
Oh.

595
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,643
Yes, that and, uh...

596
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,278
To become a damn farmer.

597
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,285
Hello,

598
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,292
Oliver Queen.

599
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,297
My name is Konstantin Kovar.

600
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,841
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

601
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,810
<i>Hey.</i>

602
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,311
Oh, so, to what latest crime or criminal
do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

603
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,445
I thoroughly deserve that.

604
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,278
Is there somewhere private we can go chat?

605
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,193
Step into my office.

606
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,498
Oh, yes, the interrogation room.
How appropriate.

607
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,206
Felicity, I was just giving you
a hard time.

608
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:29,373
I figure whenever you're ready to tell me
whatever's going on with you,

609
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,882
you'll tell me.

610
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,667
I'm gonna tell you now.

611
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,135
I have this friend.

612
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,758
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

613
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,726
Who I just watched for the umpteenth
time not tell the people

614
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,686
he's closest to what is going on with him.

615
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,602
I don't want to be like that.

616
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,560
I don't want you to be like that.

617
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,779
So, what is it, are you,
like, a serial killer?

618
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,531
Or something? The Throwing Star Killer?
A true crime groupie?

619
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,364
I've got a million scenarios running
through my mind. Like, you're...

620
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,615
I work for the Green Arrow.

621
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,702
That wasn't one of 'em.

622
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,122
It's why I keep odd hours and
why I disappear at random times.

623
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,710
And it's why I keep asking you
for favors,

624
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:12,874
and in case you haven't noticed,

625
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,176
it's why I stole evidence off your desk.

626
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,844
You know, I looked everywhere for that.

627
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,630
It goes without saying that me
being like a criminal

628
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,390
probably isn't good for our relationship.

629
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,552
But you're not <i>like</i> a criminal, Felicity.
You are one.

630
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,357
But it's for a good cause.

631
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,739
Seriously? Are you not, like, mad?

632
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,572
Or hurt? Or feeling a lack of trust?

633
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,031
I'd be a jerk if I did.

634
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,446
Felicity,

635
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,165
you're helping save this city.

636
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,751
Wow, that went a lot better
than I expected.

637
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,878
I just got so many questions.

638
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,291
Do you know where he lives?
Is his face all scarred or something?

639
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,551
- Is that why he wears a hood?
- Billy, Billy, Billy.

640
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,635
Shut up.

641
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,930
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,557
- Thanks for putting this together, Speedy.
- I can't take all the credit.

643
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,476
- Lance did come up with the venue.
- Shouldn't he be here?

644
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:17,610
Oh... Yeah. He came down with that flu
that everyone's been catching,

645
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,780
- so he just decided to sit this one out.
- Oh. Hey!

646
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,700
Well, if it isn't my favorite chief
of staff. How are you doing?

647
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,410
Still not interested.

648
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:33,464
Ooh. It's cool, man.
Nobody saw you get completely shot down.

649
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,216
You know, 'cause we did see you get...

650
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,753
- Everything looks really nice, Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you, Curtis.

651
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,264
Yeah, I can't remember the last time
I saw a concert. Or danced.

652
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,801
- Or smiled apparently.
- Okay.

653
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,310
Come on, Rory. Just follow our lead.

654
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,140
- Hey.
- Hi.

655
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,650
Can I talk to you privately?

656
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,861
Yeah. Give us a second please, guys.

657
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,731
- What's going on?
- You remember the throwing star

658
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,445
that I stole from my boyfriend. From...

659
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,743
My... From Malone? You remember the...
You remember this?

660
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,119
You said it didn't turn anything up.

661
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,073
- Pretty sure I used the word "yet."
- Okay. So, now?

662
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,913
The alloy is very specific,
with trace quantities

663
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,702
containing dozens of different
genetic markers.

664
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,879
And I was able to nail
the forensic evidence down

665
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,377
- to coming within the past four years.
- What're you trying to tell me?

666
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,630
This is gonna sound crazy,
but so is Prometheus.

667
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,011
I think that Prometheus has gotten
his hands on the various arrows

668
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,888
you've used over the past four years,
melted them down

669
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,549
and fashioned weapons out of them.

670
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,774
But if that's true,
that would mean that...

671
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:38,187
That would mean that Prometheus
has access to SCPD lockup.

672
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,734
Oliver, I think we have a real lead
on who Prometheus is.

673
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,282
He's a member of the SCPD.
