1
00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:03,712
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:07,146
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,390
Survive.

4
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:11,208
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,394
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:16,064
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:19,216
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:22,403
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:26,641
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,726
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,279
Hi, I'm looking for Detective Hall.
I was told he works in Vice.

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,064
Oliver?

13
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,775
McKenna Hall.

14
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:36,409
I live to surprise.

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,578
I want to find Walter.
My stepfather.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,446
I'll help you rescue
him, but that's it.

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,665
That's my offer.

18
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,600
Ok.

19
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:07,190
Jerry.

20
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:09,842
Jerry, you ok?
Yeah.

21
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:11,194
You look a little
peaked, man.

22
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,613
I'm fine. It's, uh,
Mrs. Hill wants us

23
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,114
to move the Sherwood
into the vault.

24
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,066
Now? It's mid-day.

25
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:18,901
I know. She says
it's a security threat.

26
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:21,287
It's, uh, all
the robberies lately.

27
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,072
Right, right.

28
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:46,846
Take this thing
off me, all right?

29
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:48,898
I got it
like you asked.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,066
Here.

31
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,152
Take it off me!

32
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,142
Were--were you--

33
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:01,560
were you bluffing? I mean,
would the thing have detonated?

34
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:05,114
Violently. Don't worry, though.
You did exactly as I asked,

35
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:06,866
so it's just
unconsciousness for you.

36
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,502
Unconscious?

37
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:21,380
You might want
to take it easy

38
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:22,682
if you plan on taking
someone off that list tonight.

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,183
This is me taking it easy.

40
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:28,771
So who's our
lucky guy tonight?

41
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:33,392
Ken Williams. His pyramid scheme
stole millions.

42
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:36,329
People didn't just lose their homes.
Their lives are ruined.

43
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,763
Why don't you call it
in early tonight,

44
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:39,615
I'm not expecting
much trouble.

45
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,555
Felicity!
Did you just...

46
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,224
Computer override
your lock.

47
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,976
Maybe a little.
What are you doing?

48
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,061
I pulled up some information
on Mr. Williams.

49
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,764
Did you know he's a widowed father
of a 10-year-old boy?

50
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,432
I told you.

51
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,017
I'm only in this
to help Walter.

52
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:17,270
Not to be an accessory
to orphaning little kids.

53
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:19,071
I'm just giving him a warning.
Has it ever occurred to you

54
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,190
you could do some
real good in the city?

55
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,292
Beyond just recovering
people's stock portfolios

56
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:25,317
and their saving accounts.

57
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:28,671
You're not the only

58
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:30,654
one who knows how
to reboot my system.

59
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,369
I made a mistake.
Getting in my way?

60
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,787
I don't disagree.
No.

61
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:37,924
Signing on with you.
Even provisionally.

62
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,294
Hey. Hey.

63
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:53,546
Drink.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,034
That tastes like dirt.

65
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,720
You got to stay
hydrated, ok?

66
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,638
Hydration is not my problem.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,809
My problem is getting
a bullet dug out of

68
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,753
my arm with a dull blade.

69
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,878
Let me take a look.

70
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:14,016
It's infected.

71
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:17,236
Go figure.

72
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:18,988
Yeah, uh...

73
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,824
I got to stop that
before it spreads.

74
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,895
When you swing past the
drugstore for those antibiotics,

75
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,030
you want to get me
a copy of "Maxim",

76
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:30,666
or maybe a "Sports Illustrated"?

77
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:34,036
Yao Fei had these super
herbs back in the cave

78
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:36,005
that'd heal anything.

79
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:39,876
I'm going
to go get them.

80
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:43,179
You're not going to last
an hour out there.

81
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,651
Well, I guess you
better hope I get back

82
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,277
in 45 minutes, then.

83
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:53,062

85
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:02,097
Ahh.

86
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:07,703
It is so good
to see you, Frank.

87
00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:09,939
Ohh.

88
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:11,908
It's been far too long.

89
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,611
Yes. My interests in China
have kept me away

90
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,413
more than I'd like.

91
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,749
But with The Undertaking
approaching,

92
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:22,468
I thought a return
to Starling City was in order.

93
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,886
Hmm.

94
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,621
Actually, Frank,

95
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,557
it's The Undertaking

96
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,593
that I wanted
to talk to you about.

97
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:33,813
I want to get out.

98
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:36,983
Is this because of what
happened to Walter?

99
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,401
With Walter,

100
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,570
with Robert.

101
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:44,106
Last week the Vigilante
nearly made my children orphans.

102
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,442
I've reached my limit, Frank.

103
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:50,780
That's, uh,

104
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:54,984
a lot to confide in me, Moira.

105
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:57,119
Robert did.

106
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:59,822
I know
he reached out to you;

107
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:01,974
whether I was supposed
to know it or not.

108
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:05,878
He had misgivings.

109
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,131
He sought you out because
he knew you did, too.

110
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:11,968
But then he was murdered.

111
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,504
And that should be
a cautionary tale for both of us.

112
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,607
Yes, I know. And I've
gone along with this

113
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,309
for as long
as I can stomach it.

114
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:23,846
We started this

115
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,232
to fix the Glades,
Frank.

116
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,285
To cure the city,
not lay it to waste.

117
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,803
You got into this

118
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:34,023
because of what happened
to your daughter.

119
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:38,027
Frank...

120
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,529
What would Amanda
want you to do?

121
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:54,975
Well.

122
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:56,112
Maybe we should
come back later.

123
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,245
No, maybe we should wait,
Oliver. This is really serious.

124
00:06:58,345 --> 00:06:59,992
What if her next attack
of conscience

125
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:01,219
leads her right to the police?

126
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,686
Oh, she won't
say anything.

127
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,154
I know I had to make
the same calculation

128
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,823
when you found out
about me.

129
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,558
Mm-hmm. And what would you
have done if you were wrong,

130
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,946
and I decided to make
a call to detective Lance?

131
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,582
I would have put
an arrow in you.

132
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,566
Ha!

133
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,371
Really--really--you really
would have done that, really?

134
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,006
Hmm.

135
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,540
I had a bet
going with myself

136
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,459
on how quickly
you two would visit.

137
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,877
Tell me not
to reveal your secret.

138
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,128
Looks like I won.

139
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,097
Actually, Felicity,
I was hoping

140
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,849
that I could get you
to change your mind.

141
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,801
I was worked up on
adrenaline last night,

142
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,853
and I didn't exactly put
my best foot forward.

143
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,274
I was hoping you'd
give me the opportunity

144
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:39,608
to do that now.

145
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,559
How about you start
with Ken Williams?

146
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,528
Did he also get to enjoy
your adrenaline last night?

147
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,397
No, he returned
the money that he stole

148
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,432
just in time
to put his son to bed.

149
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,934
Like I said, Felicity,
just a warning...

150
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,769
At this time,
we'd like to remind the public

151
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,738
that we are coordinating
our efforts with Interpol

152
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,607
as the Dodger operates
primarily in Europe,

153
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,410
and they have advised us
to warn the public

154
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,545
that he is to be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

155
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,280
You know, I heard about this guy.
They call him the Dodger

156
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,949
because he avoids
getting his hands dirty.

157
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:08,218
He uses hostages to do
his stealing for him.

158
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,420
How?

159
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,639
Puts a bomb collar
around their necks.

160
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,572
Last year, a guy
in Madrid didn't steal

161
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:14,625
what the Dodger told him to,

162
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,877
and it took his head off.
Literally.

163
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,296
And now the psycho's
in Starling City?

164
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,981
It's too bad his name's
not in your notebook.

165
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,966
You know, not all the people
that I target are on the list.

166
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,986
Every once in a while,
I make an exception.

167
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:29,106
A hostage-taking jewel
thief, for example.

168
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,594
How about you help us
take him down?

169
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,633
He's late.

170
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:51,058
Never.

171
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:06,423
I maintain a Swiss account
for financial transactions.

172
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:08,659
Here's the number.

173
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:10,995
Thanks.

174
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,597
I'll wire you the money.

175
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:17,150
Assuming I don't
misplace the numbers.

176
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:20,638
My bookkeeping method
is a little sloppy.

177
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,699
Really?

178
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,367
Clearly you're under
the impression

179
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,703
that you can have the
Sherwood Ruby for a steal.

180
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:30,206
Well, you're new
here in town.

181
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,910
We're not as refined
in Starling City.

182
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:35,745
I'm getting that impression.

183
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:44,587
Don't worry.

184
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,589
Your men are merely unconscious.

185
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,058
In about 17 minutes,

186
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
they'll wake up
with the ability

187
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,445
to turn every other
fence in this town.

188
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:55,899
But I'm not to be trifled with.

189
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:58,768
What about me?

190
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,121
I don't know.

191
00:10:03,108 --> 00:10:05,208
What about you, indeed.

192
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,619
So to catch this guy,
we need to either

193
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,204
figure out where he is,
or where he's going to be.

194
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,499
Is this really how you guys figure
out how to get your target?

195
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,050
Over burgers and shakes?

196
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,336
Sorry it took me so long.
I'm waiting on a bunch

197
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:19,789
of particularly
rowdy customers.

198
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,424
You need me to handle that?

199
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:24,761
I appreciate it,
but I'm a pro by now.

200
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:26,813
I'll be here if you need me.

201
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:30,133
Girlfriend?

202
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:33,186
No, it's my sister in law.

203
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:34,738
Hmm.
Sort of.

204
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,240
Carly was married
to Dig's brother.

205
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,658
And he passed away.

206
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,360
Hmm. Well,

207
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,028
looks like
she's hot for you.

208
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,247
Ah. Can we get back
to crime fighting, please?

209
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:46,032
Actually, Dig,
I was thinking,

210
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:47,367
you probably should
ask her out.

211
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,202
Really?
Mm-hmm.

212
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,870
I'll do that just five minutes
after you ask out McKenna.

213
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,156
Ooh, the detective
on the Dodger case.

214
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,675
You have a thing for her?
Yes.

215
00:10:57,378 --> 00:11:00,680
I don't see you
asking Carly out.

216
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:06,603
Felicity, this guy,

217
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,638
he's targeting a very specific
type of jewel.

218
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,657
We figure out why,

219
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:13,143
and that'll give us
the how to catch him.

220
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,510
I have an idea.
Mm-hmm?

221
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:17,147
Your crush object with a badge

222
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,948
said they were
working with Interpol.

223
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,737
Yeah.

224
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,185
Why don't I work
a couple of little tech,

225
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,286
you distract her
with a little flirty flirt,

226
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,121
slip said tech onto her phone.

227
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:26,523
It'll turn into
a micro transmitter,

228
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,858
and boom, we'll learn
everything she knows.

229
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,627
Hmm.

230
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,629
It's not how I typically get
my information.

231
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,330
How do you typically do it?

232
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:35,882
I find the person.

233
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:38,051
And then I put the fear of God
into them until they talk.

234
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:40,837
But we can try your way.

235
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,539
You know, Carly,
I don't want this to, um,

236
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,375
you know, to come off
weird or anything,

237
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:48,878
it's just...

238
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,566
Would you like
to have dinner?

239
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,351
How about tonight?

240
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:56,886
Tonight?
What...

241
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:59,189
We haven't waited long enough?

242
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:06,229
Mmm.

243
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:09,398
Who knew street meat
could taste so good?

244
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,285
I had a feeling you needed
a break from the office.

245
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,537
Hank was
my first client.

246
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,405
I kept his son
from being sent away

247
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,091
for a mugging
that he didn't commit.

248
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:21,211
And how did that not
score you free hot dogs for life?

249
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,848
CNRI gives low income people access
to the legal system.

250
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,184
Without them, his son could have
gone to prison forever.

251
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,053
I could have gone
to prison, too.

252
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:34,257
He couldn't afford a dream team
of super lawyers.

253
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,359
So I'm supposed to feel guilty

254
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,862
because I'm lucky enough
to have a rich family?

255
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,197
No. You are lucky.

256
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:44,200
And hopefully CNRI
will show you that.

257
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,768
Hey!

258
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,745
Give us the purse,

259
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:59,249
and we won't press any charges.

260
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:11,311
Yeah, you're right.

261
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:14,597
I really do feel lucky.

262
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:18,134
This got snagged
as he bolted over the fence.

263
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:20,270
Looks like a chain
from his wallet.

264
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:33,533
I thought you gave up crime fighting.
What?

265
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:36,286
Well, the business
with your sister. I figured...

266
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,788
Ohh.
You'd stay out of police precincts.

267
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:42,792
Yeah, I...I saw you
on the news

268
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:44,627
and I realized that
I never thanked you

269
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,996
for everything
that you did, so.

270
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:49,599
Thank you.

271
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,334
So you got promoted.

272
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,169
Major Crimes.
Wow.

273
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,754
And they assigned me
to the Dodger case.

274
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:57,473
He extorts people
into stealing for him.

275
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,143
How's that going?

276
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,694
Slow.

277
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,693
Well...

278
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:20,529
It was nice
seeing you

279
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:23,366
the last time
that I saw you.

280
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,051
Yeah. It's good
seeing you, too.

281
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,053
It was like old times.

282
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:29,205
Except the PG version.

283
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:31,474
How do you mean?

284
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:33,927
Well, you and I always knew
how to have a fun time.

285
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,179
Something that's been
missing from my life lately.

286
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,814
So how about a drink?

287
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,549
Not now.

288
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:42,435
Would you maybe--
I'll take you for a--

289
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,553
would you like to have dinner
with me, McKenna?

290
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:46,222
I don't know
if you heard,

291
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:47,825
I was on a deserted
island for five years

292
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,359
and I am totally out of practice
with this whole...

293
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:53,112
Hmm. Well--well,
dinner would be nice.

294
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:58,001
In fact, I can make
myself free tonight.

295
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,287
Yeah.
Great.

296
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,839
So I'll grab you
at eight?

297
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,074
That's perfect.

298
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:07,010
All right.
Ok.

299
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,846
I'm lingering. I'm going to go.
Ok.

300
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,701
Who's there?!

301
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,607
Help me.

302
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:52,554
Lance.

303
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:54,789
Sergeant,
it's Detective Hall.

304
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,508
I have an update
on the Dodger case.

305
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,096
A body was found in an
art gallery shot point blank.

306
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,629
There were
three other men there,

307
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:02,481
all rendered unconscious
by a highly focused

308
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:03,539
electric current to the heart.

309
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,096
Same M.O. as that
guard at the museum.

310
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:06,815
Got an ID on the vic?

311
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:08,966
His name is Cass Derenick.

312
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,051
Pause.

313
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,969
Who's Cass Derenick?

314
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,838
Arrest, possession
of stolen goods.

315
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,590
Arrest, conspiracy.

316
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,843
Conviction, attempted
sale of stolen goods.

317
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,394
This guy's a fence.

318
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,680
The Dodger's looking to unload
the Sherwood Ruby.

319
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,182
Which means he'll be
in the market for a new fence.

320
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,602
One he hasn't,
you know...killed.

321
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:33,222
So we find the fence
and we find the Dodger.

322
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,191
Anyway, I saw online
that you sell

323
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,494
a chain wallet with
an eight ball on the chain.

324
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,563
I was wondering
if you could give me

325
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:44,034
a name of one of your customers
if I gave you a description?

326
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,120
Yeah, sure, you can
call be back.

327
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,173
Like every other used clothing
and leather good store

328
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,208
I've called today.

329
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,744
What was that about?

330
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,546
What's up with the fancy fancy?

331
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,966
What? Oh, um,
I have a date.

332
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,752
Contrary to popular opinion,
I do have a life.

333
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:06,623
Then why do you seem
so nervous?

334
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,857
Is it obvious?

335
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,226
Just be your charming
and brooding self.

336
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:11,961
I mean, the girls
seem to dig that.

337
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:14,614
This girl is different.

338
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,101
She knew me before the island,
before I was...

339
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,404
That's CNRI.
I've got to take this.

340
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:24,791
I'm working on a very important
purse snatching case.

341
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,609
Yeah.

342
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,578
Hello?

343
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,213
Yes, I called you this morning.

344
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,049
Yeah, he might have been
wearing a red hoodie.

345
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,602
Kind of Abercrombie-looking.

346
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,754
His face, not the hoodie.

347
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,789
Really?

348
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,058
You wouldn't happen
to have his name?

349
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:46,813
Thank you so much.

350
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:53,636
Hey, Laurel.

351
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:57,140
Does your dad still
like arrest people?

352
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,992
I found the dirt bag.

353
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,112
His name is Roy Harper.

354
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,664
I can't remember
the last time I was here.

355
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,200
It's so beautiful.

356
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:11,955
Yeah, this was the place
to take a girl in high school.

357
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,592
Hmm, I was never
lucky enough to experience that.

358
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,762
I had braces and terrible bangs
back then.

359
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,382
I'm sure you looked amazing.

360
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,001
I'm glad we finally
got around to doing this.

361
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,020
Me, too.

362
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:31,224
You know, Andy set
a pretty high bar

363
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,393
when it came to first dates.
Hmm.

364
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,729
You know, he'd face down
armed gunmen for a living

365
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,254
but I've never seen him
as scared as he was before

366
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,279
that first date with you.

367
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,621
Ohh, Carly, I'm sorry.

368
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,207
That wasn't good
first date etiquette, was it?

369
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:50,043
Bring up Andy when we are having
a romantic night?

370
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,544
Probably not.

371
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,697
Look, Carly, this is
difficult and complicated.

372
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,300
It's not like there's
a manual, you know?

373
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,918
You know...

374
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,904
For a moment,
I--I felt like

375
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,705
a girl who likes a boy,

376
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,874
and nothing else
mattered.

377
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:08,377
But if this is
too hard for you,

378
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,597
or too complicated,

379
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,182
then please,
just get out now,

380
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,850
because I've already
been hurt too much.

381
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,185
Carly, listen, I'm sorry--

382
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,569
Can you just please
take me home?

383
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,329
Mmm.

384
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,997
No, no, no, no,
it is not possible

385
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,116
for something
to be this good!

386
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,035
Right?
Ohh!

387
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,540
So you must have
missed soufflés.

388
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,742
What do you mean?
Five years on an island,

389
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:42,011
away from civilization.
Ah, what did you do?

390
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,714
What did you eat?
Where'd you sleep?

391
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,750
How did you make it?
McKenna...

392
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,769
Sorry.

393
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,472
Didn't mean to drill you.
It's ok.

394
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,973
It's just I haven't
had a conversation

395
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,259
with a guy in a while
without it resulting

396
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,761
in me reading him
his rights.

397
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,147
So. Yeah,
but those years,

398
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:04,100
they must have
changed you.

399
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:10,773
From a guy I used
to party with to who you are now.

400
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:13,243
Yeah.

401
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,411
Because I had to make
some tough choices.

402
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,382
You're right.

403
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,718
It changed me.

404
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
What kind of
tough choices--

405
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,640
I don't want to talk about
those experiences, McKenna.

406
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:35,315
Saved by the cell.

407
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,934
Hall.

408
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,353
Ok, put what the C.I. told you in
the warrant application.

409
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:44,157
I'll be right there.
It's work, I got to go.

410
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:59,455
Felicity, listen, please.

411
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,124
I need you to activate
the bug in McKenna's phone.

412
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,993
I think the police
just got a lead on the Dodger.

413
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,495
Ok.

414
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,216
Who are you?

415
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:13,720
My name is Alan Durand.
I'm an exchange student.

416
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:16,039
I was on a fishing
excursion with my class.

417
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,810
We got lost and our boat
caught fire.

418
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,146
It was some mechanic malfunction.
We had to jump ship.

419
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,847
When?

420
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:26,849
Two days ago.

421
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,852
It was awful.

422
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:34,157
I thought I was
going to die.

423
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,993
Where are the other students?

424
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,879
Where's the boats crew, huh?

425
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:45,201
I think I'm the only one
who made it.

426
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,303
I managed
to get to shore.

427
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:49,205
I thought I was
lucky, but...

428
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:53,376
What? Somebody found you?
Soldiers, or...

429
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,378
Yes!

430
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,681
Yes.

431
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:01,184
They had these masks on

432
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,186
and they attacked me
and beat me.

433
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,405
They left me here!

434
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,908
Who are they?!

435
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:14,580
You can untie me
at any point, by the way.

436
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:23,572
Nice place
you have here.

437
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:26,042
Oh, thank you.
Tell me.

438
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,244
Does every fence
in this town hire muscle?

439
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,913
I did
as soon as I heard

440
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,765
about what you did
to Cass Derenick.

441
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,417
Oh, yes, Cass.

442
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,970
God rest his soul.

443
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:39,055
He wasn't
a very nice man.

444
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,641
He tried to steal from me.
Oh.

445
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:44,760
I've heard that you have a better
sense of judgment.

446
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:48,097
And that you have no
trouble in moving this.

447
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,566
Well, it's only a recession

448
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:53,736
for some people.

449
00:22:56,465 --> 00:23:00,645
I take a 15% commission
off the top.

450
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:03,363
Let's call it
at 12, shall we?

451
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:04,965
Obviously I don't
have to remind you

452
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:05,802
about what what happened
to the last person

453
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,667
who tried
to screw me over.

454
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:10,603
SCPD! Grab the floor!

455
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:49,760
Come quietly!

456
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,178
I'm afraid
I'll have to decline.

457
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,214
Then I'm afraid
you won't be going to jail.

458
00:24:30,193 --> 00:24:34,396
I heard on the news
the Dodger got away.

459
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:36,479
Hopefully the night
wasn't a complete waste.

460
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,647
Your dates.
How'd they go?

461
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,565
Great.
Awesome.

462
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,200
You two suck
at lying.

463
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:44,035
The police and I busted it up

464
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:45,603
before the Dodger
could get himself paid.

465
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,038
Don't change
the subject.

466
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,742
Is your hacker chip
still working?

467
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:53,778
You two
are no fun.

468
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,946
Yeah.

469
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,498
Still getting
a strong signal.

470
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,383
You should pull up
the police records.

471
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:00,919
Everything the Dodger's
stolen so far.

472
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:03,171
What are you thinking?
We know the Dodger has a taste

473
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:07,642
for a very specific
type of antiquity.

474
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:09,428
Yeah.

475
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,263
These all look like
they're from the ominous decade.

476
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:14,316
The last ten years
of King Ferdinand's reign.

477
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:16,134
And she says
we have no lives.

478
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:17,769
Are there any other
places that sell

479
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,638
or display items
from the ominous thing?

480
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,074
Decade.
Not really.

481
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:24,609
I guess people
in Starling City

482
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,111
prefer the Elizabethan era.

483
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:27,362
The Starling City
Cancer Society.

484
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,646
It says right there
they're holding

485
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:30,449
a fundraising auction
tomorrow night.

486
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:33,001
We could lure him
out into the open.

487
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:35,120
With what? A fake?

488
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:38,006
No. The Dodger clearly has a
trained eye for this sort of thing.

489
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:40,892
He's not going to fall for anything
less than the genuine article.

490
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:42,364
Where are we

491
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,347
going to get our hands
on a rare Spanish antiquity?

492
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:47,833
You really have no idea how rich
his family is, do you?

493
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:59,844
Roy William Harper Jr.

494
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:04,547
Where's senior?

495
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,715
Norris cemetery.

496
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:13,688
Sorry to hear that.

497
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,573
You and an army of bookies.

498
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,058
Can I go?

499
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,726
No. You've been
IDed as a suspect

500
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:20,328
in a purse snatching.

501
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,381
It's quite a résume
you've compiled here.

502
00:26:23,383 --> 00:26:25,733
Petty theft, B&E,
robbery,

503
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:27,285
petty theft.

504
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,354
Stolen car. Well, it's nice
to change things up

505
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:31,072
once in a while.
And petty theft.

506
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:32,874
You got something
against banks?

507
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,959
Well, it is hard to run with one
under your arm.

508
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:38,196
Well, maybe you'll learn a few
new skills in prison.

509
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:40,748
Look, I don't want to steal.

510
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,268
Ok? I don't have
any other choice.

511
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,221
My mother, she...

512
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:48,106
She has a problem.

513
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,924
Yeah, her son's a moron.

514
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:52,527
No.

515
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,913
Vertigo.

516
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,969
She got hooked
on Vertigo last year.

517
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,404
She kicked it,

518
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:06,474
but I guess
she'd done enough that...

519
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,746
It messed her up.

520
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:12,914
Hmm.

521
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:14,916
She hasn't been the same,

522
00:27:14,918 --> 00:27:16,835
and her medical bills--

523
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:20,922
look, I'm...I'm just trying
to help her get out from under.

524
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:26,294
Look, we're not privileged enough
to have as much as other people.

525
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,628
Ok?

526
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,597
Fine.

527
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,533
Let him go.

528
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:35,103
It's just a damn
purse, right?

529
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:45,280
They'll meet with you.

530
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:47,449
It has been arranged.

531
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:51,536
Thank you for this.

532
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:53,423
There's one more thing
I need you to do for me.

533
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:55,015
Malcolm's the only one
who knows where

534
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Walter's being kept.

535
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:01,012
I just...I just need a clue.

536
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,665
Some lead to follow.

537
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,384
If our plan works,

538
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:10,438
I can't let it damn
Walter to hell.

539
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,608
No.

540
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,279
That's the fate that's in store
for us, I'm afraid.

541
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:52,647
The police
are here, too.

542
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,715
Your bait's attracted them,
at least.

543
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:57,685
That's not exactly
who I'm looking to catch.

544
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:09,730
So I'm getting a good
signal from the GPS

545
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:11,449
I put in
your family's broach.

546
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:13,001
I can track it on my phone.

547
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:14,786
Speaking of,
have you given any thought

548
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:17,071
to what might happen
if this doesn't work

549
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:20,542
and the Dodger absconds
with your family jewels?

550
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,012
I'm sorry, that
came out very wrong.

551
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,748
Let's just keep our eyes
open, Felicity.

552
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,587
Hey, isn't that...

553
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:35,690
You can just follow him
over there, ok?

554
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:40,278
Mm-hmm. I would rather take my
chances with a deadly jewel thief.

555
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,063
Right.

556
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,381
Hey!

557
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,500
That broach was donated
by the Queen family.

558
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:05,119
If you want it,
you're going to have to bid.

559
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:06,337
Actually, love,

560
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:08,923
I thought
I'd just take it.

561
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:15,513
Maybe I should
check out front,

562
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,432
see if the security
guards had any problems.

563
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:19,984
That's a good idea. I'm going
to go check on the bait.

564
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:24,547
I think I have a problem.

565
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,664
Get away from me!
If this thing blows...

566
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,615
Not going to happen.

567
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,890
The Dodger said if I called
the police, he'd--

568
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:39,310
I'm going to get decapitated,
aren't I?

569
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:40,131
The tracker's on the move.

570
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:42,170
If I find him, I can
get him to disarm it.

571
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,382
Talk me in. Stay calm.

572
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:47,551
Too late.

573
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,655
Go. Just go. Go, go, go.

574
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:57,528
Talk to me, Felicity!

575
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,029
Ahem.

576
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:01,415
Heading towards
Adams and O'Neil.

577
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:03,784
At the clip he's going,
he's got to be in a vehicle.

578
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:06,871
Hey. I need
your bike.

579
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:09,340
Are you kidding me?
No.

580
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,946
I'm mobile.
Where is he?

581
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:31,997
Talk to me, Felicity.

582
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,176
Come on.

583
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:35,634
First time anyone's ever been
grateful for traffic cameras.

584
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:38,268
He's one block
from your position.

585
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,790
If you cut through Harris Plaza,
you'll end up right behind him.

586
00:31:52,547 --> 00:31:54,047
Where is he now?

587
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:55,599
Got it.
I got him, I got him.

588
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,218
Gray sedan driving north.
At the light ahead of you.

589
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,058
Ok, hard right.

590
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,994
Hey!

591
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:17,796
Don't do anything stupid.

592
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:19,622
I had the foresight
to collar up

593
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,007
a particularly
inquisitive blonde.

594
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:23,792
I assume she's
a friend of yours.

595
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,544
Touch one hair on my head
and she loses hers.

596
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,997
You've got quite
the choice to make, don't you?

597
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:31,966
Not this time.

598
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,185
Your median artery's
been severed.

599
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:36,721
You couldn't push
that button if you tried.

600
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,898
Oh, thank God.

601
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,283
Why are you doing this?

602
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:50,485
I'm exactly like you.

603
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,020
I only steal
from the rich.

604
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,401
I'm not Robin Hood.

605
00:34:04,403 --> 00:34:06,123
I don't know when
these men are coming back!

606
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,355
You have to believe me.

607
00:34:07,356 --> 00:34:09,439
Untie me, please!

608
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:16,913
What, do you think
these men,

609
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:21,001
they planted me here,
some kind of trap or something?

610
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:24,588
I...Well, why'd they
tie you up like that

611
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,922
and then just leave you?

612
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,624
Huh? Why not just kill you?

613
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,092
They were going to!
They got called away

614
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,794
at some--some altercation

615
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:33,096
somewhere else
on the island.

616
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,632
If they come back,
they will kill both of us.

617
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:37,167
Please! You have
to believe me.

618
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:38,301
Please.

619
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,886
All right, turn--

620
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:42,723
all right, turn around.

621
00:34:42,725 --> 00:34:45,942
Thank you.

622
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:50,680
Thank you.

623
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:09,521
I'm sorry...

624
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:11,566
But I can't.

625
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,018
What? Why?!

626
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,787
Why not?

627
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:22,795
Because I don't know you.

628
00:35:22,797 --> 00:35:25,030
Are you out
of your mind?!

629
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:26,698
Please!

630
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,084
You can't do this!
You can't just leave me here!

631
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,551
You know, last night
all I could think about

632
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,419
was how pissed off
Andy will be;

633
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:43,639
how hurt he'll be
if he saw us together.

634
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:48,361
But that's nothing
compared to how he'd be

635
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:51,230
if I did something
to hurt you, Carly.

636
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,600
Believe me when I tell you
that war is easier than dating.

637
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:57,587
In a war, you act

638
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,905
or you die.

639
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,376
No time to think, no time
to second guess yourself.

640
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:06,162
Maybe that's
your problem.

641
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,663
With me,
you're thinking.

642
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,249
Not feeling.

643
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:14,920
You're right.

644
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,421
How did you know
where I live?

645
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,806
A little thing
called the Internet.

646
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,660
Look, could we not
do this with a door between us?

647
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,772
So I guess you're not
pressing charges

648
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:10,175
'cause you feel like--
you feel like you can change my life?

649
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:12,061
And so you can run and tell your rich
prep school friends

650
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,897
what a Saint you are and how
you're helping the disadvantaged?

651
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,034
You don't know
a thing about me.

652
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:21,454
Thea Queen.
Trust fund brat.

653
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,156
Totaled her car, which she got
as a birthday present.

654
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,325
Loves designer labels

655
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,327
and is usually in the tabloids
for partying too much.

656
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,946
Did I--did I leave
anything out?

657
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,748
Yeah.

658
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,634
Dead father,
missing step dad,

659
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:37,303
damaged brother,

660
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:40,222
and almost served
jail time for that car accident.

661
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:45,227
Plus, she really
wants her purse back.

662
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,731
You know, you showed some
real sack coming down here,

663
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,050
the Glades in the middle
of the night.

664
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:54,519
You must not know the value
of a vintage purse.

665
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:14,801
Don't worry,
it's all there.

666
00:38:14,802 --> 00:38:17,002
Except for these. Ahh.

667
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:19,338
You know, it's a really
filthy habit you got there.

668
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,258
Yeah, tell me about it.

669
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,760
Hey, can I give you
some advice?

670
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:28,514
First, stay out
of the Glades.

671
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:30,182
And second?

672
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,958
Don't fall
for every sob story

673
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,428
a guy like me
tells the police.

674
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:39,848
You have
a great evening now.

675
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:00,702
Do you ever take time off?

676
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:03,488
I do.

677
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,458
In fact, last night
I went on a date.

678
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,878
The guy was
kind of a jerk.

679
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,830
Really?

680
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:14,115
He might have
had a reason.

681
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:19,721
McKenna,
I didn't just lose

682
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:22,174
five years
on the island.

683
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:25,627
I lost the part of
me that enjoyed...

684
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,181
Being alive.

685
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:32,684
Listening to music
and, uh...

686
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:37,906
eating a soufflé
with a beautiful girl.

687
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,192
It's the easy things.

688
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:43,245
But when you asked me
about the island,

689
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,581
it reminded me
of all the hard things

690
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,918
and the choices that
I have to make that

691
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,037
still stay with me.

692
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,340
Made me question
how I can trust,

693
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,376
and even
if I'm worthy of...

694
00:39:57,378 --> 00:39:59,211
being with anyone.

695
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,946
You are.

696
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,481
Mmm. Hmm.

697
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,982
Can I take you
to a dinner?

698
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:23,368
That I promise not
to cut short.

699
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,186
Um...

700
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:26,822
Throw in a soufflé
and you're on.

701
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,324
McKenna!

702
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,126
Glad you're still here.

703
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,079
Queen.
Mr. Lance.

704
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,964
Actually, I was just leaving.
Is everything ok, sir?

705
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,216
Yeah. I'd like you
to, uh,

706
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:40,001
work with me on
the Vigilante investigation.

707
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,636
Thank you, sir.

708
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:44,038
Well, don't worry,
we'll bring him in.

709
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,259
Oh, yeah.

710
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:51,680
Ah. Ready to go?

711
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,214
Yep.

712
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,016
Ok.

713
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:02,724
Ahh. It tastes like an ashtray.

714
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,944
But it does the job.

715
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:09,831
I owe you one.

716
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:16,070
You didn't get into
any trouble out there, did you?

717
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:18,623
Hmm?

718
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:23,628
No. Not a bit.

719
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:30,102
Frank Chan recommended you.

720
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:32,804
He said you could
help us with our problem.

721
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,026
He appreciates you
agreeing to meet with me.

722
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:42,032
Anything for a friend.

723
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,500
So...

724
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,684
How can we be of assistance?

725
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:49,920
Malcolm Merlyn.

726
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,941
I want you to kill him
for me.

727
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:58,125
